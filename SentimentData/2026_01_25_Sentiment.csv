For the first time, industry titans including Tesla’s Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella shared stages and exchanged verbal blows, revealing deep fractures in the AI industry’s united front. This unprecedented convergence marked a pivotal moment where visionary optimism collided with pragmatic concerns about sustainability, ethics, and potential market bubbles. AI Davos 2025: The Transformation of Global Discourse The visual landscape of Davos underwent dramatic changes this year. Major technology corporations commandeered prime real estate along the main promenade, with Meta, Salesforce, and Tata establishing prominent physical presences that overshadowed traditional diplomatic displays. The United States House, jointly sponsored by consulting giant McKinsey and Microsoft, stood as the largest installation, symbolizing the corporate takeover of geopolitical discourse. Meanwhile, critical global issues including climate change and poverty struggled to attract comparable attention, highlighting the forum’s shifting priorities toward technological determinism. This physical transformation reflected a broader conceptual shift: artificial intelligence moved from peripheral discussion to central agenda item, dominating conversations across public panels and private meetings. The Executive Showdown: Visionaries Versus Realists Observers noted unprecedented tension among technology leaders who typically maintain diplomatic public personas. The Davos stage became an arena for subtle—and sometimes overt—competition. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei delivered particularly striking criticism of Nvidia, despite his company’s reliance on their GPU technology. He challenged recent U.S. administration decisions allowing advanced chip exports to China, employing vivid metaphors that captured media attention. “An AI data center represents a country full of geniuses,” Amodei declared, questioning the strategic wisdom of transferring such computational power abroad. This rhetorical flourish exemplified the heightened stakes of AI development, framing technological infrastructure in national security terms. Language and Metaphor: Decoding Executive Rhetoric CEOs employed distinctive terminology that revealed their strategic positioning. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella repeatedly referred to data centers as “token factories,” abstracting complex infrastructure into production terminology that emphasized output and scalability. Jensen Huang framed AI investment primarily through job creation narratives, avoiding discussions about potential slowdowns in infrastructure development. Elon Musk’s presence itself generated significant attention, marking a departure from his previous avoidance of the forum. While his contributions contained less substantive policy discussion than peers, his participation signaled AI’s ascendance as the defining technological narrative of our era. These linguistic choices served as strategic positioning, with each executive advancing frameworks that benefited their corporate interests. The Bubble Question: Growth Versus Sustainability Beneath the optimistic projections lay persistent concerns about artificial intelligence’s economic sustainability. Multiple executives acknowledged the potential for market overextension, though they proposed divergent solutions. Satya Nadella emphasized the necessity of broader adoption, suggesting that limited usage could precipitate a market correction. He advocated for equitable global distribution of AI capabilities, positioning Microsoft as an inclusive infrastructure provider. Conversely, Jensen Huang called for increased investment, arguing that current funding levels insufficiently supported necessary innovation. This tension between expansion and consolidation revealed fundamental disagreements about AI’s developmental trajectory. Industry analysts observed that executives balanced promotional messaging with cautious realism, attempting to sustain investment enthusiasm while acknowledging practical constraints. Key AI Executive Positions at Davos 2025 Executive Company Primary Focus Notable Statement Satya Nadella Microsoft Broad adoption & equity “Token factories” need widespread usage Jensen Huang Nvidia Investment & job creation Current investment levels insufficient Dario Amodei Anthropic Geopolitical implications AI data centers as “countries of geniuses” Elon Musk Tesla/X Platform participation Previously avoided, now engaged Geopolitical Dimensions: Technology as Power The Davos discussions consistently transcended pure technology, intersecting with international relations and trade policy. Amodei’s criticism of chip exports to China exemplified this convergence, framing computational hardware as strategic assets with national security implications. This perspective gained traction among policymakers attending the forum, who increasingly view AI development through competitive geopolitical lenses. The technology’s dual-use potential—for both economic advancement and strategic advantage—complicates traditional trade relationships and export controls. These discussions occurred against a backdrop of ongoing U.S.-China technological competition, with AI representing the latest frontier in great power rivalry. European leaders expressed particular concern about dependency on American and Chinese AI ecosystems, proposing regulatory frameworks and investment strategies to ensure regional competitiveness. The Talent Wars: Human Capital in AI Development Beyond hardware and investment, executives addressed the critical human dimension of AI advancement. The competition for specialized talent emerged as a recurring subtext throughout discussions. Companies balance aggressive recruitment against financial sustainability, creating tension between expansion and profitability. This talent competition explains some public disagreements, as executives position their organizations as optimal environments for groundbreaking research. The concentration of expertise in few corporations and regions raises concerns about equitable knowledge distribution and innovation diversity. Several executives proposed educational initiatives and international collaboration frameworks to address talent shortages, though concrete commitments remained limited. Visual and Structural Changes: Corporate Dominance The physical environment of Davos 2025 provided tangible evidence of technology’s rising influence. Traditional national pavilions shared space with elaborate corporate installations featuring interactive demonstrations and networking spaces. This shift generated debate about the World Economic Forum’s evolving identity—whether it primarily serves as a platform for multilateral diplomacy or corporate engagement. The prominent technology presence attracted different participant demographics than previous years, with increased attendance from venture capitalists, startup founders, and technical specialists. This changing composition influenced discussion topics and networking dynamics, further emphasizing technology’s centrality to contemporary global challenges. Conclusion The AI Davos 2025 discussions revealed an industry at a critical inflection point, where unprecedented technological promise confronts practical limitations and internal divisions. The simultaneous presence of competing CEOs created unique transparency about strategic disagreements that typically remain behind corporate walls. While executives universally acknowledged artificial intelligence’s transformative potential, they diverged significantly on implementation pathways, ethical frameworks, and economic sustainability. These debates extend beyond corporate boardrooms, influencing policy decisions, investment patterns, and international relations. As artificial intelligence continues its rapid advancement, the tensions exposed at Davos will likely intensify, requiring more sophisticated frameworks for balancing innovation with responsibility, competition with collaboration, and ambition with realism. FAQs Q1: Why was Davos 2025 particularly significant for AI discussions? The 2025 forum marked unprecedented convergence of major tech CEOs including Musk, Huang, Amodei, and Nadella, who publicly debated AI’s future while revealing strategic tensions typically kept private. Q2: What were the main points of disagreement among tech executives? Key disagreements involved AI’s economic sustainability, appropriate investment levels, geopolitical implications of technology transfer, and whether to prioritize broad adoption versus concentrated advancement. Q3: How did the physical environment of Davos change in 2025? Technology corporations dominated the main promenade with elaborate installations, while traditional diplomatic displays received less prominence, visually representing tech’s rising influence in global discourse. Q4: What geopolitical concerns emerged regarding AI development? Executives and policymakers expressed concerns about strategic technology transfers, particularly regarding advanced chip exports to China, framing AI infrastructure as national security assets. Q5: How did executives address concerns about an AI bubble? While acknowledging potential overextension, leaders proposed different solutions—Nadella emphasized broader adoption, Huang called for more investment, and Amodei focused on geopolitical controls.

Many now focus on the cost of building a large SHIB position today. Others weigh whether future market recovery could significantly lift valuations by 2030. The debate reflects broader uncertainty about the durability of meme cryptocurrencies. Cost of Buying 100 Million SHIB at Current Prices Shiba Inu hit an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021. Since then, the token has fallen about 91% from that peak. At its current price of roughly $0.00000781, SHIB trades near multi-year lows. This decline has reshaped entry costs for long-term holders. At today’s valuation, purchasing 100 million SHIB costs about $781. Market comparisons highlight how sharply prices have shifted. In December 2025, when SHIB traded near $0.000033, the same amount cost around $3,300. Supporters say this reduced entry level improves upside potential if prices rebound over time. The prolonged downturns often attract accumulation strategies. SHIB’s continued visibility and strong trading volumes. However, they also stress that price recovery depends on broader market cycles. SHIB remains closely correlated with overall crypto sentiment. Despite its losses, Shiba Inu stays among the most-watched meme cryptocurrencies. Community size and brand recognition continue to drive interest. Still, observers caution that popularity alone does not guarantee sustainable growth. Structural factors increasingly shape investor expectations. 2030 Price Forecasts and Portfolio Value Outlook Price forecasts for Shiba Inu in 2030 differ widely across research platforms. Finder’s panel projected SHIB could reach $0.0001971 by 2030. This scenario implies a 2,382% increase from current levels. Under that estimate, 100 million SHIB would be worth about $19,710. Changelly offered a more conservative projection. Its estimates place SHIB between $0.0000458 and $0.0000532 by 2030. This range would value a 100 million SHIB holding between $4,580 and $5,320. Telegaon presented a broader outlook, forecasting prices between $0.0000919 and $0.000124. At the upper level, today’s $794 investment could rise to roughly $12,400. Broader market expectations also influence these forecasts. ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, projected the total crypto market could reach $28 trillion by 2030. Analysts linked this outlook to the expansion of blockchain adoption. They said major assets and select altcoins, including SHIB, could benefit if this growth materializes. Optimism has also emerged around a possible spot SHIB ETF. Grayscale recently identified SHIB as eligible under the SEC’s Generic Listing Standard framework. Market observers referenced Bitcoin and Ethereum price rallies following ETF inflows. However, critics continue to highlight slow development, limited transparency, and SHIB’s massive supply as constraints on long-term gains.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 20:30:12

The next significant move for LINK largely depends on Bitcoin’s momentum, with bulls and bears waiting for a clear signal before committing. Until then, the market is in a holding pattern, building tension for the breakout or breakdown. Traders Await Clear Direction For Chainlink According to an update from CryptoWzrd, the daily candles for both Chainlink and LINKBTC continue to print indecisive price action, reflecting a lack of strong conviction from either side of the market. Despite recent movements, neither buyers nor sellers have been able to establish a clear directional edge, keeping the broader outlook neutral for now. Related Reading: Chainlink Drops To $12.50, But Largest Whales Are Accumulating To gain a reliable directional bias and unlock higher-probability trade opportunities, healthier and more decisive daily candles are required, as price could continue to chop within its current range. Bitcoin is expected to remain the primary driver of the next significant move. In particular, LINKBTC needs to print another bullish daily candle in the coming week to maintain any constructive momentum. Failure to do so could shift the balance back in favor of the bears and increase downside pressure. A continuation of weakness would likely result in a break of the daily lower-high trendline, followed by a loss of the critical $12 support level. On the bullish side, if Bitcoin provides the necessary support, LINK could attempt a recovery rally toward the $16 resistance zone. Until a clearer higher-timeframe structure emerges, the trading focus remains tactical. Attention will be placed on the lower-timeframe charts, particularly over the weekend, to capitalize on quick, short-term opportunities while avoiding unnecessary exposure to indecisive daily conditions. Intraday Chart Shows Tight Range, Market Lacks Clear Direction The analyst concluded that the intraday chart remains choppy, with price action tightly compressed within a narrow range. Such conditions point to persistent market indecision, in which neither bulls nor bears have shown sufficient conviction to drive a sustained move in either direction. As a result, trade setups lack clarity and carry elevated risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Stuck In A Micro-Range As Traders Await A Clear Trigger From a tactical perspective, a retest of the $13 resistance level, followed by clear signs of rejection or fading momentum, could open the door to a short opportunity. However, if price holds above $13 with strong acceptance, that would place the market in more constructive territory and tilt the bias back in favor of the bulls. Until one of these scenarios plays out decisively, the analyst emphasized the importance of waiting. A more mature and well-defined chart structure is needed before engaging in the next trade, ensuring better confirmation, cleaner entries, and improved risk-to-reward conditions.

Vertical Aerospace, based in the United Kingdom, displayed its Valo aircraft in Manhattan. The company’s chairman, Dómhnal Slattery, says these flying vehicles are intended to expand beyond wealthy travelers who can afford expensive helicopter rides. Aiming for affordable air travel with electric power “This is not for the affluent, or the super affluent, which is where helicopters have been forever. We want to democratize urban air mobility,” Slattery told Yahoo Finance. The Valo aircraft has a wingspan of nearly 50 feet and can carry up to six passengers along with a pilot and their bags. That makes it bigger than other flying taxis currently under development by competing companies. The aircraft runs entirely on electricity and has eight rotors that let i t ta ke off straight up like a helicopter. Once airborne, four propellers in the front spin 90 degrees to push the vehicle forward for regular flight. According to the company, the electric motors make much less noise than traditional helicopters. Vertical Aerospace designed the Valo for trips of 100 miles or less. The company expects the aircraft to make several short flights between charges rather than one long journey. Slattery said the company aims to charge around the same price as an Uber Black service for each seat when the cabin is set up for six people. “That opens up the mass market,” he explained. Right now, an Uber Black ride from downtown Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport costs about $150, though prices can go higher during busy times. Slattery maintains that running on electricity instead of fuel makes the Valo cheaper to operate than regular helicopters. Traditional helicopters create noise and air pollution, need repairs more often, and require more room to take off and land. The aircraft shown in New York will soon begin the approval process with European aviation officials. Slattery says European rules are tougher than those from the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. “What we’re revealing tonight is the certificatio n ai rplane; this is what you’re physically seeing out there,” Slattery said about the displayed vehicle. He sai d th e approval process will start next year. Getting approved requires provin g th e aircraft is safe and reliable . Slattery, who spent years working in the aircraft leasing business, say s pa ssengers also need to feel confident about flying in these vehicles. “We want to really sho w th ese things are safe; I need to convince people that this becomes as safe as a Boeing 737, because commercial aviation is the safest form of transport in the world,” Slattery said. “W e al l have worked hard in the industry to achieve that (safety) metric. And so in this industry, proving safety and showing safety is what will make the difference over the next decade.” Airline partnerships and route planning underway Vertical Aerospace has partnered with American Airlines and Japan Airlines. The company hopes to receive full certification by 2028 and begin operating flights that year. However, the company won’t actually run the passenger services. Instead, it plans to operate as a manufacturer like Boeing or Airbus, building aircraft that airlines and other operators will use to serve customers. The company plans to offer flying taxi services in London. In the New York area, Vertical Aerospace is working with Bristow Group , a major helicopter transportation company, and Skyports Infrastructure, which runs heliports around New York City. Together, they’re planning routes that would connect New York City to Newark and Teterboro airports in New Jersey, as well as JFK and East Hampton Airport. Some companies already provide helicopter airport transfers. Blade, which Joby Aviation owns, currently uses regular helicopters but plans to switch to its own electric aircraft eventually. Competition among flying taxi companies will be fierce, and Vertical Aerospace is betting that the Valo’s size, speed, and distance capabilities will provide a competitive edge.

Here’s What Analysts Think,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-any-new-crypto-repeat-what-dogecoin-did-in-its-prime-heres-what-analysts-think/,"The most iconic rally of the 2021 bull run was Dogecoin’s 10,000% rise, which many believe only history can record. However, a new crypto has emerged with the potential to record a historic rally of this nature. The newcomer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently priced at $0.04 in Phase 7 of its presale and has already shown explosive demand to raise a monumental $19.95 million from a group of 18,880+ investors. Mutuum Finance has offered real utility to investors in the crypto market. An investment of $100 in this crypto asset currently in Phase 7 of its presale can potentially rise to $10,000 if Mutuum Finance repeats Dogecoin’s 10,000% rise. Dogecoin Faces the Challenge of Volatility Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be in an extremely volatile state as indicated by the recent liquidation situation wherein over $1.2 million in leveraged positions was liquidated due to the asset’s recent decline. This has left many DOGE investors vulnerable and in losses. While the crypto was once a top player in the market, its momentum is gone. Investors are now turning to a new crypto that could turn their fate around. Project Valuation & ROI Analysis While speculative in nature, the analysis of the potential of MUTM according to the presale performance can offer an understanding of the growth pattern of the token. To attain the target of achieving a growth of 10,000% from the current price of the token in Phase 7, which is $0.04, the new target price of the token will be $4. While ambitious, the target is justified given the project’s capability to attract substantial market attention. Presale Defining Market Confidence Mutuum Finance’s presale model has set the standard for successful early-stage growth. The token is showing remarkable potential as it grows by an impressive 4x, rising from its initial value of $0.01 to its current value of $0.04 in presale phase 7. The potential is high due to the token’s listing price of $0.06. An initial investment of $4,000 is set to rise to $6,000 after the listing, providing an instant gain of $2,000. Over 18,880 investors have put in $19.95 million into the project. This makes the MUTM the next crypto to explode. Dual Rewards: Incentivizing a Liquid Ecosystem Mutuum Finance uses an advanced two-level incentive mechanism that rewards all participants in the ecosystem. This mechanism allows for higher returns to liquidity providers. By depositing USDT into Peer to Contract with a base APY of 8%, an additional incentive of 6% APY in the form of MUTM tokens may be earned, increasing the returns to as much as 14%. On the other hand, borrowers may benefit from incentives such as earning a rebate of 4% APY in the form of MUTM for borrowing $10,000 in USDC with an interest rate of 9%, effectively lowering the borrowing rate to 5%. This incentive mechanism is financed through an allocation of 10% of the entire MUTM token supply. Project Stability The core element of the Mutuum Finance system is its system of risk management that guarantees the stability of the system while providing capital security for the user. The protocol applies a system of dynamically changing Loan-to-Value ratios in real-time according to the changing nature of the markets. For assets like SOL or USDC, which can be defined as blue-chip assets, the LTV can go up to 70% while the liquidation occurs at 75%. This would then allow a user holding an SOL worth $8,000 as collateral to access up to $5,600 in liquidity. Mutuum Finance, which has the symbol MUTM, has the potential to mirror the legendary 10,000% growth that Dogecoin has witnessed in the past. At $0.04 during its presale, backed by a whopping $19.95 million in demand, it has the potential to explode in the near future. A $100 investment in the token has the potential to rise to $10,000 should its valuation rise to $4, making it the next crypto to explode in the near future.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-wont-be-worth-any-less-than-1000-by-2030-heres-why/,"Crypto markets test conviction like few other asset classes. Years of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and shifting narratives have forced many investors to reassess their long-term beliefs. XRP has endured all of this while remaining one of the most debated digital assets in the industry. Yet, for some builders and industry leaders, the long-term case for XRP has only strengthened as the underlying financial infrastructure continues to evolve. That conviction recently resurfaced after Dominic Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, shared a pointed long-term outlook on X. Kwok’s statement blended humor with resolve, but its foundation rested on a serious thesis. As a Web3 educator and ecosystem builder deeply embedded in blockchain development, Kwok framed XRP’s future value as a function of structural utility rather than market sentiment. His remarks resonated widely because they echoed a view increasingly held among long-term XRP proponents. fyi i did not go grey at the age of 30 for $XRP to be worth any less than $1,000 by 2030 — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 23, 2026 XRP’s Role in Future Financial Infrastructure XRP was engineered to solve liquidity inefficiencies in global finance . Its primary function as a bridge asset allows institutions to move value across borders instantly and at low cost. Supporters argue that if XRP becomes embedded in large-scale payment flows, tokenized asset settlement, and institutional liquidity corridors, its valuation must reflect utility-driven demand, not speculative cycles. In high-volume financial systems, assets that facilitate settlement often require higher unit prices to handle large transfers efficiently. From this perspective, price appreciation supports functionality rather than hype. Supply Dynamics and Liquidity Constraints Critics often reject four-figure XRP projections by citing market capitalization limits. Advocates counter that this view oversimplifies supply mechanics. While XRP’s total supply is capped , the liquid supply available on exchanges continues to decline due to long-term holding, institutional custody, escrow mechanisms, and reduced speculative float. As adoption scales, constrained liquidity could amplify price pressure rather than dilute it. In that framework, higher prices enable XRP to move significant value without destabilizing markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Changes the Playing Field Regulatory resolution in the United States removed one of XRP’s largest obstacles. Institutions can now engage with XRP without existential legal risk, unlocking pathways for ETFs, custody solutions, and enterprise-grade settlement products. This shift reframes XRP from a legally uncertain asset into a compliant financial infrastructure. For industry builders like Kwok, regulation no longer suppresses XRP’s potential. Instead, it legitimizes its role within regulated markets. Conviction Over Certainty Kwok’s assertion does not promise timelines or guarantees. It reflects a high-conviction belief grounded in infrastructure, liquidity mechanics, and long-term adoption trends. Whether XRP ultimately reaches $1,000 by 2030 remains uncertain. What is clear is that leaders embedded in Web3 development increasingly view XRP not through short-term charts, but through the lens of a financial system still under construction.

The money was approved by Congress in 2021 to help states build EV infrastructure. But in February 2026, after Sean Duffy took over as Transportation Secretary, the Department of Transportation shut down access to the funds without going through proper legal steps. That triggered a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states and Washington D.C. The case was heard in Seattle by U.S. District Judge Tana Lin. Lin said the DOT and Federal Highway Administration “yanked the NEVI Formula Program’s cord out of the outlet” without following the rules laid out in administrative law. Judge issues permanent order against transportation department The judge didn’t just scold them. She issued a permanent order stopping the Transportation Department from taking back funds or canceling plans already approved. That means states can move ahead with the projects they planned, using money Congress already gave them. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club were happy with the ruling. So were the states. Mike Faulk, who speaks for Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, said, “Judge Lin’s order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future.” The $5 billion program was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed by Biden in 2021. It’s called the NEVI program and was set up to help states build a national network of EV chargers. States like California, Colorado, and Washington had already made their plans and were awarded the funds. But as soon as Duffy took office under President Donald Trump, the DOT suddenly stopped the money from flowing. The Trump administration claimed it was just a temporary pause. But that pause came without any legal process. Lin didn’t buy the excuse. She said the law didn’t allow for any kind of pause, even a short one. “In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,” she wrote. That earlier pause had already drawn fire from the court. A preliminary injunction forced the DOT to issue new guidance. Still, by then, a lot of damage had already been done. Projects were delayed. States were left hanging. Now the case is likely to cause more fights in Congress. The Senate is expected next week to take up a bill that would shift $879 million, money meant for EV charging, to other kinds of infrastructure. That bill already passed the House. If it passes the Senate too, some of the EV money could be rerouted despite the court’s ruling. The Trump administration has also been rolling out other steps to push gas-powered cars over electric ones. It’s been cutting EV tax breaks for buyers and backing automakers that focus on fuel engines. This court ruling won’t stop that. But it does mean the government can’t mess with state funding that was already approved. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. How Ripple Is Embedding Intelligence Into On-Chain Systems An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions. As a leading provider of real-time cross-border payment solutions, Ripple leverages the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables real-time cross-border settlement.

However, a technical breakdown shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd argued that what looks like stagnation may actually be the final preparation phase before a historic move. The price structure suggests something far bigger that sends XRP on its most aggressive rally in eight years, but the implications only become clear when the full setup is examined. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A 400-Day Rectangular Reaccumulation Still Holding Structure According to technical analysis done by ChartNerd, XRP’s price action has been locked inside a rectangular reaccumulation zone for about 400 days, and this has led to the formation of what looks like a rectangular bull flag on a macro timeframe. The technical chart shows a strong impulsive move from July 2024 to December 2024 acting as the flagpole, right when XRP peaked at the $3.4 price zone back then. This impulsive flagpole has been followed by a long period of sideways trading where XRP’s price has repeatedly respected a clearly defined support around $1.8 and resistance boundaries around $3.6. This type of structure is associated with reaccumulation within the support and resistance zones, especially when it is playing out after a sharp expansion move and holding for this length of time. Each dip into reaccumulation support has been absorbed, preventing any sustained breakdown and keeping the broader pattern intact. ChartNerd noted that the rectangular flag will be valid as long as this support level is defended, and this will activate the expansion journey. XRP Price Chart. Source: @ChartNerdTA on X Macro Breakout Projection Puts XRP Price Target At $23 According to ChartNerd, bearish participants are increasingly pressured by the fact that this fractal is still holding despite repeated attempts to invalidate it. The longer XRP’s price action is trapped inside the rectangle without breaking down, the more likely it becomes that the eventual resolution favors the dominant trend that preceded the consolidation. In this case, that trend was bullish, which strengthens the case for an upside breakout once resistance is cleared. If the rectangular bull flag resolves to the upside as projected, the chart outlines a breakout trajectory that would carry XRP into double-digit territory, with a long-term target region near $23. This price target projection is derived from the height of the flagpole extended from the top of the reaccumulation range. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering ChartNerd labelled this possible move as one of the most aggressive rallies XRP could see in seven to eight years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.92, meaning a move toward the $23 region would represent a gain of over 1,000% from current levels, which is a type of percentage expansion XRP has played out well in the past.

The breakout above prior record highs signals a structural repricing of gold rather than a speculative spike, with analysts pointing to central bank accumulation, long-term inflation hedging, and weakening confidence in fiat currencies as key drivers behind the rally. Goldman Sachs Raises 2026 Gold Target to $5,400 Goldman Sachs has reinforced the bullish outlook by raising its 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 per ounce, citing sustained demand from both private investors and central banks. The investment bank emphasized that recent buyers are unlikely to exit positions quickly, creating a higher price floor for gold over the medium term. According to Goldman’s commodities research team, central bank purchases, particularly from emerging markets remain a powerful structural force, while global investors increasingly view gold as a strategic hedge against geopolitical risk, fiscal imbalances, and long-term currency debasement. The bank also noted that anticipated rate cuts in coming years could further support gold by reducing real yields. David Roche: Gold Could Reach $6,000 on Central Bank Shift Veteran strategist David Roche, President of Quantum Strategy, has offered one of the more assertive institutional forecasts, suggesting gold prices could climb toward $6,000 per ounce if central banks continue reallocating reserves away from traditional currencies and into bullion. Roche argues that rising geopolitical fragmentation and declining trust in global monetary coordination are pushing policymakers toward tangible reserve assets. He has highlighted the growing preference for gold as a neutral store of value in a multipolar world, particularly among countries seeking to reduce exposure to the U.S. dollar. In this framework, gold is not merely a hedge, but a strategic monetary asset undergoing re-monetization. Wall Street: Institutional Support for Higher Gold Prices Across Wall Street, sentiment remains firmly constructive. Several major financial institutions now project gold prices well above historical norms over the next two years, reflecting a shift in long-term assumptions rather than short-term volatility. UBS aligns closely with Goldman Sachs, projecting gold prices around $5,400 per ounce, while Yardeni Research has outlined a bullish scenario targeting $6,000 amid persistent fiscal deficits and rising sovereign debt levels. Jefferies has published one of the most optimistic mainstream outlooks, suggesting gold could reach $6,600 per ounce if inflation risks and geopolitical instability remain elevated. Collectively, these forecasts indicate a growing consensus that gold’s role in global portfolios is expanding, driven by both defensive positioning and long-term strategic allocation. Robert Kiyosaki’s Long-Term Bull Case Outside traditional Wall Street analysis, investor and author Robert Kiyosaki continues to promote an aggressively bullish stance on gold. In recent posts on X, Kiyosaki has reiterated his belief that fiat currencies are entering a period of accelerated debasement, prompting investors to seek refuge in hard assets. Kiyosaki has publicly stated a long-term gold target as high as $27,000 per ounce, framing the metal as insurance against systemic financial risk rather than a conventional trade. While his projections fall well beyond institutional estimates, they reflect broader retail and alternative-investment sentiment supporting gold’s multi-year uptrend.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 22:46:23

In a recent survey conducted by the crypto mining platform GoMining, over 5,700 Bitcoin holders shared their experiences with crypto use for everyday payments. The result showed that 55% of respondents rarely or never use crypto for daily real-world transactions. Admittedly, they claim to believe in crypto adoption and the privacy it provides. Still, they gave five reasons behind their choice. A Drawback in Infrastructure The foremost reason why many respondents do not use their crypto holdings to cover everyday payments is the lack of adequate infrastructure to enable them to do so. Over 49% of respondents (2,663) stressed that most merchants do not accept crypto as a payment method. GoMining’s CEO, Mark Zalan, emphasized this point, telling CryptoPotato that “people don’t build a new habit if they have to hunt for places that accept it.” Another 44.7% (2,400) of the survey respondents cited high fees as a barrier, while 26.8% (1,440) highlighted long transaction processing times as a challenge. Blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin, that use a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm often struggle with network speed and transaction fees. As a result, users may find themselves paying more in fees than they would with traditional payment methods. Stablecoins: A Better Option? Over 43% of respondents (2,330) cited price volatility as the reason they did not use crypto for daily payments. Granted, most cryptocurrencies, like BTC, are known for their nonstop volatility. As a result, many have flocked to stablecoins for payments. GoMining’s CEO recognized and emphasized this in his comment: “The [transaction] confirmations need to be fast, and the customer needs to know what to expect from receipts or dispute handling. That’s why stablecoin settlement and card-style systems are drawing so much attention; they lower friction for merchants while keeping the flow familiar. [. . .] Rewards can help people try it at first, but they only stick if fees are low and you can actually use it everywhere.” Finally, 36.2% (1,942) of respondents pointed to potential scams as the reason they did not embrace crypto for everyday payments. On the question of whether Zalan believes crypto should be used more for payments, he said that he doesn’t. Instead, he noted that trying to force that is part of the market confusion. “Bitcoin can play a payment role, often as a settlement and reserve layer that allows faster rails above it. However, there are numerous other tokens that are better viewed as utility for networks, tools for governance, or even as risks, not as money,” he added.

However, the route to achieving this is heavily dependent on institutions, which have yet to come on board in large numbers. Although ETFs lend credibility to the project, the current inflows only seem to contribute to the established trading ranges. On another note, a new and cheap crypto project is attracting smart investors’ interest due to its immediate high growth potential mechanics. This DeFi crypto offers a clear and immediate opportunity to gain more, making it the best crypto to buy now to achieve gains in no time. The difference between these two cryptos is quite clear: whereas one crypto waits to be validated by others, another crypto is busy creating a system to generate more wealth. The Gradual Path that XRP is Taking The forecast for 2026 shows a potential increase for XRP; however, the journey is marked by conditions. For a long time, the token has remained at a price range. It is also seen investing in new ETF products; however, these have not generated the required momentum for a breakthrough. The use of the XRP Ledger is increasing, but it still lags well behind the major competition. As such, the price increase is going to be slow and dependent on other trends within the market. For investors who are looking for investments to multiply their money rapidly, this is not the best option. It lacks the aggressive growth engines of new and more dynamic investments. Mutuum Finance Presale On the other end, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides an exact opportunity with time constraints. This cryptocurrency is in Phase 7, with the tokens being sold at $0.04. This price will soon go up by nearly 20% with the next phase. This chance to buy the cheap cryptocurrency is soon coming to an end. For instance, $500 invested now will yield 12,500 tokens. As the price is set to launch at $0.06, this particular position is expected to rise to $750, a significant immediate gain. Looking at the past trends of strong presales, the potential is much higher after that, making this a crucial time to buy into the cryptocurrency. This is why it is the best crypto to buy now for strategic investors. Earning Yield with mtTokens After the Mutuum Finance platform is launched, holders can immediately begin generating passive income. If a user decides to deposit an asset such as USDT or ETH, they are given a certain number of mtTokens. These tokens can begin generating passive income immediately. If a user has $3,000 that they have deposited, they could potentially earn a 12% return. The mtTokens can be staked in the safety module of the protocol to earn extra MUTM tokens as reward. This not only makes the deposit an earning opportunity but proves the utility of the crypto as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for earning profits. Security Through Overcollateralized Loans Mutuum Finance provides security to its users through its lending model. In its lending model, a user is expected to deposit collateral that is higher than the amount being borrowed. For instance, if a user wants to borrow $5,000, he/she is expected to deposit $7,500 worth of ETH. This means that as a lender, their money is secure and can earn interest with minimal risk involved. This robust security system, which has already passed an audit by Halborn, instills immense trust. It means that this is a long-term project that not only safeguards investors’ capital but also allows it to grow. This is exactly why it’s a top DeFi crypto. A Smart Choice for Real Growth When determining the most promising cryptocurrencies to buy today, the decision is based solely on past momentum versus future prediction. XRP’s opportunity is based solely on future ETF success and adoption rate. Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) opportunity is clearly evident by its thriving presale process and future use for earning high yields while maintaining high security standards for investors to grow their modest investments into high returns So, when it comes to making an investment where one can gain significant returns, the choice is clear. The opportunity to invest in this promising project from the ground level is available, although only for a short period of time.

Mobile phones are central. According to Vera Songwe, a former UN under-secretary-general, millions who lack bank accounts can use stablecoins to protect savings and move money faster. That access matters in places where inflation has been high and bank fees are steep. Use By Businesses And Everyday People Reports have disclosed that stablecoins now make up around 43% of all crypto transaction volume in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria alone processed nearly $22 billion in dollar-linked stablecoin activity over a recent 12-month span. That money is used for remittances, payroll and business settlements. Firms and market traders are among the biggest users, but many everyday people are joining in too. In countries such as Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia and South Africa, demand is driven by volatile local currencies and rules that limit access to dollars. Mobile money networks help push adoption along. Stablecoins Speed Up Cross-Border Payments Traditional remittances can be costly. At a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, Songwe noted that sending $100 through traditional money transfer services in Africa often costs around $6, making cross-border payments both slow and costly. Stablecoins cut those costs and shorten wait times from days to minutes for many transfers. Small payments and wages can be settled quickly, and that speed changes how businesses plan cash flow. Local Rules Are Changing Fast Governments are reacting in different ways. Ghana passed a Virtual Asset Service Providers law to bring trading into a formal framework. On January 13, Nigeria required crypto platforms to link transactions to tax ID numbers, a move meant to bring activity into official records. South Africa’s central bank has warned that stablecoins and other tokens could pose risks to financial stability as use grows. Policy is being written while users and tech firms keep pushing ahead. Risks And The Road Ahead High inflation remains a core reason people are turning to stablecoins . Reports say inflation has exceeded 20% in 12 to 15 countries since the pandemic, and that reality pushes people to look for alternatives to local notes. Everyday Use, Measured Change What started as a tech niche has grown into a practical tool for many across the continent. For small and medium businesses, the benefit is clear: faster settlements and lower costs. For people without bank accounts, a smartphone can now open a route to store value in currencies less tied to local inflation. Adoption will likely keep rising, but how quickly it becomes part of mainstream finance will depend on stronger rules, better safeguards, and the continued spread of simple mobile services that people trust.

With resistance near $91,000–$92,000 and the macro downtrend looming, traders are watching closely to see if BTC will break higher or face renewed pressure. The coming days could prove decisive in shaping the next major move. Bitcoin Mirrors 2021 Cluster: History In Motion Bitcoin continues to mirror the price patterns seen during the 2021 cluster. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that the current market structure is echoing historical behavior, suggesting that similar dynamics are at play. Traders are closely watching these familiar patterns to gauge whether the cycle is repeating itself or if new trends may emerge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness The rules of the game remain consistent. A bearish acceleration would likely be triggered if Bitcoin breaks down from the macro descending triangle base, currently positioned around $82,000. Conversely, a bullish bias would require a decisive break above the macro downtrend, which sits near $100,000. These levels serve as critical decision points for the market, dictating whether bulls or bears gain control in the coming sessions. So far, Bitcoin has encountered rejection in the high $90,000s, falling just short of the macro downtrend. This mirrors previous market behavior, in which the asset developed a basing structure near the triangle’s base before attempting to push higher toward the downtrend’s upper boundary. It demonstrates that history is repeating itself for now, with the market consolidating and preparing for its next directional move. If the macro downtrend continues to act as resistance, the triangle’s base may gradually weaken over time. Such a development would increase the risk of further downside, making the reaction at both the base and the downtrend crucial. BTC Surpasses $91,000 Before Facing Selling Pressure In a recent market update by Ted, it was noted that while Bitcoin broke above the $91,000 threshold yesterday, the rally met significant resistance. Sellers entered the market with substantial force at these local highs, effectively capping the momentum and preventing a sustained breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Sharp Pullback Raises One Question: Will $92K Hold? As a result of this rejection, Bitcoin has retreated into the “no-trading zone.” Ted suggests that this period of sideways price action is likely to persist through the next couple of days, largely driven by the typical low-liquidity environment seen during the weekend. Looking ahead, the outlook remains cautious. Ted emphasizes that any upward movements will likely be short-lived until BTC can decisively clear the $91,000 to $92,000 resistance zone. Meanwhile, such a move must be backed by strong spot demand to prove its validity.

The new crypto rulebook specifies what banks and securities firms must submit and what an external certifier must confirm before offering crypto intermediation and custody services in Brazil. Instrução Normativa (IN) BCB No. 701 was published in Brazil’s official gazette on January 23, 2026, and will become effective on February 2, 2026. Brazil’s central bank formalizes crypto entry rules IN 701 does not build Brazil’s crypto framework from the ground up. It applies sections of BCB Resolution No. 520 (Nov. 10, 2025) by defining the communication steps and the essential content needed. Under IN 701, banks must maintain current registration in Unicad. Also, they must submit independent certification via the BCB’s APS-Siscom system. If the bank does not complete all required steps, the communication is ineffective at the BCB. The bank stays barred from providing crypto services under the new rules. Banks must hire an independent, qualified certifier to verify their compliance with the BCB rules for VASPs before starting operations. The certifier must sign a declaration with the applicant bank, confirming no corporate or commercial ties that might cause a conflict of interest. User funds must be separated Certifiers must verify that institutions keep user funds separate from company assets and show evidence of reserves for all digital assets held by both customers and the company. IN 701 requires the certification to clearly evaluate each item to determine if the institution meets baseline requirements. The certification must include operational controls common in prudential frameworks. These controls involve outsourced services, especially data processing and cloud computing. It must also assess the technical and legal compliance of key suppliers, including those abroad. Recovery plans for client assets and funds are required. Governance policies, internal controls, and cybersecurity with incident response measures must also be addressed. The certifier must examine controls related to anti-financial-crime compliance, including anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and proliferation-financing risks. They must also review market integrity procedures aimed at detecting and stopping abusive actions in the virtual-asset market. The certification should cover each required item individually. The BCB may ask the certifier for more detailed explanations if needed. IN 701 requires certifiers to verify that banks clearly inform customers about the services, support channels, key third-party providers, guarantee funds or insurance, custody processes, risks of the virtual asset and its blockchain, and the terms and risks of staking operations. The rule now mandates certifiers to retain working papers and memos for five years, enhancing the BCB’s review capability. Brazilian banks gain a faster path into crypto Isac Costa, professor and director of the Brazilian Institute of Technology and Innovation (IBIT), says banks may function without fully completing the usual authorization process for common VASPs if they secure certification. He told Valor Econômico that institutions may begin services 90 days after notifying the Central Bank, provided they have independent technical certification confirming full regulatory compliance. The rules do not name the companies that will certify institutions, but Costa thinks auditors familiar with crypto will take on this role. The central bank is likely to clarify this issue because these auditors play a key role in bringing banks into the crypto industry. This is important for Brazil’s effort to promote crypto through banks. Banks and brokerages in Brazil are interested in providing crypto trading and custody to retail investors. The BCB’s method shifts some initial verification tasks to an external certifier but retains the supervisor’s authority to review, block, or stop actions.

This comes amid predictions that regulatory clarity and broader adoption could send the BTC price to as high as $200,000. UBS To Offer Bitcoin Trading To Some Wealth Clients Bloomberg reported that UBS is planning to launch crypto trading for some of its wealth clients, starting with its private bank clients in Switzerland. The bank will reportedly begin by offering these clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum . At the same time, the crypto offering could further expand to clients in the Pacific-Asia region and the U.S. The banking giant is currently in discussions with potential partners, and there is no clear timeline for when it could launch Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for clients. This move is said to be partly due to increased demand from wealth clients for crypto exposure. UBS also faces increased competition as other Wall Street giants are working to offer crypto trading. Morgan Stanley , in partnership with Zerohash, announced plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of this year, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The banking giant may soon also be able to offer its crypto products, as it has filed with the SEC to launch spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs. Furthermore, JPMorgan, another of UBS’ competitors, is considering offering crypto trading to institutional clients , although this plan is still in the early stages. The bank already accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral from its clients. Last year, it also filed to offer BTC structured notes that will track the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Can Bank’s Entry Trigger A BTC Rally To $200,000 Kevin O’Leary predicted that Bitcoin could rally to between $150,000 and $200,000 this year, driven by the passage of the CLARITY Act. His prediction came just as White House Crypto Czar David Sacks said banks would fully enter crypto once the bill passes. As such, there is a possibility that BTC could reach this $200,000 psychological level in anticipation of the amount of new capital that could flow into BTC from these banks once the bill passes. BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, also predicted during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 this year, partly due to growing institutional adoption by Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that a BTC rally to $200,000 is the “most obvious thing in the world” to him. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $89,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Bitcoin News|Assets Under Management|AUM|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BitMine|BlackRock Bitcoin ETF|Bloomberg|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Changpeng “CZ” Zhao|CLARITY Act|CNBC|Coinmarketcap|David Sacks|ETH|Ethereum|JPMorgan|Kevin O'Leary|Morgan Stanley|SEC|SOL ETFs|solana|Tom Lee|UBS|White House Crypto Czar|Zerohash,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 00:30:06

Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum’s inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering Higher Lows And A Structure That Keeps Tightening The analyst’s technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin’s chart. Notably, Ethereum’s price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation. Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here. As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @Tryrexcrypto on X The Bigger Picture Behind Ethereum’s Price Action Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows. Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem.
