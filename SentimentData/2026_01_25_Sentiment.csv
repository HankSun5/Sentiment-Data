For the first time, industry titans including Tesla’s Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella shared stages and exchanged verbal blows, revealing deep fractures in the AI industry’s united front. This unprecedented convergence marked a pivotal moment where visionary optimism collided with pragmatic concerns about sustainability, ethics, and potential market bubbles. AI Davos 2025: The Transformation of Global Discourse The visual landscape of Davos underwent dramatic changes this year. Major technology corporations commandeered prime real estate along the main promenade, with Meta, Salesforce, and Tata establishing prominent physical presences that overshadowed traditional diplomatic displays. The United States House, jointly sponsored by consulting giant McKinsey and Microsoft, stood as the largest installation, symbolizing the corporate takeover of geopolitical discourse. Meanwhile, critical global issues including climate change and poverty struggled to attract comparable attention, highlighting the forum’s shifting priorities toward technological determinism. This physical transformation reflected a broader conceptual shift: artificial intelligence moved from peripheral discussion to central agenda item, dominating conversations across public panels and private meetings. The Executive Showdown: Visionaries Versus Realists Observers noted unprecedented tension among technology leaders who typically maintain diplomatic public personas. The Davos stage became an arena for subtle—and sometimes overt—competition. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei delivered particularly striking criticism of Nvidia, despite his company’s reliance on their GPU technology. He challenged recent U.S. administration decisions allowing advanced chip exports to China, employing vivid metaphors that captured media attention. “An AI data center represents a country full of geniuses,” Amodei declared, questioning the strategic wisdom of transferring such computational power abroad. This rhetorical flourish exemplified the heightened stakes of AI development, framing technological infrastructure in national security terms. Language and Metaphor: Decoding Executive Rhetoric CEOs employed distinctive terminology that revealed their strategic positioning. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella repeatedly referred to data centers as “token factories,” abstracting complex infrastructure into production terminology that emphasized output and scalability. Jensen Huang framed AI investment primarily through job creation narratives, avoiding discussions about potential slowdowns in infrastructure development. Elon Musk’s presence itself generated significant attention, marking a departure from his previous avoidance of the forum. While his contributions contained less substantive policy discussion than peers, his participation signaled AI’s ascendance as the defining technological narrative of our era. These linguistic choices served as strategic positioning, with each executive advancing frameworks that benefited their corporate interests. The Bubble Question: Growth Versus Sustainability Beneath the optimistic projections lay persistent concerns about artificial intelligence’s economic sustainability. Multiple executives acknowledged the potential for market overextension, though they proposed divergent solutions. Satya Nadella emphasized the necessity of broader adoption, suggesting that limited usage could precipitate a market correction. He advocated for equitable global distribution of AI capabilities, positioning Microsoft as an inclusive infrastructure provider. Conversely, Jensen Huang called for increased investment, arguing that current funding levels insufficiently supported necessary innovation. This tension between expansion and consolidation revealed fundamental disagreements about AI’s developmental trajectory. Industry analysts observed that executives balanced promotional messaging with cautious realism, attempting to sustain investment enthusiasm while acknowledging practical constraints. Key AI Executive Positions at Davos 2025 Executive Company Primary Focus Notable Statement Satya Nadella Microsoft Broad adoption & equity “Token factories” need widespread usage Jensen Huang Nvidia Investment & job creation Current investment levels insufficient Dario Amodei Anthropic Geopolitical implications AI data centers as “countries of geniuses” Elon Musk Tesla/X Platform participation Previously avoided, now engaged Geopolitical Dimensions: Technology as Power The Davos discussions consistently transcended pure technology, intersecting with international relations and trade policy. Amodei’s criticism of chip exports to China exemplified this convergence, framing computational hardware as strategic assets with national security implications. This perspective gained traction among policymakers attending the forum, who increasingly view AI development through competitive geopolitical lenses. The technology’s dual-use potential—for both economic advancement and strategic advantage—complicates traditional trade relationships and export controls. These discussions occurred against a backdrop of ongoing U.S.-China technological competition, with AI representing the latest frontier in great power rivalry. European leaders expressed particular concern about dependency on American and Chinese AI ecosystems, proposing regulatory frameworks and investment strategies to ensure regional competitiveness. The Talent Wars: Human Capital in AI Development Beyond hardware and investment, executives addressed the critical human dimension of AI advancement. The competition for specialized talent emerged as a recurring subtext throughout discussions. Companies balance aggressive recruitment against financial sustainability, creating tension between expansion and profitability. This talent competition explains some public disagreements, as executives position their organizations as optimal environments for groundbreaking research. The concentration of expertise in few corporations and regions raises concerns about equitable knowledge distribution and innovation diversity. Several executives proposed educational initiatives and international collaboration frameworks to address talent shortages, though concrete commitments remained limited. Visual and Structural Changes: Corporate Dominance The physical environment of Davos 2025 provided tangible evidence of technology’s rising influence. Traditional national pavilions shared space with elaborate corporate installations featuring interactive demonstrations and networking spaces. This shift generated debate about the World Economic Forum’s evolving identity—whether it primarily serves as a platform for multilateral diplomacy or corporate engagement. The prominent technology presence attracted different participant demographics than previous years, with increased attendance from venture capitalists, startup founders, and technical specialists. This changing composition influenced discussion topics and networking dynamics, further emphasizing technology’s centrality to contemporary global challenges. Conclusion The AI Davos 2025 discussions revealed an industry at a critical inflection point, where unprecedented technological promise confronts practical limitations and internal divisions. The simultaneous presence of competing CEOs created unique transparency about strategic disagreements that typically remain behind corporate walls. While executives universally acknowledged artificial intelligence’s transformative potential, they diverged significantly on implementation pathways, ethical frameworks, and economic sustainability. These debates extend beyond corporate boardrooms, influencing policy decisions, investment patterns, and international relations. As artificial intelligence continues its rapid advancement, the tensions exposed at Davos will likely intensify, requiring more sophisticated frameworks for balancing innovation with responsibility, competition with collaboration, and ambition with realism. FAQs Q1: Why was Davos 2025 particularly significant for AI discussions? The 2025 forum marked unprecedented convergence of major tech CEOs including Musk, Huang, Amodei, and Nadella, who publicly debated AI’s future while revealing strategic tensions typically kept private. Q2: What were the main points of disagreement among tech executives? Key disagreements involved AI’s economic sustainability, appropriate investment levels, geopolitical implications of technology transfer, and whether to prioritize broad adoption versus concentrated advancement. Q3: How did the physical environment of Davos change in 2025? Technology corporations dominated the main promenade with elaborate installations, while traditional diplomatic displays received less prominence, visually representing tech’s rising influence in global discourse. Q4: What geopolitical concerns emerged regarding AI development? Executives and policymakers expressed concerns about strategic technology transfers, particularly regarding advanced chip exports to China, framing AI infrastructure as national security assets. Q5: How did executives address concerns about an AI bubble? While acknowledging potential overextension, leaders proposed different solutions—Nadella emphasized broader adoption, Huang called for more investment, and Amodei focused on geopolitical controls.

Many now focus on the cost of building a large SHIB position today. Others weigh whether future market recovery could significantly lift valuations by 2030. The debate reflects broader uncertainty about the durability of meme cryptocurrencies. Cost of Buying 100 Million SHIB at Current Prices Shiba Inu hit an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021. Since then, the token has fallen about 91% from that peak. At its current price of roughly $0.00000781, SHIB trades near multi-year lows. This decline has reshaped entry costs for long-term holders. At today’s valuation, purchasing 100 million SHIB costs about $781. Market comparisons highlight how sharply prices have shifted. In December 2025, when SHIB traded near $0.000033, the same amount cost around $3,300. Supporters say this reduced entry level improves upside potential if prices rebound over time. The prolonged downturns often attract accumulation strategies. SHIB’s continued visibility and strong trading volumes. However, they also stress that price recovery depends on broader market cycles. SHIB remains closely correlated with overall crypto sentiment. Despite its losses, Shiba Inu stays among the most-watched meme cryptocurrencies. Community size and brand recognition continue to drive interest. Still, observers caution that popularity alone does not guarantee sustainable growth. Structural factors increasingly shape investor expectations. 2030 Price Forecasts and Portfolio Value Outlook Price forecasts for Shiba Inu in 2030 differ widely across research platforms. Finder’s panel projected SHIB could reach $0.0001971 by 2030. This scenario implies a 2,382% increase from current levels. Under that estimate, 100 million SHIB would be worth about $19,710. Changelly offered a more conservative projection. Its estimates place SHIB between $0.0000458 and $0.0000532 by 2030. This range would value a 100 million SHIB holding between $4,580 and $5,320. Telegaon presented a broader outlook, forecasting prices between $0.0000919 and $0.000124. At the upper level, today’s $794 investment could rise to roughly $12,400. Broader market expectations also influence these forecasts. ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, projected the total crypto market could reach $28 trillion by 2030. Analysts linked this outlook to the expansion of blockchain adoption. They said major assets and select altcoins, including SHIB, could benefit if this growth materializes. Optimism has also emerged around a possible spot SHIB ETF. Grayscale recently identified SHIB as eligible under the SEC’s Generic Listing Standard framework. Market observers referenced Bitcoin and Ethereum price rallies following ETF inflows. However, critics continue to highlight slow development, limited transparency, and SHIB’s massive supply as constraints on long-term gains.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 20:30:12

The next significant move for LINK largely depends on Bitcoin’s momentum, with bulls and bears waiting for a clear signal before committing. Until then, the market is in a holding pattern, building tension for the breakout or breakdown. Traders Await Clear Direction For Chainlink According to an update from CryptoWzrd, the daily candles for both Chainlink and LINKBTC continue to print indecisive price action, reflecting a lack of strong conviction from either side of the market. Despite recent movements, neither buyers nor sellers have been able to establish a clear directional edge, keeping the broader outlook neutral for now. Related Reading: Chainlink Drops To $12.50, But Largest Whales Are Accumulating To gain a reliable directional bias and unlock higher-probability trade opportunities, healthier and more decisive daily candles are required, as price could continue to chop within its current range. Bitcoin is expected to remain the primary driver of the next significant move. In particular, LINKBTC needs to print another bullish daily candle in the coming week to maintain any constructive momentum. Failure to do so could shift the balance back in favor of the bears and increase downside pressure. A continuation of weakness would likely result in a break of the daily lower-high trendline, followed by a loss of the critical $12 support level. On the bullish side, if Bitcoin provides the necessary support, LINK could attempt a recovery rally toward the $16 resistance zone. Until a clearer higher-timeframe structure emerges, the trading focus remains tactical. Attention will be placed on the lower-timeframe charts, particularly over the weekend, to capitalize on quick, short-term opportunities while avoiding unnecessary exposure to indecisive daily conditions. Intraday Chart Shows Tight Range, Market Lacks Clear Direction The analyst concluded that the intraday chart remains choppy, with price action tightly compressed within a narrow range. Such conditions point to persistent market indecision, in which neither bulls nor bears have shown sufficient conviction to drive a sustained move in either direction. As a result, trade setups lack clarity and carry elevated risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Stuck In A Micro-Range As Traders Await A Clear Trigger From a tactical perspective, a retest of the $13 resistance level, followed by clear signs of rejection or fading momentum, could open the door to a short opportunity. However, if price holds above $13 with strong acceptance, that would place the market in more constructive territory and tilt the bias back in favor of the bulls. Until one of these scenarios plays out decisively, the analyst emphasized the importance of waiting. A more mature and well-defined chart structure is needed before engaging in the next trade, ensuring better confirmation, cleaner entries, and improved risk-to-reward conditions.

Vertical Aerospace, based in the United Kingdom, displayed its Valo aircraft in Manhattan. The company’s chairman, Dómhnal Slattery, says these flying vehicles are intended to expand beyond wealthy travelers who can afford expensive helicopter rides. Aiming for affordable air travel with electric power “This is not for the affluent, or the super affluent, which is where helicopters have been forever. We want to democratize urban air mobility,” Slattery told Yahoo Finance. The Valo aircraft has a wingspan of nearly 50 feet and can carry up to six passengers along with a pilot and their bags. That makes it bigger than other flying taxis currently under development by competing companies. The aircraft runs entirely on electricity and has eight rotors that let i t ta ke off straight up like a helicopter. Once airborne, four propellers in the front spin 90 degrees to push the vehicle forward for regular flight. According to the company, the electric motors make much less noise than traditional helicopters. Vertical Aerospace designed the Valo for trips of 100 miles or less. The company expects the aircraft to make several short flights between charges rather than one long journey. Slattery said the company aims to charge around the same price as an Uber Black service for each seat when the cabin is set up for six people. “That opens up the mass market,” he explained. Right now, an Uber Black ride from downtown Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport costs about $150, though prices can go higher during busy times. Slattery maintains that running on electricity instead of fuel makes the Valo cheaper to operate than regular helicopters. Traditional helicopters create noise and air pollution, need repairs more often, and require more room to take off and land. The aircraft shown in New York will soon begin the approval process with European aviation officials. Slattery says European rules are tougher than those from the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. “What we’re revealing tonight is the certificatio n ai rplane; this is what you’re physically seeing out there,” Slattery said about the displayed vehicle. He sai d th e approval process will start next year. Getting approved requires provin g th e aircraft is safe and reliable . Slattery, who spent years working in the aircraft leasing business, say s pa ssengers also need to feel confident about flying in these vehicles. “We want to really sho w th ese things are safe; I need to convince people that this becomes as safe as a Boeing 737, because commercial aviation is the safest form of transport in the world,” Slattery said. “W e al l have worked hard in the industry to achieve that (safety) metric. And so in this industry, proving safety and showing safety is what will make the difference over the next decade.” Airline partnerships and route planning underway Vertical Aerospace has partnered with American Airlines and Japan Airlines. The company hopes to receive full certification by 2028 and begin operating flights that year. However, the company won’t actually run the passenger services. Instead, it plans to operate as a manufacturer like Boeing or Airbus, building aircraft that airlines and other operators will use to serve customers. The company plans to offer flying taxi services in London. In the New York area, Vertical Aerospace is working with Bristow Group , a major helicopter transportation company, and Skyports Infrastructure, which runs heliports around New York City. Together, they’re planning routes that would connect New York City to Newark and Teterboro airports in New Jersey, as well as JFK and East Hampton Airport. Some companies already provide helicopter airport transfers. Blade, which Joby Aviation owns, currently uses regular helicopters but plans to switch to its own electric aircraft eventually. Competition among flying taxi companies will be fierce, and Vertical Aerospace is betting that the Valo’s size, speed, and distance capabilities will provide a competitive edge.

An investment of $100 in this crypto asset currently in Phase 7 of its presale can potentially rise to $10,000 if Mutuum Finance repeats Dogecoin’s 10,000% rise. Dogecoin Faces the Challenge of Volatility Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be in an extremely volatile state as indicated by the recent liquidation situation wherein over $1.2 million in leveraged positions was liquidated due to the asset’s recent decline. This has left many DOGE investors vulnerable and in losses. While the crypto was once a top player in the market, its momentum is gone. Investors are now turning to a new crypto that could turn their fate around. Project Valuation & ROI Analysis While speculative in nature, the analysis of the potential of MUTM according to the presale performance can offer an understanding of the growth pattern of the token. To attain the target of achieving a growth of 10,000% from the current price of the token in Phase 7, which is $0.04, the new target price of the token will be $4. While ambitious, the target is justified given the project’s capability to attract substantial market attention. Presale Defining Market Confidence Mutuum Finance’s presale model has set the standard for successful early-stage growth. The token is showing remarkable potential as it grows by an impressive 4x, rising from its initial value of $0.01 to its current value of $0.04 in presale phase 7. The potential is high due to the token’s listing price of $0.06. An initial investment of $4,000 is set to rise to $6,000 after the listing, providing an instant gain of $2,000. Over 18,880 investors have put in $19.95 million into the project. This makes the MUTM the next crypto to explode. Dual Rewards: Incentivizing a Liquid Ecosystem Mutuum Finance uses an advanced two-level incentive mechanism that rewards all participants in the ecosystem. This mechanism allows for higher returns to liquidity providers. By depositing USDT into Peer to Contract with a base APY of 8%, an additional incentive of 6% APY in the form of MUTM tokens may be earned, increasing the returns to as much as 14%. On the other hand, borrowers may benefit from incentives such as earning a rebate of 4% APY in the form of MUTM for borrowing $10,000 in USDC with an interest rate of 9%, effectively lowering the borrowing rate to 5%. This incentive mechanism is financed through an allocation of 10% of the entire MUTM token supply. Project Stability The core element of the Mutuum Finance system is its system of risk management that guarantees the stability of the system while providing capital security for the user. The protocol applies a system of dynamically changing Loan-to-Value ratios in real-time according to the changing nature of the markets. For assets like SOL or USDC, which can be defined as blue-chip assets, the LTV can go up to 70% while the liquidation occurs at 75%. This would then allow a user holding an SOL worth $8,000 as collateral to access up to $5,600 in liquidity. Mutuum Finance, which has the symbol MUTM, has the potential to mirror the legendary 10,000% growth that Dogecoin has witnessed in the past. At $0.04 during its presale, backed by a whopping $19.95 million in demand, it has the potential to explode in the near future. A $100 investment in the token has the potential to rise to $10,000 should its valuation rise to $4, making it the next crypto to explode in the near future.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-wont-be-worth-any-less-than-1000-by-2030-heres-why/,"Crypto markets test conviction like few other asset classes. Years of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and shifting narratives have forced many investors to reassess their long-term beliefs. XRP has endured all of this while remaining one of the most debated digital assets in the industry. Yet, for some builders and industry leaders, the long-term case for XRP has only strengthened as the underlying financial infrastructure continues to evolve. That conviction recently resurfaced after Dominic Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, shared a pointed long-term outlook on X. Kwok’s statement blended humor with resolve, but its foundation rested on a serious thesis. As a Web3 educator and ecosystem builder deeply embedded in blockchain development, Kwok framed XRP’s future value as a function of structural utility rather than market sentiment. His remarks resonated widely because they echoed a view increasingly held among long-term XRP proponents. fyi i did not go grey at the age of 30 for $XRP to be worth any less than $1,000 by 2030 — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 23, 2026 XRP’s Role in Future Financial Infrastructure XRP was engineered to solve liquidity inefficiencies in global finance . Its primary function as a bridge asset allows institutions to move value across borders instantly and at low cost. Supporters argue that if XRP becomes embedded in large-scale payment flows, tokenized asset settlement, and institutional liquidity corridors, its valuation must reflect utility-driven demand, not speculative cycles. In high-volume financial systems, assets that facilitate settlement often require higher unit prices to handle large transfers efficiently. From this perspective, price appreciation supports functionality rather than hype. Supply Dynamics and Liquidity Constraints Critics often reject four-figure XRP projections by citing market capitalization limits. Advocates counter that this view oversimplifies supply mechanics. While XRP’s total supply is capped , the liquid supply available on exchanges continues to decline due to long-term holding, institutional custody, escrow mechanisms, and reduced speculative float. As adoption scales, constrained liquidity could amplify price pressure rather than dilute it. In that framework, higher prices enable XRP to move significant value without destabilizing markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Changes the Playing Field Regulatory resolution in the United States removed one of XRP’s largest obstacles. Institutions can now engage with XRP without existential legal risk, unlocking pathways for ETFs, custody solutions, and enterprise-grade settlement products. This shift reframes XRP from a legally uncertain asset into a compliant financial infrastructure. For industry builders like Kwok, regulation no longer suppresses XRP’s potential. Instead, it legitimizes its role within regulated markets. Conviction Over Certainty Kwok’s assertion does not promise timelines or guarantees. It reflects a high-conviction belief grounded in infrastructure, liquidity mechanics, and long-term adoption trends. Whether XRP ultimately reaches $1,000 by 2030 remains uncertain. What is clear is that leaders embedded in Web3 development increasingly view XRP not through short-term charts, but through the lens of a financial system still under construction.

The money was approved by Congress in 2021 to help states build EV infrastructure. But in February 2026, after Sean Duffy took over as Transportation Secretary, the Department of Transportation shut down access to the funds without going through proper legal steps. That triggered a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states and Washington D.C. The case was heard in Seattle by U.S. District Judge Tana Lin. Lin said the DOT and Federal Highway Administration “yanked the NEVI Formula Program’s cord out of the outlet” without following the rules laid out in administrative law. Judge issues permanent order against transportation department The judge didn’t just scold them. She issued a permanent order stopping the Transportation Department from taking back funds or canceling plans already approved. That means states can move ahead with the projects they planned, using money Congress already gave them. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club were happy with the ruling. So were the states. Mike Faulk, who speaks for Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, said, “Judge Lin’s order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future.” The $5 billion program was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed by Biden in 2021. It’s called the NEVI program and was set up to help states build a national network of EV chargers. States like California, Colorado, and Washington had already made their plans and were awarded the funds. But as soon as Duffy took office under President Donald Trump, the DOT suddenly stopped the money from flowing. The Trump administration claimed it was just a temporary pause. But that pause came without any legal process. Lin didn’t buy the excuse. She said the law didn’t allow for any kind of pause, even a short one. “In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,” she wrote. That earlier pause had already drawn fire from the court. A preliminary injunction forced the DOT to issue new guidance. Still, by then, a lot of damage had already been done. Projects were delayed. States were left hanging. Now the case is likely to cause more fights in Congress. The Senate is expected next week to take up a bill that would shift $879 million, money meant for EV charging, to other kinds of infrastructure. That bill already passed the House. If it passes the Senate too, some of the EV money could be rerouted despite the court’s ruling. The Trump administration has also been rolling out other steps to push gas-powered cars over electric ones. It’s been cutting EV tax breaks for buyers and backing automakers that focus on fuel engines. This court ruling won’t stop that. But it does mean the government can’t mess with state funding that was already approved. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. How Ripple Is Embedding Intelligence Into On-Chain Systems An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions.

However, a technical breakdown shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd argued that what looks like stagnation may actually be the final preparation phase before a historic move. The price structure suggests something far bigger that sends XRP on its most aggressive rally in eight years, but the implications only become clear when the full setup is examined. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A 400-Day Rectangular Reaccumulation Still Holding Structure According to technical analysis done by ChartNerd, XRP’s price action has been locked inside a rectangular reaccumulation zone for about 400 days, and this has led to the formation of what looks like a rectangular bull flag on a macro timeframe. The technical chart shows a strong impulsive move from July 2024 to December 2024 acting as the flagpole, right when XRP peaked at the $3.4 price zone back then. This impulsive flagpole has been followed by a long period of sideways trading where XRP’s price has repeatedly respected a clearly defined support around $1.8 and resistance boundaries around $3.6. This type of structure is associated with reaccumulation within the support and resistance zones, especially when it is playing out after a sharp expansion move and holding for this length of time. Each dip into reaccumulation support has been absorbed, preventing any sustained breakdown and keeping the broader pattern intact. ChartNerd noted that the rectangular flag will be valid as long as this support level is defended, and this will activate the expansion journey. XRP Price Chart. Source: @ChartNerdTA on X Macro Breakout Projection Puts XRP Price Target At $23 According to ChartNerd, bearish participants are increasingly pressured by the fact that this fractal is still holding despite repeated attempts to invalidate it. The longer XRP’s price action is trapped inside the rectangle without breaking down, the more likely it becomes that the eventual resolution favors the dominant trend that preceded the consolidation. In this case, that trend was bullish, which strengthens the case for an upside breakout once resistance is cleared. If the rectangular bull flag resolves to the upside as projected, the chart outlines a breakout trajectory that would carry XRP into double-digit territory, with a long-term target region near $23. This price target projection is derived from the height of the flagpole extended from the top of the reaccumulation range. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering ChartNerd labelled this possible move as one of the most aggressive rallies XRP could see in seven to eight years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.92, meaning a move toward the $23 region would represent a gain of over 1,000% from current levels, which is a type of percentage expansion XRP has played out well in the past.

The breakout above prior record highs signals a structural repricing of gold rather than a speculative spike, with analysts pointing to central bank accumulation, long-term inflation hedging, and weakening confidence in fiat currencies as key drivers behind the rally. Goldman Sachs Raises 2026 Gold Target to $5,400 Goldman Sachs has reinforced the bullish outlook by raising its 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 per ounce, citing sustained demand from both private investors and central banks. The investment bank emphasized that recent buyers are unlikely to exit positions quickly, creating a higher price floor for gold over the medium term. According to Goldman’s commodities research team, central bank purchases, particularly from emerging markets remain a powerful structural force, while global investors increasingly view gold as a strategic hedge against geopolitical risk, fiscal imbalances, and long-term currency debasement. The bank also noted that anticipated rate cuts in coming years could further support gold by reducing real yields. David Roche: Gold Could Reach $6,000 on Central Bank Shift Veteran strategist David Roche, President of Quantum Strategy, has offered one of the more assertive institutional forecasts, suggesting gold prices could climb toward $6,000 per ounce if central banks continue reallocating reserves away from traditional currencies and into bullion. Roche argues that rising geopolitical fragmentation and declining trust in global monetary coordination are pushing policymakers toward tangible reserve assets. He has highlighted the growing preference for gold as a neutral store of value in a multipolar world, particularly among countries seeking to reduce exposure to the U.S. dollar. In this framework, gold is not merely a hedge, but a strategic monetary asset undergoing re-monetization. Wall Street: Institutional Support for Higher Gold Prices Across Wall Street, sentiment remains firmly constructive. Several major financial institutions now project gold prices well above historical norms over the next two years, reflecting a shift in long-term assumptions rather than short-term volatility. UBS aligns closely with Goldman Sachs, projecting gold prices around $5,400 per ounce, while Yardeni Research has outlined a bullish scenario targeting $6,000 amid persistent fiscal deficits and rising sovereign debt levels. Jefferies has published one of the most optimistic mainstream outlooks, suggesting gold could reach $6,600 per ounce if inflation risks and geopolitical instability remain elevated. Collectively, these forecasts indicate a growing consensus that gold’s role in global portfolios is expanding, driven by both defensive positioning and long-term strategic allocation. Robert Kiyosaki’s Long-Term Bull Case Outside traditional Wall Street analysis, investor and author Robert Kiyosaki continues to promote an aggressively bullish stance on gold. In recent posts on X, Kiyosaki has reiterated his belief that fiat currencies are entering a period of accelerated debasement, prompting investors to seek refuge in hard assets. Kiyosaki has publicly stated a long-term gold target as high as $27,000 per ounce, framing the metal as insurance against systemic financial risk rather than a conventional trade. While his projections fall well beyond institutional estimates, they reflect broader retail and alternative-investment sentiment supporting gold’s multi-year uptrend.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 22:46:23

In a recent survey conducted by the crypto mining platform GoMining, over 5,700 Bitcoin holders shared their experiences with crypto use for everyday payments. The result showed that 55% of respondents rarely or never use crypto for daily real-world transactions. Admittedly, they claim to believe in crypto adoption and the privacy it provides. Still, they gave five reasons behind their choice. A Drawback in Infrastructure The foremost reason why many respondents do not use their crypto holdings to cover everyday payments is the lack of adequate infrastructure to enable them to do so. Over 49% of respondents (2,663) stressed that most merchants do not accept crypto as a payment method. GoMining’s CEO, Mark Zalan, emphasized this point, telling CryptoPotato that “people don’t build a new habit if they have to hunt for places that accept it.” Another 44.7% (2,400) of the survey respondents cited high fees as a barrier, while 26.8% (1,440) highlighted long transaction processing times as a challenge. Blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin, that use a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm often struggle with network speed and transaction fees. As a result, users may find themselves paying more in fees than they would with traditional payment methods. Stablecoins: A Better Option? Over 43% of respondents (2,330) cited price volatility as the reason they did not use crypto for daily payments. Granted, most cryptocurrencies, like BTC, are known for their nonstop volatility. As a result, many have flocked to stablecoins for payments. GoMining’s CEO recognized and emphasized this in his comment: “The [transaction] confirmations need to be fast, and the customer needs to know what to expect from receipts or dispute handling. That’s why stablecoin settlement and card-style systems are drawing so much attention; they lower friction for merchants while keeping the flow familiar. [. . .] Rewards can help people try it at first, but they only stick if fees are low and you can actually use it everywhere.” Finally, 36.2% (1,942) of respondents pointed to potential scams as the reason they did not embrace crypto for everyday payments. On the question of whether Zalan believes crypto should be used more for payments, he said that he doesn’t. Instead, he noted that trying to force that is part of the market confusion. “Bitcoin can play a payment role, often as a settlement and reserve layer that allows faster rails above it. However, there are numerous other tokens that are better viewed as utility for networks, tools for governance, or even as risks, not as money,” he added.

However, the route to achieving this is heavily dependent on institutions, which have yet to come on board in large numbers. Although ETFs lend credibility to the project, the current inflows only seem to contribute to the established trading ranges. On another note, a new and cheap crypto project is attracting smart investors’ interest due to its immediate high growth potential mechanics. This DeFi crypto offers a clear and immediate opportunity to gain more, making it the best crypto to buy now to achieve gains in no time. The difference between these two cryptos is quite clear: whereas one crypto waits to be validated by others, another crypto is busy creating a system to generate more wealth. The Gradual Path that XRP is Taking The forecast for 2026 shows a potential increase for XRP; however, the journey is marked by conditions. For a long time, the token has remained at a price range. It is also seen investing in new ETF products; however, these have not generated the required momentum for a breakthrough. The use of the XRP Ledger is increasing, but it still lags well behind the major competition. As such, the price increase is going to be slow and dependent on other trends within the market. For investors who are looking for investments to multiply their money rapidly, this is not the best option. It lacks the aggressive growth engines of new and more dynamic investments. Mutuum Finance Presale On the other end, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides an exact opportunity with time constraints. This cryptocurrency is in Phase 7, with the tokens being sold at $0.04. This price will soon go up by nearly 20% with the next phase. This chance to buy the cheap cryptocurrency is soon coming to an end. For instance, $500 invested now will yield 12,500 tokens. As the price is set to launch at $0.06, this particular position is expected to rise to $750, a significant immediate gain. Looking at the past trends of strong presales, the potential is much higher after that, making this a crucial time to buy into the cryptocurrency. This is why it is the best crypto to buy now for strategic investors. Earning Yield with mtTokens After the Mutuum Finance platform is launched, holders can immediately begin generating passive income. If a user decides to deposit an asset such as USDT or ETH, they are given a certain number of mtTokens. These tokens can begin generating passive income immediately. If a user has $3,000 that they have deposited, they could potentially earn a 12% return. The mtTokens can be staked in the safety module of the protocol to earn extra MUTM tokens as reward. This not only makes the deposit an earning opportunity but proves the utility of the crypto as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for earning profits. Security Through Overcollateralized Loans Mutuum Finance provides security to its users through its lending model. In its lending model, a user is expected to deposit collateral that is higher than the amount being borrowed. For instance, if a user wants to borrow $5,000, he/she is expected to deposit $7,500 worth of ETH. This means that as a lender, their money is secure and can earn interest with minimal risk involved. This robust security system, which has already passed an audit by Halborn, instills immense trust. It means that this is a long-term project that not only safeguards investors’ capital but also allows it to grow. This is exactly why it’s a top DeFi crypto. A Smart Choice for Real Growth When determining the most promising cryptocurrencies to buy today, the decision is based solely on past momentum versus future prediction. XRP’s opportunity is based solely on future ETF success and adoption rate. Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) opportunity is clearly evident by its thriving presale process and future use for earning high yields while maintaining high security standards for investors to grow their modest investments into high returns So, when it comes to making an investment where one can gain significant returns, the choice is clear. The opportunity to invest in this promising project from the ground level is available, although only for a short period of time.

Mobile phones are central. According to Vera Songwe, a former UN under-secretary-general, millions who lack bank accounts can use stablecoins to protect savings and move money faster. That access matters in places where inflation has been high and bank fees are steep. Use By Businesses And Everyday People Reports have disclosed that stablecoins now make up around 43% of all crypto transaction volume in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria alone processed nearly $22 billion in dollar-linked stablecoin activity over a recent 12-month span. That money is used for remittances, payroll and business settlements. Firms and market traders are among the biggest users, but many everyday people are joining in too. In countries such as Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia and South Africa, demand is driven by volatile local currencies and rules that limit access to dollars. Mobile money networks help push adoption along. Stablecoins Speed Up Cross-Border Payments Traditional remittances can be costly. At a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, Songwe noted that sending $100 through traditional money transfer services in Africa often costs around $6, making cross-border payments both slow and costly. Stablecoins cut those costs and shorten wait times from days to minutes for many transfers. Small payments and wages can be settled quickly, and that speed changes how businesses plan cash flow. Local Rules Are Changing Fast Governments are reacting in different ways. Ghana passed a Virtual Asset Service Providers law to bring trading into a formal framework. On January 13, Nigeria required crypto platforms to link transactions to tax ID numbers, a move meant to bring activity into official records. South Africa’s central bank has warned that stablecoins and other tokens could pose risks to financial stability as use grows. Policy is being written while users and tech firms keep pushing ahead. Risks And The Road Ahead High inflation remains a core reason people are turning to stablecoins . Reports say inflation has exceeded 20% in 12 to 15 countries since the pandemic, and that reality pushes people to look for alternatives to local notes. Everyday Use, Measured Change What started as a tech niche has grown into a practical tool for many across the continent. For small and medium businesses, the benefit is clear: faster settlements and lower costs. For people without bank accounts, a smartphone can now open a route to store value in currencies less tied to local inflation. Adoption will likely keep rising, but how quickly it becomes part of mainstream finance will depend on stronger rules, better safeguards, and the continued spread of simple mobile services that people trust.

With resistance near $91,000–$92,000 and the macro downtrend looming, traders are watching closely to see if BTC will break higher or face renewed pressure. The coming days could prove decisive in shaping the next major move. Bitcoin Mirrors 2021 Cluster: History In Motion Bitcoin continues to mirror the price patterns seen during the 2021 cluster. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that the current market structure is echoing historical behavior, suggesting that similar dynamics are at play. Traders are closely watching these familiar patterns to gauge whether the cycle is repeating itself or if new trends may emerge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness The rules of the game remain consistent. A bearish acceleration would likely be triggered if Bitcoin breaks down from the macro descending triangle base, currently positioned around $82,000. Conversely, a bullish bias would require a decisive break above the macro downtrend, which sits near $100,000. These levels serve as critical decision points for the market, dictating whether bulls or bears gain control in the coming sessions. So far, Bitcoin has encountered rejection in the high $90,000s, falling just short of the macro downtrend. This mirrors previous market behavior, in which the asset developed a basing structure near the triangle’s base before attempting to push higher toward the downtrend’s upper boundary. It demonstrates that history is repeating itself for now, with the market consolidating and preparing for its next directional move. If the macro downtrend continues to act as resistance, the triangle’s base may gradually weaken over time. Such a development would increase the risk of further downside, making the reaction at both the base and the downtrend crucial. BTC Surpasses $91,000 Before Facing Selling Pressure In a recent market update by Ted, it was noted that while Bitcoin broke above the $91,000 threshold yesterday, the rally met significant resistance. Sellers entered the market with substantial force at these local highs, effectively capping the momentum and preventing a sustained breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Sharp Pullback Raises One Question: Will $92K Hold? As a result of this rejection, Bitcoin has retreated into the “no-trading zone.” Ted suggests that this period of sideways price action is likely to persist through the next couple of days, largely driven by the typical low-liquidity environment seen during the weekend. Looking ahead, the outlook remains cautious. Ted emphasizes that any upward movements will likely be short-lived until BTC can decisively clear the $91,000 to $92,000 resistance zone. Meanwhile, such a move must be backed by strong spot demand to prove its validity.

The new crypto rulebook specifies what banks and securities firms must submit and what an external certifier must confirm before offering crypto intermediation and custody services in Brazil. Instrução Normativa (IN) BCB No. 701 was published in Brazil’s official gazette on January 23, 2026, and will become effective on February 2, 2026. Brazil’s central bank formalizes crypto entry rules IN 701 does not build Brazil’s crypto framework from the ground up. It applies sections of BCB Resolution No. 520 (Nov. 10, 2025) by defining the communication steps and the essential content needed. Under IN 701, banks must maintain current registration in Unicad. Also, they must submit independent certification via the BCB’s APS-Siscom system. If the bank does not complete all required steps, the communication is ineffective at the BCB. The bank stays barred from providing crypto services under the new rules. Banks must hire an independent, qualified certifier to verify their compliance with the BCB rules for VASPs before starting operations. The certifier must sign a declaration with the applicant bank, confirming no corporate or commercial ties that might cause a conflict of interest. User funds must be separated Certifiers must verify that institutions keep user funds separate from company assets and show evidence of reserves for all digital assets held by both customers and the company. IN 701 requires the certification to clearly evaluate each item to determine if the institution meets baseline requirements. The certification must include operational controls common in prudential frameworks. These controls involve outsourced services, especially data processing and cloud computing. It must also assess the technical and legal compliance of key suppliers, including those abroad. Recovery plans for client assets and funds are required. Governance policies, internal controls, and cybersecurity with incident response measures must also be addressed. The certifier must examine controls related to anti-financial-crime compliance, including anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and proliferation-financing risks. They must also review market integrity procedures aimed at detecting and stopping abusive actions in the virtual-asset market. The certification should cover each required item individually. The BCB may ask the certifier for more detailed explanations if needed. IN 701 requires certifiers to verify that banks clearly inform customers about the services, support channels, key third-party providers, guarantee funds or insurance, custody processes, risks of the virtual asset and its blockchain, and the terms and risks of staking operations. The rule now mandates certifiers to retain working papers and memos for five years, enhancing the BCB’s review capability. Brazilian banks gain a faster path into crypto Isac Costa, professor and director of the Brazilian Institute of Technology and Innovation (IBIT), says banks may function without fully completing the usual authorization process for common VASPs if they secure certification. He told Valor Econômico that institutions may begin services 90 days after notifying the Central Bank, provided they have independent technical certification confirming full regulatory compliance. The rules do not name the companies that will certify institutions, but Costa thinks auditors familiar with crypto will take on this role. The central bank is likely to clarify this issue because these auditors play a key role in bringing banks into the crypto industry. This is important for Brazil’s effort to promote crypto through banks. Banks and brokerages in Brazil are interested in providing crypto trading and custody to retail investors. The BCB’s method shifts some initial verification tasks to an external certifier but retains the supervisor’s authority to review, block, or stop actions. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This comes amid predictions that regulatory clarity and broader adoption could send the BTC price to as high as $200,000. UBS To Offer Bitcoin Trading To Some Wealth Clients Bloomberg reported that UBS is planning to launch crypto trading for some of its wealth clients, starting with its private bank clients in Switzerland. The bank will reportedly begin by offering these clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum . At the same time, the crypto offering could further expand to clients in the Pacific-Asia region and the U.S. The banking giant is currently in discussions with potential partners, and there is no clear timeline for when it could launch Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for clients. This move is said to be partly due to increased demand from wealth clients for crypto exposure. UBS also faces increased competition as other Wall Street giants are working to offer crypto trading. Morgan Stanley , in partnership with Zerohash, announced plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of this year, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The banking giant may soon also be able to offer its crypto products, as it has filed with the SEC to launch spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs. Furthermore, JPMorgan, another of UBS’ competitors, is considering offering crypto trading to institutional clients , although this plan is still in the early stages. The bank already accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral from its clients. Last year, it also filed to offer BTC structured notes that will track the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Can Bank’s Entry Trigger A BTC Rally To $200,000 Kevin O’Leary predicted that Bitcoin could rally to between $150,000 and $200,000 this year, driven by the passage of the CLARITY Act. His prediction came just as White House Crypto Czar David Sacks said banks would fully enter crypto once the bill passes. As such, there is a possibility that BTC could reach this $200,000 psychological level in anticipation of the amount of new capital that could flow into BTC from these banks once the bill passes. BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, also predicted during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 this year, partly due to growing institutional adoption by Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that a BTC rally to $200,000 is the “most obvious thing in the world” to him. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $89,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Bitcoin News|Assets Under Management|AUM|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BitMine|BlackRock Bitcoin ETF|Bloomberg|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Changpeng “CZ” Zhao|CLARITY Act|CNBC|Coinmarketcap|David Sacks|ETH|Ethereum|JPMorgan|Kevin O'Leary|Morgan Stanley|SEC|SOL ETFs|solana|Tom Lee|UBS|White House Crypto Czar|Zerohash,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 00:30:06

Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum’s inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering Higher Lows And A Structure That Keeps Tightening The analyst’s technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin’s chart. Notably, Ethereum’s price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation. Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here. As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @Tryrexcrypto on X The Bigger Picture Behind Ethereum’s Price Action Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows. Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.3052 Market Cap $593.68M Trading Volume $36.89M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.3062 24-hour Low $0.30 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.09% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3059 14-Day RSI 47.90 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.5141 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is down ~15% from its recent high and is now range-bound near local support. Daily momentum is bearish but decelerating, hinting at possible short-term stabilization. The 4-hour structure remains weak, with sellers firmly defending the $0.31–$0.32 zone. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1-day chart for January 25, OP is trading around $0.305, stabilizing after a strong impulsive rally that topped near $0.358, marking roughly a 15% pullback from the recent peak. The rejection from the upper Bollinger Band and failure to hold above the mid-band near $0.322 confirms that bullish momentum has cooled materially. OP is now compressing just above the lower Bollinger Band around $0.286, suggesting sellers are losing aggression but buyers are not yet stepping in decisively. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD has crossed into negative territory with expanding red histogram bars, signaling bearish continuation risk, although the flattening slope hints that downside momentum is slowing rather than accelerating. A daily close below $0.300 would expose $0.286 quickly, while reclaiming $0.322 is required to shift the structure back toward recovery. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP remains structurally weak, trading below the Alligator averages with the “mouth” opening downward, which reinforces a short-term bearish bias. The coin has repeatedly failed to reclaim the $0.309–$0.318 resistance band, confirming this zone as active supply, while support at $0.300 has been tested multiple times and is thinning. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The OBV continues to trend lower, showing persistent distribution and lack of meaningful accumulation, despite minor green candles attempting to form a base. The bounce from $0.295 was shallow, less than 4%, indicating reactive buying rather than confident dip demand. As long as OP remains capped below $0.318, upside attempts are likely to be sold into, with a breakdown risking a sweep toward $0.285–$0.295. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3186 SELL SMA 5 $0.3096 SELL SMA 10 $0.3156 SELL SMA 21 $0.3195 SELL SMA 50 $0.3059 SELL SMA 100 $0.3505 SELL SMA 200 $0.5141 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3229 SELL EMA 5 $0.3199 SELL EMA 10 $0.3099 SELL EMA 21 $0.3008 BUY EMA 50 $0.3214 SELL EMA 100 $0.3925 SELL EMA 200 $0.5338 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Unless OP reclaims $0.322 with conviction, the path of least resistance remains sideways-to-down, with a higher probability of a support test near $0.29 before any sustainable upside attempt. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February.

The decline is also accompanied by other key factors, such as negative funding rates, indicating a strong bearish bias. Analysts have also pointed out that a decline to $2,700 is also a real possibility. With this being said, this environment makes a perfect scenario for investors to look to a project that has a good opportunity in hand instead of waiting on a potential recovery in a project’s growth. As of today, what is clear is that instead of a failing giant being the crypto to consider buying today, a thriving new crypto in a live presale phase is what’s needed to steer clear of any uncertainty in today’s crypto environment. Ethereum’s Bearish Pressure The current position of Ethereum is a worrying factor. The price drop to less than $3,000 and the current negative funding rate indicate that the price is likely to continue falling as the number of investors betting on the price drop increases. There is a significant withdrawal of money from Ethereum ETFs. Despite the purchases by the large holders, the price continues falling. As technical analysis shows, the next major support point for the cryptocurrency is at $2,627, implying further loss. For the investor, it is a precarious position to be in. Investing in something that may continuously lose value is not the best strategy. Therefore, it is not advisable to invest in Ethereum if one is wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to buy now for growth. The best strategy is to invest in a crypto with an upward trend. Mutuum Finance Presale: The Ground-Floor Opportunity As Ethereum struggles, Mutuum Finance is offering a defining and exclusive opportunity for those willing to participate. Its presale is ongoing and is currently in Phase 7 at a price per token of $0.04. It is expected to increase to $0.045 in the next phase; hence, it is a one-time opportunity to purchase at a low price. For example, an investment of $400 will yield 10,000 MUTM tokens. With the set price of $0.06 at the time of its launch, this holding has the potential to increase up to $600 in a short period of time by a remarkable $200. Additionally, the analysts have predicted a tremendous demand for this crypto in the future after its listing, in which the initial profit from the presale can multiply 30x. This will turn $400 into $12,000, placing this new crypto in the top spot for the best crypto to buy now. Profit from Direct Peer-to-Peer Lending The Mutuum Finance platform will allow users to make Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This feature enables users to make mutually agreed-on deals with specific conditions that offer better returns. For instance, users can make a $2,000 loan directly with a person they trust at 18% annual interest. This generates $360 in pure profit annually. It is an ideal model for tokens which might not be a good fit for the regular pools, thus offering a more lucrative arrangement. It ensures the lender has full control while earning yields which far surpass the regular bank. This earning ability makes it an ideal reason for considering this as the best crypto to invest in. Growth through the Buy-Back Distribution Model Mutuum Finance has an effective model of buying and distribution to reward long-term holders. Some of the fees on the platform will be used to buy MUTM tokens on the market, which will later be distributed as dividends to the users who have staked their funds. If one has tokens worth $5,000 as a deposit, they can stake them on the Mutuum platform. If the protocol has $500,000 in fees that are allocated towards buybacks, they could earn an additional $1,000 in a distribution round of MUTM. This leads to an ecosystem that will continue to create value, making it a solid DeFi crypto in which to invest. A Strategic Investment Decision The debate on the best crypto to invest in currently has an obvious answer. The price trend of Ethereum is going downwards and is bearish. On the other hand, there is an opportunity for gains from the presale of Mutuum Finance, making profits from the yield farming opportunity and tokenomics. Buying MUTM is a strategic move into a project that already has working mechanics before its main launch. For investors looking to secure their wealth, the decision is obvious. The window for the presale is not infinite, and the time to take action is now.

The company, listed publicly and based in Oklahoma, holds major deposits of heavy rare earths across the U.S. The funding comes as Washington scrambles to secure control of materials key to national defense, energy, and tech supply chains. The federal government will take a 10% stake in the miner through 16.1 million shares priced at $17.17 each, and warrants for another 17.6 million at the same price. The total equity buy is worth $277 million, but the government is already looking at an implied profit of $490 million based on the company’s current stock price of $24.77. That’s just the equity side. A separate $1.3 billion in senior secured debt is also being handed over, coming from a finance facility inside the Commerce Department, created under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Government boosts rare earth output with direct investment One official at the Chips office, the group that led the negotiations, said they’re “focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and U.S. national security.” The office operates under the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which falls under the Commerce Department. That department has so far refused to comment publicly on the transaction. The debt portion of the deal will be issued at market rates and structured directly with USA Rare Earth. The move comes as investors are swarming around anything linked to rare earths. Earlier this week, Trump said the U.S. had finalized a “framework” that might lead to deals involving Greenland’s untapped mineral reserves. One insider made it clear, though: this deal has nothing to do with Greenland. Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year, with a 40% jump just this week. The company is now valued at $3.7 billion and is working on a massive rare earth mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas. It says the site holds 15 out of 17 rare earth elements used to build phones, fighter jets, and missiles. It’s also building a magnet production plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Cantor joins private financing while Trump expands control This federal funding isn’t happening in a vacuum. USA Rare Earth is also raising over $1 billion in private equity through a separate deal. That effort is being handled by Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street giant once owned by Howard Lutnick, who is now Trump’s Commerce Secretary. His sons run it now. The private money raise is not connected to the government investment, but it’s part of a bigger push. The company only needed $500 million to satisfy the terms of the government deal, it’s already cleared that number. The funding method used is known as a Pipe (private investment in public equity). Demand for the deal has been high, according to sources close to the company. Cantor helped the company go public last year via a blank cheque vehicle in March. While Cantor didn’t advise on the federal deal, the firm’s role is clearly growing under Trump’s America First push. And this isn’t the administration’s first rodeo in this space. Just last year, it poured money into MP Materials, Lithium Americas, Trilogy Metals, and others. Some of those deals raised eyebrows. For example, the government invested in Vulcan Elements, a rare earth start-up, three months after Donald Trump Jr’s venture group bought in. The defense and commerce departments have been working closely to boost local production. USA Rare Earth is the latest piece of that effort, but it won’t be the last. The White House is serious about locking down minerals supply, and Trump is making sure that happens by getting the government directly involved in ownership. Including rare earths. Including chips. Including steel. Including whatever else they decide matters to the flag. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

As top altcoin picks like Ethereum gear up for $4,000-$5,000 forecasts per Binance and Kraken analyses, a bold newcomer like APEMARS is stealing the spotlight with its epic Mars conquest narrative, Commander Ape rallying a degen crew through scarcity burns and viral rewards. But with presale Stage 5 live at just $0.00003629 and over $109K raised, the clock is ticking: Will you join before prices surge to the $0.0055 listing, unlocking 15,000%+ ROI? Imagine staking your $APRZ holdings right after presale, only to see 63% APY rewards ignite two months post-launch, compounding your gains as the community expands like a rocket blasting off. While XRP’s bullish highs might reach $10-14 in optimistic AI scenarios from Yahoo Finance, and Ethereum pushes toward $7K-$9K if upgrades like Glamsterdam deliver, APEMARS’ deflationary tokenomics and referral bonuses are creating real FOMO, turning early investors into potential millionaires. But stages are selling out fast; hesitate, and you might watch from the sidelines as this meme coin hero claims the 2026 throne. APEMARS Presale Stage 3: 2026’s Top Altcoin Picks? As we dive deeper into top altcoin picks for 2026, APEMARS stands out like a rocket ready for liftoff. This fun yet strategic meme coin draws from an epic story of Commander Ape’s solo trip to Mars, turning it into a community-driven adventure that’s pulling in investors fast. With its live presale in Stage 5 at just $0.00003629 per token, and a listing price eyed at $0.0055, it’s whispering huge potential returns that could make early joiners smile big. Backed by smart token burns and rewards, APEMARS isn’t just hype; it’s built for lasting momentum in a market where XRP price predictions show steady climbs but might lack that viral spark. What sets APEMARS apart in the 2026 landscape? Picture a coin where scarcity meets storytelling, rewarding holders while building a “degen crew” that’s growing by the day. Over $109,000 raised already, with Stage 5 filling fast and the next stage kicking in soon. If you’re eyeing top altcoin picks beyond Ethereum’s scaling plays or XRP’s regulatory wins, APEMARS could be the underdog that delivers the thrill. APEMARS Investment Scenario: Crunching the Numbers for 15,000%+ ROI Potential Let’s talk numbers, because in top altcoin picks for 2026, the math behind APEMARS screams opportunity. Say you invest $1,000 now in Stage 5 at $0.00003629 that nets you about 27,555,800 tokens. Fast-forward to the $0.0055 listing price, and your stack could be worth $151,556.90, a jaw-dropping 15,000% returns. That’s not pie-in-the-sky; it’s based on the project’s deflationary setup, with 50% of the 70 billion total supply in presale and burns trimming the fat along the way. How to Buy APEMARS: Simple Steps to Join the Presale Before It’s Gone Getting into APEMARS is straightforward, perfect for anyone chasing top altcoin picks without the hassle. First, head to the official site at APEMARS.com and connect your Ethereum wallet. MetaMask works great. Pick your amount (ETH, USDT, or card options available), confirm the swap, and boom, your $APRZ tokens are claimed post-presale. To amp up the FOMO, hit that $22 minimum for a referral code and share it earn 9.34% bonuses while building your crew. With Stage 5 ticking down fast (just days left before the price jumps), this is your shot to lock in before the burns and listings kick values higher. In a market buzzing with XRP price predictions and Ethereum upgrades, APEMARS feels like the fresh bet that could pay off big. Don’t let this stage slip away. XRP: Steady Momentum Amid ETF Buzz and Banking Adoption XRP is showing real resilience early in 2026. The coin started the year up 13%, and fresh news highlights Ripple’s push into institutional finance. Ripple’s president recently said 2026 could mark the shift to full crypto adoption in banks, while ETF inflows and chart patterns suggest a potential reversal soon. Price predictions for XRP in 2026 range from conservative averages of $2.20 (CoinCodex) to more optimistic calls of $3.18–$3.49 (Changelly), with some analysts floating $10–$14 if regulatory wins and global use keep accelerating. Even bolder takes mention of $18+ if XRP narrows the gap with Bitcoin. Solid, reliable growth but without the explosive narrative many are craving right now. Ethereum: Upgrades and On-Chain Strength Set the Stage for Bigger Moves Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and smart contracts. On-chain activity is picking up again, with more staking, whale accumulation, and ETF interest building quietly in the background. Forecasts for 2026 look promising: averages between $4,565 and $5,201 (Changelly), with some firms like Standard Chartered calling for $7,500 by year-end, thanks to supply dynamics and upcoming upgrades like Glamsterdam that should make transactions faster and cheaper. Short-term targets sit around $3,455–$3,900 in the next few weeks. Ethereum delivers steady, fundamentals-driven upside, but it lacks that viral, community-fueled spark that can create sudden moonshots. While XRP and Ethereum offer dependable paths forward in 2026’s altcoin landscape, APEMARS brings a completely different energy scarcity through burns, 63% staking APY waiting to unlock, and an epic Mars story that’s filling up fast in presale Stage 5. With the next price jump just days away, this could be the wildcard that surprises everyone. Wrapping Up 2026’s Altcoin Market: Steady Giants Meet Bold Newcomers As we look ahead to 2026, the altcoin market feels like a mix of proven paths and fresh adventures. XRP price prediction points to reliable growth around $2 to $4 on average, backed by regulatory progress and banking ties that could push it higher in bullish scenarios. Ethereum builds on its strengths with upgrades aiming for $4,000 to $5,000 averages, offering solid returns through DeFi and staking. These top altcoin picks provide a foundation for investors seeking stability in a shifting space. Yet, in this evolving scene, options like APEMARS add an exciting layer with its scarcity burns, 63% staking rewards set to launch soon after listing, and a fun Mars conquest story that’s drawing in a growing community. With presale Stage 5 moving quickly at $0.00003629 and a potential 15,000% ROI to the $0.0055 listing, it reminds us that sometimes the most rewarding journeys start small but build fast. For those eyeing top altcoin picks, keeping an open mind to these underdogs could make all the difference. After all, the next big win might just be one bold step away. According to the best crypto to buy now , top altcoin picks for 2026 emphasize projects with strong narratives and utilities, like APEMARS’ Mars-themed ecosystem. Remember, past performance isn’t indicative of future results, invest only what you can afford to lose, and consult financial advisors to align strategies with your risk tolerance.

XRP price prediction 2026 varies across sources, with averages clustering around $2 to $4 based on CoinCodex and Changelly analyses. Bullish scenarios from AI models like Grok and Perplexity suggest highs up to $14 if ETF approvals and banking adoption accelerate, while conservative forecasts hover at $2.20 amid market volatility. Investors should monitor regulatory developments closely for accurate trends. Will XRP reach $10 in 2026? XRP price prediction 2026 includes optimistic takes where it could hit $10 or more, per FXEmpire and FastBull, driven by ETF inflows exceeding $10 billion and fractal setups signaling breakouts. However, base cases from Motley Fool and Kraken predict $2 to $4 averages, requiring strong macro conditions and institutional growth to achieve such highs without major pullbacks. How much will XRP be worth in 2026 according to AI models? XRP price prediction 2026 from AI like ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude ranges from under $2 in bearish views to over $14 in upside cases, with base clusters at $2 to $4. Yahoo Finance highlights divergence: Grok sees $10 potential, while Perplexity pushes $9, emphasizing factors like regulatory wins and adoption for explosive growth. What factors could influence XRP price prediction 2026? XRP price prediction 2026 depends on ETF buzz, Ripple’s banking partnerships, and upgrades like Glamsterdam for Ethereum competitors. Sources like Binance and Kraken note on-chain activity, whale accumulation, and global adoption as key drivers, potentially pushing averages to $3.50, but volatility from macro risks could cap gains unless institutional inflows surge. Is APEMARS a better altcoin pick than XRP for 2026 ROI? While XRP price prediction 2026 forecasts steady $2 to $4 growth, APEMARS offers explosive potential with 15,000% ROI from Stage 5 presale at $0.00003629 to $0.0055 listing. It’s staking at 63% APY and deflationary burns create FOMO, positioning it as a high-risk, high-reward meme coin alternative for investors seeking viral momentum over XRP’s stability. AEO Summary XRP price prediction 2026 points to averages of $2 to $4, with bullish highs reaching $10 to $14 amid ETF approvals and banking adoption, according to CoinCodex, Changelly, and AI models like Grok. In the altcoin landscape, Ethereum eyes $4,000 to $5,000 via upgrades, but APEMARS steals focus as a top altcoin pick in live presale Stage 5 at $0.00003629, promising 15,000% ROI to $0.0055 listing.

The jump has widened the price gap with the U.S., where local Chinese buyers are now paying a $9 premium over global levels. It’s no longer just a rally. It’s a physical scramble. People are lining up in Shenzhen, emptying shelves, and banks are struggling to keep up. China’s shortage of silver is no longer isolated. Refineries in Turkey are reporting zero stock for the past 10 days, especially on 10 oz and 100 oz bars. Buyers there are offering premiums of up to $9 per ounce, the same premium seen in China. Meanwhile, a recent Korea Mint sale sold out in just one hour, giving more proof that physical demand is spiraling out of control across Asia. Trump’s second term fuels a wave of silver buying across Asia The price pressure started rising right after Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched attacks on the Federal Reserve. Since early January, silver has jumped another 30%, after gaining nearly 150% in 2025. It started with Chinese buyers snapping up coins and bars, but now the hunger is spreading into India, Turkey, and the Middle East. Firat Sekerci, a bullion dealer based in Dubai, said this is the wildest buying he’s seen. Firat said Turkish refiners have had no stock for days, and demand hasn’t slowed. Because of that, banks have shifted their shipping priorities toward Turkey and nearby regions. This has led to fewer shipments reaching India, where demand is climbing again. Right now, demand in India is even hotter than it was during the Diwali buying rush last October. Back then, people bought everything ahead of the festival, while tariffs kept metal stuck in the U.S., and that drained liquidity in London. That squeeze pushed benchmark prices to levels not seen since the 1970s. But now, India is going through it again, with buyers grabbing smaller bars and coins, especially from MMTC-PAMP, the country’s biggest refiner. The company’s boss, Samit Guha, said interest hasn’t slowed. Even Elon Musk got involved in December. He posted on X about new Chinese export rules, right as silver demand started blowing up outside China. China shipped around 5,100 tons of silver in 2025 . That’s the biggest number in over 16 years, based on customs data. So while people are panicking over possible export controls, the numbers suggest things haven’t tightened just yet. But nerves are high. China has already tightened exports on other materials like antimony and rare earths, and no one’s ruling out that silver could be next. This entire shortage was kicked off by a short squeeze back in October, when local supply problems spiraled out across the globe.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,990 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price movement represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and has sparked intense analysis among traders and institutional investors worldwide. Market analysts immediately began scrutinizing trading volumes, liquidity conditions, and macroeconomic indicators to understand the driving forces behind this sudden decline. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Reaction The descent below $89,000 marks a crucial psychological level for Bitcoin traders. Consequently, this breach triggered automated sell orders across multiple exchanges. Trading volume surged by approximately 35% in the hour following the drop, according to aggregated exchange data. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by 2.8% within the same period. Major exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance reported increased sell-side pressure, particularly in the USDT and USD trading pairs. The futures market also showed heightened activity, with open interest fluctuating significantly as traders adjusted their positions. Historical data reveals that Bitcoin has tested the $89,000 support level three times in the past quarter. Each previous test resulted in either a swift rebound or a consolidation phase. The current price sits just above the 50-day simple moving average, a key technical indicator watched by algorithmic traders. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into neutral territory, suggesting the potential for either continued selling or a stabilization period. Market sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, shifted from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ following the price movement. Contextual Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Volatility Several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors typically contribute to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Firstly, traditional financial markets experienced mild turbulence this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite showing slight declines. Secondly, comments from Federal Reserve officials regarding interest rate policies often impact risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, blockchain data indicates a recent increase in Bitcoin transfers to exchanges, a metric often associated with selling pressure. The network’s hash rate remains stable, indicating no fundamental change in the security or operation of the Bitcoin network itself. Regulatory developments continue to influence market psychology. For instance, recent statements from financial authorities in major economies can create uncertainty. Moreover, the performance of other major cryptocurrencies, often called ‘altcoins,’ frequently correlates with Bitcoin’s movements. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, also saw a 3.1% decline in the same period. The table below shows key market metrics before and after the price drop: Metric Before Drop (Approx.) After Drop (Approx.) BTC Price (Binance USDT) $89,450 $88,990 24-Hour Trading Volume $28.5B $38.7B Market Dominance 52.3% 51.8% Futures Funding Rate +0.01% -0.005% Technical analysts highlight several important support and resistance levels. The next major support zone lies between $87,500 and $88,000, an area where significant buying interest emerged during previous market cycles. On the other hand, resistance is now expected near the $90,500 and $91,200 levels, which previously acted as support. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart is showing early signs of a bearish crossover, a development that technical traders monitor closely. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure and Liquidity Financial institutions with cryptocurrency research divisions have published immediate analyses. For example, analysts often cite the role of large holders, known as ‘whales,’ in providing or absorbing liquidity during volatile periods. On-chain data services report that whale wallet activity increased in the 12 hours preceding the drop. Furthermore, the options market shows a rising demand for put options (bearish bets) at the $88,000 and $85,000 strike prices for the monthly expiry. This activity suggests some traders are hedging against further downside risk. Market structure relies heavily on liquidity, which refers to the ease of buying or selling an asset without drastically affecting its price. Order book data from several exchanges reveals that the bid-side liquidity (buy orders) thinned noticeably just below the $89,100 level. This thinning likely accelerated the downward move once that level broke. Market makers, entities that provide constant buy and sell quotes, reportedly widened their spreads temporarily to manage their risk exposure. This is a standard practice during periods of high volatility and order flow imbalance. Historical Comparisons and Cycle Analysis Bitcoin’s history is characterized by periods of intense volatility followed by consolidation. A comparison to previous market cycles can provide context, though past performance never guarantees future results. For instance, in the 2021 bull market, Bitcoin experienced over twenty separate corrections of 10% or more before reaching its all-time high. These pullbacks are considered normal and healthy by many long-term investors, as they can shake out over-leveraged positions and establish stronger support levels for future advances. The current market phase differs from previous ones in several key aspects: Institutional Participation: Significant capital from ETFs and corporate treasuries now provides a different base of demand. Regulatory Clarity: While evolving, the regulatory environment in major jurisdictions is more defined than in earlier cycles. Market Infrastructure: Sophisticated trading tools, derivatives, and custody solutions have matured considerably. Macro Correlation: Bitcoin has shown periods of both correlation and decoupling with traditional risk assets like tech stocks. Long-term holders, defined as wallets that have not moved Bitcoin for over 155 days, continue to hold a historically high percentage of the circulating supply. This behavior often indicates a strong conviction in the asset’s long-term value proposition, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. The illiquid supply, or coins unlikely to be sold soon, has been trending upward throughout the year, according to data from analytics firms. Conclusion The Bitcoin price movement below $89,000 serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility within cryptocurrency markets. This event highlights the complex interplay between technical levels, market sentiment, liquidity, and broader financial conditions. While short-term price action captures attention, the fundamental aspects of the Bitcoin network—its security, decentralization, and fixed supply—remain unchanged. Market participants will now watch for whether this level becomes a new resistance point or a base for the next leg of market structure development. The Bitcoin price will likely continue to be a key indicator for the overall digital asset ecosystem in the coming days and weeks. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $89,000? Market analysts attribute the drop to a combination of factors including thin bid-side liquidity at a key technical level, broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets, and potential profit-taking by short-term traders after a period of consolidation near higher prices. Q2: What is the significance of the $89,000 level for Bitcoin? The $89,000 level acted as both support and resistance in recent trading history. Its breach is psychologically significant for market participants and often triggers automated trading algorithms, which can amplify price movements in either direction. Q3: How does this price drop compare to historical Bitcoin corrections? Corrections of this magnitude (around 1-3%) are relatively common in Bitcoin’s trading history. During previous bull markets, the asset frequently experienced deeper pullbacks exceeding 10% while maintaining its overall long-term upward trajectory. Q4: What should traders monitor after this Bitcoin price movement? Traders typically watch order book liquidity, futures market funding rates, on-chain movement from large holders, and broader equity market performance. The reaction at the next key support level (around $87,500-$88,000) will be particularly telling for short-term direction. Q5: Does this price change affect the long-term outlook for Bitcoin? Most long-term analysts distinguish between short-term volatility and long-term fundamentals. Factors like adoption, regulatory developments, and technological upgrades are generally considered more significant for the multi-year outlook than any single day’s price action.

One side is booming thanks to industrial exports tied to global demand for AI infrastructure. The other side, built around domestic consumption, is still struggling. This divide is now driving every major investor decision, with big firms like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Asset Management choosing to back the exporters and ignore the local retailers. Manufacturing and tech-related companies are dominating. The ones focused on local consumers are falling further behind. Investors are done waiting for a broad recovery. They’re now betting on the side of China that is delivering real earnings from real demand. Export stocks rise as investors chase AI infrastructure gains William Bratton from BNP Paribas Exane said: “There are clearly two very different Chinas at the moment.” He said his team prefers materials, industrials, and technology over anything consumer-facing, and that earnings numbers prove why. The winners are easy to spot. China XD Electric, a big player in ultra-high-voltage grid work, is up 75% this year. TBEA, which makes electrical components, is up 28%. These companies are riding the global push for artificial intelligence buildouts, and they’re cashing in. Morgan Stanley just backed a group of stocks they think will ride this momentum. Their picks include Sany Heavy Industry, Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic, Han’s Laser, and Wuxi Lead Intelligent. Their analysts, including Sheng Zhong, said, “Construction machinery is entering an improvement cycle, with the domestic recovery continuing along with overseas demand.” They’re seeing what they called “decent growth momentum” in exports. Min Lan Tan from UBS said, “I think industrials outperformance will continue because that’s where there’s a lot of structural growth that is happening.” She added, “Nobody can afford to really step back from this AI race.” That demand is pushing forecasts higher. Over the past six months, the CSI 300 Industrials Index saw a 10% rise in earnings expectations. For the consumer index, it was just 5%. The difference says it all. Consumer stocks fall as property problems drag on Retail-linked names aren’t getting the same love. Fuyao Glass Industry is down 5.4% this year. Great Wall Motor has dropped 4.6%. The main issue is China’s property crisis, which still hasn’t been fixed. People just aren’t spending. The recovery that was supposed to boost domestic demand hasn’t shown up. Chaoping Zhu from JPMorgan Asset Management said the big investors he talks to aren’t confident in local demand coming back. “They remain cautious about domestic recovery, focusing instead on the earnings growth potential of the ‘going global’ theme,” he said. Zhu also said the Chinese government is now leaning harder into advanced manufacturing and tech, trying to use the stock market to boost both capital formation and household wealth. Of course, this industrial boom isn’t bulletproof. If foreign countries push back on cheap Chinese goods, the party could end fast. But right now, Beijing’s top policy focus is still on fixing consumption. That means some bargain hunters might look at beaten-down consumer stocks — if they’re brave enough.

It is estimated that the losses are at “hundreds of billions of won,” though the exact figure has not been publicly confirmed. Bitcoin Missing From Government Storage The incident reportedly came to light during a routine internal inspection of seized financial assets, a process that includes checking passwords and access information kept on removable storage devices such as USB drives. A prosecution official cited in local coverage said the loss may have occurred after someone accidentally accessed a so-called “fake site” while conducting the inspection. This has raised the possibility that the BTC was compromised through a scam link rather than a direct breach of a secured system. Meanwhile, another local media, “The Chosun Daily,” reported that roughly 70 billion won (about $47.7 million) worth of Bitcoin was missing, and that the suspected cause was a phishing attack triggered when an agency worker visited a fraudulent website. The report stated that the wallet password or access credentials may have been exposed externally, which enabled attackers to drain the seized holdings. Authorities are reportedly working to determine the circumstances of the loss and trace the whereabouts of the seized assets, but could not disclose specifics. Phishing Threats Persist Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used to steal crypto, and they rely on spoofed websites or messages designed to trick victims into entering sensitive information such as private keys or login details. These scams threaten both individual and institutional crypto holders across the world. Earlier this year, users of Ledger, the prominent France-based crypto hardware wallet company, were targeted in a phishing scam following a data breach at its e-commerce partner, Global-e. After Ledger confirmed that customer contact and order details were exposed, scammers sent personalized emails claiming a fake merger between Ledger and Trezor. The messages instructed users to “migrate” their wallets by entering 24-word recovery phrases on a spoofed site. In December, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen warned of a rise in phishing scams using fake Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings to steal crypto. Hackers send bogus links via Telegram or fake Calendly pages, then claim audio or connection issues during calls to trick victims into downloading malware. Chen urged users to verify meeting links, avoid installing software during calls, and report suspicious contacts immediately.

Amid rising pressure from US President Donald Trump for lower borrowing costs, the Fed has urged Washington officials to stay focused on this goal. The officials are expected to reaffirm this stance when they wrap up their two-day meeting on Wednesday, January 28. At the same time, analysts predict that central banks in countries such as Brazil, Canada , and Sweden are also likely to maintain their current interest rates given the prevailing economic conditions. The Fed encountered a tense moment amid Trump’s demands Regarding the Fed’s recent decision , sources close to the situation, who wished to remain anonymous, as the discussions were private, unveiled that the three central banks teamed up with more than a dozen others, including the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB), who proved to be Fed chair Jerome Powell’s strong supporters. Under this collaboration, these banks stressed the importance of independence at a time when the administration in Washington exerted heightened pressure on Powell and the team. To demonstrate the intensity of the situation, reports highlighted that, in addition to the US president repeatedly complaining about the Fed chair’s cautious approach to lowering interest rates, the Fed is currently facing grand jury subpoenas, suggesting the possibility of criminal charges. On the other hand, the Supreme Court reviewed arguments presented regarding whether Trump can proceed with his motive to dismiss Lisa Cook, a Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors of the United States. Following this drama, central banks worldwide have adopted a strategic approach to their operations to counter mounting international pressures. However, they still raise concerns due to several challenging global situations, including a recent market crash in Japan, rising investor tensions over Trump’s interest in Greenland, and his escalating threats to international trade flows . Regarding this matter, Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, commented that the world is currently more vulnerable to sudden changes. Georgieva made this statement during the closing session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, further arguing that things have taken a different turn nowadays. Several analysts also weighed in on the topic. They noted that, “We believe that most members of the FOMC can find data that supports keeping rates unchanged at the upcoming meeting. This level of agreement would show support for Powell, who has faced strong criticism from the White House. The key figures to watch are Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman: If they join the majority in voting to keep rates steady, they will signal their backing for Powell — especially regarding Fed independence. We think Waller will vote with the majority, but Bowman may disagree.” In the meantime, policymakers noted that while they are concerned about the negative impact of tariffs on economic expansion, they remain focused on monitoring potential inflationary pressures in today’s climate. Uncertainties surround the fate of the Fed’s decision on interest rates A group of 18 central banks worldwide is set to attend meetings scheduled for decision-making sessions next week. Following this announcement, several analysts anticipated that central banks in Africa would take a different approach from the Fed, thereby supporting new easing measures as they adapt to shifting economic conditions. On the other hand, sources noted that inflation reports from Australia to Brazil and Japan, along with Chinese industrial profits and European GDP figures, will be major highlights. In the meantime, officials from the Fed are expected to maintain interest rates steady after implementing three consecutive rate reductions by late 2025. At this moment, analysts predict that Powell will propose that the current policy is fit for purpose for the time being, but the Fed chair will not outline upcoming changes to interest rates. With this approach in place, officials can take their time to observe how previous rate reductions have affected the country’s economic progress.

Instead, tax policy and regulatory treatment are the main hurdles, according to a senior executive at Bitcoin financial firm Strive. Pierre Rochard, a board member of Strive and a veteran of Bitcoin treasury management, stated this week that while improvements in scaling technologies – tools that speed up transactions and reduce costs – continue to develop, it’s the way BTC is taxed that prevents it from functioning as ordinary money in everyday transactions. Using an athletic analogy to explain BTC’s situation, he said that victory isn’t guaranteed by strength alone; you must show up and play the game, just as a top athlete can’t claim victory from the sidelines. He remarked, “The best athlete can win against the worst athlete 100% of the time, if the best athlete plays. It drops to 0% if he doesn’t play and lets the weak athlete win. You have to play to win. Get in the arena.” Strive’s Rochard says Bitcoin payments increased faster in low-tax places Under current US tax rules, Bitcoin is treated as property rather than currency. That means every time someone spends BTC, for coffee, services, or goods, it triggers a tax reporting obligation and potentially a capital gains tax if the value has increased since the buyer acquired the Bitcoin. The absence of a de minimis tax exemption — a threshold below which transactions would not be taxed — has drawn sharp criticism from industry advocates. In response to Rochard’s post, one X user countered his point, saying that even in countries where BTC is tax-free, paying with Bitcoin hasn’t caught on. The Strive executive later pushed back , stating the data shows BTC payments have grown much faster in low-tax regions than in high-tax ones. Responding to another user’s post, he insisted that tax enforcement should be feared. Some commenters also supported his perspective, claiming that if it were not for tax imposition, they would use Bitcoin all the time. X commenter Mohammed Walid Gagi asserted that tax-free nations don’t fear Bitcoin. Some users thanked him for cutting through the noise, saying that everyone focuses on Lightning and scaling when tax treatment is the real barrier. Just last month, the Bitcoin Policy Institute warned that taxing every BTC payment makes it simply less effective as a day-to-day currency and slows its uptake. Currently, US officials are exploring a de minimis tax exemption for fully backed stablecoins—a proposal that hasn’t gone over well with Bitcoiners. Senator Lummis had introduced a bill providing exemptions for small BTC transactions In July 2025, crypto supporter and Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a bill to exempt small digital asset transactions of $300 or less from taxes. The proposal would impose a $5,000 annual cap on exemptions and add protections for crypto-based charitable giving. It also suggested earnings from crypto staking or mining wouldn’t be treated as taxable income until the coins were sold. Additionally, in October, after Square integrated Bitcoin payments, founder Jack Dorsey advocated for a tax break on small BTC transactions. Dorsey noted, “We want BTC to be everyday money ASAP.” But Marty Bent, co-founder of the media outlet Truth for the Commoner, derided the plan to exempt stablecoins from taxes as “nonsensical.” Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island are also proposing legislation to make small Bitcoin transactions tax-free for consumers and companies alike. The Senate Bill 2021 proposes allowing up to $20,000 in yearly Bitcoin transactions — or $5,000 monthly — without triggering state tax liability. The proposed solution would also minimize tax expenses for small crypto exchanges and allow the public to remain compliant with crypto law, including those of self-certification, record-keeping, and valuation. Rhode Island lawmakers say they would review the policy in 1 year to gauge its impact on the economy and state finances. Nevertheless, the bill reflects the state’s effort to normalize digital currencies in daily payments, limiting the exemption to small transactions rather than investment trades.

But When It Moves, It Moves the Hardest",https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-is-always-last-to-move-but-when-it-moves-it-moves-the-hardest/,"Crypto proponent Captain Mallard (@Brett_Crypto_X) recently pointed to a recurring pattern in XRP’s market behavior. XRP has often moved later than the rest of the market, particularly compared to Bitcoin, which typically leads major trends. This delay has been a consistent feature across multiple cycles. While Bitcoin frequently sets the direction early, XRP tends to consolidate for longer periods . Price action remains compressed while momentum builds beneath the surface. When XRP finally reacts, the move is usually decisive. This historical behavior is why analysts and traders are now watching XRP closely as market conditions continue to align for its next phase of momentum. XRP is always last to move. But when it moves… it moves the hardest. Never forget. — Captain mallard (@Brett_Crypto_X) January 22, 2026 Historical Patterns of Delayed Movement XRP’s historical behavior shows periods of consolidation followed by notable price activity. Unlike Bitcoin, which often reacts quickly to market developments, XRP has a slower buildup. This delay allows underlying trends to strengthen before larger moves occur. Investors interpret this as a sign that when XRP breaks out, the resulting gains can be substantial. Observers cite past cycles where the digital asset lagged initially but eventually surpassed expectations in performance. Factors that Could Aid XRP’s Breakout Several factors contribute to the growing bullish sentiment around XRP. Regulatory clarity has improved, giving institutional investors more confidence in the token. Clearer guidelines reduce uncertainty, encouraging larger financial players to engage with XRP. This shift is likely to increase trading volume and market participation, providing a foundation for stronger price action. Institutional interest is also rising through ETF developments. Momentum in U.S.-based spot XRP ETFs has drawn attention from major investors. These funds facilitate access to XRP for traditional financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals. As a result, market liquidity improves, and demand pressure can contribute to upward movement. Analysts note that ETF availability often coincides with periods of increased adoption and price appreciation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Global Adoption and Network Utility Global adoption of XRP continues to expand. Ripple’s payment solutions are integrated with financial institutions across multiple regions, allowing XRP to support faster cross-border transactions. These real-world applications enhance the token’s utility and long-term value proposition. As more banks and payment providers incorporate XRP into their operations, adoption reinforces market confidence and encourages investment. XRP’s pattern of delayed but strong movements positions it uniquely. When the token reacts, the impact tends to be significant. Combined with regulatory clarity, ETF momentum, and growing global adoption, XRP is positioned for meaningful market activity in the short and long term.

The weekly chart highlights a repetition of the previous bullrun’s pattern, with the only significant difference being the extended accumulation period. This longer phase of price stability sets the stage for higher potential targets . CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) drew attention to the setup. He noted that the next surge could take XRP to $11, with a final wave potentially reaching $70. This outlook is based on the similarity of the current structure to the prior cycle, adjusted for the longer accumulation period. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 Comparison to Previous Bullrun The chart suggests that XRP replicated the previous rally pattern after extended periods of consolidation. The first pattern led to the breakout in 2017, which pushed XRP to its all-time high. The asset has since surpassed that level, hitting a new peak price of $3.65 in July 2025. However, this new peak remains within the consolidation zone, suggesting it could serve as a base for the next climb. Historical resistance levels now act as support, providing a stable base for the next upward movement. The previous bull run saw a rapid ascent after accumulation. This suggests that the current structure could produce comparable growth once the market resumes momentum. By matching the prior cycle’s trajectory, the analyst sees a roadmap for XRP’s potential breakout and larger gains. XRP Key Price Zones The highlighted zones on the chart indicate critical support and resistance levels. The first zone represents historical consolidation, which preceded the previous price surge. The second zone, closer to current levels, marks the area where price has compressed before preparing for the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These zones indicate where buying pressure can accumulate, setting up the conditions for a significant upward move. Once XRP breaks above its $3.65 peak, the chart suggests a clear path to $11, followed by a further advance to $70. Outlook for XRP XRP’s chart shows a clear growth pattern. By replicating the previous bullrun , the cryptocurrency is positioned for substantial upside. Support levels have held firmly, accumulation has occurred, and the next wave could drive the price to $11, with a subsequent move toward $70. CryptoBull’s prediction reinforces the expectation that XRP is entering a significant growth phase based on historical patterns and current price behavior.

ChatGPT Weighs In on Ripple’s Price,https://cryptopotato.com/how-will-xrp-trade-next-week-chatgpt-weighs-in-on-ripples-price/,"Ripple’s cross-border token, alongside most of the cryptocurrency market, began the new year with a bang, surging by double digits within the span of just days. More specifically, XRP went from under $1.90 to $2.40 by January 6 when the tide turned, and it quickly lost momentum. The subsequent geopolitical tension caused by US President Trump’s ambitions to take over Greenland led to a market-wide correction. XRP was not spared, and it now struggles at its 2026 starting point of around $1.90. Here’s a look, through the eyes of ChatGPT, at what’s next for the asset. Week Ahead: ChatGPT Edition As usual, the popular AI solution outlined three possible scenarios for the weeks ahead. The first one, which it categorized as the bearish case, envisioned a continuous but rather gradual price decline for XRP to as low as $1.70. That would be possible if the asset decisively breaks below the $1.90 support and drops further beneath the $1.80 zone, an area where buyers used to step in at least in the past few months. The probability for this additional 10% decline was around 30%-35%, ChatGPT said. In contrast, ChatGPT’s bullish scenario envisions a substantial uptick in the next up to seven days that can take XRP back toward its yearly highs of $2.30. Such a short-term relief rally would be possible if buyers manage to flip the $2.05-$2.10 zone into support with convincing volume. It noted that charting a 20% increase from the current levels would require “broader market strength rather than XRP-specific news.” However, this was ChatGPT’s most unlikely scenario for the week ahead, with probability chances of 20%-25%. Consolidation to Reign Following the latest wild swings in the cryptocurrency markets, the AI platform indicated that a prolonged period of consolidation is most likely to be anticipated for the week ahead. After all, it has been only three full weeks since the start of the new year, and XRP has already produced several double-digit moves. As such, it outlined a 40%-45% chance for a sideways chop scenario between $1.85 and $2.05 as the ongoing structure suggests “that neither bulls nor bears currently have full control.” “If broader market conditions remain mixed and Bitcoin trades sideways, XRP could remain rangebound for most of the week, frustrating traders expecting a decisive move. This type of price action would also allow indicators to reset before the next breakout attempt,” ChatGPT concluded. The post How Will XRP Trade Next Week?

Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their weakest week in nearly a year, with $1.33 billion in outflows. Selling peaked midweek, led by heavy redemptions from BlackRock’s IBIT. Ether ETFs also turned negative, shedding $611 million over the same period. The pullback marks the worst weekly showing since February 2025 and reflects a sharp reversal in investor sentiment after strong inflows the previous week. The outflows follow a period of optimism, when spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.42 billion in net inflows. Midweek Bitcoin ETF Outflows Surge as $709M Exits in Single Day Selling pressure peaked midweek. Wednesday alone saw $709 million exit Bitcoin ETFs, making it the heaviest outflow day of the week. Tuesday followed closely behind with $483 million in redemptions. Outflows eased toward the end of the week, with $32 million leaving on Thursday and $104 million on Friday. The magnitude of the withdrawals echoes the turbulence seen in late February 2025, when Bitcoin ETFs lost $2.61 billion in a single week during a sharp market downturn. That episode, often referred to by analysts as the “February Freeze,” coincided with Bitcoin’s drop from above $109,000 to below $80,000 and included a record $1.14 billion single-day outflow on Feb. 25. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by assets under management, posted outflows on all four trading days last week. Data from SoSoValue shows the fund experienced its heaviest redemptions on Tuesday and Wednesday, accounting for a significant share of the overall decline. 1/ US Spot Crypto ETF Weekly Flows (Jan 12-16, ET) • BTC ETFs: +$1.42B • ETH ETFs: +$479M • SOL ETFs: +$46.88M • XRP ETFs: +$56.83M Source: SoSoValue #CryptoETF #SoSoValue pic.twitter.com/Wi35m9jMLu — SoSoValue (@SoSoValueCrypto) January 19, 2026 IBIT currently holds about $69.75 billion in net assets, representing roughly 3.9% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. Despite the recent pullback, the broader picture for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains positive. Since their launch in January 2024, cumulative net inflows stand at $56.5 billion, with total net assets across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs reaching approximately $115.9 billion. Ethereum ETFs were not spared from the broader risk-off move. Spot Ether ETFs posted $611 million in net outflows for the week, reversing the prior week’s $479 million inflow streak. Wednesday was again the worst day, with $298 million redeemed, followed by $230 million on Tuesday. Total net assets for Ether ETFs now sit around $17.7 billion, with cumulative inflows of $12.3 billion since their July 2024 debut. Solana ETFs Defy Broader Sell-Off as Bitcoin, XRP Funds See Outflows Not all crypto-linked funds followed the same pattern. Spot Solana ETFs continued to attract capital, recording $9.6 million in net inflows over the week, extending a multi-week positive trend. Bitwise’s BSOL remained the category leader by assets. Spot XRP ETFs , meanwhile, saw mixed flows, ending the week with $40.6 million in net outflows after a sharp $53 million exit on Tuesday. The ETF drawdowns come amid signs of shifting market dynamics on-chain. According to a CryptoQuant report, Bitcoin holders have begun realizing net losses for the first time since October 2023. The firm noted the market has moved from a profit-taking phase into a loss-realization phase, with roughly 69,000 BTC in realized losses since Dec. 23, a pattern reminiscent of past transitions from bull to bear markets.

Senate crypto reforms, growing BIP-110 adoption, and rumors around GameStop’s BTC transfer have added noise, but price action suggests consolidation, not collapse. The $88K zone now stands as the key pivot for Bitcoin’s next directional move. Bitcoin Governance Debate Resurfaces as BIP-110 Node Adoption Expands Bitcoin’s long-running governance debate has resurfaced as adoption of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 110 (BIP-110) edges higher. Roughly 2.38% of Bitcoin nodes are now running BIP-110, a temporary soft fork designed to limit non-monetary data, or “spam,” embedded in transactions. The proposal restores restrictions on OP_RETURN data and output sizes that were loosened in recent Bitcoin Core updates. Facilitating Spam is incompatible with Bitcoin’s sound money mission via decentralization. Facilitating Spam makes it more expensive/cumbersome to use Bitcoin in a self sovereign manner than it otherwise would without Spam. Activate BIP-110 yesterday. Filters up. https://t.co/6czRByhKLb — ₿itcoin ₿ombadil (@BitcoinBombadil) January 24, 2026 The issue has divided the community. Critics argue that allowing excessive arbitrary data risks turning Bitcoin into a data-storage network, raising node costs and pushing out smaller, home-run operators, which could increase centralization. Supporters counter that usage should not be artificially limited and that existing spam filters are ineffective. While the debate may create short-term noise, it has little direct price impact. Over time, efforts like BIP-110 reinforce Bitcoin’s decentralization, strengthening its credibility as resilient, trust-minimized money. GameStop Moves 4,700 BTC to Coinbase Prime, Raising Sale Speculation GameStop has moved its entire Bitcoin holding, roughly 4,710 BTC worth over $420 million, to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation that a sale may be imminent. According to CryptoQuant , the company acquired its Bitcoin at an average price near $107,900, meaning a full exit at current levels around $90,800 would imply an unrealized loss of roughly $76 million. GameStop throws in the towel? Their on-chain wallets just moved all BTC holdings to Coinbase Prime, likely to sell. Between May 14–23, 2025, they bought 4,710 BTC at an avg. price of $107.9K, investing ~$504M. Now selling for around $90.8K, potentially realising approximately… pic.twitter.com/Bp7MwRVQ43 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 23, 2026 Large transfers to institutional trading platforms often precede selling, but the move alone does not confirm liquidation. GameStop has not issued any public statement, leaving markets to interpret the intent. The broader impact on Bitcoin appears limited. More than 190 publicly listed companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, underscoring continued institutional participation. Even if GameStop were to exit, it would represent an isolated corporate decision rather than a shift in overall institutional confidence. Short-term volatility is possible, but longer-term demand remains intact. Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Tests $88K Support as Breakout Pressure Builds Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC is trading near $88,600, entering a corrective phase after failing to hold the $97,300 swing high earlier this month. On the 4-hour chart, price has slipped back into a rising channel that guided the move from the $83,800 low. The rejection at channel resistance marked a momentum shift, reinforced by long upper wicks and a bearish engulfing candle that broke short-term support. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview BTC is now testing a key confluence zone between $88,000 and $87,300, which aligns with prior demand and the lower boundary of the ascending channel. Recent candles show smaller bodies with lower wicks, suggesting selling pressure is easing rather than accelerating. However, price remains below the 50-EMA and 100-EMA, while the 200-EMA near $91,200 continues to cap rebounds, keeping near-term bias cautious. RSI has rebounded from oversold levels near 30 and is stabilizing around 40–42, signaling balance but not strength. The structure resembles a descending flag within a broader uptrend. If $87,300 holds, a reclaim of $90,000 could open $92,400–$94,500. A clean break below risks $85,600. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade Setup: Buy $87,500–$88,000, target $94,000, stop below $85,500.

This movement has sent a clear signal: many investors are stepping back right now. ETF Flows And Who Is Selling Reports note that ETF flows are often on the radar as a quick read on investor mood, but the picture is not always simple. Large outflows can reflect institutional rebalancing or tactical moves by funds, not only mass retail selling. The US market had a four-day trading week because of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, which may have concentrated trades into fewer sessions and amplified the numbers. Still, losing more than a billion dollars in a few days will get attention. Market Mood And Metals The wider mood has soured. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered an Extreme Fear score of 25, and sentiment trackers have been flashing caution. Reports say Santiment believes retail traders are pulling back while attention drifts toward more traditional assets. Meanwhile, metals have been strong. Reports disclose that with gold trading near $5,000 and silver approaching $100, some market players feel Bitcoin has been left out of a rally that lifted metals, which has weighed on confidence in the crypto market. Source: Alternative.me Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has struggled to find a steady rhythm over the past week. Prices slipped below the $89,000 to $90,000 range as traders reacted to fresh geopolitical tension and renewed trade worries, before stabilizing as nerves eased. This was driven higher after some soft political indicators around tariff threats, only to substantiate the idea that markets rarely react to conflict but rather to changes in tone and expectations. Signals That Could Matter These movements illustrate how Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset rather than an asset shelter, falling in tandem with equities when unexpected financial shocks hit the globe, before rebounding when the fever subsides to gather fresh buyers.

The move lower reflects near-term macro caution and heavy ETF-related selling rather than a breakdown in network fundamentals. With Bitcoin hovering near $89,000 and risk sentiment mixed, ETH has shifted into a range-bound phase where price is lagging underlying activity. ETF Pressure Weighs on Price, Not Structure Short-term pressure has largely come from spot ETH ETF outflows, which exceeded $600 million between January 20–23, led in part by a single-day $250 million exit from BlackRock’s ETHA. This selling has cooled momentum and kept ETH capped below the $3,000 handle. However, the flow data points more toward rotation and profit-taking than institutional abandonment. On-chain tracking shows whales accumulating roughly $1 billion worth of ETH during the recent correction, while funding rates and open interest have reset from crowded long conditions. That combination suggests leverage is being flushed, not confidence. On-Chain Activity Tells a Different Story Beneath the price, Ethereum’s network activity remains strong. Daily active addresses have climbed toward 1.3 million, while transaction counts are holding between 1.9 million and 2.2 million per day. Validator behavior reinforces this trend: exit queues are near zero, entry queues are rebuilding, and staking participation continues to rise, tightening circulating supply. Low fees and improved efficiency post-upgrades are also driving sustained DeFi and app usage, reinforcing a “price weak, fundamentals firm” dynamic that has historically preceded larger trend moves. Ethereum Rises Despite U.S.-Iran Tensions On the geopolitical front, the tensions are rising between the U.S. and Iran as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warns it is “more ready than ever” amid U.S. warships moving toward the Middle East. The warning comes after Iran’s recent crackdown on protests, which left thousands dead, and Trump has set strict red lines for military action, including preventing mass executions and violence against civilians. Despite these geopolitical tensions, Ethereum (ETH) continues to rise. This shows that investors remain confident in Ethereum’s growth, likely supported by strong developments like the Ethereum Foundation prioritizing post-quantum security. Today marks an inflection in the Ethereum Foundation's long-term quantum strategy. We've formed a new Post Quantum (PQ) team, led by the brilliant Thomas Coratger ( @tcoratger ).

RSI remains subdued near 35–40, signaling caution but not capitulation. A reset toward support followed by a reclaim of $3,060 would reopen upside toward $3,190–$3,400, while a clean break below $2,800 would risk a deeper retracement toward $2,700.

The upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade and later Hegota phase focus on scalability, efficiency, and sustainability, building on blob infrastructure progress and accelerating Layer-2 adoption. With over 8.7 million new contracts deployed entering the year, analysts increasingly view 2026 as a potential breakout period if macro conditions stabilize.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/the-most-aggressive-xrp-rally-in-over-7-years-is-coming-heres-the-signal/,"XRP has entered a significant phase in its market cycle. The cryptocurrency has spent 400 days within a rectangular reaccumulation pattern, which is now showing signs of consolidation above key support levels. According to crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA), this extended period may precede one of XRP’s most aggressive rallies in nearly 8 years. Traders are closely monitoring the asset for a potential breakout, as it may target double-digit prices. Rectangular Reaccumulation Structure The chart shared by ChartNerd highlights a rectangular bull flag pattern . XRP has oscillated between clearly defined reaccumulation support and resistance levels. The rectangular range demonstrates consolidation following a strong initial move, referred to as the flagpole on the chart. The asset’s current price action remains above the lower boundary, validating the reaccumulation pattern. ChartNerd emphasizes the importance of maintaining support at this level to sustain the next upward trajectory. $XRP : This 400 day long rectangular reaccumulation phase might just lead up to the most aggressive rally XRP has seen in over 7/8 years. Defend reaccumulation support to activate this expansion journey https://t.co/3OwVmfYg7Z pic.twitter.com/Em7bDmkVh0 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 23, 2026 Breakout Target and Price Projection If XRP maintains its position above reaccumulation support, the rectangular bull flag structure suggests a double-digit breakout target . The chart marks a potential move toward $23.84. This level aligns with the technical measurement derived from the height of the flag pole projected from the upper boundary of the reaccumulation zone. Traders and investors may view a breach of the resistance line as confirmation of a significant upward expansion. Trading Range and Market Behavior XRP’s price has remained within the 400-day trading range , displaying low volatility compared to the preceding flagpole movement. This extended consolidation has allowed the market to absorb prior gains and establish a solid base. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The trading range also indicates disciplined accumulation. Within this range, the support and resistance levels act as reference points for potential entries and exits. ChartNerd notes that the validity of the rectangular bull flag is contingent on price holding above the reaccumulation support. What to Expect from XRP Historically, XRP has experienced periods of prolonged consolidation before substantial upward movements. The current rectangular pattern mirrors previous bull flag setups in the market, where momentum accelerates once consolidation resolves. The digital asset has been relatively quiet over the past year within this range. However, the structure suggests readiness for a decisive move. Market participants are closely observing XRP, as this consolidation pattern may signal one of the most significant rallies the cryptocurrency has experienced in years.

57452053,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=901788,1769329800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57452053.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Analysis: Analysts Identify 700% Expansion Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-analysis-analysts-identify-700-expansion-potential/,"New cryptocurrency projects are commonly analyzed in terms of the usefulness of valuation, adoption and development rates. Several experts believe that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can be valued at its build-stage level as opposed to its usage-stage level. That difference has made it possible to discuss proactively how far MUTM can go within the first two years of protocol activity. Presale Data and Protocol Design Mutuum Finance started its presale in early 2025 at $0.01 and has risen to $0.04 in Phase 7 following numerous stage changes. Up to now the presale has brought in $19.9M and inboarded over 18,900 holders who have already sold 830M tokens. Out of the 4B MUTM available, 1.82B or 45.5 percent are reserved as presale access. This has been gradual and not explosive. The protocol is concerned with decentralized lending. The project’s design promotes lending of P2C wherein the users provide funds to a liquidity pool and earn mtTokens that index the principal and APY. It also facilitates P2P borrowing through users at determined loan-to-value determination under liquidation logic to safeguard in times of volatility. Analysts monitoring new crypto and DeFi crypto industries note that this two-fold design provides Mutuum Finance with a useful borrowing platform instead of a story only design. V1 Launch and Security Check It is announced by the official X-account of the team that V1 protocol will go to the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 has collateral rules, liquidation and debt accounting logic and lender APY logic. To model the price, analysts define V1 as the price at which valuation will start to take into account use instead of planning. Mutuum Finance has an independent audit conducted by Halborn Security and a score of 90/100 token scan rating by CertiK. In the case of lending, this validation layer is a stipulation because of collateral and liquidation. Some analysts feel that in case the V1 rollout occurs on time and usage during the testnet with mainnet following, MUTM would reprice to the $0.10 to $0.15 range. This would amount to 150%-275% increase at the execution stage out of the present presale price of $0.04. Growth Catalysts mtTokens are one of the fundamental mechanisms of the protocol. Users providing assets are awarded mtTokens and APY. Those mtTokens will be deposited in the safety module to receive MUTM which will be bought on an open market and will be transferred back to stakers. Those purchases are financed by a part of the revenue generated in the process of borrowing. This buy-and-distribute model is emphasized by the analysts since it creates a buy demand on a basis of the lending volume rather than attention cycles. To encourage participation, Mutuum Finance operates a 24-hour leaderboard each day giving the best contributor $500 of MUTM. This enhances involvement in the later stages and expansion in distribution. Roadmap Milestones In addition to lending, the project will also launch an overcollateralized stablecoin where users can mint their collateral instead of selling their assets according to the official roadmap. The users of Stablecoin are longer term borrowers and according to analysts this enhances the revenue predictability of DeFi lenders. It is also expected to expand its layer-2 in order to charge fewer transaction fees and support throughput to users who do not desire to trade on Ethereum mainnet. In a long-term context, when the minting of stablecoins and the support of Layer-2 protocols increase the use of protocol-driven prices, a number of analysts draw up a third price between $0.25 to $0.32. Out of the presale price which is $0.04, this range reflects a 525-700% growth on a bullish valuation trajectory. According to the analysts, whale entries in terminal presale periods usually indicate belief that the prices will not be maintained at the build-phase levels when the use and revenues start to be realized. As the remaining supply gets tighter and the latter stage will see the price go up once more, more investors have entered the market in order to be positioned ahead of the V1 transition. Mutuum Finance has reached the development, security and participation point of development. As an investment to watch the type of crypto to invest in 2026-2027, analysts indicate that MUTM belongs to the category of early cheap crypto that are about to get first activated, instead of late-cycle assets already being priced to maturity.

The Nietzschean Penguin token, affectionately nicknamed PENGUIN by its community, saw its price and market capitalization skyrocket by roughly 564% in a single 24‑hour trading session, according to on‑chain data. The White House uploaded a photo on X of Trump and the bird walking together in the snow, with the words, “Embrace the penguin,” which rapidly spread across social media. The AI‑generated image showed Trump with a penguin holding an American flag, and Greenland’s flag planted in the snow behind them. Later that day, the Department of Defense’s rapid response page also shared its own version of the image, saying, “Be a warrior, embrace the penguin.” Alon says PENGUIN’s surge is a statement that onchain trading never died Before the White House post, the cryptocurrency had a market cap of around $387,000, but within 24 hours, it saw $244 million in trading volume, according to SolanaFloor. According to DEXScreener, the token is currently worth about $0.13 , giving it a market capitalization of roughly $136 million. Speaking on the meme coin performance, Alon Cohen, the co-founder of meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, commented , “The early success of PENGUIN is proof that onchain trading was never dead, just a sleeping giant waiting for the right moment. Psychological barriers are only just beginning to get broken. Tons of opportunities ahead.” The PENGUIN’s token gains come at a time of broader downturn in the meme coin market. Just last year, some 11.6 million crypto tokens collapsed, mostly due to the flood of meme coins launched by platforms such as Pump.fun. However, at the start of this year, the meme coin market cap briefly surged by 23%, rising from approximately $38 billion in December 2025 to over $47 billion, per CoinMarketCap. Santiment data at the time showed that increased social media mentions of the assets matched meme coins’ short-term surge. Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at trading firm Kronos Research, had also commented, “Meme coins typically lead when risk appetite returns. The rebound in the Fear and Greed Index from extreme fear toward neutral reinforces this shift.” At the time of writing, meme coins’ total market value had fallen to around $39 billion, as crypto markets continued to fluctuate between brief surges and dips. Some X users mocked the White House post The White House’s post taps into the viral “Nihilist Penguin” meme, which first appeared in a 2007 Werner Herzog documentary showing an Emperor penguin leaving its colony to wander toward the Antarctic mountains. Aside from the gains in the Penguin meme coin, it also elicited many social media reactions. Some ridiculed the White House’s post, noting that penguins are found almost entirely in the southern hemisphere, and not in Greenland . Former Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney also zeroed in on the factual error, saying it echoed Trump’s earlier moment of confusion over Greenland and Iceland. He wrote, “In the same week as his humiliating climb down on Greenland, he confused Iceland and Greenland multiple times, and now his staff is confusing Antarctica with Greenland. (penguins inhabit the former, not the latter.)” On Saturday, however, the White House replied to his criticism, saying, “The penguin does not concern himself with the opinions of those who cannot comprehend.” At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump’s revived interest in acquiring Greenland also took center stage among international leaders.

Key Takeaways: BIP-110 has gained early traction, with 583 Bitcoin nodes signaling support for a temporary cap on transaction data. The proposal seeks to reverse recent Bitcoin Core changes that removed OP_RETURN limits. Supporters argue stricter data limits are needed to curb spam and preserve node decentralization. Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 110 (BIP-110) is currently signaling support from 583 nodes, or about 2.38% of the network, according to data from The Bitcoin Portal . Out of roughly 24,481 reachable nodes, those backing the proposal are primarily running Bitcoin Knots , an alternative node implementation often favored by operators critical of recent changes to Bitcoin Core. BIP-110 Proposes One-Year Cap on Bitcoin Transaction Data BIP-110 proposes a temporary soft fork that would reintroduce strict limits on transaction data at the consensus level. Specifically, it caps transaction output sizes at 34 bytes and restricts OP_RETURN data, a script used to embed arbitrary information into transactions, to 83 bytes. The soft fork is designed to last for one year, after which the limits could be extended, modified or allowed to expire. The proposal emerged in response to changes introduced in Bitcoin Core version 30, released in October 2025. That update removed the long-standing 83-byte limit on OP_RETURN data following a pull request first introduced earlier in the year. The move was controversial and met with widespread criticism from parts of the Bitcoin community, which argued the change was made without sufficient consensus. OP_RETURN has long been a flashpoint in Bitcoin governance debates . While it enables use cases such as timestamping and metadata anchoring, critics say uncapped data fields encourage blockchain spam and non-financial use of block space. Larger data payloads increase storage and bandwidth requirements for nodes, raising concerns that running a full node could become cost-prohibitive for everyday users. BIP-110 RC3 pic.twitter.com/5KeoTCyhWV — Justin (@innerhat) January 21, 2026 Critics of the Core update argue that higher hardware demands risk undermining one of Bitcoin’s defining features, which is the ability for individuals to verify the network using consumer-grade hardware. As node operation becomes more expensive, they warn, the network could drift toward greater centralization. Bitcoin educator Matthew Kratter compared unchecked data usage to a parasitic threat. He has argued that excessive spam could overwhelm the network’s underlying structure, weakening Bitcoin’s resilience over time. BIP-110 Backers Frame Proposal as Temporary Fix Supporters of BIP-110 see the proposal as a corrective measure rather than a permanent policy shift. By making the soft fork explicitly temporary, its authors aim to give the network time to assess the impact of restored limits without locking Bitcoin into a long-term rule change. Others remain unconvinced. Bitcoin Core contributor Jameson Lopp has defended the removal of OP_RETURN limits, arguing that artificial caps do little to deter spam and may instead push unwanted activity into other parts of the protocol.

According to reports, the hacker group is now deploying the AI-generated PowerShell malware, using it to target developers and engineers in the blockchain industry. The North Korean hacker group is believed to have been in operation since at least 2014 and is associated with APT37 and Kimusky activity clusters. The group has targeted organizations spread across South Korea, Ukraine, Russia, and several other European countries. According to the threat sample analyzed by CheckPoint researchers, the North Korean group’s latest campaign is targeted towards the Asian Pacific region. North Korean Konni group deploys AI-generated malware In the report, the researchers claimed that the malware was submitted by users who found it in Japan, India, and Australia. The attack begins with the victim receiving a Discord link that delivers a ZIP archive containing a PDF lure and a malicious LNK shortcut file. The LNK runs an embedded PowerShell loader that extracts a DOCX document and a CAB archive that contains a PowerShell backdoor, two batch files, and a UAC bypass executable. After the shortcut file is launched, the DOCX opens and executes a batch file included in the cabinet file. The lure DOCX document shows that the hacker wants to compromise the development environment, which could provide them with access to sensitive assets, including infrastructure, API credentials, wallet access, and finally digital asset holdings. The first batch file creates a staging directory for the backdoor and the second batch file. In addition, it also creates an hourly scheduled task that mimics the startup task of OneDrive. The task reads an XOR-encrypted PowerShell script from disk and decrypts it for in-memory execution. After completing all these steps, it then deletes itself to wipe all the signs of an infection. The PowerShell backdoor heavily masks its origin using arithmetic-based string encoding, runtime string reconstruction, and the execution of the final logic using “Invoked-Expression.” According to the researchers, the PowerShell malware indicates the presence of an AI-assisted development rather than traditionally authored malware. The evidence showing this includes the clear and structured documentation at the top of the script, which is very unusual for malware development. In addition, it has a clean and modular layout, and the presence of a “# hackers . CheckPoint researchers give details on the malware The researchers explained that the phrasing also shows that the model instructs a human user on how to customize the placeholder value. They said such comments are commonly seen in AI-generated scripts and tutorials. Before execution, the malware performs a hardware, software, and user activity check to ensure that it is not running in analysis environments. Once that is determined, it then generates a unique host ID. After that, it follows a specified path of action. Once the backdoor is fully activated and running on the infected device, the malware contacts the command-and-control (C2) server periodically to send host metadata and polls the server at random intervals. If the C2 contains a PowerShell code, it turns into a script block and carries out its activities using background jobs. CheckPoint noted that these attacks can be attributed to the North Korean Konni threat actor based on the earlier launcher format and lure name. In addition, the researchers claimed that aside from having the same script name overlap, there are other common elements in the execution chain structure with earlier attacks. The researchers have also published indicators of compromise associated with this recent campaign to help defenders recognize when they have been attacked by the North Korean Konni campaign so they can protect their assets.

In his statement, SMQKE asserted that DTCC is partnered with R3 and emphasized that R3’s infrastructure uses XRP, noting that this connection has been documented multiple times. The claim was presented as a response to ongoing skepticism around XRP’s involvement in large-scale financial market infrastructure. Rather than relying on opinion, the post focused on documentary evidence. The images attached to the tweet were positioned as historical and institutional references that, taken together, outline how XRP has been referenced within R3-related settlement frameworks and how DTCC has worked with R3 in distributed ledger initiatives. DTCC IS PARTNERED WITH R3 WHICH USES XRP Documented 3x for the skeptics. https://t.co/hoUQocViJU pic.twitter.com/gndfoQDxoT — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 23, 2026 DTCC’s Engagement With R3 DTCC is a central pillar of global financial market infrastructure, responsible for clearing, settlement, custody, and information services across multiple asset classes. Over the past several years, DTCC has publicly explored distributed ledger technology as part of efforts to modernize post-trade processes. One of its most notable collaborations in this area has been with R3, the firm behind the Corda distributed ledger platform. The material shared by SMQKE points to documentation indicating DTCC’s participation in projects built on R3’s Corda technology. These initiatives were designed to improve efficiency, transparency, and resilience in clearing and settlement workflows. The tweet does not emphasize that DTCC directly uses XRP in its core operations, but that DTCC’s chosen DLT partner, R3, has developed solutions that explicitly reference XRP. R3, Corda, and XRP References Banks and financial institutions use R3’s Corda platform for permissioned settlement applications. According to the documents highlighted in SMQKE’s post, XRP has been identified within certain R3-related settlement contexts, including discussions around cross-border payments and interoperability. One of the attached excerpts references XRP as a digital asset supported within settlement solutions connected to Corda, particularly in payment obligations and global transfers. SMQKE underscored that these references are not isolated. By stating that the link has been “documented 3x,” the researcher suggested a pattern across multiple sources rather than a single, ambiguous mention. The post is intended to counter claims that XRP has no documented relevance within institutional-grade financial infrastructure connected to major market entities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications Highlighted by the Researcher The core message of SMQKE’s tweet is evidentiary rather than predictive. By compiling and resurfacing these documents, the researcher aimed to demonstrate that XRP has appeared within serious, institutional discussions tied to R3’s technology and, by extension, to organizations such as DTCC that have partnered with R3. The post stops short of claiming current production use by DTCC but stresses that dismissing XRP as entirely absent from this ecosystem overlooks documented material. In presenting these attachments, SMQKE presents the issue as one of record rather than belief, arguing that the documented links are sufficient to challenge persistent skepticism in XRP’s relevance in enterprise and financial market infrastructure.

Once primarily associated with cryptocurrencies, this distributed ledger technology is proving its versatility across multiple industries, from finance and logistics to healthcare and entertainment. As businesses and governments explore blockchain’s potential, the emphasis has shifted from abstract promise to measurable impact. Finance and Transparent Payments One of blockchain’s most established real-world uses is in financial services. Banks and payment providers are leveraging blockchain to facilitate faster and more secure transactions. Cross-border payments, which traditionally take days and incur high fees, can now be completed in near real-time thanks to blockchain-based networks. Smart contracts—self-executing agreements with code enforcing the terms—are increasingly deployed in lending, insurance, and trade finance. These contracts reduce the need for intermediaries and minimize human error, offering businesses more efficient ways to conduct transactions. Institutions are also experimenting with tokenized assets, converting equities, bonds, and other financial instruments into blockchain-based tokens. This approach enhances liquidity, simplifies settlement, and opens access to new investor bases that were previously difficult to reach. Supply Chain Transparency Blockchain is proving invaluable in supply chain management. By recording every step of a product’s journey on an immutable ledger, companies can verify authenticity, track inventory, and detect fraud. For example, food suppliers can monitor produce from farm to supermarket, ensuring freshness and safety. Luxury brands are also employing blockchain to authenticate high-end goods, combating counterfeiting and preserving brand value. The transparency offered by blockchain not only benefits companies but also reassures consumers, who can now trace the origin of their products in real time. Healthcare Innovations The healthcare sector is exploring blockchain for secure patient data management. Patient records stored on a blockchain can be shared across hospitals and clinics with proper permissions, enhancing care coordination while safeguarding privacy. Drug supply chains are also being monitored on blockchains to prevent counterfeit medications from entering the market. In clinical trials, blockchain helps verify the integrity of collected data, ensuring results are reliable and tamper-proof. These applications illustrate how blockchain is contributing to patient safety and operational efficiency. Provably Fair Gambling Even the gambling industry has found a unique niche for blockchain. Provably fair gambling platforms use blockchain to verify that game outcomes are random and unmanipulated. Players can audit results themselves, offering transparency that traditional online casinos cannot guarantee. While this is a smaller segment of blockchain adoption, it exemplifies how trustless systems can replace intermediaries and enhance credibility in sectors where fairness is paramount. Today, Provably Fair algorithms are not available in all online pokies. Therefore, resources such as Auspokies do a massive amount of work to check gambling operators for fairness across a whole list of parameters. And while the technology is developing, such reviewers are a reliable support for active players. Digital Identity and Security Digital identity solutions are another emerging application of blockchain. Users can maintain control over their personal data without relying on centralized authorities. By using blockchain, individuals can prove their identity, access services, and sign documents securely. This reduces the risk of identity theft and data breaches, which are increasingly common in traditional centralized systems. Governments are exploring blockchain-based identity programs, while corporations are adopting similar solutions to verify customers and employees efficiently. Real Estate and Asset Tokenization Blockchain is transforming the real estate industry through tokenization. Instead of dealing with bulky paperwork and slow transactions, property ownership can be represented as blockchain tokens. This allows fractional ownership, making it easier for smaller investors to enter real estate markets. Transactions become faster, cheaper, and more transparent, reducing reliance on traditional intermediaries like notaries and brokers. Similar approaches are being used to tokenize other tangible assets, including art, collectibles, and vehicles, creating new liquidity opportunities for markets that were previously illiquid. The Future Blockchain’s shift from experimental technology to practical solution is gaining momentum. While cryptocurrencies still dominate headlines, enterprise and consumer applications are increasingly proving the technology’s worth in tangible ways. Supply chain transparency, secure payments, digital identity, tokenized assets, and even provably fair gambling show that blockchain is far more than hype—it is a tool shaping real-world processes. As more industries adopt blockchain, the benefits of efficiency, security, and trust are likely to become standard expectations rather than futuristic promises.",Crypto News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-25 09:08:01

This change in dynamics comes as BTC and the broader crypto market are believed to be on the brink of a bear cycle. According to a weekly CryptoQuant report , Bitcoin holders have not seen this shift since October 2023. The negative turn in profit dynamics has dominated the past 30 days. Bitcoin Sees Change in Profit Dynamics CryptoQuant said Bitcoin holders have realized losses accumulating to 69,000 BTC since December 23. This is the first time network participants have realized net losses in a 30-day period since October 2023. The Bitcoin network has witnessed a decline in realized profits since March 2024. The plunge came with prices losing momentum as the bull phase came to an end. Analysts found similarities between the current market dynamic and the 2021-2022 bull cycle. After realized net profits peaked in January 2021, they began to decline. February and November 2021 saw a series of lower local tops, followed by net losses. Notably, BTC holders realized lower net profits at higher prices at the time. Following a similar trend, realized net profits peaked in January 2024. Since then, there have been a series of lower peaks in December 2024, July, and October 2025. Currently, the profit margin has turned negative, and holders are realizing net losses. Early-stage Bear Market Signs Bitcoin net realized profits have fallen from 4.4 million BTC in October 2025 to 2.5 million BTC currently, a level not seen since March 2024. Analysts said this level is similar to that seen in March 2022, during the early stages of the last bear market. Interestingly, current net realized losses are also following patterns similar to trends seen in March 2022. At the time, the bear market was already underway, and bitcoin’s price had lost its momentum. Considering investor sentiment and speculation surrounding the market, this dynamic confirms that the bear market has indeed begun . Analysts have confirmed that most on-chain metrics and profit dynamics are consistent with early-stage bear market conditions. Last week, CryptoPotato reported that bitcoin’s demand conditions had improved; however, the improvement did not trigger any significant changes. There are no remarkable shifts in demand from exchange-traded funds or spot indicators. Instead, demand has contracted over the past 30 days.

The company, which recently earned a provisional license, released a statement halting the service after five months of launching it. The move comes as Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) tightens oversight of the crypto industry under its Accelerated Regulatory Incubation Program (ARIP). ARIP is a sandbox program designed to help crypto exchanges in the country transition from a largely informal market into a regulated industry. This way, the exchanges are integrated into Nigeria’s capital markets framework. Nigeria faces challenges in its move to regulate the crypto industry According to its statement, Quidax claimed that the decision to halt its peer-to-peer (P2P) services was a result of user preference. Quidax informed users via email that its P2P marketplace would be shut down, removing ads, merchant chats, and other services. The exchange claimed that while it is shutting down its P2P marketplace and other services, products, including instant swaps and order book trading, would continue to operate without issues. P2P trading has long been one of the most controversial segments of the crypto economy of Nigeria. It enables users to buy and sell digital assets directly with one another, while settling transactions through bank transfers offline. The structure has made P2P a liquidity channel, but also another headache for regulators. Analysts and experts have noted that regulating the marketplace will show the practical limits of what regulators are currently willing/able to do when it comes to the crypto industry. While it remains very active, there have been a lot of issues concerning the service and other vices being carried out by users acting as merchants on several exchanges. In 2024, the SEC raised concerns about P2P crypto markets. The regulator highlighted several issues, including opaque transaction flows, difficulties in monitoring off-platform settlements, and the risks of exchange rate manipulation on platforms. The Nigerian regulator also noted the issue of foreign P2P platforms operating in legal grey areas in the country. Platform licensing slows as regulators move to determine readiness According to reports, Quidax was supposed to correct all the issues and risks with its P2P service. Rather than allow P2P activity spill into informal channels, the exchange was supposed to create an internal structure that would put the service within a controlled and regulated environment. Users who sign up to become merchants would have to complete a full verification process, which includes a level 3 know-your-customer verification, two-factor authentication, and a minimum participation history. The applications were reviewed by Quidax, and approved merchants were awarded special badges. Despite the slight success of the program and the safeguards put in place, the feature has now been discontinued, suggesting that the Nigerian regulator might even be looking into stricter models to control P2P in the future. The timing of Quidax’s announcement came at a time when things related to licensing have slowed. The exchange and fellow competitor Busha were expected to transition into full crypto licenses by August 2025, but things have since stalled, with the Nigerian regulator pausing approvals to determine its readiness. Meanwhile, the crypto regulation in Nigeria is becoming more demanding. Earlier this year, the SEC raised minimum capital requirements for crypto platforms, slamming a N2 billion minimum balance on the platforms. Under the Investment and Securities Act (2025), digital assets are now classified as securities, bringing crypto activities under capital markets regulation. In addition, the Nigerian government recently sought to include the crypto population in its new tax regime. The Nigerian government recently ordered crypto platforms to mandate their users to include their tax identification number in their accounts. While P2P platforms have not been provided with a standalone regulation, they are now treated as a Digital Assets Intermediary and are expected to maintain a minimum capital of N500 million. In a case where crypto services mix with P2P services, then the burdens are expected to increase. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Key Takeaways: GameStop moved its entire 4,710 BTC stash to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation of a potential exit from its Bitcoin treasury. If sold near current prices, the company would realize an estimated $75M–$85M loss on its Bitcoin holdings. The transfer comes as corporate crypto treasury strategies face pressure amid falling digital asset prices. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant flagged the move on Friday after identifying a wallet labeled as belonging to GameStop that sent all 4,710 BTC , worth roughly $420 million at current prices, to Coinbase’s institutional trading platform. “GameStop throws in the towel?” CryptoQuant asked in a post on X, suggesting the transfer was “likely to sell.” GameStop Faces Potential $75M–$85M Loss on Bitcoin Bet if Sold If liquidated near recent market prices, the sale would lock in a sizable loss. CryptoQuant estimates GameStop accumulated its Bitcoin in May at an average price of around $107,900 per coin, implying unrealized losses of roughly $75 million to $85 million, depending on execution price. GameStop announced its Bitcoin purchase earlier this year after CEO Ryan Cohen met with Strategy chairman Michael Saylor in February to discuss corporate crypto treasury models. At the time, the move aligned the meme-stock retailer with a growing group of public companies experimenting with digital assets as balance-sheet holdings. GameStop throws in the towel? Their on-chain wallets just moved all BTC holdings to Coinbase Prime, likely to sell. Between May 14–23, 2025, they bought 4,710 BTC at an avg. price of $107.9K, investing ~$504M. Now selling for around $90.8K, potentially realising approximately… pic.twitter.com/Bp7MwRVQ43 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 23, 2026 Since the transfer, GameStop has not publicly confirmed whether it has sold or intends to sell the Bitcoin. While moving funds to Coinbase Prime often precedes a sale, given the platform’s deep liquidity and execution tools, such transfers do not always signal imminent liquidation. Coinbase Prime also provides custody and wallet management services through its regulated trust business, leaving open the possibility of an internal restructuring. The timing has fueled debate. Corporate Bitcoin treasuries surged in popularity throughout 2024 and early 2025, but the model has faced growing scrutiny as crypto prices pulled back sharply in recent months. Several firms that adopted similar strategies are now sitting on steep paper losses, prompting some to trim holdings to shore up balance sheets. Ethereum-focused ETHZilla, for example, recently disclosed selling part of its Ether reserves to reduce debt. Cohen Stock Purchase Lifts GameStop Shares as Bitcoin Questions Swirl The transfer also coincides with renewed activity from Cohen himself. A regulatory filing this week revealed the CEO purchased an additional 500,000 GameStop shares worth more than $10 million, helping push GME shares up over 3% on Thursday. The stock move added another layer of intrigue, with some investors viewing the buy as a vote of confidence amid uncertainty around the company’s crypto exposure. Despite the recent pressure, corporate crypto treasuries remain embedded in traditional markets. Earlier this month, MSCI opted not to remove digital asset treasury companies from its indexes, a decision that spared firms like Strategy from potential billions in passive outflows.

Amid rising speculations, an on-chain analysis has recently been put out, which provides an answer to the question. Related Reading: Bitcoin Metric Suggests Miners Are In Recovery Mode — Price To Follow? Open Interest Across Exchanges Falls To $17 Billion In their latest QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, analytics platform Arab Chain reveals that there has been a fall in active Ethereum derivatives contracts across major exchanges, as indicated by data from the Ethereum: Open Interest-All Exchanges, All Symbol metric. Typically, rising Open Interest (OI) across exchanges indicates that more traders are entering leveraged positions. On the other hand, falling OI reflects more exits of leveraged positions, and by extension, reduced aversion to risk. In the Quicktake post, Arab Chain highlights that open interest across exchanges has dipped to about $16.9 billion, marking the lowest level reached since mid-December last year. This, in turn, reflects an overall reduction in risk appetite across the Ethereum derivatives market. Because there is less speculative activity, there are also reduced risks of liquidations. Hence, the Ethereum price stands a higher chance of consolidating. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean? What’s Happening On Binance? While exchanges in general are recording significant pull-outs from the derivatives market, Binance has shown an outlier performance. Arab Chain highlights that the world’s largest exchange by trading volume has instead recorded about $7.5 billion in Open Interest. Interestingly, this reading slightly exceeds the December average range of $6.8–$7.4 billion. The divergence between the Open Interest values across all exchanges and that of Binance suggests that, while market participants are reducing their risk exposure, there is still liquidity in the derivatives market. Rather than a blatant exit, it has been repositioned toward the deeper and more liquid venue. Arab Chain also explains that this behavior indicates a change in market operations from a higher-risk trading environment to one more price and risk efficient. In conclusion, the large traders are yet to make their exits but are merely reducing their exposure, while holding high-quality positions on Binance. In addition, Ethereum’s proximity to the $3,000 price — especially as OI declines — shows that the market has been absorbing the deleveraging events while showing little selling pressure. Ultimately, Binance’s OI retaining levels above December’s support the idea that the market still has strong derivatives backing. Hence, the broader picture remains bullish. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,958, reflecting a 0.33% growth since the past day, according to CoinMarketCap data.

SEC Vs Gemini In January 2023, the SEC instituted one of the most controversial crypto-related lawsuits against Gemini Trust Company and its partner, Genesis Global Capital LLC, accusing both parties of illegally offering and selling unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn lending program, a financial product that operated between 2021 and 2022, which allowed customers to lend crypto for interest at 7.4% per annum. Following the FTX crash in 2022, Genesis, which had a significant financial exposure to the now-defunct crypto exchange, halted withdrawals on the Gemini Earn Program, effectively locking up $940 million in investor assets. Since then, a series of events has unfolded, including Genesis entering bankruptcy proceedings, and through that process, all Earn investors ultimately recovered 100 percent of their crypto assets in kind. In addition, Gemini has settled related matters with state and federal regulators, paying over $50 million in civil fines. In the joint stipulation filed this week, the SEC noted that its decision to seek dismissal “in the exercise of its discretion” took into account the full investor recovery and those regulatory settlements. The dismissal is with prejudice, preventing the SEC from re-filing the same claims, and represents the formal end of one of the most high-profile enforcement actions in the US crypto industry. US Crypto Regulatory Turnaround The dismissal of the Gemini case comes amid a broader recalibration of the US crypto regulatory approach under the Donald Trump administration. Several high-profile SEC actions against major platforms, involving Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, have been dropped or paused, reflecting a shift from a forceful regulatory approach seen under the former chairman, Gary Gensler. At the same time, Congress and the White House continue to pursue pro-crypto legislative and policy initiatives. In July 2025, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, a landmark bill establishing a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins, aimed at boosting consumer protection and supporting broader adoption of digital assets. Alongside the GENIUS Act, the highly anticipated Clarity Act , passed by the US House, aims to delineate regulatory responsibilities between agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) based on how digital assets function. The US Senate Agriculture Committee is set to observe a markup session of the bill on January 27, indicating steady progress despite recent concerning events, including public outrage by Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong and the Banking Committee’s continued postponement of its own hearing session.",SEC|CFTC|CLARITY Act|Donald Trump|gemini|Genesis|GENIUS Act|Joint Stipulation,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 10:00:50

In his commentary, the analyst argues that XRP has broken out of what he describes as the largest triangular consolidation pattern in its history, spanning more than six years. Despite ongoing skepticism in parts of the market, XForceGlobal maintains that the technical structure now reflects a confirmed macro breakout rather than a temporary deviation. According to the analyst, the persistence of “fakeout” claims does not align with the broader trend visible on higher timeframes. He clarified that his outlook is not rooted in a permanent bullish or bearish bias, but instead in an effort to follow prevailing trends and identify large-scale breakout formations. This setup positions the analysis as process-driven rather than sentiment-driven, with a focus on market structure rather than short-term price reactions. $XRP Breaking out of the largest 6+ year triangle in history, and people are still calling it a fakeout. I’m not a permabull or permabear on #XRP , but I do like to follow trends and play macro breakout patterns. https://t.co/mDKX3rcpzY pic.twitter.com/92vh6sdxXe — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) January 23, 2026 Risk Management Over Fixed Price Targets Beyond the breakout narrative, XForceGlobal placed strong emphasis on risk management and adaptability. He cautioned against overreliance on price targets, including those he has previously shared, noting that market conditions evolve continuously as new data emerges. In his view, traders should reassess assumptions daily and weekly rather than becoming anchored to static projections. The analyst explained that this approach has directly influenced his own trading decisions. He disclosed that he has already realized partial gains by taking profits into strength, selling approximately half of his position while continuing to build exposure earlier in the trend. This strategy, he suggested, allows for participation in further upside while reducing downside risk if conditions change. XForceGlobal also stressed the importance of progressing “level by level,” urging market participants to focus on measured moves reflected in the chart rather than ambitious end-point valuations. The attached visuals outline potential wave structures and extension zones, but the analyst made clear that these are tools for navigation, not guarantees of outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trend Structure and Elliott Wave Framework Central to XForceGlobal’s analysis is the use of Elliott Wave Theory to interpret XRP’s market structure . He argued that wave analysis can help traders remain objective and avoid emotional extremes often promoted by permanently bullish or bearish pundits. By focusing on trend alignment and structural confirmation, he believes market participants can better respond to shifts in momentum without ideological attachment. Importantly, the analyst stated that he would not hesitate to adopt a bearish stance if the trend deteriorates. He emphasized that maintaining credibility requires acknowledging when conditions turn unfavorable. However, he concluded that current data does not support such a shift, as the prevailing structure continues to favor the established breakout trend. Overall, XForceGlobal’s commentary presents a technically grounded perspective that combines long-term chart analysis with disciplined risk management. Rather than promoting certainty, the analysis highlights flexibility, trend adherence, and the evaluation of market structure as XRP progresses through its current phase.

57453682,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27862,1769336304,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,"Ethereum’s Record Throughput, Low Fee Paradox — Implications for Institutions and the EVM Ecosystem",https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/ethereums-record-throughput-low-fee-paradox-implications-for-institutions-and-the-evm-ecosystem/,"Ethereum processed just over 2.88 million transactions in a single day last Friday — the highest daily total in its history. What made this moment particularly noteworthy was that it occurred in the context of unusually low average transaction fees. At first glance, that seems paradoxical. Activity spikes on Ethereum have historically coincided with congestion, fee spikes and, in some quarters , calls for the network’s imminent demise . This cycle looks different. Usage is increasing, fees remain subdued and participation in staking continues to deepen. For many observers, this is a sign that Ethereum’s long-running technical roadmap — particularly its emphasis on Layer-2 scaling — is beginning to deliver. It also raises more fundamental questions about the evolving role of Ethereum’s base layer and the implications for both institutional adoption and the broader EVM ecosystem. Ethereum’s Base Layer Is Narrowing — and Clarifying The current reality appears to reflect deliberate architectural changes that have been years in the making. Rather than serving as the execution venue for every transaction, Ethereum is increasingly assuming the role of a neutral settlement and coordination layer, with the bulk of execution activity migrating to L2s. From an infrastructural and institutional perspective, this development is meaningful. Ethereum is beginning to behave less like a monolithic network constrained by on-chain execution limits, and more like a modular system composed of specialised layers. This mirrors traditional financial infrastructure, where settlement rails prioritise robustness and reliability, while innovation occurs at the edges. For institutions, that distinction matters. Settlement layers are valued not for flexibility or novelty, but for predictability, neutrality and clearly defined operating assumptions. While large-scale production use of Ethereum remains limited among institutions, many emerging use cases — including early experiments in areas such as tokenised securities — rely heavily on trust in the base layer as a shared, verifiable source of truth. In practice, narrowing the scope of the base layer makes Ethereum easier for institutions to assess, concentrating security and finality at the core while pushing execution complexity and user-facing risk to layers designed to absorb it. Rethinking the Fee Narrative This architectural shift has direct implications for how network activity and fees should be interpreted. Historically, rising fees were treated as a proxy for demand and Ethereum’s economic value, with congestion interpreted as evidence that the network was being “used,” even when that usage came at the price of degraded performance. Smooth operation under heavy load, particularly while fees remain low, arguably tells a more important story, pointing to growing operational maturity rather than declining demand. For institutions, this distinction matters. Reliability, predictability and well-understood behaviour under stress tend to matter far more than fee volatility or scarcity-driven narratives. Infrastructure that behaves consistently under load is easier to integrate into regulated and risk-managed environments. Raising the Stakes The recent all-time high in staking reinforces this interpretation. More than 36 million ETH — close to 30% of the circulating supply — is now staked , representing roughly $120 billion secured at the protocol level. A substantial share of this stake is operated via exchanges, professional validators and liquid staking protocols that primarily serve institutions. Validator queue dynamics provide further context. Exit queues have effectively fallen to zero, while entry queues remain long, a pattern more consistent with steady, disciplined participation than speculative inflows or panic-driven exits. Institutions rarely commit capital to long-term staking without confidence in governance stability, operational continuity and clearly defined exit conditions. While higher staking participation does reduce circulating supply and sell pressure, the more meaningful signal is growing comfort with Ethereum’s rules and long-term operating assumptions. A Word of Caution Not all recent transaction growth necessarily reflects meaningful economic coordination, however. Some analysis suggests that a significant portion of recent transaction volume may be driven by address-poisoning activity, particularly involving stablecoins. As transaction costs have fallen, certain forms of spam and phishing have become economically viable at scale, inflating headline activity metrics without corresponding increases in genuine economic use. This complicates how transaction growth should be interpreted. High throughput alone does not distinguish between productive activity and adversarial behaviour, a distinction that becomes increasingly important as execution costs fall. For institutional observers, transaction volume alone is a blunt signal. Understanding the composition and intent of on-chain activity matters as much as the raw numbers themselves. What Institutions Are Actually Watching From an institutional perspective, the central question is not impressive-looking metrics, but whether the system is converging toward operational credibility. That means predictable protocol evolution, transparent trade-offs between efficiency and security, and a clear separation between settlement guarantees and application-level risk. Scaling success is measured not by the absence of risk, but by how clearly that risk is distributed across layers, users and counterparties. Ethereum’s recent performance suggests progress on throughput and stability. Whether that progress translates into durable institutional trust will depend on how effectively complexity and user protection are addressed across the broader ecosystem. A Broader View of Settlement Infrastructure Taken together, these developments highlight a broader principle: long-term institutional adoption depends less on novelty or speed than on neutrality, robustness and minimised trust assumptions. As systems scale, the cost of failure rises and tolerance for experimental risk declines. In this respect, Bitcoin provides a useful reference point. It was designed from the outset as a narrowly scoped settlement system, prioritising simplicity and resilience over expressive execution. Ethereum’s current trajectory suggests a partial convergence toward that logic, clarifying the role of the base layer while pushing flexibility and experimentation to the edges. Whether that maturity proves durable will be determined not just by throughput and fees, but by how well scaling aligns with security, incentives and institutional expectations. In that sense, Ethereum’s recent transaction milestone is perhaps less a victory lap than a stress test — one that will shape how institutions evaluate Ethereum, Bitcoin and settlement infrastructure more broadly in the coming years.

Well, Bithumb tops XRP holdings with 1.84B, followed by Binance at 1.70B and Uphold with 1.51B. Ripple holds 1.33B, underscoring its role in liquidity and market operations. South Korea’s Upbit owns 1.27B, while an anonymous wallet claims 1.24B, rounding out the top six. Why does this matter? Well, this distribution underscores a key crypto market dynamic: exchanges and institutional wallets hold outsized influence. Billions in custody can trigger major price swings, impact liquidity, and shape market sentiment. Ripple’s strategic XRP holdings support supply management, market-making, and financial partnerships, ensuring deep liquidity for high-volume trading. Amid these shifts, XRP is positioned to challenge gold after seven years of decline. Notably, understanding XRP’s top holders is essential for investors looking beyond price charts. Exchanges dominate the leaderboard, highlighting global demand and the growing role of custody and institutional oversight in a market that blends retail and professional participation. Ripple’s recent renewal of its custody deal with Garanti BBVA Crypto in Turkey underscores the importance of secure storage for XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Tracking top wallets offers insights into liquidity, risk management, and market dynamics, making it a strategic tool for anticipating shifts and understanding the forces shaping XRP’s future. Conclusion In a market dominated by a few major XRP holders, tracking top wallets is crucial for understanding price, liquidity, and market stability.

He noted that the AI models could usurp human identities and relationships, influence public opinion, and deepen social polarization. The comments come as many artificial intelligence models face criticisms since the start of the year. The most glaring one is that of xAI chatbot Grok, which has faced criticism over its use to create inappropriate deepfake images of women and children. Countries across the world have issued a standing order to the platform to fix its chatbot, with some even going as far as suspending its use in their country while asking Elon Musk to create safeguards to fix the issue. Pope Leo XIV highlights the dangers of AI to humans In his message marking the World Day of Social Communications, the pope mentioned that AI systems can reflect how their creators see the world. He mentioned that they can also shape patterns of thought by reproducing the biases embedded in the data that they process. “The challenge is a matter of protecting human identity and authentic relationships,” the pontiff said. We need faces and voices to once again speak the person. We need to safeguard the gift of communication as the deepest truth of the human being, and to orient every technological innovation toward it. https://t.co/PmSAHj4gju — Pope Leo XIV (@Pontifex) January 24, 2026 Pope Leo XIV’s warnings are also coming as generative AI continues to make leaps and bounds towards replication. The models are now used to manufacture images, music, and texts to levels where they are sometimes indistinguishable from human-made works. In 2023, his predecessor, Pope Francis, was the subject of several viral fake AI images. In some images, he wore a white puffer jacket instead of his usual robes, while in others, he was altered in some ways. Since then, generative AI has been the go-to tool for some high-profile figures, including United States President Donald Trump, who has generated and posted several AI-generated images to his online accounts. In his speech, Pope Leo XIV warned that only a small number of companies hold significant power over AI development, and that AI tools are now increasing the difficulty of telling apart works that were created by humans and those created using the models. Pope urges tech leaders to look into AI risks This is not the first time that Pope Leo XIV has warned the global populace about the risks and dangers associated with artificial intelligence. Since he was elected Pope last May as the first pontiff from the United States, he has consistently warned about the growing influence of AI technology. In November, he urged the leaders in the technology industry to build artificial intelligence models that respect human dignity. He highlighted that AI development is part of a larger struggle over who we become when we build systems that learn, decide, and operate at a global scale. “Technological innovation can be a form of participation in the divine act of creation. It carries an ethical and spiritual weight, for every design choice expresses a vision of humanity,” the Pope said at the time. He called on builders of AI to create models that show genuine reverence for life. In addition to creating models that show genuine reverence for life, the Pope also criticized systems that present statistical probability as reliable knowledge, adding that the tools only offer approximation. He noted that the challenge ahead is to establish effective governance and called on countries to educate young people about how algorithms influence perceptions of reality. The pontiff also condemned the increased use of AI in military applications, warning against delegating life-and-death decisions to machines. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Big-cap holdings remain, but in periods of higher returns traders tend to move into new cheap altcoins with clear roadmap and less high valuation. This rotation has been observed with a section of Cardano investors who now are placing in a different cryptocurrency that is less than $1 before the first protocol launch. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is still among the most common platforms of smart contract in the market. ADA is trading at approximately $0.36 and its market cap of approximately $13B. Since its previous rise wave, ADA has not been able to cross the resistance levels of $0.42 and $0.50. According to analysts, these areas have limited potential gains in the recent rallies and provided resistance to the movement of trends. Valuation has been the other challenge facing ADA. Big caps have lower rates of repricing because more liquidity is needed to dispose of the asset. Analysts monitoring leading cryptocurrencies claim that Cardano has a chance of doing well over time, but its prospective to forward appreciation is less strong than that of cheap cryptos that just entered their initial adoption cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The latest altcoin that has been on the news is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new developing cryptocurrency that creates a decentralized lending system. Mutuum Finance started out in early 2025 at a presale price of $0.01 but has advanced to Phase 7 at $0.04. The presale has raised $19.9M and has also gotten 18,900 holders comprising about 830M tokens. The reallocators of the ADA appeal are at the initial phase of the protocol. Mutuum Finance is constructing a borrowing and lending platform through which users can provide their assets to earn yield and borrow without the need to sell their collateral. The platform is assessed by Halborn Security as an independent audit and reportedly possesses a 90 out of 100 score on the CertiK token scan. In the case of lending protocol, this validation is regarded as being necessary because of liquidation and collateral management. Weaknesses vs Strengths: ADA vs MUTM Analysts tend to make a comparison between ADA and MUTM more of a maturity, as opposed to a competition. ADA is an established firm with a huge market capital, decrease in percentage growth and high liquidity needs. MUTM is early and has lower valuation and first-activation roadmap that might reprice based on utility and not market narratives. To long-term allocators, this contrast tends to result in portfolio math. To take an example a $500 investment in ADA when the price is at $0.36 could have little upward potential unless significant catalysts develop. Conversely, an initial investment of $500 in MUTM at $0.04 would give a significantly large share of MUTM. Analysts emphasise the fact that this is just a reflection of why smaller assets in the earlier stages are more likely to appeal to investors looking to have a better upside potential. Phase Progression and Q1 Catalyst Setup The X account of Mutuum Finance supported the claim by stating that V1 protocol will go to Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 contains borrowing, lending, collateral regulations and liquidation mechanisms. This is referred to as having the first point of visibility of protocol usage as opposed to theoretical. Phase 7 is also pacing faster than the preceding phases and analysts have reported greater whale allocations and greater involvement of late-stage buyers. The second step will raise the MUTM price by almost 20% which has made a timing aspect to the investors deciding on the crypto they can purchase before the release window of the Q1. It is probable that Cardano will continue to be a stable project with a high reputation, though analysts think that the project may not be able to grow its value due to valuation and market saturation. Mutuum Finance can be considered the other side of the curve: early utility, growing participation and unpriced. Investors who are considering the best crypto opportunities in Q1 2026, MUTM has become one of the most interesting companies with a roadmap that will soon shift towards implementation as opposed to planning.

According to The Korea Times , trading volume in Tether (USDT) across the nation’s five major won-based exchanges climbed to 378.2 billion won ($261 million) when the exchange rate exceeded 1,480 won per dollar last Wednesday, citing CryptoQuant data. The spike follows mounting currency pressures that pushed the won through nine consecutive days of declines against the dollar, marking its longest losing streak since 2008, Bloomberg reported. Source: Bloomberg Major exchanges, including Korbit, Coinone, Upbit, and Bithumb, launched aggressive promotional campaigns centered on stablecoins, including USDC and USDe, waiving trading fees and distributing rewards to boost volumes during what industry officials described as a downturn in broader crypto markets. Banks Slash Dollar Rates as Government Defends Currency According to The Chosun Daily , South Korea’s major commercial banks slash e d dollar deposit interest rates to near zero in response to government pressure to defend the exchange rate. Shinhan Bank cut its annual rate from 1.5% to 0.1% starting January 30, while Hana Bank reduced rates from 2% to 0.05% for its Travelog Foreign Currency Account. The coordinated move followed the authorities’ summoning of bank executives and their request that they “ refrain from excessive marketing that encourages foreign currency deposits such as dollars. ” Banks responded by introducing incentives for won conversion, with Shinhan offering a 90% preferential rate for customers converting dollar deposits back to won, plus an additional 0.1 percentage point rate boost for those subscribing to won-term deposits afterward. Dollar deposit balances at the five major banks fell 3.8% from month-end to 63.25 billion dollars as of January 22, marking the first decline after three consecutive months of surges. Corporate deposits, which account for 80% of all dollar holdings, dropped sharply from 52.42 billion dollars at year-end to 49.83 billion dollars, suggesting that the authorities’ recommendation to sell dollars spot, combined with perceptions that the exchange rate had peaked, was driving the decline. Individual dollar deposits grew at a significantly slower pace, rising just 109.64 million dollars, compared with the previous month’s 1.09 billion dollar surge. Presidential Intervention Accelerates Won Stabilization President Lee Jae-myung delivered a rare verbal intervention on the exchange rate during a January 21 press conference, stating authorities predicted the rate would drop to around 1,400 won within one to two months. The won-dollar rate immediately fell from 1,481.4 won to 1,467.7 won following his remarks, closing at 1,471.3 won. Source: TheChosunDaily Market observers noted the unprecedented nature of a sitting president specifying both an exchange rate target and timeline, with Lee’s statement carrying significantly more weight than U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s earlier comment that the won’s recent decline was “ inconsistent with Korea’s strong fundamentals. ” Meanwhile, demand for dollar exchange slowed as average daily won-to-dollar conversions reached 16.54 million dollars from January 1-22, while dollar-to-won conversions surged to 5.2 million dollars daily, significantly exceeding last year’s 3.78 million dollar average and indicating increased profit-taking. In fact, according to CNBC , South Korea’s fourth-quarter GDP growth slowed to 1.5% year over year, missing economists’ forecasts of 1.9%, as construction investment shrank 3.9% and exports pulled back 2.1% from the previous quarter. The won has lost nearly 2% against the greenback this year, making it one of Asia’s worst-performing currencies, while South Korean retail investors bought approximately 2.4 billion dollars of U.S. equities on a net basis through mid-January, up roughly 60% from the same period last year. The broader economic slowdown comes as Seoul advances major crypto policy reforms despite regulatory gridlock over stablecoin governance. Earlier this month, South Korea ended its nine-year corporate crypto trading ban , permitting listed companies to invest up to 5% of equity capital in top-20 cryptocurrencies, while lawmakers passed amendments to the Capital Markets Act and Electronic Securities Act establishing legal frameworks for tokenized securities trading beginning January 2027. South Korea has launched guidelines, allowing listed companies and professional investors to invest up to 5% of their equity capital crypto. #SouthKorea #CorporateCryptoInvestment #CryptoInvestment https://t.co/d55u3TDsBF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 12, 2026 Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo pledged to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs and extend trading hours to 24/7 as part of efforts to eliminate the “ Korea discount, ” though comprehensive digital asset legislation remains stalled amid disputes between the Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea over stablecoin issuance rules.

The pullback came as the broader digital asset market struggled to find direction amid sustained selling pressure and weakening investor sentiment. The bulk of the selling came from Bitcoin, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust posting net weekly outflows of about $522.4 million. The heaviest drawdown occurred on January 21, when IBIT alone recorded roughly $356.6 million in outflows. Additional selling followed later in the week, including $101.6 million on January 23 and $56.9 million on January 20, outweighing a modest $15.1 million inflow earlier in the period. Total Bitcoin spot ETFs inflows. Source: Coinglass Ethereum saw similarly strong selling pressure. In this case, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust registered total weekly outflows of approximately $416.6 million. The largest single-day outflow came on January 21, when ETHA shed about $250.3 million. This was followed by further declines of $92.3 million on January 20, $44.4 million on January 22, and $44.5 million on January 23, offset only slightly by a $14.9 million inflow on January 16. Total Ethereum spot ETFs inflows. Source: Coinglass ETFs accelerate crypto market downturn In total, BlackRock offloaded about $939 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single week. These moves were part of a wider trend across U.S. spot crypto ETFs, which collectively logged persistent net outflows as institutional investors reduced exposure. While a handful of funds managed small inflows on isolated days, they were outweighed by broad-based selling in both Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The ETF-driven selling coincided with a broader downturn in the crypto market . Bitcoin and Ethereum traded under sustained pressure throughout the week, as investors reacted to macro uncertainty, declining risk appetite, and fading momentum following earlier rallies. Market sentiment weakened as persistent outflows reinforced concerns about near-term downside risks. To this end, Bitcoin fell below the crucial $90,000 level, while Ethereum dropped below $3,000.

57454424,https://cryptonews.com/?p=478724,1769338914,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57454424.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: $1.88 Triple-Bottom Support as ETF Money Pulls Back – What’s Next?,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-1-88-triple-bottom-support-as-etf-money-pulls-back-whats-next/,"XRP is trading near $1.89–$1.91 as January draws to a close, holding a well-defined triple-bottom support around $1.88 after slipping below the $2.00 mark earlier this week. The pullback has coincided with ETF outflows and a sharp drop in trading volume, but price action suggests stabilization rather than renewed selling pressure. With volatility compressing and buyers repeatedly defending the same demand zone, XRP is approaching a technical decision point that could define its next directional move. ETF Outflows Ease Short-Term Momentum Without Breaking the Thesis Short-term pressure has been driven largely by institutional flows. According to data reported by CryptoQuant, U.S. spot XRP ETFs recorded their first weekly net outflows, totaling approximately $40.6 million toward the end of January. Trading volume has also declined sharply, with some estimates showing a 50%+ drop in 24-hour activity, signaling trader hesitation rather than aggressive selling. That said, the flow data points to rotation and profit-taking, not abandonment. XRP remains one of the few large-cap tokens with clear regulatory positioning in the US, and earlier ETF inflows north of $1 billion underscore that institutional interest hasn’t disappeared. The current reset appears more about leverage clearing than confidence breaking. Core Adoption Trends Remain Unchanged Despite Price Weakness Fundamentally, Ripple’s long-term thesis remains unchanged. XRP continues to underpin on-demand liquidity (ODL) across Ripple’s global payments network, offering faster and cheaper settlement compared to legacy systems. More than 300 financial institutions remain connected to RippleNet, and ongoing regulatory clarity following 2025 rulings continues to distinguish XRP from many peers. While no major partnership headlines have emerged this week, the absence of negative ecosystem news reinforces the view that the current weakness is market-driven, not fundamental. XRP Price Prediction: Volatility Shrinks at $1.90 – Breakout or Breakdown Ahead? From a technical perspective, XRP price prediction remains cautiously neutral near term. On the 2-hour chart, price is stabilizing inside a descending channel, capped by a falling trendline near $1.95. XRP is trading below the 50-EMA and 100-EMA, while the 200-EMA near $1.99 continues to act as firm resistance. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Support is clearly defined between $1.88 and $1.85, where repeated long lower wicks suggest responsive buying. RSI has recovered into the mid-40s after oversold readings, indicating easing downside pressure. Volatility has contracted, forming a descending wedge, a structure that often resolves higher if support holds. A successful break above $1.95 would expose $2.03–$2.06, signaling structural repair. Conversely, a decisive loss of $1.85 would open downside toward $1.80 and $1.77. XRP Trade setup: Accumulate near $1.88–$1.85, target $2.03–$2.06, invalidation below $1.80.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/easya-co-founder-reiterates-1000-xrp-price-by-2030-heres-why/,"EasyA co-founder Dom Kwok recently addressed comments from members of the XRP community in a short conversation that combined humor with a clear expression of long-term confidence. While the tone of the interaction was light, the message itself underscored Kwok’s belief that XRP’s future valuation will far exceed current levels. The exchange also highlighted how sharply opinions remain divided among market participants when it comes to long-term price expectations and regulatory risk. Kwok’s Statement and Julie’s Response Kwok initiated the exchange by stating that he did not go grey at the age of 30 for XRP to be worth anything less than $1,000 by 2030 . The comment was not presented as a technical forecast or a data-based projection, but rather as a personal expression of conviction. Julie, an X user responding to Kwok, replied that inexpensive XRP still “looks good” on him, keeping the interaction informal and playful. Kwok responded once more by telling readers to imagine how good expensive XRP is going to look. With that reply, he reinforced his original position without expanding on specific catalysts or timelines. The exchange remained concise, but the message was unambiguous: Kwok continues to expect significant long-term upside for XRP . fyi i did not go grey at the age of 30 for $XRP to be worth any less than $1,000 by 2030 — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 23, 2026 Community Reactions Highlight Divided Views Other users quickly added their own perspectives. An X user identified as GM147 rejected the idea of extreme price appreciation, arguing that such outcomes are limited to imagination and asserting that XRP would never reach values far above its historical ranges. This comment reflected a skeptical view often expressed by traders who focus on past market behavior rather than future structural change. Another commenter, D Rock, offered a different response. While stating that they have held XRP for years and remain committed, the user expressed concern about government actions related to digital assets. Their comment referenced increased attention on wallets, discussions around seizure of crypto assets, and uncertainty tied to legislation. Unlike GM147’s response, this view did not dismiss long-term potential outright but emphasized unease about external pressures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Concerns in the Background Although regulatory issues were not the central focus of Kwok’s remarks, they remain a significant factor influencing investor sentiment. Recent discussions around expanded financial surveillance powers, asset forfeiture laws that do not require criminal convictions, and state-level measures that treat digital wallets as property subject to seizure have contributed to anxiety among some holders. These concerns help explain why expressions of confidence often coexist with caution within the same community. Optimism Meets Skepticism Kwok’s comments served as a reaffirmation of belief rather than an attempt to persuade critics with analysis. The replies they received, ranging from outright dismissal to cautious support, illustrate how sharply opinions differ within the XRP community . Even a brief exchange can reveal the contrast between long-term optimism, market skepticism, and regulatory concern that continues to shape conversations around XRP’s future.

The data leaked access to 420,000 Binance accounts, Instagram, Facebook, Roblox, dating sites, and other platforms. The database exposed to the public lacked encryption and password protection, according to Jeremiah Fowler from ExpressVPN. It included 149,404,754 distinct login credentials and reached 96 GB in size of raw data. Millions of account logins leaked from Binance, Instagram, Google, and TikTok. Source: ExpressVPN blog . The leaked data was open to the public The database was open to the public. Anyone who found it could access millions of people’s credentials. The exposed documents contained emails, usernames, passwords, and account login URLs. The leaked records included data from social media websites like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter). Dating apps and OnlyFans accounts data revealed login methods for creators and users. Fowler found leaked logins from many streaming accounts as well, such as Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, and Roblox. In the small sample of records the cybersecurity researcher examined, he found financial service accounts, crypto wallets , Binance trading accounts, as well as banking and credit card logins. Government accounts were not spared either. Logins linked to [dot]gov domains from various nations were found. Such sensitive data may enable targeted phishing or impersonation attacks. This could threaten national security and public safety. The database was hosted online but lacked ownership details. Fowler reported it to the hosting provider, and after almost a month, the hosting was suspended. The hosting provider refused to reveal who managed the database. It remains unclear whether the database was used for criminal activity, legitimate research, or why it was publicly exposed. The database exposure duration is unknown. Other people might have accessed it. A troubling detail is that the records kept growing until they became restricted and inaccessible, the cybersecurity researcher added. The total number of records and the size of the exposed infostealer database. Source: ExpressVPN blog . Infostealer malware collected logins and extra information The database contained keylogging and infostealer malware, which secretly collect credentials from infected devices. Unlike old infostealer malware datasets, these files recorded extra information. The records contained the “host_reversed path.” This structure organizes stolen data by victim and source for easy indexing. Reversing the hostname can prevent directory conflicts and evade simple detection rules targeting common domain formats. The system assigned each unique log line a document ID based on a line hash to guarantee one distinct record. A brief check showed these hash and document IDs were unique with no duplicates found. The release of many unique usernames and passwords creates a major security threat for many people who are unaware that their data was compromised. Criminals may use this information to automate attacks on accounts like email, crypto wallets, social media, and business systems. This greatly raises the risk of fraud, identity theft, financial crimes, and phishing scams. Malware silently steals login data and sends it to hackers. Changing passwords is useless in the presence of malware and infostealers. Installing antivirus software helps detect and remove malware from smartphones and computers completely. An October report by Security[dot]org found that about 66% of U.S. adults used antivirus software in 2025. Many users have unprotected devices that are vulnerable to infostealer malware. The report stated that $16.6 billion was lost to cybercrime in a single year. If someone thinks their device has malware, they should act right away. Get seen where it counts.

According to industry officials, stablecoins have seen a rise in demand across the Korean crypto market amid a rise in the won-dollar exchange rate due to volatility. While the benchmark KOSPI and other commodities like gold and silver have risen to new levels, digital assets have always been left out of previous rallies, which usually leaves South Korean exchanges struggling. However, things have changed this time, with the rise in the value of the US dollar boosting the demand for stablecoins . This has prompted exchanges to capitalize on the trend and increase trading volumes. South Korean exchanges turn to stablecoins to boost volumes The trend began with Korbit announcing its plan to waive all trading fees for transactions involving dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) last week. The stablecoin was developed by Circle, and each token is designed to maintain the value of a dollar. In addition, Korbit also announced a USDC trading campaign that remains ongoing. The campaign is expected to run through March, warning users that they will record at least 10 million won ($6,900) in weekly cumulative transaction volume. The exchange mentioned that traders who hit this threshold would be eligible to share a reward pool totaling 25,000 USDC, with allocations varying based on the trading volume of the participant for that week. Coinone is also running a similar campaign, announcing that it will distribute 8,000 USDC to its users every week if they reach a certain trading volume by the end of that week. Meanwhile, Upbit and Bithumb are taking a different approach. The exchanges, considered the two biggest in the Korean crypto industry, are listing new stablecoins. Some weeks ago, both exchanges announced the listing of Ethena USD ( USDe ), a synthetic stablecoin developed by Ethena Labs. The token is designed to maintain a one-on-one value with the US dollar without relying on traditional bank reserves. The two firms have also launched other campaigns aimed at increasing their transaction volumes. Upbit recently announced a three-round promotion campaign that started on January 17, offering free Ethena tokens to its users who rank among the top traders of USDe. The intensifying marketing push around dollar-pegged stablecoins has been driven largely by the sharp drop in the won-dollar exchange rate. As the exchange rate continues to move higher, trading activity using dollar-based stablecoins has increased drastically. Exchange rate skyrockets amid moves to regulate stablecoins Data from on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shows that when the exchange rate exceeded 1,480 won per dollar last Wednesday, trading volume in Tether across the major exchanges trading in won hit 378.2 billion won, marking a 62% rise from January 1. According to an official from one of the top exchanges, exchanges are stepping up their activities due to the rising exchange rate. In the current market environment, stablecoins are used to boost trading volumes and develop new revenue streams. Meanwhile, Korea recently made its first legislative step to curb money laundering via stablecoins. The country announced that stablecoins would be brought under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act as part of efforts to combat money laundering and tax evasion using digital assets. The bill was proposed by Rep. Park Sung-hoon, and classified stablecoin as a legal means of payment, placing them alongside existing instruments like government-issued notes and banknotes. “This regulatory gap could enable illegal foreign exchange dealings and tax evasion using stablecoins,” the lawmaker said. “The bill aims to classify virtual assets pegged to domestic or foreign currencies, which can be used for payments for a broad range of users, as official means of payment under the law.” The concerns mirrored those of the Bank of Korea, which warned that stablecoins could be used for cross-border transactions without complying with reporting requirements.

Sophisticated Attack Mirrors Growing Pattern The breach follows established tactics where hackers exploit trusted accounts to distribute malicious links disguised as urgent platform notifications. Recipients received messages appearing to come from X’s rights management team, complete with fake compliance warnings and time-sensitive appeals processes designed to create panic and bypass security awareness. Blockchain security researcher Wu Blockchain first identified the compromise and alerted the community to ignore any communications from the account. The warning emphasized particular concern given Chen’s extensive network of high-profile cryptocurrency executives, developers, and investors who might trust messages from his verified account.

Industry Faces Relentless Social Engineering Wave BNB Chain’s official account suffered a similar breach in October when hackers posted fake reward programs with phishing links after Binance co-founder CZ warned followers against clicking suspicious content. The compromised account promoted fraudulent BSC token distributions, promising early payouts to users who voted on reward dates through malicious URLs designed to drain digital wallets. Binance co-CEO Yi He’s WeChat account was also hijacked in December to promote meme coin schemes, with attackers conducting a coordinated pump-and-dump operation around the token MUBARA. Two wallets created hours before the breach accumulated 21.16 million tokens before dumping holdings as retail traders flooded in, netting attackers approximately $55,000 while leaving later buyers exposed to price collapse. Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance warned that new co-CEO Yi He’s @heyibinance abandoned WeChat account was hacked and used to push a meme coin called MUBARA. #Binance #Memecoins https://t.co/sdyH325OMD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 Among other notable accounts hacked were ZKsync and Matter Labs, which were compromised in May through what the team described as “ delegated accounts ” with limited posting privileges. Hackers published false claims about an SEC investigation alongside fake airdrop promotions, triggering a 5% drop in the ZK token price despite a prior 38.5% weekly rally. The prominent crypto media company, Watcher.Guru also confirmed its account breach in March after fake Ripple-SWIFT partnership claims spread across connected Telegram, Facebook, and Discord channels through automated content bots. The team suspects the compromise originated from a suspicious link containing unusual query strings shared in their Telegram group weeks earlier. Record Theft Year Exposes Escalating Threats The crypto ecosystem witnessed over $3.4 billion stolen in 2025, according to Chainalysis’s 2026 Crypto Crime Report , with North Korean state-backed hackers accounting for a record $2.02 billion across fewer but increasingly sophisticated attacks. Source: Chainalysis The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea now represents 76% of all service compromises, bringing cumulative DPRK cryptocurrency theft to $6.75 billion since operations began. Personal wallet compromises surged to 158,000 incidents affecting at least 80,000 unique victims, triple the 54,000 cases recorded in 2022. Address poisoning scams drove December’s single-largest loss , when one victim transferred $50 million to a fraudulent wallet mimicking their intended destination, while private key leaks resulted in $27.3 million stolen from multi-signature wallets. Personal Security Breaches Surge Across Platforms Most recently, Ubuntu developer Alan Pope warned that attackers are hijacking Snap Store publisher accounts by registering expired domains linked to legitimate developers, then pushing malicious updates to previously trusted packages. The technique exploits automatic update systems and established trust signals, with at least 2 confirmed cases of wallet-stealing malware distributed through seemingly normal applications. Hackers are exploiting trusted Snap Store packages to steal cryptocurrency by hijacking existing publisher accounts. #Hack #Crypto https://t.co/YV5Yoiwb0F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 21, 2026 Given these growing, multifaceted attack vectors, Better Business Bureau officials are warning consumers about phishing campaigns that lock X users out of their accounts and are subsequently used for cryptocurrency promotions. Kentucky journalist Jennie Rees described receiving direct messages from apparent colleagues requesting contest votes, only to find her account posting fake Audi purchase claims tied to crypto earnings after clicking the malicious link.

Coinbase CEO Praises Trump-Led White House As Most Crypto-Forward Government In a January 24 post on the social media platform X, Armstrong shared a few key “themes and takeaways” from the latest edition of WEF. After admitting that the conference offered a productive time of meeting people one-on-one, the Coinbase CEO revealed that the major focus was on pushing crypto adoption globally. Starting his list of takeaways, Armstrong highlighted that everyone was talking about tokenization, which is beginning to expand to every asset class in the world. The crypto leader said to expect some major progress in the tokenization sector in 2026, especially as the Fortune 500 business leaders continuously lean in. Secondly, the Coinbase CEO shared that crypto legislation and the CLARITY Act were another area of focus, as the government of the day looks to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. According to Armstrong, most of the bank CEOs he met at the WEF in the past week are actually pro-crypto. Armstrong wrote on X: One CEO of a top 10 global bank told me crypto is their number one priority, and they view it as existential. Furthermore, the Coinbase CEO lauded the Trump administration as the most crypto-forward government in the world at the moment. Armstrong acknowledged their progress with the crypto market structure, stating that these clear rules are crucial for global competitiveness and will put money back in people’s pockets. In what seemed like a cheeky tone, Armstrong mentioned that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) topics didn’t come up throughout the forum. According to the crypto founder, the week felt productive, as it centered around real, global progress — all thanks to BlackRock CEO and new WEF co-chair Larry Fink. The Coinbase leader touted crypto and AI (artificial intelligence) as the most talked-about technologies in today’s world. Highlighting their compatibility, Armstrong stated that AI agents will eventually default to using stablecoins for payments, as they cannot be KYC’d like human beings. Finally, Armstrong revealed that the Coinbase, Circle, and Bermuda partnership to build a fully on-chain economy was announced at WEF Davos 2026. “Excited to make progress on this and create a compelling case study for other nations to follow,” the crypto CEO concluded. Total Crypto Market Cap At $3.09 Trillion As of this writing, the global cryptocurrency market has a total capitalization of $3.086 trillion, with Bitcoin retaining its spot as the world’s largest cryptocurrency.",Coinbase|Brian Armstrong|coinbase|crypto|crypto news|WEF Davos 2026,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 12:00:39

Here’s What Is Happening,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-this-is-just-the-beginning-heres-what-is-happening/,"Crypto investor and analyst Xaif Crypto has highlighted the early performance of XRP exchange-traded funds, describing them as a small but expanding segment of the digital asset market. In a recent post, Xaif Crypto noted that XRP-focused ETFs have delivered stronger-than-expected early inflows and returns, suggesting that institutional exposure to XRP through regulated investment products is beginning to take shape. According to the analyst, these initial metrics indicate that the current phase may represent only the early stages of a longer-term development for XRP-based investment vehicles. The commentary was accompanied by data outlining the performance of multiple XRP ETFs across spot, income, and leveraged categories. The figures, sourced from Bloomberg and VettaFi as of January 16, 2026, show that several spot XRP ETFs have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in assets under management within a relatively short timeframe. Products such as the Canary XRP ETF, Bitwise XRP ETF, and Franklin XRP ETF reported assets ranging from approximately $287 million to $374 million, with year-to-date returns clustered in the low-to-mid teens. $XRP ETFs are a small, yet growing segment of the crypto space XRP ETFs have outperformed many expectations early flows and returns hint this is just the beginning https://t.co/5GocCnItti pic.twitter.com/Eti62YgcgG — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) January 24, 2026 XRP ETF: Flows, Returns, and Market Positioning Xaif Crypto’s post emphasized that despite XRP ETFs representing a relatively narrow slice of the overall crypto ETF market, their early net flows and performance metrics have surpassed many initial assumptions. While the attached data shows that multiple spot products recorded positive year-to-date net inflows, some leveraged XRP ETFs posted notably higher year-to-date returns, exceeding 20 percent in certain cases. At the same time, since-inception returns for several funds remain negative, reflecting the broader volatility XRP has experienced over the past year. The analyst’s assessment focused on the importance of these early indicators rather than the absolute scale. While XRP ETFs currently trail Bitcoin-related funds in total assets, the pace of adoption and the diversity of available structures were presented as signs of increasing institutional engagement with XRP exposure. Debate Over ETF Impact on Token Prices The post also prompted a direct exchange about the role ETFs play in the crypto market. An X user, identified as RESEDARAN, argued that ETFs are detached from the underlying crypto ecosystem, stating that such products only provide awareness and do not materially affect token valuations. In response, Xaif Crypto rejected that view, asserting that spot ETFs can have a direct and measurable impact on token prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Xaif Crypto, spot ETFs require fund providers to hold the underlying tokens. When investors purchase ETF shares, the issuer must acquire additional XRP to maintain proper backing, thereby increasing market demand. The analyst pointed to the experience of Bitcoin spot ETFs , which coincided with substantial capital inflows and upward price movement, as an example of how ETF-driven demand can influence market dynamics. Xaif Crypto further noted that ETFs open the door to institutional capital that may otherwise avoid direct participation in crypto markets. Xaif Crypto’s analysis positions XRP ETFs as an emerging institutional gateway with tangible market implications. While still modest in size, the combination of early inflows, competitive returns, and expanding product offerings suggests that XRP ETFs could play a growing role in shaping demand for XRP in regulated financial environments.
