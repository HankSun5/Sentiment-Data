For the first time, industry titans including Tesla’s Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, Anthropic’s Dario Amodei, and Microsoft’s Satya Nadella shared stages and exchanged verbal blows, revealing deep fractures in the AI industry’s united front. This unprecedented convergence marked a pivotal moment where visionary optimism collided with pragmatic concerns about sustainability, ethics, and potential market bubbles. AI Davos 2025: The Transformation of Global Discourse The visual landscape of Davos underwent dramatic changes this year. Major technology corporations commandeered prime real estate along the main promenade, with Meta, Salesforce, and Tata establishing prominent physical presences that overshadowed traditional diplomatic displays. The United States House, jointly sponsored by consulting giant McKinsey and Microsoft, stood as the largest installation, symbolizing the corporate takeover of geopolitical discourse. Meanwhile, critical global issues including climate change and poverty struggled to attract comparable attention, highlighting the forum’s shifting priorities toward technological determinism. This physical transformation reflected a broader conceptual shift: artificial intelligence moved from peripheral discussion to central agenda item, dominating conversations across public panels and private meetings. The Executive Showdown: Visionaries Versus Realists Observers noted unprecedented tension among technology leaders who typically maintain diplomatic public personas. The Davos stage became an arena for subtle—and sometimes overt—competition. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei delivered particularly striking criticism of Nvidia, despite his company’s reliance on their GPU technology. He challenged recent U.S. administration decisions allowing advanced chip exports to China, employing vivid metaphors that captured media attention. “An AI data center represents a country full of geniuses,” Amodei declared, questioning the strategic wisdom of transferring such computational power abroad. This rhetorical flourish exemplified the heightened stakes of AI development, framing technological infrastructure in national security terms. Language and Metaphor: Decoding Executive Rhetoric CEOs employed distinctive terminology that revealed their strategic positioning. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella repeatedly referred to data centers as “token factories,” abstracting complex infrastructure into production terminology that emphasized output and scalability. Jensen Huang framed AI investment primarily through job creation narratives, avoiding discussions about potential slowdowns in infrastructure development. Elon Musk’s presence itself generated significant attention, marking a departure from his previous avoidance of the forum. While his contributions contained less substantive policy discussion than peers, his participation signaled AI’s ascendance as the defining technological narrative of our era. These linguistic choices served as strategic positioning, with each executive advancing frameworks that benefited their corporate interests. The Bubble Question: Growth Versus Sustainability Beneath the optimistic projections lay persistent concerns about artificial intelligence’s economic sustainability. Multiple executives acknowledged the potential for market overextension, though they proposed divergent solutions. Satya Nadella emphasized the necessity of broader adoption, suggesting that limited usage could precipitate a market correction. He advocated for equitable global distribution of AI capabilities, positioning Microsoft as an inclusive infrastructure provider. Conversely, Jensen Huang called for increased investment, arguing that current funding levels insufficiently supported necessary innovation. This tension between expansion and consolidation revealed fundamental disagreements about AI’s developmental trajectory. Industry analysts observed that executives balanced promotional messaging with cautious realism, attempting to sustain investment enthusiasm while acknowledging practical constraints. Key AI Executive Positions at Davos 2025 Executive Company Primary Focus Notable Statement Satya Nadella Microsoft Broad adoption & equity “Token factories” need widespread usage Jensen Huang Nvidia Investment & job creation Current investment levels insufficient Dario Amodei Anthropic Geopolitical implications AI data centers as “countries of geniuses” Elon Musk Tesla/X Platform participation Previously avoided, now engaged Geopolitical Dimensions: Technology as Power The Davos discussions consistently transcended pure technology, intersecting with international relations and trade policy. Amodei’s criticism of chip exports to China exemplified this convergence, framing computational hardware as strategic assets with national security implications. This perspective gained traction among policymakers attending the forum, who increasingly view AI development through competitive geopolitical lenses. The technology’s dual-use potential—for both economic advancement and strategic advantage—complicates traditional trade relationships and export controls. These discussions occurred against a backdrop of ongoing U.S.-China technological competition, with AI representing the latest frontier in great power rivalry. European leaders expressed particular concern about dependency on American and Chinese AI ecosystems, proposing regulatory frameworks and investment strategies to ensure regional competitiveness. The Talent Wars: Human Capital in AI Development Beyond hardware and investment, executives addressed the critical human dimension of AI advancement. The competition for specialized talent emerged as a recurring subtext throughout discussions. Companies balance aggressive recruitment against financial sustainability, creating tension between expansion and profitability. This talent competition explains some public disagreements, as executives position their organizations as optimal environments for groundbreaking research. The concentration of expertise in few corporations and regions raises concerns about equitable knowledge distribution and innovation diversity. Several executives proposed educational initiatives and international collaboration frameworks to address talent shortages, though concrete commitments remained limited. Visual and Structural Changes: Corporate Dominance The physical environment of Davos 2025 provided tangible evidence of technology’s rising influence. Traditional national pavilions shared space with elaborate corporate installations featuring interactive demonstrations and networking spaces. This shift generated debate about the World Economic Forum’s evolving identity—whether it primarily serves as a platform for multilateral diplomacy or corporate engagement. The prominent technology presence attracted different participant demographics than previous years, with increased attendance from venture capitalists, startup founders, and technical specialists. This changing composition influenced discussion topics and networking dynamics, further emphasizing technology’s centrality to contemporary global challenges. Conclusion The AI Davos 2025 discussions revealed an industry at a critical inflection point, where unprecedented technological promise confronts practical limitations and internal divisions. The simultaneous presence of competing CEOs created unique transparency about strategic disagreements that typically remain behind corporate walls. While executives universally acknowledged artificial intelligence’s transformative potential, they diverged significantly on implementation pathways, ethical frameworks, and economic sustainability. These debates extend beyond corporate boardrooms, influencing policy decisions, investment patterns, and international relations. As artificial intelligence continues its rapid advancement, the tensions exposed at Davos will likely intensify, requiring more sophisticated frameworks for balancing innovation with responsibility, competition with collaboration, and ambition with realism. FAQs Q1: Why was Davos 2025 particularly significant for AI discussions? The 2025 forum marked unprecedented convergence of major tech CEOs including Musk, Huang, Amodei, and Nadella, who publicly debated AI’s future while revealing strategic tensions typically kept private. Q2: What were the main points of disagreement among tech executives? Key disagreements involved AI’s economic sustainability, appropriate investment levels, geopolitical implications of technology transfer, and whether to prioritize broad adoption versus concentrated advancement. Q3: How did the physical environment of Davos change in 2025? Technology corporations dominated the main promenade with elaborate installations, while traditional diplomatic displays received less prominence, visually representing tech’s rising influence in global discourse. Q4: What geopolitical concerns emerged regarding AI development? Executives and policymakers expressed concerns about strategic technology transfers, particularly regarding advanced chip exports to China, framing AI infrastructure as national security assets. Q5: How did executives address concerns about an AI bubble? While acknowledging potential overextension, leaders proposed different solutions—Nadella emphasized broader adoption, Huang called for more investment, and Amodei focused on geopolitical controls.

Many now focus on the cost of building a large SHIB position today. Others weigh whether future market recovery could significantly lift valuations by 2030. The debate reflects broader uncertainty about the durability of meme cryptocurrencies. Cost of Buying 100 Million SHIB at Current Prices Shiba Inu hit an all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021. Since then, the token has fallen about 91% from that peak. At its current price of roughly $0.00000781, SHIB trades near multi-year lows. This decline has reshaped entry costs for long-term holders. At today’s valuation, purchasing 100 million SHIB costs about $781. Market comparisons highlight how sharply prices have shifted. In December 2025, when SHIB traded near $0.000033, the same amount cost around $3,300. Supporters say this reduced entry level improves upside potential if prices rebound over time. The prolonged downturns often attract accumulation strategies. SHIB’s continued visibility and strong trading volumes. However, they also stress that price recovery depends on broader market cycles. SHIB remains closely correlated with overall crypto sentiment. Despite its losses, Shiba Inu stays among the most-watched meme cryptocurrencies. Community size and brand recognition continue to drive interest. Still, observers caution that popularity alone does not guarantee sustainable growth. Structural factors increasingly shape investor expectations. 2030 Price Forecasts and Portfolio Value Outlook Price forecasts for Shiba Inu in 2030 differ widely across research platforms. Finder’s panel projected SHIB could reach $0.0001971 by 2030. This scenario implies a 2,382% increase from current levels. Under that estimate, 100 million SHIB would be worth about $19,710. Changelly offered a more conservative projection. Its estimates place SHIB between $0.0000458 and $0.0000532 by 2030. This range would value a 100 million SHIB holding between $4,580 and $5,320. Telegaon presented a broader outlook, forecasting prices between $0.0000919 and $0.000124. At the upper level, today’s $794 investment could rise to roughly $12,400. Broader market expectations also influence these forecasts. ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood, projected the total crypto market could reach $28 trillion by 2030. Analysts linked this outlook to the expansion of blockchain adoption. They said major assets and select altcoins, including SHIB, could benefit if this growth materializes. Optimism has also emerged around a possible spot SHIB ETF. Grayscale recently identified SHIB as eligible under the SEC’s Generic Listing Standard framework. Market observers referenced Bitcoin and Ethereum price rallies following ETF inflows. However, critics continue to highlight slow development, limited transparency, and SHIB’s massive supply as constraints on long-term gains.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 20:30:12

The next significant move for LINK largely depends on Bitcoin’s momentum, with bulls and bears waiting for a clear signal before committing. Until then, the market is in a holding pattern, building tension for the breakout or breakdown. Traders Await Clear Direction For Chainlink According to an update from CryptoWzrd, the daily candles for both Chainlink and LINKBTC continue to print indecisive price action, reflecting a lack of strong conviction from either side of the market. Despite recent movements, neither buyers nor sellers have been able to establish a clear directional edge, keeping the broader outlook neutral for now. Related Reading: Chainlink Drops To $12.50, But Largest Whales Are Accumulating To gain a reliable directional bias and unlock higher-probability trade opportunities, healthier and more decisive daily candles are required, as price could continue to chop within its current range. Bitcoin is expected to remain the primary driver of the next significant move. In particular, LINKBTC needs to print another bullish daily candle in the coming week to maintain any constructive momentum. Failure to do so could shift the balance back in favor of the bears and increase downside pressure. A continuation of weakness would likely result in a break of the daily lower-high trendline, followed by a loss of the critical $12 support level. On the bullish side, if Bitcoin provides the necessary support, LINK could attempt a recovery rally toward the $16 resistance zone. Until a clearer higher-timeframe structure emerges, the trading focus remains tactical. Attention will be placed on the lower-timeframe charts, particularly over the weekend, to capitalize on quick, short-term opportunities while avoiding unnecessary exposure to indecisive daily conditions. Intraday Chart Shows Tight Range, Market Lacks Clear Direction The analyst concluded that the intraday chart remains choppy, with price action tightly compressed within a narrow range. Such conditions point to persistent market indecision, in which neither bulls nor bears have shown sufficient conviction to drive a sustained move in either direction. As a result, trade setups lack clarity and carry elevated risk. Related Reading: Chainlink Stuck In A Micro-Range As Traders Await A Clear Trigger From a tactical perspective, a retest of the $13 resistance level, followed by clear signs of rejection or fading momentum, could open the door to a short opportunity. However, if price holds above $13 with strong acceptance, that would place the market in more constructive territory and tilt the bias back in favor of the bulls. Until one of these scenarios plays out decisively, the analyst emphasized the importance of waiting. A more mature and well-defined chart structure is needed before engaging in the next trade, ensuring better confirmation, cleaner entries, and improved risk-to-reward conditions.

Vertical Aerospace, based in the United Kingdom, displayed its Valo aircraft in Manhattan. The company’s chairman, Dómhnal Slattery, says these flying vehicles are intended to expand beyond wealthy travelers who can afford expensive helicopter rides. Aiming for affordable air travel with electric power “This is not for the affluent, or the super affluent, which is where helicopters have been forever. We want to democratize urban air mobility,” Slattery told Yahoo Finance. The Valo aircraft has a wingspan of nearly 50 feet and can carry up to six passengers along with a pilot and their bags. That makes it bigger than other flying taxis currently under development by competing companies. The aircraft runs entirely on electricity and has eight rotors that let i t ta ke off straight up like a helicopter. Once airborne, four propellers in the front spin 90 degrees to push the vehicle forward for regular flight. According to the company, the electric motors make much less noise than traditional helicopters. Vertical Aerospace designed the Valo for trips of 100 miles or less. The company expects the aircraft to make several short flights between charges rather than one long journey. Slattery said the company aims to charge around the same price as an Uber Black service for each seat when the cabin is set up for six people. “That opens up the mass market,” he explained. Right now, an Uber Black ride from downtown Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport costs about $150, though prices can go higher during busy times. Slattery maintains that running on electricity instead of fuel makes the Valo cheaper to operate than regular helicopters. Traditional helicopters create noise and air pollution, need repairs more often, and require more room to take off and land. The aircraft shown in New York will soon begin the approval process with European aviation officials. Slattery says European rules are tougher than those from the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States. “What we’re revealing tonight is the certificatio n ai rplane; this is what you’re physically seeing out there,” Slattery said about the displayed vehicle. He sai d th e approval process will start next year. Getting approved requires provin g th e aircraft is safe and reliable . Slattery, who spent years working in the aircraft leasing business, say s pa ssengers also need to feel confident about flying in these vehicles. “We want to really sho w th ese things are safe; I need to convince people that this becomes as safe as a Boeing 737, because commercial aviation is the safest form of transport in the world,” Slattery said. “W e al l have worked hard in the industry to achieve that (safety) metric. And so in this industry, proving safety and showing safety is what will make the difference over the next decade.” Airline partnerships and route planning underway Vertical Aerospace has partnered with American Airlines and Japan Airlines. The company hopes to receive full certification by 2028 and begin operating flights that year. However, the company won’t actually run the passenger services. Instead, it plans to operate as a manufacturer like Boeing or Airbus, building aircraft that airlines and other operators will use to serve customers. The company plans to offer flying taxi services in London. In the New York area, Vertical Aerospace is working with Bristow Group , a major helicopter transportation company, and Skyports Infrastructure, which runs heliports around New York City. Together, they’re planning routes that would connect New York City to Newark and Teterboro airports in New Jersey, as well as JFK and East Hampton Airport. Some companies already provide helicopter airport transfers. Blade, which Joby Aviation owns, currently uses regular helicopters but plans to switch to its own electric aircraft eventually. Competition among flying taxi companies will be fierce, and Vertical Aerospace is betting that the Valo’s size, speed, and distance capabilities will provide a competitive edge.

Here’s What Analysts Think,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-any-new-crypto-repeat-what-dogecoin-did-in-its-prime-heres-what-analysts-think/,"The most iconic rally of the 2021 bull run was Dogecoin’s 10,000% rise, which many believe only history can record. However, a new crypto has emerged with the potential to record a historic rally of this nature. The newcomer is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is currently priced at $0.04 in Phase 7 of its presale and has already shown explosive demand to raise a monumental $19.95 million from a group of 18,880+ investors. Mutuum Finance has offered real utility to investors in the crypto market. An investment of $100 in this crypto asset currently in Phase 7 of its presale can potentially rise to $10,000 if Mutuum Finance repeats Dogecoin’s 10,000% rise. Dogecoin Faces the Challenge of Volatility Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be in an extremely volatile state as indicated by the recent liquidation situation wherein over $1.2 million in leveraged positions was liquidated due to the asset’s recent decline. This has left many DOGE investors vulnerable and in losses. While the crypto was once a top player in the market, its momentum is gone. Investors are now turning to a new crypto that could turn their fate around. Project Valuation & ROI Analysis While speculative in nature, the analysis of the potential of MUTM according to the presale performance can offer an understanding of the growth pattern of the token. To attain the target of achieving a growth of 10,000% from the current price of the token in Phase 7, which is $0.04, the new target price of the token will be $4. While ambitious, the target is justified given the project’s capability to attract substantial market attention. Presale Defining Market Confidence Mutuum Finance’s presale model has set the standard for successful early-stage growth. The token is showing remarkable potential as it grows by an impressive 4x, rising from its initial value of $0.01 to its current value of $0.04 in presale phase 7. The potential is high due to the token’s listing price of $0.06. An initial investment of $4,000 is set to rise to $6,000 after the listing, providing an instant gain of $2,000. Over 18,880 investors have put in $19.95 million into the project. This makes the MUTM the next crypto to explode. Dual Rewards: Incentivizing a Liquid Ecosystem Mutuum Finance uses an advanced two-level incentive mechanism that rewards all participants in the ecosystem. This mechanism allows for higher returns to liquidity providers. By depositing USDT into Peer to Contract with a base APY of 8%, an additional incentive of 6% APY in the form of MUTM tokens may be earned, increasing the returns to as much as 14%. On the other hand, borrowers may benefit from incentives such as earning a rebate of 4% APY in the form of MUTM for borrowing $10,000 in USDC with an interest rate of 9%, effectively lowering the borrowing rate to 5%. This incentive mechanism is financed through an allocation of 10% of the entire MUTM token supply. Project Stability The core element of the Mutuum Finance system is its system of risk management that guarantees the stability of the system while providing capital security for the user. The protocol applies a system of dynamically changing Loan-to-Value ratios in real-time according to the changing nature of the markets. For assets like SOL or USDC, which can be defined as blue-chip assets, the LTV can go up to 70% while the liquidation occurs at 75%. This would then allow a user holding an SOL worth $8,000 as collateral to access up to $5,600 in liquidity. Mutuum Finance, which has the symbol MUTM, has the potential to mirror the legendary 10,000% growth that Dogecoin has witnessed in the past. At $0.04 during its presale, backed by a whopping $19.95 million in demand, it has the potential to explode in the near future. A $100 investment in the token has the potential to rise to $10,000 should its valuation rise to $4, making it the next crypto to explode in the near future.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-xrp-wont-be-worth-any-less-than-1000-by-2030-heres-why/,"Crypto markets test conviction like few other asset classes. Years of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and shifting narratives have forced many investors to reassess their long-term beliefs. XRP has endured all of this while remaining one of the most debated digital assets in the industry. Yet, for some builders and industry leaders, the long-term case for XRP has only strengthened as the underlying financial infrastructure continues to evolve. That conviction recently resurfaced after Dominic Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, shared a pointed long-term outlook on X. Kwok’s statement blended humor with resolve, but its foundation rested on a serious thesis. As a Web3 educator and ecosystem builder deeply embedded in blockchain development, Kwok framed XRP’s future value as a function of structural utility rather than market sentiment. His remarks resonated widely because they echoed a view increasingly held among long-term XRP proponents. fyi i did not go grey at the age of 30 for $XRP to be worth any less than $1,000 by 2030 — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 23, 2026 XRP’s Role in Future Financial Infrastructure XRP was engineered to solve liquidity inefficiencies in global finance . Its primary function as a bridge asset allows institutions to move value across borders instantly and at low cost. Supporters argue that if XRP becomes embedded in large-scale payment flows, tokenized asset settlement, and institutional liquidity corridors, its valuation must reflect utility-driven demand, not speculative cycles. In high-volume financial systems, assets that facilitate settlement often require higher unit prices to handle large transfers efficiently. From this perspective, price appreciation supports functionality rather than hype. Supply Dynamics and Liquidity Constraints Critics often reject four-figure XRP projections by citing market capitalization limits. Advocates counter that this view oversimplifies supply mechanics. While XRP’s total supply is capped , the liquid supply available on exchanges continues to decline due to long-term holding, institutional custody, escrow mechanisms, and reduced speculative float. As adoption scales, constrained liquidity could amplify price pressure rather than dilute it. In that framework, higher prices enable XRP to move significant value without destabilizing markets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Changes the Playing Field Regulatory resolution in the United States removed one of XRP’s largest obstacles. Institutions can now engage with XRP without existential legal risk, unlocking pathways for ETFs, custody solutions, and enterprise-grade settlement products. This shift reframes XRP from a legally uncertain asset into a compliant financial infrastructure. For industry builders like Kwok, regulation no longer suppresses XRP’s potential. Instead, it legitimizes its role within regulated markets. Conviction Over Certainty Kwok’s assertion does not promise timelines or guarantees. It reflects a high-conviction belief grounded in infrastructure, liquidity mechanics, and long-term adoption trends. Whether XRP ultimately reaches $1,000 by 2030 remains uncertain. What is clear is that leaders embedded in Web3 development increasingly view XRP not through short-term charts, but through the lens of a financial system still under construction.

The money was approved by Congress in 2021 to help states build EV infrastructure. But in February 2026, after Sean Duffy took over as Transportation Secretary, the Department of Transportation shut down access to the funds without going through proper legal steps. That triggered a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states and Washington D.C. The case was heard in Seattle by U.S. District Judge Tana Lin. Lin said the DOT and Federal Highway Administration “yanked the NEVI Formula Program’s cord out of the outlet” without following the rules laid out in administrative law. Judge issues permanent order against transportation department The judge didn’t just scold them. She issued a permanent order stopping the Transportation Department from taking back funds or canceling plans already approved. That means states can move ahead with the projects they planned, using money Congress already gave them. Environmental groups like the Sierra Club were happy with the ruling. So were the states. Mike Faulk, who speaks for Washington Attorney General Nick Brown, said, “Judge Lin’s order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future.” The $5 billion program was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed by Biden in 2021. It’s called the NEVI program and was set up to help states build a national network of EV chargers. States like California, Colorado, and Washington had already made their plans and were awarded the funds. But as soon as Duffy took office under President Donald Trump, the DOT suddenly stopped the money from flowing. The Trump administration claimed it was just a temporary pause. But that pause came without any legal process. Lin didn’t buy the excuse. She said the law didn’t allow for any kind of pause, even a short one. “In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,” she wrote. That earlier pause had already drawn fire from the court. A preliminary injunction forced the DOT to issue new guidance. Still, by then, a lot of damage had already been done. Projects were delayed. States were left hanging. Now the case is likely to cause more fights in Congress. The Senate is expected next week to take up a bill that would shift $879 million, money meant for EV charging, to other kinds of infrastructure. That bill already passed the House. If it passes the Senate too, some of the EV money could be rerouted despite the court’s ruling. The Trump administration has also been rolling out other steps to push gas-powered cars over electric ones. It’s been cutting EV tax breaks for buyers and backing automakers that focus on fuel engines. This court ruling won’t stop that. But it does mean the government can’t mess with state funding that was already approved. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

By merging AI with decentralized settlement, Ripple is positioning the Ledger to support smarter workflows and more efficient liquidity management. How Ripple Is Embedding Intelligence Into On-Chain Systems An analyst known as SMQKE on X has shared a case study of an AI implementation in the cross-border payment, in which Ripple has successfully combined blockchain technology and artificial intelligence to enhance the efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness of global transactions. As a leading provider of real-time cross-border payment solutions, Ripple leverages the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables real-time cross-border settlement.

However, a technical breakdown shared by crypto analyst ChartNerd argued that what looks like stagnation may actually be the final preparation phase before a historic move. The price structure suggests something far bigger that sends XRP on its most aggressive rally in eight years, but the implications only become clear when the full setup is examined. Related Reading: Bitcoin Influencers Get Spotlight In X’s New ‘Starterpacks’ A 400-Day Rectangular Reaccumulation Still Holding Structure According to technical analysis done by ChartNerd, XRP’s price action has been locked inside a rectangular reaccumulation zone for about 400 days, and this has led to the formation of what looks like a rectangular bull flag on a macro timeframe. The technical chart shows a strong impulsive move from July 2024 to December 2024 acting as the flagpole, right when XRP peaked at the $3.4 price zone back then. This impulsive flagpole has been followed by a long period of sideways trading where XRP’s price has repeatedly respected a clearly defined support around $1.8 and resistance boundaries around $3.6. This type of structure is associated with reaccumulation within the support and resistance zones, especially when it is playing out after a sharp expansion move and holding for this length of time. Each dip into reaccumulation support has been absorbed, preventing any sustained breakdown and keeping the broader pattern intact. ChartNerd noted that the rectangular flag will be valid as long as this support level is defended, and this will activate the expansion journey. XRP Price Chart. Source: @ChartNerdTA on X Macro Breakout Projection Puts XRP Price Target At $23 According to ChartNerd, bearish participants are increasingly pressured by the fact that this fractal is still holding despite repeated attempts to invalidate it. The longer XRP’s price action is trapped inside the rectangle without breaking down, the more likely it becomes that the eventual resolution favors the dominant trend that preceded the consolidation. In this case, that trend was bullish, which strengthens the case for an upside breakout once resistance is cleared. If the rectangular bull flag resolves to the upside as projected, the chart outlines a breakout trajectory that would carry XRP into double-digit territory, with a long-term target region near $23. This price target projection is derived from the height of the flagpole extended from the top of the reaccumulation range. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering ChartNerd labelled this possible move as one of the most aggressive rallies XRP could see in seven to eight years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $1.92, meaning a move toward the $23 region would represent a gain of over 1,000% from current levels, which is a type of percentage expansion XRP has played out well in the past.

The breakout above prior record highs signals a structural repricing of gold rather than a speculative spike, with analysts pointing to central bank accumulation, long-term inflation hedging, and weakening confidence in fiat currencies as key drivers behind the rally. Goldman Sachs Raises 2026 Gold Target to $5,400 Goldman Sachs has reinforced the bullish outlook by raising its 2026 gold price forecast to $5,400 per ounce, citing sustained demand from both private investors and central banks. The investment bank emphasized that recent buyers are unlikely to exit positions quickly, creating a higher price floor for gold over the medium term. According to Goldman’s commodities research team, central bank purchases, particularly from emerging markets remain a powerful structural force, while global investors increasingly view gold as a strategic hedge against geopolitical risk, fiscal imbalances, and long-term currency debasement. The bank also noted that anticipated rate cuts in coming years could further support gold by reducing real yields. David Roche: Gold Could Reach $6,000 on Central Bank Shift Veteran strategist David Roche, President of Quantum Strategy, has offered one of the more assertive institutional forecasts, suggesting gold prices could climb toward $6,000 per ounce if central banks continue reallocating reserves away from traditional currencies and into bullion. Roche argues that rising geopolitical fragmentation and declining trust in global monetary coordination are pushing policymakers toward tangible reserve assets. He has highlighted the growing preference for gold as a neutral store of value in a multipolar world, particularly among countries seeking to reduce exposure to the U.S. dollar. In this framework, gold is not merely a hedge, but a strategic monetary asset undergoing re-monetization. Wall Street: Institutional Support for Higher Gold Prices Across Wall Street, sentiment remains firmly constructive. Several major financial institutions now project gold prices well above historical norms over the next two years, reflecting a shift in long-term assumptions rather than short-term volatility. UBS aligns closely with Goldman Sachs, projecting gold prices around $5,400 per ounce, while Yardeni Research has outlined a bullish scenario targeting $6,000 amid persistent fiscal deficits and rising sovereign debt levels. Jefferies has published one of the most optimistic mainstream outlooks, suggesting gold could reach $6,600 per ounce if inflation risks and geopolitical instability remain elevated. Collectively, these forecasts indicate a growing consensus that gold’s role in global portfolios is expanding, driven by both defensive positioning and long-term strategic allocation. Robert Kiyosaki’s Long-Term Bull Case Outside traditional Wall Street analysis, investor and author Robert Kiyosaki continues to promote an aggressively bullish stance on gold. In recent posts on X, Kiyosaki has reiterated his belief that fiat currencies are entering a period of accelerated debasement, prompting investors to seek refuge in hard assets. Kiyosaki has publicly stated a long-term gold target as high as $27,000 per ounce, framing the metal as insurance against systemic financial risk rather than a conventional trade. While his projections fall well beyond institutional estimates, they reflect broader retail and alternative-investment sentiment supporting gold’s multi-year uptrend.",News|Reports,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-24 22:46:23

In a recent survey conducted by the crypto mining platform GoMining, over 5,700 Bitcoin holders shared their experiences with crypto use for everyday payments. The result showed that 55% of respondents rarely or never use crypto for daily real-world transactions. Admittedly, they claim to believe in crypto adoption and the privacy it provides. Still, they gave five reasons behind their choice. A Drawback in Infrastructure The foremost reason why many respondents do not use their crypto holdings to cover everyday payments is the lack of adequate infrastructure to enable them to do so. Over 49% of respondents (2,663) stressed that most merchants do not accept crypto as a payment method. GoMining’s CEO, Mark Zalan, emphasized this point, telling CryptoPotato that “people don’t build a new habit if they have to hunt for places that accept it.” Another 44.7% (2,400) of the survey respondents cited high fees as a barrier, while 26.8% (1,440) highlighted long transaction processing times as a challenge. Blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin, that use a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm often struggle with network speed and transaction fees. As a result, users may find themselves paying more in fees than they would with traditional payment methods. Stablecoins: A Better Option? Over 43% of respondents (2,330) cited price volatility as the reason they did not use crypto for daily payments. Granted, most cryptocurrencies, like BTC, are known for their nonstop volatility. As a result, many have flocked to stablecoins for payments. GoMining’s CEO recognized and emphasized this in his comment: “The [transaction] confirmations need to be fast, and the customer needs to know what to expect from receipts or dispute handling. That’s why stablecoin settlement and card-style systems are drawing so much attention; they lower friction for merchants while keeping the flow familiar. [. . .] Rewards can help people try it at first, but they only stick if fees are low and you can actually use it everywhere.” Finally, 36.2% (1,942) of respondents pointed to potential scams as the reason they did not embrace crypto for everyday payments. On the question of whether Zalan believes crypto should be used more for payments, he said that he doesn’t. Instead, he noted that trying to force that is part of the market confusion. “Bitcoin can play a payment role, often as a settlement and reserve layer that allows faster rails above it. However, there are numerous other tokens that are better viewed as utility for networks, tools for governance, or even as risks, not as money,” he added.

However, the route to achieving this is heavily dependent on institutions, which have yet to come on board in large numbers. Although ETFs lend credibility to the project, the current inflows only seem to contribute to the established trading ranges. On another note, a new and cheap crypto project is attracting smart investors’ interest due to its immediate high growth potential mechanics. This DeFi crypto offers a clear and immediate opportunity to gain more, making it the best crypto to buy now to achieve gains in no time. The difference between these two cryptos is quite clear: whereas one crypto waits to be validated by others, another crypto is busy creating a system to generate more wealth. The Gradual Path that XRP is Taking The forecast for 2026 shows a potential increase for XRP; however, the journey is marked by conditions. For a long time, the token has remained at a price range. It is also seen investing in new ETF products; however, these have not generated the required momentum for a breakthrough. The use of the XRP Ledger is increasing, but it still lags well behind the major competition. As such, the price increase is going to be slow and dependent on other trends within the market. For investors who are looking for investments to multiply their money rapidly, this is not the best option. It lacks the aggressive growth engines of new and more dynamic investments. Mutuum Finance Presale On the other end, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides an exact opportunity with time constraints. This cryptocurrency is in Phase 7, with the tokens being sold at $0.04. This price will soon go up by nearly 20% with the next phase. This chance to buy the cheap cryptocurrency is soon coming to an end. For instance, $500 invested now will yield 12,500 tokens. As the price is set to launch at $0.06, this particular position is expected to rise to $750, a significant immediate gain. Looking at the past trends of strong presales, the potential is much higher after that, making this a crucial time to buy into the cryptocurrency. This is why it is the best crypto to buy now for strategic investors. Earning Yield with mtTokens After the Mutuum Finance platform is launched, holders can immediately begin generating passive income. If a user decides to deposit an asset such as USDT or ETH, they are given a certain number of mtTokens. These tokens can begin generating passive income immediately. If a user has $3,000 that they have deposited, they could potentially earn a 12% return. The mtTokens can be staked in the safety module of the protocol to earn extra MUTM tokens as reward. This not only makes the deposit an earning opportunity but proves the utility of the crypto as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for earning profits. Security Through Overcollateralized Loans Mutuum Finance provides security to its users through its lending model. In its lending model, a user is expected to deposit collateral that is higher than the amount being borrowed. For instance, if a user wants to borrow $5,000, he/she is expected to deposit $7,500 worth of ETH. This means that as a lender, their money is secure and can earn interest with minimal risk involved. This robust security system, which has already passed an audit by Halborn, instills immense trust. It means that this is a long-term project that not only safeguards investors’ capital but also allows it to grow. This is exactly why it’s a top DeFi crypto. A Smart Choice for Real Growth When determining the most promising cryptocurrencies to buy today, the decision is based solely on past momentum versus future prediction. XRP’s opportunity is based solely on future ETF success and adoption rate. Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) opportunity is clearly evident by its thriving presale process and future use for earning high yields while maintaining high security standards for investors to grow their modest investments into high returns So, when it comes to making an investment where one can gain significant returns, the choice is clear. The opportunity to invest in this promising project from the ground level is available, although only for a short period of time.

Mobile phones are central. According to Vera Songwe, a former UN under-secretary-general, millions who lack bank accounts can use stablecoins to protect savings and move money faster. That access matters in places where inflation has been high and bank fees are steep. Use By Businesses And Everyday People Reports have disclosed that stablecoins now make up around 43% of all crypto transaction volume in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria alone processed nearly $22 billion in dollar-linked stablecoin activity over a recent 12-month span. That money is used for remittances, payroll and business settlements. Firms and market traders are among the biggest users, but many everyday people are joining in too. In countries such as Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia and South Africa, demand is driven by volatile local currencies and rules that limit access to dollars. Mobile money networks help push adoption along. Stablecoins Speed Up Cross-Border Payments Traditional remittances can be costly. At a World Economic Forum panel in Davos, Switzerland on Thursday, Songwe noted that sending $100 through traditional money transfer services in Africa often costs around $6, making cross-border payments both slow and costly. Stablecoins cut those costs and shorten wait times from days to minutes for many transfers. Small payments and wages can be settled quickly, and that speed changes how businesses plan cash flow. Local Rules Are Changing Fast Governments are reacting in different ways. Ghana passed a Virtual Asset Service Providers law to bring trading into a formal framework. On January 13, Nigeria required crypto platforms to link transactions to tax ID numbers, a move meant to bring activity into official records. South Africa’s central bank has warned that stablecoins and other tokens could pose risks to financial stability as use grows. Policy is being written while users and tech firms keep pushing ahead. Risks And The Road Ahead High inflation remains a core reason people are turning to stablecoins . Reports say inflation has exceeded 20% in 12 to 15 countries since the pandemic, and that reality pushes people to look for alternatives to local notes. Everyday Use, Measured Change What started as a tech niche has grown into a practical tool for many across the continent. For small and medium businesses, the benefit is clear: faster settlements and lower costs. For people without bank accounts, a smartphone can now open a route to store value in currencies less tied to local inflation. Adoption will likely keep rising, but how quickly it becomes part of mainstream finance will depend on stronger rules, better safeguards, and the continued spread of simple mobile services that people trust.

With resistance near $91,000–$92,000 and the macro downtrend looming, traders are watching closely to see if BTC will break higher or face renewed pressure. The coming days could prove decisive in shaping the next major move. Bitcoin Mirrors 2021 Cluster: History In Motion Bitcoin continues to mirror the price patterns seen during the 2021 cluster. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that the current market structure is echoing historical behavior, suggesting that similar dynamics are at play. Traders are closely watching these familiar patterns to gauge whether the cycle is repeating itself or if new trends may emerge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Bear Mode For 83 Days: Trend Pulse Confirms Structural Weakness The rules of the game remain consistent. A bearish acceleration would likely be triggered if Bitcoin breaks down from the macro descending triangle base, currently positioned around $82,000. Conversely, a bullish bias would require a decisive break above the macro downtrend, which sits near $100,000. These levels serve as critical decision points for the market, dictating whether bulls or bears gain control in the coming sessions. So far, Bitcoin has encountered rejection in the high $90,000s, falling just short of the macro downtrend. This mirrors previous market behavior, in which the asset developed a basing structure near the triangle’s base before attempting to push higher toward the downtrend’s upper boundary. It demonstrates that history is repeating itself for now, with the market consolidating and preparing for its next directional move. If the macro downtrend continues to act as resistance, the triangle’s base may gradually weaken over time. Such a development would increase the risk of further downside, making the reaction at both the base and the downtrend crucial. BTC Surpasses $91,000 Before Facing Selling Pressure In a recent market update by Ted, it was noted that while Bitcoin broke above the $91,000 threshold yesterday, the rally met significant resistance. Sellers entered the market with substantial force at these local highs, effectively capping the momentum and preventing a sustained breakout. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Sharp Pullback Raises One Question: Will $92K Hold? As a result of this rejection, Bitcoin has retreated into the “no-trading zone.” Ted suggests that this period of sideways price action is likely to persist through the next couple of days, largely driven by the typical low-liquidity environment seen during the weekend. Looking ahead, the outlook remains cautious. Ted emphasizes that any upward movements will likely be short-lived until BTC can decisively clear the $91,000 to $92,000 resistance zone. Meanwhile, such a move must be backed by strong spot demand to prove its validity.

The new crypto rulebook specifies what banks and securities firms must submit and what an external certifier must confirm before offering crypto intermediation and custody services in Brazil. Instrução Normativa (IN) BCB No. 701 was published in Brazil’s official gazette on January 23, 2026, and will become effective on February 2, 2026. Brazil’s central bank formalizes crypto entry rules IN 701 does not build Brazil’s crypto framework from the ground up. It applies sections of BCB Resolution No. 520 (Nov. 10, 2025) by defining the communication steps and the essential content needed. Under IN 701, banks must maintain current registration in Unicad. Also, they must submit independent certification via the BCB’s APS-Siscom system. If the bank does not complete all required steps, the communication is ineffective at the BCB. The bank stays barred from providing crypto services under the new rules. Banks must hire an independent, qualified certifier to verify their compliance with the BCB rules for VASPs before starting operations. The certifier must sign a declaration with the applicant bank, confirming no corporate or commercial ties that might cause a conflict of interest. User funds must be separated Certifiers must verify that institutions keep user funds separate from company assets and show evidence of reserves for all digital assets held by both customers and the company. IN 701 requires the certification to clearly evaluate each item to determine if the institution meets baseline requirements. The certification must include operational controls common in prudential frameworks. These controls involve outsourced services, especially data processing and cloud computing. It must also assess the technical and legal compliance of key suppliers, including those abroad. Recovery plans for client assets and funds are required. Governance policies, internal controls, and cybersecurity with incident response measures must also be addressed. The certifier must examine controls related to anti-financial-crime compliance, including anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, and proliferation-financing risks. They must also review market integrity procedures aimed at detecting and stopping abusive actions in the virtual-asset market. The certification should cover each required item individually. The BCB may ask the certifier for more detailed explanations if needed. IN 701 requires certifiers to verify that banks clearly inform customers about the services, support channels, key third-party providers, guarantee funds or insurance, custody processes, risks of the virtual asset and its blockchain, and the terms and risks of staking operations. The rule now mandates certifiers to retain working papers and memos for five years, enhancing the BCB’s review capability. Brazilian banks gain a faster path into crypto Isac Costa, professor and director of the Brazilian Institute of Technology and Innovation (IBIT), says banks may function without fully completing the usual authorization process for common VASPs if they secure certification. He told Valor Econômico that institutions may begin services 90 days after notifying the Central Bank, provided they have independent technical certification confirming full regulatory compliance. The rules do not name the companies that will certify institutions, but Costa thinks auditors familiar with crypto will take on this role. The central bank is likely to clarify this issue because these auditors play a key role in bringing banks into the crypto industry. This is important for Brazil’s effort to promote crypto through banks. Banks and brokerages in Brazil are interested in providing crypto trading and custody to retail investors. The BCB’s method shifts some initial verification tasks to an external certifier but retains the supervisor’s authority to review, block, or stop actions. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

This comes amid predictions that regulatory clarity and broader adoption could send the BTC price to as high as $200,000. UBS To Offer Bitcoin Trading To Some Wealth Clients Bloomberg reported that UBS is planning to launch crypto trading for some of its wealth clients, starting with its private bank clients in Switzerland. The bank will reportedly begin by offering these clients the opportunity to invest in Bitcoin and Ethereum . At the same time, the crypto offering could further expand to clients in the Pacific-Asia region and the U.S. The banking giant is currently in discussions with potential partners, and there is no clear timeline for when it could launch Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for clients. This move is said to be partly due to increased demand from wealth clients for crypto exposure. UBS also faces increased competition as other Wall Street giants are working to offer crypto trading. Morgan Stanley , in partnership with Zerohash, announced plans to launch crypto trading in the first half of this year, starting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The banking giant may soon also be able to offer its crypto products, as it has filed with the SEC to launch spot BTC, ETH, and SOL ETFs. Furthermore, JPMorgan, another of UBS’ competitors, is considering offering crypto trading to institutional clients , although this plan is still in the early stages. The bank already accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral from its clients. Last year, it also filed to offer BTC structured notes that will track the performance of the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF. Can Bank’s Entry Trigger A BTC Rally To $200,000 Kevin O’Leary predicted that Bitcoin could rally to between $150,000 and $200,000 this year, driven by the passage of the CLARITY Act. His prediction came just as White House Crypto Czar David Sacks said banks would fully enter crypto once the bill passes. As such, there is a possibility that BTC could reach this $200,000 psychological level in anticipation of the amount of new capital that could flow into BTC from these banks once the bill passes. BitMine’s Chairman, Tom Lee, also predicted during a CNBC interview that Bitcoin could reach between $200,000 and $250,000 this year, partly due to growing institutional adoption by Wall Street giants. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that a BTC rally to $200,000 is the “most obvious thing in the world” to him. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $89,600, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Bitcoin News|Assets Under Management|AUM|binance|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BitMine|BlackRock Bitcoin ETF|Bloomberg|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Changpeng “CZ” Zhao|CLARITY Act|CNBC|Coinmarketcap|David Sacks|ETH|Ethereum|JPMorgan|Kevin O'Leary|Morgan Stanley|SEC|SOL ETFs|solana|Tom Lee|UBS|White House Crypto Czar|Zerohash,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 00:30:06

Although frustration is growing due to Ethereum’s inability to hold above $3,000, some technical analysts are quick to point out that the structure forming beneath the surface tells a very different story. According to one analyst, the real risk right now is not being bullish on Ethereum and trying to short in anticipation of a downside breakout. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering Higher Lows And A Structure That Keeps Tightening The analyst’s technical view on Ethereum is focused less on short-term momentum and more on the structure developing on the chart, which he argues is even clearer than what is currently visible on Bitcoin’s chart. Notably, Ethereum’s price action is carving out a series of higher lows on the daily candlestick timeframe chart to form a tightening triangular pattern since December 2025. This kind of behavior shows that each pullback is being absorbed at progressively higher levels, which is how strong trends reset before continuation. Ethereum needs to avoid a breakdown below key support zones in order for this trend continuation setup to still be valid. According to the analyst, a dip under $2,860 would begin to weaken the pattern, while a close below $2,780 would invalidate the higher-low structure. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,950, which is dangerously close to the lower boundary of this setup. Therefore, some traders will be tempted to short Ethereum at this level, but the analyst called it the dumbest thing to do here. As long as those levels ($2,860 and $2,780) hold, the analyst sees no technical justification for betting against ETH, especially near the lower boundary of the channel where buyers have repeatedly stepped in. If support holds, the next move would be a gradual return to the upper trendline of the channel, which is just below $3,340. A move into that region would bring price back into direct contact with overhead resistance and set the stage for a breakout if buying pressure continues to increase. Ethereum Price Chart. Source: @Tryrexcrypto on X The Bigger Picture Behind Ethereum’s Price Action Ethereum is entering 2026 without clear bullish momentum, a reality that has dampened sentiment across the spot and derivatives markets. Spot ETF inflows into Ethereum and Bitcoin have slowed down, and issuers have been highlighted with consistent days of outflows. Nonetheless, major asset managers are still holding huge amounts of Ethereum and are working on diversifying their activities on Ethereum. BlackRock, for example, filed with the SEC in December to launch a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund, a move that will bring in more institutional investors into the Ethereum ecosystem.

Optimism price prediction for 2029 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $2.40. In 2032, OP tokens will range between $2.10 and $4.60, with an average value of $3.05. Optimism’s (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform’s initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the OP price prediction for 2026 – 2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.3052 Market Cap $593.68M Trading Volume $36.89M Circulating Supply 1.944B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.2519 (Dec 26, 2025) 24-hour High $0.3062 24-hour Low $0.30 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 8.09% (High) 50-Day SMA $0.3059 14-Day RSI 47.90 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.5141 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP is down ~15% from its recent high and is now range-bound near local support. Daily momentum is bearish but decelerating, hinting at possible short-term stabilization. The 4-hour structure remains weak, with sellers firmly defending the $0.31–$0.32 zone. Optimism 1-day price chart On the 1-day chart for January 25, OP is trading around $0.305, stabilizing after a strong impulsive rally that topped near $0.358, marking roughly a 15% pullback from the recent peak. The rejection from the upper Bollinger Band and failure to hold above the mid-band near $0.322 confirms that bullish momentum has cooled materially. OP is now compressing just above the lower Bollinger Band around $0.286, suggesting sellers are losing aggression but buyers are not yet stepping in decisively. OPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD has crossed into negative territory with expanding red histogram bars, signaling bearish continuation risk, although the flattening slope hints that downside momentum is slowing rather than accelerating. A daily close below $0.300 would expose $0.286 quickly, while reclaiming $0.322 is required to shift the structure back toward recovery. Optimism 4-hour price chart On the 4-hour timeframe, OP remains structurally weak, trading below the Alligator averages with the “mouth” opening downward, which reinforces a short-term bearish bias. The coin has repeatedly failed to reclaim the $0.309–$0.318 resistance band, confirming this zone as active supply, while support at $0.300 has been tested multiple times and is thinning. OPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The OBV continues to trend lower, showing persistent distribution and lack of meaningful accumulation, despite minor green candles attempting to form a base. The bounce from $0.295 was shallow, less than 4%, indicating reactive buying rather than confident dip demand. As long as OP remains capped below $0.318, upside attempts are likely to be sold into, with a breakdown risking a sweep toward $0.285–$0.295. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.3186 SELL SMA 5 $0.3096 SELL SMA 10 $0.3156 SELL SMA 21 $0.3195 SELL SMA 50 $0.3059 SELL SMA 100 $0.3505 SELL SMA 200 $0.5141 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.3229 SELL EMA 5 $0.3199 SELL EMA 10 $0.3099 SELL EMA 21 $0.3008 BUY EMA 50 $0.3214 SELL EMA 100 $0.3925 SELL EMA 200 $0.5338 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Unless OP reclaims $0.322 with conviction, the path of least resistance remains sideways-to-down, with a higher probability of a support test near $0.29 before any sustainable upside attempt. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it’s risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you’re willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Optimism historic price sentiment Optimism price history by Coingecko OP launched with an initial value of $4.57 on May 31 but dropped sharply in June due to the UST stablecoin de-pegging and LUNA collapse, closing June at $0.5434. It further declined to $0.4147 by mid-July. In August, OP briefly surged above $1.90, but by mid-October, it dropped to $0.70 following the FTX collapse. In Q1 2023, OP surged past $3.00 during a crypto bull run but lost 66% shortly after. A recovery saw it close the year at $3.90. OP saw an eventful 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.85 in March before sliding below $2.30 by mid-April. After a brief recovery to over $2.90 in May, it entered a bearish phase, trading at $1.82–$1.96 by July and $1.54–$1.62 by October. November brought a spark of hope with a peak at $2.60. OP closed December within the range of $1.611–$2.773. In January 2025, OP peaked at $2.18 but lost momentum, dropping to as low as $0.84 in February. OP peaked at $0.9346 in March, $0.8523 in May, $0.7478 in June, and in July, $0.86. In August, OP traded between $0.6178 and $0.880, and in September, it maintained an average price of $0.74. In November, OP traded between $0.2888 – $0.4516, and in December, the coin traded between $0.3117 – $0.3264.

The decline is also accompanied by other key factors, such as negative funding rates, indicating a strong bearish bias. Analysts have also pointed out that a decline to $2,700 is also a real possibility. With this being said, this environment makes a perfect scenario for investors to look to a project that has a good opportunity in hand instead of waiting on a potential recovery in a project’s growth. As of today, what is clear is that instead of a failing giant being the crypto to consider buying today, a thriving new crypto in a live presale phase is what’s needed to steer clear of any uncertainty in today’s crypto environment. Ethereum’s Bearish Pressure The current position of Ethereum is a worrying factor. The price drop to less than $3,000 and the current negative funding rate indicate that the price is likely to continue falling as the number of investors betting on the price drop increases. There is a significant withdrawal of money from Ethereum ETFs. Despite the purchases by the large holders, the price continues falling. As technical analysis shows, the next major support point for the cryptocurrency is at $2,627, implying further loss. For the investor, it is a precarious position to be in. Investing in something that may continuously lose value is not the best strategy. Therefore, it is not advisable to invest in Ethereum if one is wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to buy now for growth. The best strategy is to invest in a crypto with an upward trend.

Its presale is ongoing and is currently in Phase 7 at a price per token of $0.04. It is expected to increase to $0.045 in the next phase; hence, it is a one-time opportunity to purchase at a low price. For example, an investment of $400 will yield 10,000 MUTM tokens. With the set price of $0.06 at the time of its launch, this holding has the potential to increase up to $600 in a short period of time by a remarkable $200. Additionally, the analysts have predicted a tremendous demand for this crypto in the future after its listing, in which the initial profit from the presale can multiply 30x. This will turn $400 into $12,000, placing this new crypto in the top spot for the best crypto to buy now. Profit from Direct Peer-to-Peer Lending The Mutuum Finance platform will allow users to make Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This feature enables users to make mutually agreed-on deals with specific conditions that offer better returns. For instance, users can make a $2,000 loan directly with a person they trust at 18% annual interest. This generates $360 in pure profit annually. It is an ideal model for tokens which might not be a good fit for the regular pools, thus offering a more lucrative arrangement. It ensures the lender has full control while earning yields which far surpass the regular bank. This earning ability makes it an ideal reason for considering this as the best crypto to invest in. Growth through the Buy-Back Distribution Model Mutuum Finance has an effective model of buying and distribution to reward long-term holders. Some of the fees on the platform will be used to buy MUTM tokens on the market, which will later be distributed as dividends to the users who have staked their funds. If one has tokens worth $5,000 as a deposit, they can stake them on the Mutuum platform. If the protocol has $500,000 in fees that are allocated towards buybacks, they could earn an additional $1,000 in a distribution round of MUTM. This leads to an ecosystem that will continue to create value, making it a solid DeFi crypto in which to invest. A Strategic Investment Decision The debate on the best crypto to invest in currently has an obvious answer. The price trend of Ethereum is going downwards and is bearish. On the other hand, there is an opportunity for gains from the presale of Mutuum Finance, making profits from the yield farming opportunity and tokenomics. Buying MUTM is a strategic move into a project that already has working mechanics before its main launch. For investors looking to secure their wealth, the decision is obvious. The window for the presale is not infinite, and the time to take action is now.

The company, listed publicly and based in Oklahoma, holds major deposits of heavy rare earths across the U.S. The funding comes as Washington scrambles to secure control of materials key to national defense, energy, and tech supply chains. The federal government will take a 10% stake in the miner through 16.1 million shares priced at $17.17 each, and warrants for another 17.6 million at the same price. The total equity buy is worth $277 million, but the government is already looking at an implied profit of $490 million based on the company’s current stock price of $24.77. That’s just the equity side. A separate $1.3 billion in senior secured debt is also being handed over, coming from a finance facility inside the Commerce Department, created under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Government boosts rare earth output with direct investment One official at the Chips office, the group that led the negotiations, said they’re “focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and U.S. national security.” The office operates under the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which falls under the Commerce Department. That department has so far refused to comment publicly on the transaction. The debt portion of the deal will be issued at market rates and structured directly with USA Rare Earth. The move comes as investors are swarming around anything linked to rare earths. Earlier this week, Trump said the U.S. had finalized a “framework” that might lead to deals involving Greenland’s untapped mineral reserves. One insider made it clear, though: this deal has nothing to do with Greenland. Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year, with a 40% jump just this week. The company is now valued at $3.7 billion and is working on a massive rare earth mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas. It says the site holds 15 out of 17 rare earth elements used to build phones, fighter jets, and missiles. It’s also building a magnet production plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Cantor joins private financing while Trump expands control This federal funding isn’t happening in a vacuum. USA Rare Earth is also raising over $1 billion in private equity through a separate deal. That effort is being handled by Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street giant once owned by Howard Lutnick, who is now Trump’s Commerce Secretary. His sons run it now. The private money raise is not connected to the government investment, but it’s part of a bigger push. The company only needed $500 million to satisfy the terms of the government deal, it’s already cleared that number. The funding method used is known as a Pipe (private investment in public equity). Demand for the deal has been high, according to sources close to the company. Cantor helped the company go public last year via a blank cheque vehicle in March. While Cantor didn’t advise on the federal deal, the firm’s role is clearly growing under Trump’s America First push. And this isn’t the administration’s first rodeo in this space. Just last year, it poured money into MP Materials, Lithium Americas, Trilogy Metals, and others. Some of those deals raised eyebrows. For example, the government invested in Vulcan Elements, a rare earth start-up, three months after Donald Trump Jr’s venture group bought in. The defense and commerce departments have been working closely to boost local production. USA Rare Earth is the latest piece of that effort, but it won’t be the last. The White House is serious about locking down minerals supply, and Trump is making sure that happens by getting the government directly involved in ownership. Including rare earths. Including chips. Including steel. Including whatever else they decide matters to the flag. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

As top altcoin picks like Ethereum gear up for $4,000-$5,000 forecasts per Binance and Kraken analyses, a bold newcomer like APEMARS is stealing the spotlight with its epic Mars conquest narrative, Commander Ape rallying a degen crew through scarcity burns and viral rewards. But with presale Stage 5 live at just $0.00003629 and over $109K raised, the clock is ticking: Will you join before prices surge to the $0.0055 listing, unlocking 15,000%+ ROI? Imagine staking your $APRZ holdings right after presale, only to see 63% APY rewards ignite two months post-launch, compounding your gains as the community expands like a rocket blasting off. While XRP’s bullish highs might reach $10-14 in optimistic AI scenarios from Yahoo Finance, and Ethereum pushes toward $7K-$9K if upgrades like Glamsterdam deliver, APEMARS’ deflationary tokenomics and referral bonuses are creating real FOMO, turning early investors into potential millionaires. But stages are selling out fast; hesitate, and you might watch from the sidelines as this meme coin hero claims the 2026 throne. APEMARS Presale Stage 3: 2026’s Top Altcoin Picks? As we dive deeper into top altcoin picks for 2026, APEMARS stands out like a rocket ready for liftoff. This fun yet strategic meme coin draws from an epic story of Commander Ape’s solo trip to Mars, turning it into a community-driven adventure that’s pulling in investors fast. With its live presale in Stage 5 at just $0.00003629 per token, and a listing price eyed at $0.0055, it’s whispering huge potential returns that could make early joiners smile big. Backed by smart token burns and rewards, APEMARS isn’t just hype; it’s built for lasting momentum in a market where XRP price predictions show steady climbs but might lack that viral spark. What sets APEMARS apart in the 2026 landscape? Picture a coin where scarcity meets storytelling, rewarding holders while building a “degen crew” that’s growing by the day. Over $109,000 raised already, with Stage 5 filling fast and the next stage kicking in soon. If you’re eyeing top altcoin picks beyond Ethereum’s scaling plays or XRP’s regulatory wins, APEMARS could be the underdog that delivers the thrill. APEMARS Investment Scenario: Crunching the Numbers for 15,000%+ ROI Potential Let’s talk numbers, because in top altcoin picks for 2026, the math behind APEMARS screams opportunity. Say you invest $1,000 now in Stage 5 at $0.00003629 that nets you about 27,555,800 tokens. Fast-forward to the $0.0055 listing price, and your stack could be worth $151,556.90, a jaw-dropping 15,000% returns. That’s not pie-in-the-sky; it’s based on the project’s deflationary setup, with 50% of the 70 billion total supply in presale and burns trimming the fat along the way. How to Buy APEMARS: Simple Steps to Join the Presale Before It’s Gone Getting into APEMARS is straightforward, perfect for anyone chasing top altcoin picks without the hassle. First, head to the official site at APEMARS.com and connect your Ethereum wallet. MetaMask works great. Pick your amount (ETH, USDT, or card options available), confirm the swap, and boom, your $APRZ tokens are claimed post-presale. To amp up the FOMO, hit that $22 minimum for a referral code and share it earn 9.34% bonuses while building your crew. With Stage 5 ticking down fast (just days left before the price jumps), this is your shot to lock in before the burns and listings kick values higher. In a market buzzing with XRP price predictions and Ethereum upgrades, APEMARS feels like the fresh bet that could pay off big. Don’t let this stage slip away. XRP: Steady Momentum Amid ETF Buzz and Banking Adoption XRP is showing real resilience early in 2026. The coin started the year up 13%, and fresh news highlights Ripple’s push into institutional finance. Ripple’s president recently said 2026 could mark the shift to full crypto adoption in banks, while ETF inflows and chart patterns suggest a potential reversal soon. Price predictions for XRP in 2026 range from conservative averages of $2.20 (CoinCodex) to more optimistic calls of $3.18–$3.49 (Changelly), with some analysts floating $10–$14 if regulatory wins and global use keep accelerating. Even bolder takes mention of $18+ if XRP narrows the gap with Bitcoin. Solid, reliable growth but without the explosive narrative many are craving right now. Ethereum: Upgrades and On-Chain Strength Set the Stage for Bigger Moves Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and smart contracts. On-chain activity is picking up again, with more staking, whale accumulation, and ETF interest building quietly in the background. Forecasts for 2026 look promising: averages between $4,565 and $5,201 (Changelly), with some firms like Standard Chartered calling for $7,500 by year-end, thanks to supply dynamics and upcoming upgrades like Glamsterdam that should make transactions faster and cheaper. Short-term targets sit around $3,455–$3,900 in the next few weeks. Ethereum delivers steady, fundamentals-driven upside, but it lacks that viral, community-fueled spark that can create sudden moonshots. While XRP and Ethereum offer dependable paths forward in 2026’s altcoin landscape, APEMARS brings a completely different energy scarcity through burns, 63% staking APY waiting to unlock, and an epic Mars story that’s filling up fast in presale Stage 5. With the next price jump just days away, this could be the wildcard that surprises everyone. Wrapping Up 2026’s Altcoin Market: Steady Giants Meet Bold Newcomers As we look ahead to 2026, the altcoin market feels like a mix of proven paths and fresh adventures. XRP price prediction points to reliable growth around $2 to $4 on average, backed by regulatory progress and banking ties that could push it higher in bullish scenarios. Ethereum builds on its strengths with upgrades aiming for $4,000 to $5,000 averages, offering solid returns through DeFi and staking. These top altcoin picks provide a foundation for investors seeking stability in a shifting space. Yet, in this evolving scene, options like APEMARS add an exciting layer with its scarcity burns, 63% staking rewards set to launch soon after listing, and a fun Mars conquest story that’s drawing in a growing community. With presale Stage 5 moving quickly at $0.00003629 and a potential 15,000% ROI to the $0.0055 listing, it reminds us that sometimes the most rewarding journeys start small but build fast. For those eyeing top altcoin picks, keeping an open mind to these underdogs could make all the difference. After all, the next big win might just be one bold step away. According to the best crypto to buy now , top altcoin picks for 2026 emphasize projects with strong narratives and utilities, like APEMARS’ Mars-themed ecosystem. Remember, past performance isn’t indicative of future results, invest only what you can afford to lose, and consult financial advisors to align strategies with your risk tolerance.

XRP price prediction 2026 varies across sources, with averages clustering around $2 to $4 based on CoinCodex and Changelly analyses. Bullish scenarios from AI models like Grok and Perplexity suggest highs up to $14 if ETF approvals and banking adoption accelerate, while conservative forecasts hover at $2.20 amid market volatility. Investors should monitor regulatory developments closely for accurate trends. Will XRP reach $10 in 2026? XRP price prediction 2026 includes optimistic takes where it could hit $10 or more, per FXEmpire and FastBull, driven by ETF inflows exceeding $10 billion and fractal setups signaling breakouts. However, base cases from Motley Fool and Kraken predict $2 to $4 averages, requiring strong macro conditions and institutional growth to achieve such highs without major pullbacks. How much will XRP be worth in 2026 according to AI models? XRP price prediction 2026 from AI like ChatGPT, Grok, and Claude ranges from under $2 in bearish views to over $14 in upside cases, with base clusters at $2 to $4. Yahoo Finance highlights divergence: Grok sees $10 potential, while Perplexity pushes $9, emphasizing factors like regulatory wins and adoption for explosive growth. What factors could influence XRP price prediction 2026? XRP price prediction 2026 depends on ETF buzz, Ripple’s banking partnerships, and upgrades like Glamsterdam for Ethereum competitors. Sources like Binance and Kraken note on-chain activity, whale accumulation, and global adoption as key drivers, potentially pushing averages to $3.50, but volatility from macro risks could cap gains unless institutional inflows surge. Is APEMARS a better altcoin pick than XRP for 2026 ROI? While XRP price prediction 2026 forecasts steady $2 to $4 growth, APEMARS offers explosive potential with 15,000% ROI from Stage 5 presale at $0.00003629 to $0.0055 listing. It’s staking at 63% APY and deflationary burns create FOMO, positioning it as a high-risk, high-reward meme coin alternative for investors seeking viral momentum over XRP’s stability. AEO Summary XRP price prediction 2026 points to averages of $2 to $4, with bullish highs reaching $10 to $14 amid ETF approvals and banking adoption, according to CoinCodex, Changelly, and AI models like Grok. In the altcoin landscape, Ethereum eyes $4,000 to $5,000 via upgrades, but APEMARS steals focus as a top altcoin pick in live presale Stage 5 at $0.00003629, promising 15,000% ROI to $0.0055 listing.

The jump has widened the price gap with the U.S., where local Chinese buyers are now paying a $9 premium over global levels. It’s no longer just a rally. It’s a physical scramble. People are lining up in Shenzhen, emptying shelves, and banks are struggling to keep up. China’s shortage of silver is no longer isolated. Refineries in Turkey are reporting zero stock for the past 10 days, especially on 10 oz and 100 oz bars. Buyers there are offering premiums of up to $9 per ounce, the same premium seen in China. Meanwhile, a recent Korea Mint sale sold out in just one hour, giving more proof that physical demand is spiraling out of control across Asia. Trump’s second term fuels a wave of silver buying across Asia The price pressure started rising right after Donald Trump returned to the White House and launched attacks on the Federal Reserve. Since early January, silver has jumped another 30%, after gaining nearly 150% in 2025. It started with Chinese buyers snapping up coins and bars, but now the hunger is spreading into India, Turkey, and the Middle East. Firat Sekerci, a bullion dealer based in Dubai, said this is the wildest buying he’s seen. Firat said Turkish refiners have had no stock for days, and demand hasn’t slowed. Because of that, banks have shifted their shipping priorities toward Turkey and nearby regions. This has led to fewer shipments reaching India, where demand is climbing again. Right now, demand in India is even hotter than it was during the Diwali buying rush last October. Back then, people bought everything ahead of the festival, while tariffs kept metal stuck in the U.S., and that drained liquidity in London. That squeeze pushed benchmark prices to levels not seen since the 1970s. But now, India is going through it again, with buyers grabbing smaller bars and coins, especially from MMTC-PAMP, the country’s biggest refiner. The company’s boss, Samit Guha, said interest hasn’t slowed. Even Elon Musk got involved in December. He posted on X about new Chinese export rules, right as silver demand started blowing up outside China. China shipped around 5,100 tons of silver in 2025 . That’s the biggest number in over 16 years, based on customs data. So while people are panicking over possible export controls, the numbers suggest things haven’t tightened just yet. But nerves are high. China has already tightened exports on other materials like antimony and rare earths, and no one’s ruling out that silver could be next. This entire shortage was kicked off by a short squeeze back in October, when local supply problems spiraled out across the globe. It’s a reminder that in this market, if China runs dry, everyone feels it. And right now, Shanghai is sucking up every ounce it can find.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $88,990 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This price movement represents a notable shift from recent trading ranges and has sparked intense analysis among traders and institutional investors worldwide. Market analysts immediately began scrutinizing trading volumes, liquidity conditions, and macroeconomic indicators to understand the driving forces behind this sudden decline. Bitcoin Price Action and Immediate Market Reaction The descent below $89,000 marks a crucial psychological level for Bitcoin traders. Consequently, this breach triggered automated sell orders across multiple exchanges. Trading volume surged by approximately 35% in the hour following the drop, according to aggregated exchange data. Meanwhile, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization decreased by 2.8% within the same period. Major exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance reported increased sell-side pressure, particularly in the USDT and USD trading pairs. The futures market also showed heightened activity, with open interest fluctuating significantly as traders adjusted their positions. Historical data reveals that Bitcoin has tested the $89,000 support level three times in the past quarter. Each previous test resulted in either a swift rebound or a consolidation phase. The current price sits just above the 50-day simple moving average, a key technical indicator watched by algorithmic traders. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped into neutral territory, suggesting the potential for either continued selling or a stabilization period. Market sentiment, as measured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, shifted from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ following the price movement. Contextual Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Volatility Several macroeconomic and sector-specific factors typically contribute to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Firstly, traditional financial markets experienced mild turbulence this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite showing slight declines. Secondly, comments from Federal Reserve officials regarding interest rate policies often impact risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Additionally, blockchain data indicates a recent increase in Bitcoin transfers to exchanges, a metric often associated with selling pressure. The network’s hash rate remains stable, indicating no fundamental change in the security or operation of the Bitcoin network itself. Regulatory developments continue to influence market psychology. For instance, recent statements from financial authorities in major economies can create uncertainty. Moreover, the performance of other major cryptocurrencies, often called ‘altcoins,’ frequently correlates with Bitcoin’s movements. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, also saw a 3.1% decline in the same period. The table below shows key market metrics before and after the price drop: Metric Before Drop (Approx.) After Drop (Approx.) BTC Price (Binance USDT) $89,450 $88,990 24-Hour Trading Volume $28.5B $38.7B Market Dominance 52.3% 51.8% Futures Funding Rate +0.01% -0.005% Technical analysts highlight several important support and resistance levels. The next major support zone lies between $87,500 and $88,000, an area where significant buying interest emerged during previous market cycles. On the other hand, resistance is now expected near the $90,500 and $91,200 levels, which previously acted as support. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart is showing early signs of a bearish crossover, a development that technical traders monitor closely. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure and Liquidity Financial institutions with cryptocurrency research divisions have published immediate analyses. For example, analysts often cite the role of large holders, known as ‘whales,’ in providing or absorbing liquidity during volatile periods. On-chain data services report that whale wallet activity increased in the 12 hours preceding the drop. Furthermore, the options market shows a rising demand for put options (bearish bets) at the $88,000 and $85,000 strike prices for the monthly expiry. This activity suggests some traders are hedging against further downside risk. Market structure relies heavily on liquidity, which refers to the ease of buying or selling an asset without drastically affecting its price. Order book data from several exchanges reveals that the bid-side liquidity (buy orders) thinned noticeably just below the $89,100 level. This thinning likely accelerated the downward move once that level broke. Market makers, entities that provide constant buy and sell quotes, reportedly widened their spreads temporarily to manage their risk exposure. This is a standard practice during periods of high volatility and order flow imbalance. Historical Comparisons and Cycle Analysis Bitcoin’s history is characterized by periods of intense volatility followed by consolidation. A comparison to previous market cycles can provide context, though past performance never guarantees future results. For instance, in the 2021 bull market, Bitcoin experienced over twenty separate corrections of 10% or more before reaching its all-time high. These pullbacks are considered normal and healthy by many long-term investors, as they can shake out over-leveraged positions and establish stronger support levels for future advances. The current market phase differs from previous ones in several key aspects: Institutional Participation: Significant capital from ETFs and corporate treasuries now provides a different base of demand. Regulatory Clarity: While evolving, the regulatory environment in major jurisdictions is more defined than in earlier cycles. Market Infrastructure: Sophisticated trading tools, derivatives, and custody solutions have matured considerably. Macro Correlation: Bitcoin has shown periods of both correlation and decoupling with traditional risk assets like tech stocks. Long-term holders, defined as wallets that have not moved Bitcoin for over 155 days, continue to hold a historically high percentage of the circulating supply. This behavior often indicates a strong conviction in the asset’s long-term value proposition, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. The illiquid supply, or coins unlikely to be sold soon, has been trending upward throughout the year, according to data from analytics firms. Conclusion The Bitcoin price movement below $89,000 serves as a reminder of the inherent volatility within cryptocurrency markets. This event highlights the complex interplay between technical levels, market sentiment, liquidity, and broader financial conditions. While short-term price action captures attention, the fundamental aspects of the Bitcoin network—its security, decentralization, and fixed supply—remain unchanged. Market participants will now watch for whether this level becomes a new resistance point or a base for the next leg of market structure development. The Bitcoin price will likely continue to be a key indicator for the overall digital asset ecosystem in the coming days and weeks. FAQs Q1: Why did the Bitcoin price fall below $89,000? Market analysts attribute the drop to a combination of factors including thin bid-side liquidity at a key technical level, broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets, and potential profit-taking by short-term traders after a period of consolidation near higher prices. Q2: What is the significance of the $89,000 level for Bitcoin? The $89,000 level acted as both support and resistance in recent trading history. Its breach is psychologically significant for market participants and often triggers automated trading algorithms, which can amplify price movements in either direction. Q3: How does this price drop compare to historical Bitcoin corrections? Corrections of this magnitude (around 1-3%) are relatively common in Bitcoin’s trading history. During previous bull markets, the asset frequently experienced deeper pullbacks exceeding 10% while maintaining its overall long-term upward trajectory. Q4: What should traders monitor after this Bitcoin price movement? Traders typically watch order book liquidity, futures market funding rates, on-chain movement from large holders, and broader equity market performance. The reaction at the next key support level (around $87,500-$88,000) will be particularly telling for short-term direction. Q5: Does this price change affect the long-term outlook for Bitcoin? Most long-term analysts distinguish between short-term volatility and long-term fundamentals. Factors like adoption, regulatory developments, and technological upgrades are generally considered more significant for the multi-year outlook than any single day’s price action.

One side is booming thanks to industrial exports tied to global demand for AI infrastructure. The other side, built around domestic consumption, is still struggling. This divide is now driving every major investor decision, with big firms like Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Asset Management choosing to back the exporters and ignore the local retailers. Manufacturing and tech-related companies are dominating. The ones focused on local consumers are falling further behind. Investors are done waiting for a broad recovery. They’re now betting on the side of China that is delivering real earnings from real demand. Export stocks rise as investors chase AI infrastructure gains William Bratton from BNP Paribas Exane said: “There are clearly two very different Chinas at the moment.” He said his team prefers materials, industrials, and technology over anything consumer-facing, and that earnings numbers prove why. The winners are easy to spot. China XD Electric, a big player in ultra-high-voltage grid work, is up 75% this year. TBEA, which makes electrical components, is up 28%. These companies are riding the global push for artificial intelligence buildouts, and they’re cashing in. Morgan Stanley just backed a group of stocks they think will ride this momentum. Their picks include Sany Heavy Industry, Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic, Han’s Laser, and Wuxi Lead Intelligent. Their analysts, including Sheng Zhong, said, “Construction machinery is entering an improvement cycle, with the domestic recovery continuing along with overseas demand.” They’re seeing what they called “decent growth momentum” in exports. Min Lan Tan from UBS said, “I think industrials outperformance will continue because that’s where there’s a lot of structural growth that is happening.” She added, “Nobody can afford to really step back from this AI race.” That demand is pushing forecasts higher. Over the past six months, the CSI 300 Industrials Index saw a 10% rise in earnings expectations. For the consumer index, it was just 5%. The difference says it all. Consumer stocks fall as property problems drag on Retail-linked names aren’t getting the same love. Fuyao Glass Industry is down 5.4% this year. Great Wall Motor has dropped 4.6%. The main issue is China’s property crisis, which still hasn’t been fixed. People just aren’t spending. The recovery that was supposed to boost domestic demand hasn’t shown up. Chaoping Zhu from JPMorgan Asset Management said the big investors he talks to aren’t confident in local demand coming back. “They remain cautious about domestic recovery, focusing instead on the earnings growth potential of the ‘going global’ theme,” he said. Zhu also said the Chinese government is now leaning harder into advanced manufacturing and tech, trying to use the stock market to boost both capital formation and household wealth. Of course, this industrial boom isn’t bulletproof. If foreign countries push back on cheap Chinese goods, the party could end fast. But right now, Beijing’s top policy focus is still on fixing consumption. That means some bargain hunters might look at beaten-down consumer stocks — if they’re brave enough.

It is estimated that the losses are at “hundreds of billions of won,” though the exact figure has not been publicly confirmed. Bitcoin Missing From Government Storage The incident reportedly came to light during a routine internal inspection of seized financial assets, a process that includes checking passwords and access information kept on removable storage devices such as USB drives. A prosecution official cited in local coverage said the loss may have occurred after someone accidentally accessed a so-called “fake site” while conducting the inspection. This has raised the possibility that the BTC was compromised through a scam link rather than a direct breach of a secured system. Meanwhile, another local media, “The Chosun Daily,” reported that roughly 70 billion won (about $47.7 million) worth of Bitcoin was missing, and that the suspected cause was a phishing attack triggered when an agency worker visited a fraudulent website. The report stated that the wallet password or access credentials may have been exposed externally, which enabled attackers to drain the seized holdings. Authorities are reportedly working to determine the circumstances of the loss and trace the whereabouts of the seized assets, but could not disclose specifics. Phishing Threats Persist Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used to steal crypto, and they rely on spoofed websites or messages designed to trick victims into entering sensitive information such as private keys or login details. These scams threaten both individual and institutional crypto holders across the world. Earlier this year, users of Ledger, the prominent France-based crypto hardware wallet company, were targeted in a phishing scam following a data breach at its e-commerce partner, Global-e. After Ledger confirmed that customer contact and order details were exposed, scammers sent personalized emails claiming a fake merger between Ledger and Trezor. The messages instructed users to “migrate” their wallets by entering 24-word recovery phrases on a spoofed site. In December, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen warned of a rise in phishing scams using fake Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings to steal crypto. Hackers send bogus links via Telegram or fake Calendly pages, then claim audio or connection issues during calls to trick victims into downloading malware. Chen urged users to verify meeting links, avoid installing software during calls, and report suspicious contacts immediately.

Amid rising pressure from US President Donald Trump for lower borrowing costs, the Fed has urged Washington officials to stay focused on this goal. The officials are expected to reaffirm this stance when they wrap up their two-day meeting on Wednesday, January 28. At the same time, analysts predict that central banks in countries such as Brazil, Canada , and Sweden are also likely to maintain their current interest rates given the prevailing economic conditions. The Fed encountered a tense moment amid Trump’s demands Regarding the Fed’s recent decision , sources close to the situation, who wished to remain anonymous, as the discussions were private, unveiled that the three central banks teamed up with more than a dozen others, including the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB), who proved to be Fed chair Jerome Powell’s strong supporters. Under this collaboration, these banks stressed the importance of independence at a time when the administration in Washington exerted heightened pressure on Powell and the team. To demonstrate the intensity of the situation, reports highlighted that, in addition to the US president repeatedly complaining about the Fed chair’s cautious approach to lowering interest rates, the Fed is currently facing grand jury subpoenas, suggesting the possibility of criminal charges. On the other hand, the Supreme Court reviewed arguments presented regarding whether Trump can proceed with his motive to dismiss Lisa Cook, a Member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors of the United States. Following this drama, central banks worldwide have adopted a strategic approach to their operations to counter mounting international pressures. However, they still raise concerns due to several challenging global situations, including a recent market crash in Japan, rising investor tensions over Trump’s interest in Greenland, and his escalating threats to international trade flows . Regarding this matter, Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, commented that the world is currently more vulnerable to sudden changes. Georgieva made this statement during the closing session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, further arguing that things have taken a different turn nowadays. Several analysts also weighed in on the topic. They noted that, “We believe that most members of the FOMC can find data that supports keeping rates unchanged at the upcoming meeting. This level of agreement would show support for Powell, who has faced strong criticism from the White House. The key figures to watch are Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman: If they join the majority in voting to keep rates steady, they will signal their backing for Powell — especially regarding Fed independence. We think Waller will vote with the majority, but Bowman may disagree.” In the meantime, policymakers noted that while they are concerned about the negative impact of tariffs on economic expansion, they remain focused on monitoring potential inflationary pressures in today’s climate. Uncertainties surround the fate of the Fed’s decision on interest rates A group of 18 central banks worldwide is set to attend meetings scheduled for decision-making sessions next week. Following this announcement, several analysts anticipated that central banks in Africa would take a different approach from the Fed, thereby supporting new easing measures as they adapt to shifting economic conditions. On the other hand, sources noted that inflation reports from Australia to Brazil and Japan, along with Chinese industrial profits and European GDP figures, will be major highlights. In the meantime, officials from the Fed are expected to maintain interest rates steady after implementing three consecutive rate reductions by late 2025. At this moment, analysts predict that Powell will propose that the current policy is fit for purpose for the time being, but the Fed chair will not outline upcoming changes to interest rates. With this approach in place, officials can take their time to observe how previous rate reductions have affected the country’s economic progress.

Instead, tax policy and regulatory treatment are the main hurdles, according to a senior executive at Bitcoin financial firm Strive. Pierre Rochard, a board member of Strive and a veteran of Bitcoin treasury management, stated this week that while improvements in scaling technologies – tools that speed up transactions and reduce costs – continue to develop, it’s the way BTC is taxed that prevents it from functioning as ordinary money in everyday transactions. Using an athletic analogy to explain BTC’s situation, he said that victory isn’t guaranteed by strength alone; you must show up and play the game, just as a top athlete can’t claim victory from the sidelines. He remarked, “The best athlete can win against the worst athlete 100% of the time, if the best athlete plays. It drops to 0% if he doesn’t play and lets the weak athlete win. You have to play to win. Get in the arena.” Strive’s Rochard says Bitcoin payments increased faster in low-tax places Under current US tax rules, Bitcoin is treated as property rather than currency. That means every time someone spends BTC, for coffee, services, or goods, it triggers a tax reporting obligation and potentially a capital gains tax if the value has increased since the buyer acquired the Bitcoin. The absence of a de minimis tax exemption — a threshold below which transactions would not be taxed — has drawn sharp criticism from industry advocates. In response to Rochard’s post, one X user countered his point, saying that even in countries where BTC is tax-free, paying with Bitcoin hasn’t caught on. The Strive executive later pushed back , stating the data shows BTC payments have grown much faster in low-tax regions than in high-tax ones. Responding to another user’s post, he insisted that tax enforcement should be feared. Some commenters also supported his perspective, claiming that if it were not for tax imposition, they would use Bitcoin all the time. X commenter Mohammed Walid Gagi asserted that tax-free nations don’t fear Bitcoin. Some users thanked him for cutting through the noise, saying that everyone focuses on Lightning and scaling when tax treatment is the real barrier. Just last month, the Bitcoin Policy Institute warned that taxing every BTC payment makes it simply less effective as a day-to-day currency and slows its uptake. Currently, US officials are exploring a de minimis tax exemption for fully backed stablecoins—a proposal that hasn’t gone over well with Bitcoiners. Senator Lummis had introduced a bill providing exemptions for small BTC transactions In July 2025, crypto supporter and Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis proposed a bill to exempt small digital asset transactions of $300 or less from taxes. The proposal would impose a $5,000 annual cap on exemptions and add protections for crypto-based charitable giving. It also suggested earnings from crypto staking or mining wouldn’t be treated as taxable income until the coins were sold. Additionally, in October, after Square integrated Bitcoin payments, founder Jack Dorsey advocated for a tax break on small BTC transactions. Dorsey noted, “We want BTC to be everyday money ASAP.” But Marty Bent, co-founder of the media outlet Truth for the Commoner, derided the plan to exempt stablecoins from taxes as “nonsensical.” Meanwhile, lawmakers in Rhode Island are also proposing legislation to make small Bitcoin transactions tax-free for consumers and companies alike. The Senate Bill 2021 proposes allowing up to $20,000 in yearly Bitcoin transactions — or $5,000 monthly — without triggering state tax liability. The proposed solution would also minimize tax expenses for small crypto exchanges and allow the public to remain compliant with crypto law, including those of self-certification, record-keeping, and valuation. Rhode Island lawmakers say they would review the policy in 1 year to gauge its impact on the economy and state finances. Nevertheless, the bill reflects the state’s effort to normalize digital currencies in daily payments, limiting the exemption to small transactions rather than investment trades.

But When It Moves, It Moves the Hardest",https://timestabloid.com/finance-expert-xrp-is-always-last-to-move-but-when-it-moves-it-moves-the-hardest/,"Crypto proponent Captain Mallard (@Brett_Crypto_X) recently pointed to a recurring pattern in XRP’s market behavior. XRP has often moved later than the rest of the market, particularly compared to Bitcoin, which typically leads major trends. This delay has been a consistent feature across multiple cycles. While Bitcoin frequently sets the direction early, XRP tends to consolidate for longer periods . Price action remains compressed while momentum builds beneath the surface. When XRP finally reacts, the move is usually decisive. This historical behavior is why analysts and traders are now watching XRP closely as market conditions continue to align for its next phase of momentum. XRP is always last to move. But when it moves… it moves the hardest. Never forget. — Captain mallard (@Brett_Crypto_X) January 22, 2026 Historical Patterns of Delayed Movement XRP’s historical behavior shows periods of consolidation followed by notable price activity. Unlike Bitcoin, which often reacts quickly to market developments, XRP has a slower buildup. This delay allows underlying trends to strengthen before larger moves occur. Investors interpret this as a sign that when XRP breaks out, the resulting gains can be substantial. Observers cite past cycles where the digital asset lagged initially but eventually surpassed expectations in performance. Factors that Could Aid XRP’s Breakout Several factors contribute to the growing bullish sentiment around XRP. Regulatory clarity has improved, giving institutional investors more confidence in the token. Clearer guidelines reduce uncertainty, encouraging larger financial players to engage with XRP. This shift is likely to increase trading volume and market participation, providing a foundation for stronger price action. Institutional interest is also rising through ETF developments. Momentum in U.S.-based spot XRP ETFs has drawn attention from major investors. These funds facilitate access to XRP for traditional financial institutions and high-net-worth individuals. As a result, market liquidity improves, and demand pressure can contribute to upward movement. Analysts note that ETF availability often coincides with periods of increased adoption and price appreciation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Global Adoption and Network Utility Global adoption of XRP continues to expand. Ripple’s payment solutions are integrated with financial institutions across multiple regions, allowing XRP to support faster cross-border transactions. These real-world applications enhance the token’s utility and long-term value proposition. As more banks and payment providers incorporate XRP into their operations, adoption reinforces market confidence and encourages investment. XRP’s pattern of delayed but strong movements positions it uniquely. When the token reacts, the impact tends to be significant. Combined with regulatory clarity, ETF momentum, and growing global adoption, XRP is positioned for meaningful market activity in the short and long term.

The weekly chart highlights a repetition of the previous bullrun’s pattern, with the only significant difference being the extended accumulation period. This longer phase of price stability sets the stage for higher potential targets . CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) drew attention to the setup. He noted that the next surge could take XRP to $11, with a final wave potentially reaching $70. This outlook is based on the similarity of the current structure to the prior cycle, adjusted for the longer accumulation period. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 Comparison to Previous Bullrun The chart suggests that XRP replicated the previous rally pattern after extended periods of consolidation. The first pattern led to the breakout in 2017, which pushed XRP to its all-time high. The asset has since surpassed that level, hitting a new peak price of $3.65 in July 2025. However, this new peak remains within the consolidation zone, suggesting it could serve as a base for the next climb. Historical resistance levels now act as support, providing a stable base for the next upward movement. The previous bull run saw a rapid ascent after accumulation. This suggests that the current structure could produce comparable growth once the market resumes momentum. By matching the prior cycle’s trajectory, the analyst sees a roadmap for XRP’s potential breakout and larger gains. XRP Key Price Zones The highlighted zones on the chart indicate critical support and resistance levels. The first zone represents historical consolidation, which preceded the previous price surge. The second zone, closer to current levels, marks the area where price has compressed before preparing for the next leg up. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 These zones indicate where buying pressure can accumulate, setting up the conditions for a significant upward move. Once XRP breaks above its $3.65 peak, the chart suggests a clear path to $11, followed by a further advance to $70. Outlook for XRP XRP’s chart shows a clear growth pattern. By replicating the previous bullrun , the cryptocurrency is positioned for substantial upside. Support levels have held firmly, accumulation has occurred, and the next wave could drive the price to $11, with a subsequent move toward $70. CryptoBull’s prediction reinforces the expectation that XRP is entering a significant growth phase based on historical patterns and current price behavior.

ChatGPT Weighs In on Ripple’s Price,https://cryptopotato.com/how-will-xrp-trade-next-week-chatgpt-weighs-in-on-ripples-price/,"Ripple’s cross-border token, alongside most of the cryptocurrency market, began the new year with a bang, surging by double digits within the span of just days. More specifically, XRP went from under $1.90 to $2.40 by January 6 when the tide turned, and it quickly lost momentum. The subsequent geopolitical tension caused by US President Trump’s ambitions to take over Greenland led to a market-wide correction. XRP was not spared, and it now struggles at its 2026 starting point of around $1.90. Here’s a look, through the eyes of ChatGPT, at what’s next for the asset. Week Ahead: ChatGPT Edition As usual, the popular AI solution outlined three possible scenarios for the weeks ahead. The first one, which it categorized as the bearish case, envisioned a continuous but rather gradual price decline for XRP to as low as $1.70. That would be possible if the asset decisively breaks below the $1.90 support and drops further beneath the $1.80 zone, an area where buyers used to step in at least in the past few months. The probability for this additional 10% decline was around 30%-35%, ChatGPT said. In contrast, ChatGPT’s bullish scenario envisions a substantial uptick in the next up to seven days that can take XRP back toward its yearly highs of $2.30. Such a short-term relief rally would be possible if buyers manage to flip the $2.05-$2.10 zone into support with convincing volume. It noted that charting a 20% increase from the current levels would require “broader market strength rather than XRP-specific news.” However, this was ChatGPT’s most unlikely scenario for the week ahead, with probability chances of 20%-25%. Consolidation to Reign Following the latest wild swings in the cryptocurrency markets, the AI platform indicated that a prolonged period of consolidation is most likely to be anticipated for the week ahead. After all, it has been only three full weeks since the start of the new year, and XRP has already produced several double-digit moves. As such, it outlined a 40%-45% chance for a sideways chop scenario between $1.85 and $2.05 as the ongoing structure suggests “that neither bulls nor bears currently have full control.” “If broader market conditions remain mixed and Bitcoin trades sideways, XRP could remain rangebound for most of the week, frustrating traders expecting a decisive move. This type of price action would also allow indicators to reset before the next breakout attempt,” ChatGPT concluded. The post How Will XRP Trade Next Week?

Key Takeaways: US spot Bitcoin ETFs logged their weakest week in nearly a year, with $1.33 billion in outflows. Selling peaked midweek, led by heavy redemptions from BlackRock’s IBIT. Ether ETFs also turned negative, shedding $611 million over the same period. The pullback marks the worst weekly showing since February 2025 and reflects a sharp reversal in investor sentiment after strong inflows the previous week. The outflows follow a period of optimism, when spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.42 billion in net inflows. Midweek Bitcoin ETF Outflows Surge as $709M Exits in Single Day Selling pressure peaked midweek. Wednesday alone saw $709 million exit Bitcoin ETFs, making it the heaviest outflow day of the week. Tuesday followed closely behind with $483 million in redemptions. Outflows eased toward the end of the week, with $32 million leaving on Thursday and $104 million on Friday. The magnitude of the withdrawals echoes the turbulence seen in late February 2025, when Bitcoin ETFs lost $2.61 billion in a single week during a sharp market downturn. That episode, often referred to by analysts as the “February Freeze,” coincided with Bitcoin’s drop from above $109,000 to below $80,000 and included a record $1.14 billion single-day outflow on Feb. 25. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot Bitcoin ETF by assets under management, posted outflows on all four trading days last week. Data from SoSoValue shows the fund experienced its heaviest redemptions on Tuesday and Wednesday, accounting for a significant share of the overall decline. 1/ US Spot Crypto ETF Weekly Flows (Jan 12-16, ET) • BTC ETFs: +$1.42B • ETH ETFs: +$479M • SOL ETFs: +$46.88M • XRP ETFs: +$56.83M Source: SoSoValue #CryptoETF #SoSoValue pic.twitter.com/Wi35m9jMLu — SoSoValue (@SoSoValueCrypto) January 19, 2026 IBIT currently holds about $69.75 billion in net assets, representing roughly 3.9% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. Despite the recent pullback, the broader picture for spot Bitcoin ETFs remains positive. Since their launch in January 2024, cumulative net inflows stand at $56.5 billion, with total net assets across all US spot Bitcoin ETFs reaching approximately $115.9 billion. Ethereum ETFs were not spared from the broader risk-off move. Spot Ether ETFs posted $611 million in net outflows for the week, reversing the prior week’s $479 million inflow streak. Wednesday was again the worst day, with $298 million redeemed, followed by $230 million on Tuesday. Total net assets for Ether ETFs now sit around $17.7 billion, with cumulative inflows of $12.3 billion since their July 2024 debut. Solana ETFs Defy Broader Sell-Off as Bitcoin, XRP Funds See Outflows Not all crypto-linked funds followed the same pattern. Spot Solana ETFs continued to attract capital, recording $9.6 million in net inflows over the week, extending a multi-week positive trend. Bitwise’s BSOL remained the category leader by assets. Spot XRP ETFs , meanwhile, saw mixed flows, ending the week with $40.6 million in net outflows after a sharp $53 million exit on Tuesday. The ETF drawdowns come amid signs of shifting market dynamics on-chain. According to a CryptoQuant report, Bitcoin holders have begun realizing net losses for the first time since October 2023. The firm noted the market has moved from a profit-taking phase into a loss-realization phase, with roughly 69,000 BTC in realized losses since Dec. 23, a pattern reminiscent of past transitions from bull to bear markets.

Senate crypto reforms, growing BIP-110 adoption, and rumors around GameStop’s BTC transfer have added noise, but price action suggests consolidation, not collapse. The $88K zone now stands as the key pivot for Bitcoin’s next directional move. Bitcoin Governance Debate Resurfaces as BIP-110 Node Adoption Expands Bitcoin’s long-running governance debate has resurfaced as adoption of Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 110 (BIP-110) edges higher. Roughly 2.38% of Bitcoin nodes are now running BIP-110, a temporary soft fork designed to limit non-monetary data, or “spam,” embedded in transactions. The proposal restores restrictions on OP_RETURN data and output sizes that were loosened in recent Bitcoin Core updates. Facilitating Spam is incompatible with Bitcoin’s sound money mission via decentralization. Facilitating Spam makes it more expensive/cumbersome to use Bitcoin in a self sovereign manner than it otherwise would without Spam. Activate BIP-110 yesterday. Filters up. https://t.co/6czRByhKLb — ₿itcoin ₿ombadil (@BitcoinBombadil) January 24, 2026 The issue has divided the community. Critics argue that allowing excessive arbitrary data risks turning Bitcoin into a data-storage network, raising node costs and pushing out smaller, home-run operators, which could increase centralization. Supporters counter that usage should not be artificially limited and that existing spam filters are ineffective. While the debate may create short-term noise, it has little direct price impact. Over time, efforts like BIP-110 reinforce Bitcoin’s decentralization, strengthening its credibility as resilient, trust-minimized money. GameStop Moves 4,700 BTC to Coinbase Prime, Raising Sale Speculation GameStop has moved its entire Bitcoin holding, roughly 4,710 BTC worth over $420 million, to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation that a sale may be imminent. According to CryptoQuant , the company acquired its Bitcoin at an average price near $107,900, meaning a full exit at current levels around $90,800 would imply an unrealized loss of roughly $76 million. GameStop throws in the towel? Their on-chain wallets just moved all BTC holdings to Coinbase Prime, likely to sell. Between May 14–23, 2025, they bought 4,710 BTC at an avg. price of $107.9K, investing ~$504M. Now selling for around $90.8K, potentially realising approximately… pic.twitter.com/Bp7MwRVQ43 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 23, 2026 Large transfers to institutional trading platforms often precede selling, but the move alone does not confirm liquidation. GameStop has not issued any public statement, leaving markets to interpret the intent. The broader impact on Bitcoin appears limited. More than 190 publicly listed companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, underscoring continued institutional participation. Even if GameStop were to exit, it would represent an isolated corporate decision rather than a shift in overall institutional confidence. Short-term volatility is possible, but longer-term demand remains intact. Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Tests $88K Support as Breakout Pressure Builds Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC is trading near $88,600, entering a corrective phase after failing to hold the $97,300 swing high earlier this month. On the 4-hour chart, price has slipped back into a rising channel that guided the move from the $83,800 low. The rejection at channel resistance marked a momentum shift, reinforced by long upper wicks and a bearish engulfing candle that broke short-term support. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview BTC is now testing a key confluence zone between $88,000 and $87,300, which aligns with prior demand and the lower boundary of the ascending channel. Recent candles show smaller bodies with lower wicks, suggesting selling pressure is easing rather than accelerating. However, price remains below the 50-EMA and 100-EMA, while the 200-EMA near $91,200 continues to cap rebounds, keeping near-term bias cautious. RSI has rebounded from oversold levels near 30 and is stabilizing around 40–42, signaling balance but not strength. The structure resembles a descending flag within a broader uptrend. If $87,300 holds, a reclaim of $90,000 could open $92,400–$94,500. A clean break below risks $85,600. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade Setup: Buy $87,500–$88,000, target $94,000, stop below $85,500.

This movement has sent a clear signal: many investors are stepping back right now. ETF Flows And Who Is Selling Reports note that ETF flows are often on the radar as a quick read on investor mood, but the picture is not always simple. Large outflows can reflect institutional rebalancing or tactical moves by funds, not only mass retail selling. The US market had a four-day trading week because of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, which may have concentrated trades into fewer sessions and amplified the numbers. Still, losing more than a billion dollars in a few days will get attention. Market Mood And Metals The wider mood has soured. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered an Extreme Fear score of 25, and sentiment trackers have been flashing caution. Reports say Santiment believes retail traders are pulling back while attention drifts toward more traditional assets. Meanwhile, metals have been strong. Reports disclose that with gold trading near $5,000 and silver approaching $100, some market players feel Bitcoin has been left out of a rally that lifted metals, which has weighed on confidence in the crypto market. Source: Alternative.me Bitcoin Price Action Bitcoin has struggled to find a steady rhythm over the past week. Prices slipped below the $89,000 to $90,000 range as traders reacted to fresh geopolitical tension and renewed trade worries, before stabilizing as nerves eased. This was driven higher after some soft political indicators around tariff threats, only to substantiate the idea that markets rarely react to conflict but rather to changes in tone and expectations. Signals That Could Matter These movements illustrate how Bitcoin behaves more like a risk asset rather than an asset shelter, falling in tandem with equities when unexpected financial shocks hit the globe, before rebounding when the fever subsides to gather fresh buyers.

The move lower reflects near-term macro caution and heavy ETF-related selling rather than a breakdown in network fundamentals. With Bitcoin hovering near $89,000 and risk sentiment mixed, ETH has shifted into a range-bound phase where price is lagging underlying activity. ETF Pressure Weighs on Price, Not Structure Short-term pressure has largely come from spot ETH ETF outflows, which exceeded $600 million between January 20–23, led in part by a single-day $250 million exit from BlackRock’s ETHA. This selling has cooled momentum and kept ETH capped below the $3,000 handle. However, the flow data points more toward rotation and profit-taking than institutional abandonment. On-chain tracking shows whales accumulating roughly $1 billion worth of ETH during the recent correction, while funding rates and open interest have reset from crowded long conditions. That combination suggests leverage is being flushed, not confidence. On-Chain Activity Tells a Different Story Beneath the price, Ethereum’s network activity remains strong. Daily active addresses have climbed toward 1.3 million, while transaction counts are holding between 1.9 million and 2.2 million per day. Validator behavior reinforces this trend: exit queues are near zero, entry queues are rebuilding, and staking participation continues to rise, tightening circulating supply. Low fees and improved efficiency post-upgrades are also driving sustained DeFi and app usage, reinforcing a “price weak, fundamentals firm” dynamic that has historically preceded larger trend moves. Ethereum Rises Despite U.S.-Iran Tensions On the geopolitical front, the tensions are rising between the U.S. and Iran as Iran’s Revolutionary Guard warns it is “more ready than ever” amid U.S. warships moving toward the Middle East. The warning comes after Iran’s recent crackdown on protests, which left thousands dead, and Trump has set strict red lines for military action, including preventing mass executions and violence against civilians. Despite these geopolitical tensions, Ethereum (ETH) continues to rise. This shows that investors remain confident in Ethereum’s growth, likely supported by strong developments like the Ethereum Foundation prioritizing post-quantum security. Today marks an inflection in the Ethereum Foundation's long-term quantum strategy. We've formed a new Post Quantum (PQ) team, led by the brilliant Thomas Coratger ( @tcoratger ).

RSI remains subdued near 35–40, signaling caution but not capitulation. A reset toward support followed by a reclaim of $3,060 would reopen upside toward $3,190–$3,400, while a clean break below $2,800 would risk a deeper retracement toward $2,700.

The upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade and later Hegota phase focus on scalability, efficiency, and sustainability, building on blob infrastructure progress and accelerating Layer-2 adoption. With over 8.7 million new contracts deployed entering the year, analysts increasingly view 2026 as a potential breakout period if macro conditions stabilize.

Here’s the Signal,https://timestabloid.com/the-most-aggressive-xrp-rally-in-over-7-years-is-coming-heres-the-signal/,"XRP has entered a significant phase in its market cycle. The cryptocurrency has spent 400 days within a rectangular reaccumulation pattern, which is now showing signs of consolidation above key support levels. According to crypto analyst ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA), this extended period may precede one of XRP’s most aggressive rallies in nearly 8 years. Traders are closely monitoring the asset for a potential breakout, as it may target double-digit prices. Rectangular Reaccumulation Structure The chart shared by ChartNerd highlights a rectangular bull flag pattern . XRP has oscillated between clearly defined reaccumulation support and resistance levels. The rectangular range demonstrates consolidation following a strong initial move, referred to as the flagpole on the chart. The asset’s current price action remains above the lower boundary, validating the reaccumulation pattern. ChartNerd emphasizes the importance of maintaining support at this level to sustain the next upward trajectory. $XRP : This 400 day long rectangular reaccumulation phase might just lead up to the most aggressive rally XRP has seen in over 7/8 years. Defend reaccumulation support to activate this expansion journey https://t.co/3OwVmfYg7Z pic.twitter.com/Em7bDmkVh0 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 23, 2026 Breakout Target and Price Projection If XRP maintains its position above reaccumulation support, the rectangular bull flag structure suggests a double-digit breakout target . The chart marks a potential move toward $23.84. This level aligns with the technical measurement derived from the height of the flag pole projected from the upper boundary of the reaccumulation zone. Traders and investors may view a breach of the resistance line as confirmation of a significant upward expansion. Trading Range and Market Behavior XRP’s price has remained within the 400-day trading range , displaying low volatility compared to the preceding flagpole movement. This extended consolidation has allowed the market to absorb prior gains and establish a solid base. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The trading range also indicates disciplined accumulation. Within this range, the support and resistance levels act as reference points for potential entries and exits. ChartNerd notes that the validity of the rectangular bull flag is contingent on price holding above the reaccumulation support. What to Expect from XRP Historically, XRP has experienced periods of prolonged consolidation before substantial upward movements. The current rectangular pattern mirrors previous bull flag setups in the market, where momentum accelerates once consolidation resolves. The digital asset has been relatively quiet over the past year within this range. However, the structure suggests readiness for a decisive move. Market participants are closely observing XRP, as this consolidation pattern may signal one of the most significant rallies the cryptocurrency has experienced in years.

57452053,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=901788,1769329800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/57452053.jpeg,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Analysis: Analysts Identify 700% Expansion Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mutuum-finance-mutm-price-analysis-analysts-identify-700-expansion-potential/,"New cryptocurrency projects are commonly analyzed in terms of the usefulness of valuation, adoption and development rates. Several experts believe that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can be valued at its build-stage level as opposed to its usage-stage level. That difference has made it possible to discuss proactively how far MUTM can go within the first two years of protocol activity. Presale Data and Protocol Design Mutuum Finance started its presale in early 2025 at $0.01 and has risen to $0.04 in Phase 7 following numerous stage changes. Up to now the presale has brought in $19.9M and inboarded over 18,900 holders who have already sold 830M tokens. Out of the 4B MUTM available, 1.82B or 45.5 percent are reserved as presale access. This has been gradual and not explosive. The protocol is concerned with decentralized lending. The project’s design promotes lending of P2C wherein the users provide funds to a liquidity pool and earn mtTokens that index the principal and APY. It also facilitates P2P borrowing through users at determined loan-to-value determination under liquidation logic to safeguard in times of volatility. Analysts monitoring new crypto and DeFi crypto industries note that this two-fold design provides Mutuum Finance with a useful borrowing platform instead of a story only design. V1 Launch and Security Check It is announced by the official X-account of the team that V1 protocol will go to the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 has collateral rules, liquidation and debt accounting logic and lender APY logic. To model the price, analysts define V1 as the price at which valuation will start to take into account use instead of planning. Mutuum Finance has an independent audit conducted by Halborn Security and a score of 90/100 token scan rating by CertiK. In the case of lending, this validation layer is a stipulation because of collateral and liquidation. Some analysts feel that in case the V1 rollout occurs on time and usage during the testnet with mainnet following, MUTM would reprice to the $0.10 to $0.15 range. This would amount to 150%-275% increase at the execution stage out of the present presale price of $0.04. Growth Catalysts mtTokens are one of the fundamental mechanisms of the protocol. Users providing assets are awarded mtTokens and APY. Those mtTokens will be deposited in the safety module to receive MUTM which will be bought on an open market and will be transferred back to stakers. Those purchases are financed by a part of the revenue generated in the process of borrowing. This buy-and-distribute model is emphasized by the analysts since it creates a buy demand on a basis of the lending volume rather than attention cycles. To encourage participation, Mutuum Finance operates a 24-hour leaderboard each day giving the best contributor $500 of MUTM. This enhances involvement in the later stages and expansion in distribution. Roadmap Milestones In addition to lending, the project will also launch an overcollateralized stablecoin where users can mint their collateral instead of selling their assets according to the official roadmap. The users of Stablecoin are longer term borrowers and according to analysts this enhances the revenue predictability of DeFi lenders. It is also expected to expand its layer-2 in order to charge fewer transaction fees and support throughput to users who do not desire to trade on Ethereum mainnet. In a long-term context, when the minting of stablecoins and the support of Layer-2 protocols increase the use of protocol-driven prices, a number of analysts draw up a third price between $0.25 to $0.32. Out of the presale price which is $0.04, this range reflects a 525-700% growth on a bullish valuation trajectory. According to the analysts, whale entries in terminal presale periods usually indicate belief that the prices will not be maintained at the build-phase levels when the use and revenues start to be realized. As the remaining supply gets tighter and the latter stage will see the price go up once more, more investors have entered the market in order to be positioned ahead of the V1 transition. Mutuum Finance has reached the development, security and participation point of development. As an investment to watch the type of crypto to invest in 2026-2027, analysts indicate that MUTM belongs to the category of early cheap crypto that are about to get first activated, instead of late-cycle assets already being priced to maturity.

The Nietzschean Penguin token, affectionately nicknamed PENGUIN by its community, saw its price and market capitalization skyrocket by roughly 564% in a single 24‑hour trading session, according to on‑chain data. The White House uploaded a photo on X of Trump and the bird walking together in the snow, with the words, “Embrace the penguin,” which rapidly spread across social media. The AI‑generated image showed Trump with a penguin holding an American flag, and Greenland’s flag planted in the snow behind them. Later that day, the Department of Defense’s rapid response page also shared its own version of the image, saying, “Be a warrior, embrace the penguin.” Alon says PENGUIN’s surge is a statement that onchain trading never died Before the White House post, the cryptocurrency had a market cap of around $387,000, but within 24 hours, it saw $244 million in trading volume, according to SolanaFloor. According to DEXScreener, the token is currently worth about $0.13 , giving it a market capitalization of roughly $136 million. Speaking on the meme coin performance, Alon Cohen, the co-founder of meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, commented , “The early success of PENGUIN is proof that onchain trading was never dead, just a sleeping giant waiting for the right moment. Psychological barriers are only just beginning to get broken. Tons of opportunities ahead.” The PENGUIN’s token gains come at a time of broader downturn in the meme coin market. Just last year, some 11.6 million crypto tokens collapsed, mostly due to the flood of meme coins launched by platforms such as Pump.fun. However, at the start of this year, the meme coin market cap briefly surged by 23%, rising from approximately $38 billion in December 2025 to over $47 billion, per CoinMarketCap. Santiment data at the time showed that increased social media mentions of the assets matched meme coins’ short-term surge. Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at trading firm Kronos Research, had also commented, “Meme coins typically lead when risk appetite returns. The rebound in the Fear and Greed Index from extreme fear toward neutral reinforces this shift.” At the time of writing, meme coins’ total market value had fallen to around $39 billion, as crypto markets continued to fluctuate between brief surges and dips. Some X users mocked the White House post The White House’s post taps into the viral “Nihilist Penguin” meme, which first appeared in a 2007 Werner Herzog documentary showing an Emperor penguin leaving its colony to wander toward the Antarctic mountains. Aside from the gains in the Penguin meme coin, it also elicited many social media reactions. Some ridiculed the White House’s post, noting that penguins are found almost entirely in the southern hemisphere, and not in Greenland . Former Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney also zeroed in on the factual error, saying it echoed Trump’s earlier moment of confusion over Greenland and Iceland. He wrote, “In the same week as his humiliating climb down on Greenland, he confused Iceland and Greenland multiple times, and now his staff is confusing Antarctica with Greenland. (penguins inhabit the former, not the latter.)” On Saturday, however, the White House replied to his criticism, saying, “The penguin does not concern himself with the opinions of those who cannot comprehend.” At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump’s revived interest in acquiring Greenland also took center stage among international leaders.

Key Takeaways: BIP-110 has gained early traction, with 583 Bitcoin nodes signaling support for a temporary cap on transaction data. The proposal seeks to reverse recent Bitcoin Core changes that removed OP_RETURN limits. Supporters argue stricter data limits are needed to curb spam and preserve node decentralization. Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 110 (BIP-110) is currently signaling support from 583 nodes, or about 2.38% of the network, according to data from The Bitcoin Portal . Out of roughly 24,481 reachable nodes, those backing the proposal are primarily running Bitcoin Knots , an alternative node implementation often favored by operators critical of recent changes to Bitcoin Core. BIP-110 Proposes One-Year Cap on Bitcoin Transaction Data BIP-110 proposes a temporary soft fork that would reintroduce strict limits on transaction data at the consensus level. Specifically, it caps transaction output sizes at 34 bytes and restricts OP_RETURN data, a script used to embed arbitrary information into transactions, to 83 bytes. The soft fork is designed to last for one year, after which the limits could be extended, modified or allowed to expire. The proposal emerged in response to changes introduced in Bitcoin Core version 30, released in October 2025. That update removed the long-standing 83-byte limit on OP_RETURN data following a pull request first introduced earlier in the year. The move was controversial and met with widespread criticism from parts of the Bitcoin community, which argued the change was made without sufficient consensus. OP_RETURN has long been a flashpoint in Bitcoin governance debates . While it enables use cases such as timestamping and metadata anchoring, critics say uncapped data fields encourage blockchain spam and non-financial use of block space. Larger data payloads increase storage and bandwidth requirements for nodes, raising concerns that running a full node could become cost-prohibitive for everyday users. BIP-110 RC3 pic.twitter.com/5KeoTCyhWV — Justin (@innerhat) January 21, 2026 Critics of the Core update argue that higher hardware demands risk undermining one of Bitcoin’s defining features, which is the ability for individuals to verify the network using consumer-grade hardware. As node operation becomes more expensive, they warn, the network could drift toward greater centralization. Bitcoin educator Matthew Kratter compared unchecked data usage to a parasitic threat. He has argued that excessive spam could overwhelm the network’s underlying structure, weakening Bitcoin’s resilience over time. BIP-110 Backers Frame Proposal as Temporary Fix Supporters of BIP-110 see the proposal as a corrective measure rather than a permanent policy shift. By making the soft fork explicitly temporary, its authors aim to give the network time to assess the impact of restored limits without locking Bitcoin into a long-term rule change. Others remain unconvinced. Bitcoin Core contributor Jameson Lopp has defended the removal of OP_RETURN limits, arguing that artificial caps do little to deter spam and may instead push unwanted activity into other parts of the protocol.

According to reports, the hacker group is now deploying the AI-generated PowerShell malware, using it to target developers and engineers in the blockchain industry. The North Korean hacker group is believed to have been in operation since at least 2014 and is associated with APT37 and Kimusky activity clusters. The group has targeted organizations spread across South Korea, Ukraine, Russia, and several other European countries. According to the threat sample analyzed by CheckPoint researchers, the North Korean group’s latest campaign is targeted towards the Asian Pacific region. North Korean Konni group deploys AI-generated malware In the report, the researchers claimed that the malware was submitted by users who found it in Japan, India, and Australia. The attack begins with the victim receiving a Discord link that delivers a ZIP archive containing a PDF lure and a malicious LNK shortcut file. The LNK runs an embedded PowerShell loader that extracts a DOCX document and a CAB archive that contains a PowerShell backdoor, two batch files, and a UAC bypass executable. After the shortcut file is launched, the DOCX opens and executes a batch file included in the cabinet file. The lure DOCX document shows that the hacker wants to compromise the development environment, which could provide them with access to sensitive assets, including infrastructure, API credentials, wallet access, and finally digital asset holdings. The first batch file creates a staging directory for the backdoor and the second batch file. In addition, it also creates an hourly scheduled task that mimics the startup task of OneDrive. The task reads an XOR-encrypted PowerShell script from disk and decrypts it for in-memory execution. After completing all these steps, it then deletes itself to wipe all the signs of an infection. The PowerShell backdoor heavily masks its origin using arithmetic-based string encoding, runtime string reconstruction, and the execution of the final logic using “Invoked-Expression.” According to the researchers, the PowerShell malware indicates the presence of an AI-assisted development rather than traditionally authored malware. The evidence showing this includes the clear and structured documentation at the top of the script, which is very unusual for malware development. In addition, it has a clean and modular layout, and the presence of a “# hackers . CheckPoint researchers give details on the malware The researchers explained that the phrasing also shows that the model instructs a human user on how to customize the placeholder value. They said such comments are commonly seen in AI-generated scripts and tutorials. Before execution, the malware performs a hardware, software, and user activity check to ensure that it is not running in analysis environments. Once that is determined, it then generates a unique host ID. After that, it follows a specified path of action. Once the backdoor is fully activated and running on the infected device, the malware contacts the command-and-control (C2) server periodically to send host metadata and polls the server at random intervals. If the C2 contains a PowerShell code, it turns into a script block and carries out its activities using background jobs. CheckPoint noted that these attacks can be attributed to the North Korean Konni threat actor based on the earlier launcher format and lure name. In addition, the researchers claimed that aside from having the same script name overlap, there are other common elements in the execution chain structure with earlier attacks. The researchers have also published indicators of compromise associated with this recent campaign to help defenders recognize when they have been attacked by the North Korean Konni campaign so they can protect their assets.

In his statement, SMQKE asserted that DTCC is partnered with R3 and emphasized that R3’s infrastructure uses XRP, noting that this connection has been documented multiple times. The claim was presented as a response to ongoing skepticism around XRP’s involvement in large-scale financial market infrastructure. Rather than relying on opinion, the post focused on documentary evidence. The images attached to the tweet were positioned as historical and institutional references that, taken together, outline how XRP has been referenced within R3-related settlement frameworks and how DTCC has worked with R3 in distributed ledger initiatives. DTCC IS PARTNERED WITH R3 WHICH USES XRP Documented 3x for the skeptics. https://t.co/hoUQocViJU pic.twitter.com/gndfoQDxoT — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 23, 2026 DTCC’s Engagement With R3 DTCC is a central pillar of global financial market infrastructure, responsible for clearing, settlement, custody, and information services across multiple asset classes. Over the past several years, DTCC has publicly explored distributed ledger technology as part of efforts to modernize post-trade processes. One of its most notable collaborations in this area has been with R3, the firm behind the Corda distributed ledger platform. The material shared by SMQKE points to documentation indicating DTCC’s participation in projects built on R3’s Corda technology. These initiatives were designed to improve efficiency, transparency, and resilience in clearing and settlement workflows. The tweet does not emphasize that DTCC directly uses XRP in its core operations, but that DTCC’s chosen DLT partner, R3, has developed solutions that explicitly reference XRP. R3, Corda, and XRP References Banks and financial institutions use R3’s Corda platform for permissioned settlement applications. According to the documents highlighted in SMQKE’s post, XRP has been identified within certain R3-related settlement contexts, including discussions around cross-border payments and interoperability. One of the attached excerpts references XRP as a digital asset supported within settlement solutions connected to Corda, particularly in payment obligations and global transfers. SMQKE underscored that these references are not isolated. By stating that the link has been “documented 3x,” the researcher suggested a pattern across multiple sources rather than a single, ambiguous mention. The post is intended to counter claims that XRP has no documented relevance within institutional-grade financial infrastructure connected to major market entities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Implications Highlighted by the Researcher The core message of SMQKE’s tweet is evidentiary rather than predictive. By compiling and resurfacing these documents, the researcher aimed to demonstrate that XRP has appeared within serious, institutional discussions tied to R3’s technology and, by extension, to organizations such as DTCC that have partnered with R3. The post stops short of claiming current production use by DTCC but stresses that dismissing XRP as entirely absent from this ecosystem overlooks documented material. In presenting these attachments, SMQKE presents the issue as one of record rather than belief, arguing that the documented links are sufficient to challenge persistent skepticism in XRP’s relevance in enterprise and financial market infrastructure.

Once primarily associated with cryptocurrencies, this distributed ledger technology is proving its versatility across multiple industries, from finance and logistics to healthcare and entertainment. As businesses and governments explore blockchain’s potential, the emphasis has shifted from abstract promise to measurable impact. Finance and Transparent Payments One of blockchain’s most established real-world uses is in financial services. Banks and payment providers are leveraging blockchain to facilitate faster and more secure transactions. Cross-border payments, which traditionally take days and incur high fees, can now be completed in near real-time thanks to blockchain-based networks. Smart contracts—self-executing agreements with code enforcing the terms—are increasingly deployed in lending, insurance, and trade finance. These contracts reduce the need for intermediaries and minimize human error, offering businesses more efficient ways to conduct transactions. Institutions are also experimenting with tokenized assets, converting equities, bonds, and other financial instruments into blockchain-based tokens. This approach enhances liquidity, simplifies settlement, and opens access to new investor bases that were previously difficult to reach. Supply Chain Transparency Blockchain is proving invaluable in supply chain management. By recording every step of a product’s journey on an immutable ledger, companies can verify authenticity, track inventory, and detect fraud. For example, food suppliers can monitor produce from farm to supermarket, ensuring freshness and safety. Luxury brands are also employing blockchain to authenticate high-end goods, combating counterfeiting and preserving brand value. The transparency offered by blockchain not only benefits companies but also reassures consumers, who can now trace the origin of their products in real time. Healthcare Innovations The healthcare sector is exploring blockchain for secure patient data management. Patient records stored on a blockchain can be shared across hospitals and clinics with proper permissions, enhancing care coordination while safeguarding privacy. Drug supply chains are also being monitored on blockchains to prevent counterfeit medications from entering the market. In clinical trials, blockchain helps verify the integrity of collected data, ensuring results are reliable and tamper-proof. These applications illustrate how blockchain is contributing to patient safety and operational efficiency. Provably Fair Gambling Even the gambling industry has found a unique niche for blockchain. Provably fair gambling platforms use blockchain to verify that game outcomes are random and unmanipulated. Players can audit results themselves, offering transparency that traditional online casinos cannot guarantee. While this is a smaller segment of blockchain adoption, it exemplifies how trustless systems can replace intermediaries and enhance credibility in sectors where fairness is paramount. Today, Provably Fair algorithms are not available in all online pokies. Therefore, resources such as Auspokies do a massive amount of work to check gambling operators for fairness across a whole list of parameters. And while the technology is developing, such reviewers are a reliable support for active players. Digital Identity and Security Digital identity solutions are another emerging application of blockchain. Users can maintain control over their personal data without relying on centralized authorities. By using blockchain, individuals can prove their identity, access services, and sign documents securely. This reduces the risk of identity theft and data breaches, which are increasingly common in traditional centralized systems. Governments are exploring blockchain-based identity programs, while corporations are adopting similar solutions to verify customers and employees efficiently. Real Estate and Asset Tokenization Blockchain is transforming the real estate industry through tokenization. Instead of dealing with bulky paperwork and slow transactions, property ownership can be represented as blockchain tokens. This allows fractional ownership, making it easier for smaller investors to enter real estate markets. Transactions become faster, cheaper, and more transparent, reducing reliance on traditional intermediaries like notaries and brokers. Similar approaches are being used to tokenize other tangible assets, including art, collectibles, and vehicles, creating new liquidity opportunities for markets that were previously illiquid. The Future Blockchain’s shift from experimental technology to practical solution is gaining momentum. While cryptocurrencies still dominate headlines, enterprise and consumer applications are increasingly proving the technology’s worth in tangible ways. Supply chain transparency, secure payments, digital identity, tokenized assets, and even provably fair gambling show that blockchain is far more than hype—it is a tool shaping real-world processes. As more industries adopt blockchain, the benefits of efficiency, security, and trust are likely to become standard expectations rather than futuristic promises.",Crypto News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2026-01-25 09:08:01

This change in dynamics comes as BTC and the broader crypto market are believed to be on the brink of a bear cycle. According to a weekly CryptoQuant report , Bitcoin holders have not seen this shift since October 2023. The negative turn in profit dynamics has dominated the past 30 days. Bitcoin Sees Change in Profit Dynamics CryptoQuant said Bitcoin holders have realized losses accumulating to 69,000 BTC since December 23. This is the first time network participants have realized net losses in a 30-day period since October 2023. The Bitcoin network has witnessed a decline in realized profits since March 2024. The plunge came with prices losing momentum as the bull phase came to an end. Analysts found similarities between the current market dynamic and the 2021-2022 bull cycle. After realized net profits peaked in January 2021, they began to decline. February and November 2021 saw a series of lower local tops, followed by net losses. Notably, BTC holders realized lower net profits at higher prices at the time. Following a similar trend, realized net profits peaked in January 2024. Since then, there have been a series of lower peaks in December 2024, July, and October 2025. Currently, the profit margin has turned negative, and holders are realizing net losses. Early-stage Bear Market Signs Bitcoin net realized profits have fallen from 4.4 million BTC in October 2025 to 2.5 million BTC currently, a level not seen since March 2024. Analysts said this level is similar to that seen in March 2022, during the early stages of the last bear market. Interestingly, current net realized losses are also following patterns similar to trends seen in March 2022. At the time, the bear market was already underway, and bitcoin’s price had lost its momentum. Considering investor sentiment and speculation surrounding the market, this dynamic confirms that the bear market has indeed begun . Analysts have confirmed that most on-chain metrics and profit dynamics are consistent with early-stage bear market conditions. Last week, CryptoPotato reported that bitcoin’s demand conditions had improved; however, the improvement did not trigger any significant changes. There are no remarkable shifts in demand from exchange-traded funds or spot indicators. Instead, demand has contracted over the past 30 days.

The company, which recently earned a provisional license, released a statement halting the service after five months of launching it. The move comes as Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) tightens oversight of the crypto industry under its Accelerated Regulatory Incubation Program (ARIP). ARIP is a sandbox program designed to help crypto exchanges in the country transition from a largely informal market into a regulated industry. This way, the exchanges are integrated into Nigeria’s capital markets framework. Nigeria faces challenges in its move to regulate the crypto industry According to its statement, Quidax claimed that the decision to halt its peer-to-peer (P2P) services was a result of user preference. Quidax informed users via email that its P2P marketplace would be shut down, removing ads, merchant chats, and other services. The exchange claimed that while it is shutting down its P2P marketplace and other services, products, including instant swaps and order book trading, would continue to operate without issues. P2P trading has long been one of the most controversial segments of the crypto economy of Nigeria. It enables users to buy and sell digital assets directly with one another, while settling transactions through bank transfers offline. The structure has made P2P a liquidity channel, but also another headache for regulators. Analysts and experts have noted that regulating the marketplace will show the practical limits of what regulators are currently willing/able to do when it comes to the crypto industry. While it remains very active, there have been a lot of issues concerning the service and other vices being carried out by users acting as merchants on several exchanges. In 2024, the SEC raised concerns about P2P crypto markets. The regulator highlighted several issues, including opaque transaction flows, difficulties in monitoring off-platform settlements, and the risks of exchange rate manipulation on platforms. The Nigerian regulator also noted the issue of foreign P2P platforms operating in legal grey areas in the country. Platform licensing slows as regulators move to determine readiness According to reports, Quidax was supposed to correct all the issues and risks with its P2P service. Rather than allow P2P activity spill into informal channels, the exchange was supposed to create an internal structure that would put the service within a controlled and regulated environment. Users who sign up to become merchants would have to complete a full verification process, which includes a level 3 know-your-customer verification, two-factor authentication, and a minimum participation history. The applications were reviewed by Quidax, and approved merchants were awarded special badges. Despite the slight success of the program and the safeguards put in place, the feature has now been discontinued, suggesting that the Nigerian regulator might even be looking into stricter models to control P2P in the future. The timing of Quidax’s announcement came at a time when things related to licensing have slowed. The exchange and fellow competitor Busha were expected to transition into full crypto licenses by August 2025, but things have since stalled, with the Nigerian regulator pausing approvals to determine its readiness. Meanwhile, the crypto regulation in Nigeria is becoming more demanding. Earlier this year, the SEC raised minimum capital requirements for crypto platforms, slamming a N2 billion minimum balance on the platforms. Under the Investment and Securities Act (2025), digital assets are now classified as securities, bringing crypto activities under capital markets regulation. In addition, the Nigerian government recently sought to include the crypto population in its new tax regime. The Nigerian government recently ordered crypto platforms to mandate their users to include their tax identification number in their accounts. While P2P platforms have not been provided with a standalone regulation, they are now treated as a Digital Assets Intermediary and are expected to maintain a minimum capital of N500 million. In a case where crypto services mix with P2P services, then the burdens are expected to increase. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Key Takeaways: GameStop moved its entire 4,710 BTC stash to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation of a potential exit from its Bitcoin treasury. If sold near current prices, the company would realize an estimated $75M–$85M loss on its Bitcoin holdings. The transfer comes as corporate crypto treasury strategies face pressure amid falling digital asset prices. Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant flagged the move on Friday after identifying a wallet labeled as belonging to GameStop that sent all 4,710 BTC , worth roughly $420 million at current prices, to Coinbase’s institutional trading platform. “GameStop throws in the towel?” CryptoQuant asked in a post on X, suggesting the transfer was “likely to sell.” GameStop Faces Potential $75M–$85M Loss on Bitcoin Bet if Sold If liquidated near recent market prices, the sale would lock in a sizable loss. CryptoQuant estimates GameStop accumulated its Bitcoin in May at an average price of around $107,900 per coin, implying unrealized losses of roughly $75 million to $85 million, depending on execution price. GameStop announced its Bitcoin purchase earlier this year after CEO Ryan Cohen met with Strategy chairman Michael Saylor in February to discuss corporate crypto treasury models. At the time, the move aligned the meme-stock retailer with a growing group of public companies experimenting with digital assets as balance-sheet holdings. GameStop throws in the towel? Their on-chain wallets just moved all BTC holdings to Coinbase Prime, likely to sell. Between May 14–23, 2025, they bought 4,710 BTC at an avg. price of $107.9K, investing ~$504M. Now selling for around $90.8K, potentially realising approximately… pic.twitter.com/Bp7MwRVQ43 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) January 23, 2026 Since the transfer, GameStop has not publicly confirmed whether it has sold or intends to sell the Bitcoin. While moving funds to Coinbase Prime often precedes a sale, given the platform’s deep liquidity and execution tools, such transfers do not always signal imminent liquidation. Coinbase Prime also provides custody and wallet management services through its regulated trust business, leaving open the possibility of an internal restructuring. The timing has fueled debate. Corporate Bitcoin treasuries surged in popularity throughout 2024 and early 2025, but the model has faced growing scrutiny as crypto prices pulled back sharply in recent months. Several firms that adopted similar strategies are now sitting on steep paper losses, prompting some to trim holdings to shore up balance sheets. Ethereum-focused ETHZilla, for example, recently disclosed selling part of its Ether reserves to reduce debt. Cohen Stock Purchase Lifts GameStop Shares as Bitcoin Questions Swirl The transfer also coincides with renewed activity from Cohen himself. A regulatory filing this week revealed the CEO purchased an additional 500,000 GameStop shares worth more than $10 million, helping push GME shares up over 3% on Thursday. The stock move added another layer of intrigue, with some investors viewing the buy as a vote of confidence amid uncertainty around the company’s crypto exposure. Despite the recent pressure, corporate crypto treasuries remain embedded in traditional markets. Earlier this month, MSCI opted not to remove digital asset treasury companies from its indexes, a decision that spared firms like Strategy from potential billions in passive outflows.

Amid rising speculations, an on-chain analysis has recently been put out, which provides an answer to the question.

Open Interest Across Exchanges Falls To $17 Billion In their latest QuickTake post on CryptoQuant, analytics platform Arab Chain reveals that there has been a fall in active Ethereum derivatives contracts across major exchanges, as indicated by data from the Ethereum: Open Interest-All Exchanges, All Symbol metric. Typically, rising Open Interest (OI) across exchanges indicates that more traders are entering leveraged positions. On the other hand, falling OI reflects more exits of leveraged positions, and by extension, reduced aversion to risk. In the Quicktake post, Arab Chain highlights that open interest across exchanges has dipped to about $16.9 billion, marking the lowest level reached since mid-December last year. This, in turn, reflects an overall reduction in risk appetite across the Ethereum derivatives market. Because there is less speculative activity, there are also reduced risks of liquidations. Hence, the Ethereum price stands a higher chance of consolidating. Related Reading: Analyst Says You’re Not Bullish Enough On Ethereum – What Does He Mean? What’s Happening On Binance? While exchanges in general are recording significant pull-outs from the derivatives market, Binance has shown an outlier performance. Arab Chain highlights that the world’s largest exchange by trading volume has instead recorded about $7.5 billion in Open Interest. Interestingly, this reading slightly exceeds the December average range of $6.8–$7.4 billion. The divergence between the Open Interest values across all exchanges and that of Binance suggests that, while market participants are reducing their risk exposure, there is still liquidity in the derivatives market. Rather than a blatant exit, it has been repositioned toward the deeper and more liquid venue. Arab Chain also explains that this behavior indicates a change in market operations from a higher-risk trading environment to one more price and risk efficient. In conclusion, the large traders are yet to make their exits but are merely reducing their exposure, while holding high-quality positions on Binance. In addition, Ethereum’s proximity to the $3,000 price — especially as OI declines — shows that the market has been absorbing the deleveraging events while showing little selling pressure. Ultimately, Binance’s OI retaining levels above December’s support the idea that the market still has strong derivatives backing. Hence, the broader picture remains bullish. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,958, reflecting a 0.33% growth since the past day, according to CoinMarketCap data.

SEC Vs Gemini In January 2023, the SEC instituted one of the most controversial crypto-related lawsuits against Gemini Trust Company and its partner, Genesis Global Capital LLC, accusing both parties of illegally offering and selling unregistered securities through the Gemini Earn lending program, a financial product that operated between 2021 and 2022, which allowed customers to lend crypto for interest at 7.4% per annum. Following the FTX crash in 2022, Genesis, which had a significant financial exposure to the now-defunct crypto exchange, halted withdrawals on the Gemini Earn Program, effectively locking up $940 million in investor assets. Since then, a series of events has unfolded, including Genesis entering bankruptcy proceedings, and through that process, all Earn investors ultimately recovered 100 percent of their crypto assets in kind. In addition, Gemini has settled related matters with state and federal regulators, paying over $50 million in civil fines. In the joint stipulation filed this week, the SEC noted that its decision to seek dismissal “in the exercise of its discretion” took into account the full investor recovery and those regulatory settlements. The dismissal is with prejudice, preventing the SEC from re-filing the same claims, and represents the formal end of one of the most high-profile enforcement actions in the US crypto industry. US Crypto Regulatory Turnaround The dismissal of the Gemini case comes amid a broader recalibration of the US crypto regulatory approach under the Donald Trump administration. Several high-profile SEC actions against major platforms, involving Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, have been dropped or paused, reflecting a shift from a forceful regulatory approach seen under the former chairman, Gary Gensler. At the same time, Congress and the White House continue to pursue pro-crypto legislative and policy initiatives. In July 2025, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, a landmark bill establishing a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins, aimed at boosting consumer protection and supporting broader adoption of digital assets. Alongside the GENIUS Act, the highly anticipated Clarity Act , passed by the US House, aims to delineate regulatory responsibilities between agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) based on how digital assets function. The US Senate Agriculture Committee is set to observe a markup session of the bill on January 27, indicating steady progress despite recent concerning events, including public outrage by Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong and the Banking Committee’s continued postponement of its own hearing session.",SEC|CFTC|CLARITY Act|Donald Trump|gemini|Genesis|GENIUS Act|Joint Stipulation,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 10:00:50

In his commentary, the analyst argues that XRP has broken out of what he describes as the largest triangular consolidation pattern in its history, spanning more than six years. Despite ongoing skepticism in parts of the market, XForceGlobal maintains that the technical structure now reflects a confirmed macro breakout rather than a temporary deviation. According to the analyst, the persistence of “fakeout” claims does not align with the broader trend visible on higher timeframes. He clarified that his outlook is not rooted in a permanent bullish or bearish bias, but instead in an effort to follow prevailing trends and identify large-scale breakout formations. This setup positions the analysis as process-driven rather than sentiment-driven, with a focus on market structure rather than short-term price reactions. $XRP Breaking out of the largest 6+ year triangle in history, and people are still calling it a fakeout. I’m not a permabull or permabear on #XRP , but I do like to follow trends and play macro breakout patterns. https://t.co/mDKX3rcpzY pic.twitter.com/92vh6sdxXe — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) January 23, 2026 Risk Management Over Fixed Price Targets Beyond the breakout narrative, XForceGlobal placed strong emphasis on risk management and adaptability. He cautioned against overreliance on price targets, including those he has previously shared, noting that market conditions evolve continuously as new data emerges. In his view, traders should reassess assumptions daily and weekly rather than becoming anchored to static projections. The analyst explained that this approach has directly influenced his own trading decisions. He disclosed that he has already realized partial gains by taking profits into strength, selling approximately half of his position while continuing to build exposure earlier in the trend. This strategy, he suggested, allows for participation in further upside while reducing downside risk if conditions change. XForceGlobal also stressed the importance of progressing “level by level,” urging market participants to focus on measured moves reflected in the chart rather than ambitious end-point valuations. The attached visuals outline potential wave structures and extension zones, but the analyst made clear that these are tools for navigation, not guarantees of outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Trend Structure and Elliott Wave Framework Central to XForceGlobal’s analysis is the use of Elliott Wave Theory to interpret XRP’s market structure . He argued that wave analysis can help traders remain objective and avoid emotional extremes often promoted by permanently bullish or bearish pundits. By focusing on trend alignment and structural confirmation, he believes market participants can better respond to shifts in momentum without ideological attachment. Importantly, the analyst stated that he would not hesitate to adopt a bearish stance if the trend deteriorates. He emphasized that maintaining credibility requires acknowledging when conditions turn unfavorable. However, he concluded that current data does not support such a shift, as the prevailing structure continues to favor the established breakout trend. Overall, XForceGlobal’s commentary presents a technically grounded perspective that combines long-term chart analysis with disciplined risk management. Rather than promoting certainty, the analysis highlights flexibility, trend adherence, and the evaluation of market structure as XRP progresses through its current phase.

57453682,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=27862,1769336304,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/99/default.png,"Ethereum’s Record Throughput, Low Fee Paradox — Implications for Institutions and the EVM Ecosystem",https://blog.bitfinex.com/education/ethereums-record-throughput-low-fee-paradox-implications-for-institutions-and-the-evm-ecosystem/,"Ethereum processed just over 2.88 million transactions in a single day last Friday — the highest daily total in its history. What made this moment particularly noteworthy was that it occurred in the context of unusually low average transaction fees. At first glance, that seems paradoxical. Activity spikes on Ethereum have historically coincided with congestion, fee spikes and, in some quarters , calls for the network’s imminent demise . This cycle looks different. Usage is increasing, fees remain subdued and participation in staking continues to deepen. For many observers, this is a sign that Ethereum’s long-running technical roadmap — particularly its emphasis on Layer-2 scaling — is beginning to deliver. It also raises more fundamental questions about the evolving role of Ethereum’s base layer and the implications for both institutional adoption and the broader EVM ecosystem. Ethereum’s Base Layer Is Narrowing — and Clarifying The current reality appears to reflect deliberate architectural changes that have been years in the making. Rather than serving as the execution venue for every transaction, Ethereum is increasingly assuming the role of a neutral settlement and coordination layer, with the bulk of execution activity migrating to L2s. From an infrastructural and institutional perspective, this development is meaningful. Ethereum is beginning to behave less like a monolithic network constrained by on-chain execution limits, and more like a modular system composed of specialised layers. This mirrors traditional financial infrastructure, where settlement rails prioritise robustness and reliability, while innovation occurs at the edges. For institutions, that distinction matters. Settlement layers are valued not for flexibility or novelty, but for predictability, neutrality and clearly defined operating assumptions. While large-scale production use of Ethereum remains limited among institutions, many emerging use cases — including early experiments in areas such as tokenised securities — rely heavily on trust in the base layer as a shared, verifiable source of truth. In practice, narrowing the scope of the base layer makes Ethereum easier for institutions to assess, concentrating security and finality at the core while pushing execution complexity and user-facing risk to layers designed to absorb it. Rethinking the Fee Narrative This architectural shift has direct implications for how network activity and fees should be interpreted. Historically, rising fees were treated as a proxy for demand and Ethereum’s economic value, with congestion interpreted as evidence that the network was being “used,” even when that usage came at the price of degraded performance. Smooth operation under heavy load, particularly while fees remain low, arguably tells a more important story, pointing to growing operational maturity rather than declining demand. For institutions, this distinction matters. Reliability, predictability and well-understood behaviour under stress tend to matter far more than fee volatility or scarcity-driven narratives. Infrastructure that behaves consistently under load is easier to integrate into regulated and risk-managed environments. Raising the Stakes The recent all-time high in staking reinforces this interpretation. More than 36 million ETH — close to 30% of the circulating supply — is now staked , representing roughly $120 billion secured at the protocol level. A substantial share of this stake is operated via exchanges, professional validators and liquid staking protocols that primarily serve institutions. Validator queue dynamics provide further context. Exit queues have effectively fallen to zero, while entry queues remain long, a pattern more consistent with steady, disciplined participation than speculative inflows or panic-driven exits. Institutions rarely commit capital to long-term staking without confidence in governance stability, operational continuity and clearly defined exit conditions. While higher staking participation does reduce circulating supply and sell pressure, the more meaningful signal is growing comfort with Ethereum’s rules and long-term operating assumptions. A Word of Caution Not all recent transaction growth necessarily reflects meaningful economic coordination, however. Some analysis suggests that a significant portion of recent transaction volume may be driven by address-poisoning activity, particularly involving stablecoins. As transaction costs have fallen, certain forms of spam and phishing have become economically viable at scale, inflating headline activity metrics without corresponding increases in genuine economic use. This complicates how transaction growth should be interpreted. High throughput alone does not distinguish between productive activity and adversarial behaviour, a distinction that becomes increasingly important as execution costs fall. For institutional observers, transaction volume alone is a blunt signal. Understanding the composition and intent of on-chain activity matters as much as the raw numbers themselves. What Institutions Are Actually Watching From an institutional perspective, the central question is not impressive-looking metrics, but whether the system is converging toward operational credibility. That means predictable protocol evolution, transparent trade-offs between efficiency and security, and a clear separation between settlement guarantees and application-level risk. Scaling success is measured not by the absence of risk, but by how clearly that risk is distributed across layers, users and counterparties. Ethereum’s recent performance suggests progress on throughput and stability. Whether that progress translates into durable institutional trust will depend on how effectively complexity and user protection are addressed across the broader ecosystem. A Broader View of Settlement Infrastructure Taken together, these developments highlight a broader principle: long-term institutional adoption depends less on novelty or speed than on neutrality, robustness and minimised trust assumptions. As systems scale, the cost of failure rises and tolerance for experimental risk declines. In this respect, Bitcoin provides a useful reference point. It was designed from the outset as a narrowly scoped settlement system, prioritising simplicity and resilience over expressive execution. Ethereum’s current trajectory suggests a partial convergence toward that logic, clarifying the role of the base layer while pushing flexibility and experimentation to the edges. Whether that maturity proves durable will be determined not just by throughput and fees, but by how well scaling aligns with security, incentives and institutional expectations. In that sense, Ethereum’s recent transaction milestone is perhaps less a victory lap than a stress test — one that will shape how institutions evaluate Ethereum, Bitcoin and settlement infrastructure more broadly in the coming years.

Well, Bithumb tops XRP holdings with 1.84B, followed by Binance at 1.70B and Uphold with 1.51B. Ripple holds 1.33B, underscoring its role in liquidity and market operations. South Korea’s Upbit owns 1.27B, while an anonymous wallet claims 1.24B, rounding out the top six. Why does this matter? Well, this distribution underscores a key crypto market dynamic: exchanges and institutional wallets hold outsized influence. Billions in custody can trigger major price swings, impact liquidity, and shape market sentiment. Ripple’s strategic XRP holdings support supply management, market-making, and financial partnerships, ensuring deep liquidity for high-volume trading. Amid these shifts, XRP is positioned to challenge gold after seven years of decline. Notably, understanding XRP’s top holders is essential for investors looking beyond price charts. Exchanges dominate the leaderboard, highlighting global demand and the growing role of custody and institutional oversight in a market that blends retail and professional participation. Ripple’s recent renewal of its custody deal with Garanti BBVA Crypto in Turkey underscores the importance of secure storage for XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. Tracking top wallets offers insights into liquidity, risk management, and market dynamics, making it a strategic tool for anticipating shifts and understanding the forces shaping XRP’s future. Conclusion In a market dominated by a few major XRP holders, tracking top wallets is crucial for understanding price, liquidity, and market stability.

He noted that the AI models could usurp human identities and relationships, influence public opinion, and deepen social polarization. The comments come as many artificial intelligence models face criticisms since the start of the year. The most glaring one is that of xAI chatbot Grok, which has faced criticism over its use to create inappropriate deepfake images of women and children. Countries across the world have issued a standing order to the platform to fix its chatbot, with some even going as far as suspending its use in their country while asking Elon Musk to create safeguards to fix the issue. Pope Leo XIV highlights the dangers of AI to humans In his message marking the World Day of Social Communications, the pope mentioned that AI systems can reflect how their creators see the world. He mentioned that they can also shape patterns of thought by reproducing the biases embedded in the data that they process. “The challenge is a matter of protecting human identity and authentic relationships,” the pontiff said. We need faces and voices to once again speak the person. We need to safeguard the gift of communication as the deepest truth of the human being, and to orient every technological innovation toward it. https://t.co/PmSAHj4gju — Pope Leo XIV (@Pontifex) January 24, 2026 Pope Leo XIV’s warnings are also coming as generative AI continues to make leaps and bounds towards replication. The models are now used to manufacture images, music, and texts to levels where they are sometimes indistinguishable from human-made works. In 2023, his predecessor, Pope Francis, was the subject of several viral fake AI images. In some images, he wore a white puffer jacket instead of his usual robes, while in others, he was altered in some ways. Since then, generative AI has been the go-to tool for some high-profile figures, including United States President Donald Trump, who has generated and posted several AI-generated images to his online accounts. In his speech, Pope Leo XIV warned that only a small number of companies hold significant power over AI development, and that AI tools are now increasing the difficulty of telling apart works that were created by humans and those created using the models. Pope urges tech leaders to look into AI risks This is not the first time that Pope Leo XIV has warned the global populace about the risks and dangers associated with artificial intelligence. Since he was elected Pope last May as the first pontiff from the United States, he has consistently warned about the growing influence of AI technology. In November, he urged the leaders in the technology industry to build artificial intelligence models that respect human dignity. He highlighted that AI development is part of a larger struggle over who we become when we build systems that learn, decide, and operate at a global scale. “Technological innovation can be a form of participation in the divine act of creation. It carries an ethical and spiritual weight, for every design choice expresses a vision of humanity,” the Pope said at the time. He called on builders of AI to create models that show genuine reverence for life. In addition to creating models that show genuine reverence for life, the Pope also criticized systems that present statistical probability as reliable knowledge, adding that the tools only offer approximation. He noted that the challenge ahead is to establish effective governance and called on countries to educate young people about how algorithms influence perceptions of reality. The pontiff also condemned the increased use of AI in military applications, warning against delegating life-and-death decisions to machines. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Big-cap holdings remain, but in periods of higher returns traders tend to move into new cheap altcoins with clear roadmap and less high valuation. This rotation has been observed with a section of Cardano investors who now are placing in a different cryptocurrency that is less than $1 before the first protocol launch. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) is still among the most common platforms of smart contract in the market. ADA is trading at approximately $0.36 and its market cap of approximately $13B. Since its previous rise wave, ADA has not been able to cross the resistance levels of $0.42 and $0.50. According to analysts, these areas have limited potential gains in the recent rallies and provided resistance to the movement of trends. Valuation has been the other challenge facing ADA. Big caps have lower rates of repricing because more liquidity is needed to dispose of the asset. Analysts monitoring leading cryptocurrencies claim that Cardano has a chance of doing well over time, but its prospective to forward appreciation is less strong than that of cheap cryptos that just entered their initial adoption cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The latest altcoin that has been on the news is the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new developing cryptocurrency that creates a decentralized lending system. Mutuum Finance started out in early 2025 at a presale price of $0.01 but has advanced to Phase 7 at $0.04. The presale has raised $19.9M and has also gotten 18,900 holders comprising about 830M tokens. The reallocators of the ADA appeal are at the initial phase of the protocol. Mutuum Finance is constructing a borrowing and lending platform through which users can provide their assets to earn yield and borrow without the need to sell their collateral. The platform is assessed by Halborn Security as an independent audit and reportedly possesses a 90 out of 100 score on the CertiK token scan. In the case of lending protocol, this validation is regarded as being necessary because of liquidation and collateral management. Weaknesses vs Strengths: ADA vs MUTM Analysts tend to make a comparison between ADA and MUTM more of a maturity, as opposed to a competition. ADA is an established firm with a huge market capital, decrease in percentage growth and high liquidity needs. MUTM is early and has lower valuation and first-activation roadmap that might reprice based on utility and not market narratives. To long-term allocators, this contrast tends to result in portfolio math. To take an example a $500 investment in ADA when the price is at $0.36 could have little upward potential unless significant catalysts develop. Conversely, an initial investment of $500 in MUTM at $0.04 would give a significantly large share of MUTM. Analysts emphasise the fact that this is just a reflection of why smaller assets in the earlier stages are more likely to appeal to investors looking to have a better upside potential. Phase Progression and Q1 Catalyst Setup The X account of Mutuum Finance supported the claim by stating that V1 protocol will go to Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 contains borrowing, lending, collateral regulations and liquidation mechanisms. This is referred to as having the first point of visibility of protocol usage as opposed to theoretical. Phase 7 is also pacing faster than the preceding phases and analysts have reported greater whale allocations and greater involvement of late-stage buyers. The second step will raise the MUTM price by almost 20% which has made a timing aspect to the investors deciding on the crypto they can purchase before the release window of the Q1. It is probable that Cardano will continue to be a stable project with a high reputation, though analysts think that the project may not be able to grow its value due to valuation and market saturation. Mutuum Finance can be considered the other side of the curve: early utility, growing participation and unpriced. Investors who are considering the best crypto opportunities in Q1 2026, MUTM has become one of the most interesting companies with a roadmap that will soon shift towards implementation as opposed to planning.

57453998,https://cryptonews.com/?p=478719,1769337477,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57453998.jpeg,Stablecoin Trading Surges 62% in Korea as Dollar Strengthens Against Won,https://cryptonews.com/news/stablecoin-trading-surges-62-in-korea-as-dollar-strengthens-against-won/,"South Korean crypto exchanges recorded a 62% surge in stablecoin trading volumes as the won fell to multi-year lows against the dollar, prompting platforms to intensify marketing campaigns around dollar-pegged tokens. According to The Korea Times , trading volume in Tether (USDT) across the nation’s five major won-based exchanges climbed to 378.2 billion won ($261 million) when the exchange rate exceeded 1,480 won per dollar last Wednesday, citing CryptoQuant data. The spike follows mounting currency pressures that pushed the won through nine consecutive days of declines against the dollar, marking its longest losing streak since 2008, Bloomberg reported. Source: Bloomberg Major exchanges, including Korbit, Coinone, Upbit, and Bithumb, launched aggressive promotional campaigns centered on stablecoins, including USDC and USDe, waiving trading fees and distributing rewards to boost volumes during what industry officials described as a downturn in broader crypto markets. Banks Slash Dollar Rates as Government Defends Currency According to The Chosun Daily , South Korea’s major commercial banks slash e d dollar deposit interest rates to near zero in response to government pressure to defend the exchange rate. Shinhan Bank cut its annual rate from 1.5% to 0.1% starting January 30, while Hana Bank reduced rates from 2% to 0.05% for its Travelog Foreign Currency Account. The coordinated move followed the authorities’ summoning of bank executives and their request that they “ refrain from excessive marketing that encourages foreign currency deposits such as dollars. ” Banks responded by introducing incentives for won conversion, with Shinhan offering a 90% preferential rate for customers converting dollar deposits back to won, plus an additional 0.1 percentage point rate boost for those subscribing to won-term deposits afterward. Dollar deposit balances at the five major banks fell 3.8% from month-end to 63.25 billion dollars as of January 22, marking the first decline after three consecutive months of surges. Corporate deposits, which account for 80% of all dollar holdings, dropped sharply from 52.42 billion dollars at year-end to 49.83 billion dollars, suggesting that the authorities’ recommendation to sell dollars spot, combined with perceptions that the exchange rate had peaked, was driving the decline. Individual dollar deposits grew at a significantly slower pace, rising just 109.64 million dollars, compared with the previous month’s 1.09 billion dollar surge. Presidential Intervention Accelerates Won Stabilization President Lee Jae-myung delivered a rare verbal intervention on the exchange rate during a January 21 press conference, stating authorities predicted the rate would drop to around 1,400 won within one to two months. The won-dollar rate immediately fell from 1,481.4 won to 1,467.7 won following his remarks, closing at 1,471.3 won. Source: TheChosunDaily Market observers noted the unprecedented nature of a sitting president specifying both an exchange rate target and timeline, with Lee’s statement carrying significantly more weight than U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s earlier comment that the won’s recent decline was “ inconsistent with Korea’s strong fundamentals. ” Meanwhile, demand for dollar exchange slowed as average daily won-to-dollar conversions reached 16.54 million dollars from January 1-22, while dollar-to-won conversions surged to 5.2 million dollars daily, significantly exceeding last year’s 3.78 million dollar average and indicating increased profit-taking. In fact, according to CNBC , South Korea’s fourth-quarter GDP growth slowed to 1.5% year over year, missing economists’ forecasts of 1.9%, as construction investment shrank 3.9% and exports pulled back 2.1% from the previous quarter. The won has lost nearly 2% against the greenback this year, making it one of Asia’s worst-performing currencies, while South Korean retail investors bought approximately 2.4 billion dollars of U.S. equities on a net basis through mid-January, up roughly 60% from the same period last year. The broader economic slowdown comes as Seoul advances major crypto policy reforms despite regulatory gridlock over stablecoin governance. Earlier this month, South Korea ended its nine-year corporate crypto trading ban , permitting listed companies to invest up to 5% of equity capital in top-20 cryptocurrencies, while lawmakers passed amendments to the Capital Markets Act and Electronic Securities Act establishing legal frameworks for tokenized securities trading beginning January 2027. South Korea has launched guidelines, allowing listed companies and professional investors to invest up to 5% of their equity capital crypto. #SouthKorea #CorporateCryptoInvestment #CryptoInvestment https://t.co/d55u3TDsBF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 12, 2026 Korea Exchange Chairman Jeong Eun-bo pledged to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs and extend trading hours to 24/7 as part of efforts to eliminate the “ Korea discount, ” though comprehensive digital asset legislation remains stalled amid disputes between the Financial Services Commission and the Bank of Korea over stablecoin issuance rules.

The pullback came as the broader digital asset market struggled to find direction amid sustained selling pressure and weakening investor sentiment. The bulk of the selling came from Bitcoin, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust posting net weekly outflows of about $522.4 million. The heaviest drawdown occurred on January 21, when IBIT alone recorded roughly $356.6 million in outflows. Additional selling followed later in the week, including $101.6 million on January 23 and $56.9 million on January 20, outweighing a modest $15.1 million inflow earlier in the period. Total Bitcoin spot ETFs inflows. Source: Coinglass Ethereum saw similarly strong selling pressure. In this case, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust registered total weekly outflows of approximately $416.6 million. The largest single-day outflow came on January 21, when ETHA shed about $250.3 million. This was followed by further declines of $92.3 million on January 20, $44.4 million on January 22, and $44.5 million on January 23, offset only slightly by a $14.9 million inflow on January 16. Total Ethereum spot ETFs inflows. Source: Coinglass ETFs accelerate crypto market downturn In total, BlackRock offloaded about $939 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum in a single week. These moves were part of a wider trend across U.S. spot crypto ETFs, which collectively logged persistent net outflows as institutional investors reduced exposure. While a handful of funds managed small inflows on isolated days, they were outweighed by broad-based selling in both Bitcoin and Ethereum products. The ETF-driven selling coincided with a broader downturn in the crypto market . Bitcoin and Ethereum traded under sustained pressure throughout the week, as investors reacted to macro uncertainty, declining risk appetite, and fading momentum following earlier rallies. Market sentiment weakened as persistent outflows reinforced concerns about near-term downside risks. To this end, Bitcoin fell below the crucial $90,000 level, while Ethereum dropped below $3,000.

57454424,https://cryptonews.com/?p=478724,1769338914,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/57454424.jpeg,XRP Price Prediction: $1.88 Triple-Bottom Support as ETF Money Pulls Back – What’s Next?,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-prediction-1-88-triple-bottom-support-as-etf-money-pulls-back-whats-next/,"XRP is trading near $1.89–$1.91 as January draws to a close, holding a well-defined triple-bottom support around $1.88 after slipping below the $2.00 mark earlier this week. The pullback has coincided with ETF outflows and a sharp drop in trading volume, but price action suggests stabilization rather than renewed selling pressure. With volatility compressing and buyers repeatedly defending the same demand zone, XRP is approaching a technical decision point that could define its next directional move. ETF Outflows Ease Short-Term Momentum Without Breaking the Thesis Short-term pressure has been driven largely by institutional flows. According to data reported by CryptoQuant, U.S. spot XRP ETFs recorded their first weekly net outflows, totaling approximately $40.6 million toward the end of January. Trading volume has also declined sharply, with some estimates showing a 50%+ drop in 24-hour activity, signaling trader hesitation rather than aggressive selling. That said, the flow data points to rotation and profit-taking, not abandonment. XRP remains one of the few large-cap tokens with clear regulatory positioning in the US, and earlier ETF inflows north of $1 billion underscore that institutional interest hasn’t disappeared. The current reset appears more about leverage clearing than confidence breaking. Core Adoption Trends Remain Unchanged Despite Price Weakness Fundamentally, Ripple’s long-term thesis remains unchanged. XRP continues to underpin on-demand liquidity (ODL) across Ripple’s global payments network, offering faster and cheaper settlement compared to legacy systems. More than 300 financial institutions remain connected to RippleNet, and ongoing regulatory clarity following 2025 rulings continues to distinguish XRP from many peers. While no major partnership headlines have emerged this week, the absence of negative ecosystem news reinforces the view that the current weakness is market-driven, not fundamental. XRP Price Prediction: Volatility Shrinks at $1.90 – Breakout or Breakdown Ahead? From a technical perspective, XRP price prediction remains cautiously neutral near term. On the 2-hour chart, price is stabilizing inside a descending channel, capped by a falling trendline near $1.95. XRP is trading below the 50-EMA and 100-EMA, while the 200-EMA near $1.99 continues to act as firm resistance. XRP Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Support is clearly defined between $1.88 and $1.85, where repeated long lower wicks suggest responsive buying. RSI has recovered into the mid-40s after oversold readings, indicating easing downside pressure. Volatility has contracted, forming a descending wedge, a structure that often resolves higher if support holds. A successful break above $1.95 would expose $2.03–$2.06, signaling structural repair. Conversely, a decisive loss of $1.85 would open downside toward $1.80 and $1.77. XRP Trade setup: Accumulate near $1.88–$1.85, target $2.03–$2.06, invalidation below $1.80.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/easya-co-founder-reiterates-1000-xrp-price-by-2030-heres-why/,"EasyA co-founder Dom Kwok recently addressed comments from members of the XRP community in a short conversation that combined humor with a clear expression of long-term confidence. While the tone of the interaction was light, the message itself underscored Kwok’s belief that XRP’s future valuation will far exceed current levels. The exchange also highlighted how sharply opinions remain divided among market participants when it comes to long-term price expectations and regulatory risk. Kwok’s Statement and Julie’s Response Kwok initiated the exchange by stating that he did not go grey at the age of 30 for XRP to be worth anything less than $1,000 by 2030 . The comment was not presented as a technical forecast or a data-based projection, but rather as a personal expression of conviction. Julie, an X user responding to Kwok, replied that inexpensive XRP still “looks good” on him, keeping the interaction informal and playful. Kwok responded once more by telling readers to imagine how good expensive XRP is going to look. With that reply, he reinforced his original position without expanding on specific catalysts or timelines. The exchange remained concise, but the message was unambiguous: Kwok continues to expect significant long-term upside for XRP . fyi i did not go grey at the age of 30 for $XRP to be worth any less than $1,000 by 2030 — Dom Kwok | EasyA (@dom_kwok) January 23, 2026 Community Reactions Highlight Divided Views Other users quickly added their own perspectives. An X user identified as GM147 rejected the idea of extreme price appreciation, arguing that such outcomes are limited to imagination and asserting that XRP would never reach values far above its historical ranges. This comment reflected a skeptical view often expressed by traders who focus on past market behavior rather than future structural change. Another commenter, D Rock, offered a different response. While stating that they have held XRP for years and remain committed, the user expressed concern about government actions related to digital assets. Their comment referenced increased attention on wallets, discussions around seizure of crypto assets, and uncertainty tied to legislation. Unlike GM147’s response, this view did not dismiss long-term potential outright but emphasized unease about external pressures. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Concerns in the Background Although regulatory issues were not the central focus of Kwok’s remarks, they remain a significant factor influencing investor sentiment. Recent discussions around expanded financial surveillance powers, asset forfeiture laws that do not require criminal convictions, and state-level measures that treat digital wallets as property subject to seizure have contributed to anxiety among some holders. These concerns help explain why expressions of confidence often coexist with caution within the same community. Optimism Meets Skepticism Kwok’s comments served as a reaffirmation of belief rather than an attempt to persuade critics with analysis. The replies they received, ranging from outright dismissal to cautious support, illustrate how sharply opinions differ within the XRP community . Even a brief exchange can reveal the contrast between long-term optimism, market skepticism, and regulatory concern that continues to shape conversations around XRP’s future.

The data leaked access to 420,000 Binance accounts, Instagram, Facebook, Roblox, dating sites, and other platforms. The database exposed to the public lacked encryption and password protection, according to Jeremiah Fowler from ExpressVPN. It included 149,404,754 distinct login credentials and reached 96 GB in size of raw data. Millions of account logins leaked from Binance, Instagram, Google, and TikTok. Source: ExpressVPN blog . The leaked data was open to the public The database was open to the public. Anyone who found it could access millions of people’s credentials. The exposed documents contained emails, usernames, passwords, and account login URLs. The leaked records included data from social media websites like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter). Dating apps and OnlyFans accounts data revealed login methods for creators and users. Fowler found leaked logins from many streaming accounts as well, such as Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, and Roblox. In the small sample of records the cybersecurity researcher examined, he found financial service accounts, crypto wallets , Binance trading accounts, as well as banking and credit card logins. Government accounts were not spared either. Logins linked to [dot]gov domains from various nations were found. Such sensitive data may enable targeted phishing or impersonation attacks. This could threaten national security and public safety. The database was hosted online but lacked ownership details. Fowler reported it to the hosting provider, and after almost a month, the hosting was suspended. The hosting provider refused to reveal who managed the database. It remains unclear whether the database was used for criminal activity, legitimate research, or why it was publicly exposed. The database exposure duration is unknown. Other people might have accessed it. A troubling detail is that the records kept growing until they became restricted and inaccessible, the cybersecurity researcher added. The total number of records and the size of the exposed infostealer database. Source: ExpressVPN blog . Infostealer malware collected logins and extra information The database contained keylogging and infostealer malware, which secretly collect credentials from infected devices. Unlike old infostealer malware datasets, these files recorded extra information. The records contained the “host_reversed path.” This structure organizes stolen data by victim and source for easy indexing. Reversing the hostname can prevent directory conflicts and evade simple detection rules targeting common domain formats. The system assigned each unique log line a document ID based on a line hash to guarantee one distinct record. A brief check showed these hash and document IDs were unique with no duplicates found. The release of many unique usernames and passwords creates a major security threat for many people who are unaware that their data was compromised. Criminals may use this information to automate attacks on accounts like email, crypto wallets, social media, and business systems. This greatly raises the risk of fraud, identity theft, financial crimes, and phishing scams. Malware silently steals login data and sends it to hackers. Changing passwords is useless in the presence of malware and infostealers. Installing antivirus software helps detect and remove malware from smartphones and computers completely. An October report by Security[dot]org found that about 66% of U.S. adults used antivirus software in 2025. Many users have unprotected devices that are vulnerable to infostealer malware. The report stated that $16.6 billion was lost to cybercrime in a single year. If someone thinks their device has malware, they should act right away. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

According to industry officials, stablecoins have seen a rise in demand across the Korean crypto market amid a rise in the won-dollar exchange rate due to volatility. While the benchmark KOSPI and other commodities like gold and silver have risen to new levels, digital assets have always been left out of previous rallies, which usually leaves South Korean exchanges struggling. However, things have changed this time, with the rise in the value of the US dollar boosting the demand for stablecoins . This has prompted exchanges to capitalize on the trend and increase trading volumes. South Korean exchanges turn to stablecoins to boost volumes The trend began with Korbit announcing its plan to waive all trading fees for transactions involving dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC) last week. The stablecoin was developed by Circle, and each token is designed to maintain the value of a dollar. In addition, Korbit also announced a USDC trading campaign that remains ongoing. The campaign is expected to run through March, warning users that they will record at least 10 million won ($6,900) in weekly cumulative transaction volume. The exchange mentioned that traders who hit this threshold would be eligible to share a reward pool totaling 25,000 USDC, with allocations varying based on the trading volume of the participant for that week. Coinone is also running a similar campaign, announcing that it will distribute 8,000 USDC to its users every week if they reach a certain trading volume by the end of that week. Meanwhile, Upbit and Bithumb are taking a different approach. The exchanges, considered the two biggest in the Korean crypto industry, are listing new stablecoins. Some weeks ago, both exchanges announced the listing of Ethena USD ( USDe ), a synthetic stablecoin developed by Ethena Labs. The token is designed to maintain a one-on-one value with the US dollar without relying on traditional bank reserves. The two firms have also launched other campaigns aimed at increasing their transaction volumes. Upbit recently announced a three-round promotion campaign that started on January 17, offering free Ethena tokens to its users who rank among the top traders of USDe. The intensifying marketing push around dollar-pegged stablecoins has been driven largely by the sharp drop in the won-dollar exchange rate. As the exchange rate continues to move higher, trading activity using dollar-based stablecoins has increased drastically. Exchange rate skyrockets amid moves to regulate stablecoins Data from on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shows that when the exchange rate exceeded 1,480 won per dollar last Wednesday, trading volume in Tether across the major exchanges trading in won hit 378.2 billion won, marking a 62% rise from January 1. According to an official from one of the top exchanges, exchanges are stepping up their activities due to the rising exchange rate. In the current market environment, stablecoins are used to boost trading volumes and develop new revenue streams. Meanwhile, Korea recently made its first legislative step to curb money laundering via stablecoins. The country announced that stablecoins would be brought under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act as part of efforts to combat money laundering and tax evasion using digital assets. The bill was proposed by Rep. Park Sung-hoon, and classified stablecoin as a legal means of payment, placing them alongside existing instruments like government-issued notes and banknotes. “This regulatory gap could enable illegal foreign exchange dealings and tax evasion using stablecoins,” the lawmaker said. “The bill aims to classify virtual assets pegged to domestic or foreign currencies, which can be used for payments for a broad range of users, as official means of payment under the law.” The concerns mirrored those of the Bank of Korea, which warned that stablecoins could be used for cross-border transactions without complying with reporting requirements.

Blockchain security researcher Wu Blockchain first identified the compromise and alerted the community to ignore any communications from the account. The warning emphasized particular concern given Chen’s extensive network of high-profile cryptocurrency executives, developers, and investors who might trust messages from his verified account.

Industry Faces Relentless Social Engineering Wave BNB Chain’s official account suffered a similar breach in October when hackers posted fake reward programs with phishing links after Binance co-founder CZ warned followers against clicking suspicious content. The compromised account promoted fraudulent BSC token distributions, promising early payouts to users who voted on reward dates through malicious URLs designed to drain digital wallets. Binance co-CEO Yi He’s WeChat account was also hijacked in December to promote meme coin schemes, with attackers conducting a coordinated pump-and-dump operation around the token MUBARA. Two wallets created hours before the breach accumulated 21.16 million tokens before dumping holdings as retail traders flooded in, netting attackers approximately $55,000 while leaving later buyers exposed to price collapse. Changpeng Zhao @cz_binance warned that new co-CEO Yi He’s @heyibinance abandoned WeChat account was hacked and used to push a meme coin called MUBARA. #Binance #Memecoins https://t.co/sdyH325OMD — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 10, 2025 Among other notable accounts hacked were ZKsync and Matter Labs, which were compromised in May through what the team described as “ delegated accounts ” with limited posting privileges. Hackers published false claims about an SEC investigation alongside fake airdrop promotions, triggering a 5% drop in the ZK token price despite a prior 38.5% weekly rally. The prominent crypto media company, Watcher.Guru also confirmed its account breach in March after fake Ripple-SWIFT partnership claims spread across connected Telegram, Facebook, and Discord channels through automated content bots. The team suspects the compromise originated from a suspicious link containing unusual query strings shared in their Telegram group weeks earlier. Record Theft Year Exposes Escalating Threats The crypto ecosystem witnessed over $3.4 billion stolen in 2025, according to Chainalysis’s 2026 Crypto Crime Report , with North Korean state-backed hackers accounting for a record $2.02 billion across fewer but increasingly sophisticated attacks. Source: Chainalysis The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea now represents 76% of all service compromises, bringing cumulative DPRK cryptocurrency theft to $6.75 billion since operations began. Personal wallet compromises surged to 158,000 incidents affecting at least 80,000 unique victims, triple the 54,000 cases recorded in 2022. Address poisoning scams drove December’s single-largest loss , when one victim transferred $50 million to a fraudulent wallet mimicking their intended destination, while private key leaks resulted in $27.3 million stolen from multi-signature wallets. Personal Security Breaches Surge Across Platforms Most recently, Ubuntu developer Alan Pope warned that attackers are hijacking Snap Store publisher accounts by registering expired domains linked to legitimate developers, then pushing malicious updates to previously trusted packages. The technique exploits automatic update systems and established trust signals, with at least 2 confirmed cases of wallet-stealing malware distributed through seemingly normal applications. Hackers are exploiting trusted Snap Store packages to steal cryptocurrency by hijacking existing publisher accounts. #Hack #Crypto https://t.co/YV5Yoiwb0F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 21, 2026 Given these growing, multifaceted attack vectors, Better Business Bureau officials are warning consumers about phishing campaigns that lock X users out of their accounts and are subsequently used for cryptocurrency promotions.

Coinbase CEO Praises Trump-Led White House As Most Crypto-Forward Government In a January 24 post on the social media platform X, Armstrong shared a few key “themes and takeaways” from the latest edition of WEF. After admitting that the conference offered a productive time of meeting people one-on-one, the Coinbase CEO revealed that the major focus was on pushing crypto adoption globally. Starting his list of takeaways, Armstrong highlighted that everyone was talking about tokenization, which is beginning to expand to every asset class in the world. The crypto leader said to expect some major progress in the tokenization sector in 2026, especially as the Fortune 500 business leaders continuously lean in. Secondly, the Coinbase CEO shared that crypto legislation and the CLARITY Act were another area of focus, as the government of the day looks to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. According to Armstrong, most of the bank CEOs he met at the WEF in the past week are actually pro-crypto. Armstrong wrote on X: One CEO of a top 10 global bank told me crypto is their number one priority, and they view it as existential. Furthermore, the Coinbase CEO lauded the Trump administration as the most crypto-forward government in the world at the moment. Armstrong acknowledged their progress with the crypto market structure, stating that these clear rules are crucial for global competitiveness and will put money back in people’s pockets. In what seemed like a cheeky tone, Armstrong mentioned that ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) topics didn’t come up throughout the forum. According to the crypto founder, the week felt productive, as it centered around real, global progress — all thanks to BlackRock CEO and new WEF co-chair Larry Fink. The Coinbase leader touted crypto and AI (artificial intelligence) as the most talked-about technologies in today’s world. Highlighting their compatibility, Armstrong stated that AI agents will eventually default to using stablecoins for payments, as they cannot be KYC’d like human beings. Finally, Armstrong revealed that the Coinbase, Circle, and Bermuda partnership to build a fully on-chain economy was announced at WEF Davos 2026. “Excited to make progress on this and create a compelling case study for other nations to follow,” the crypto CEO concluded. Total Crypto Market Cap At $3.09 Trillion As of this writing, the global cryptocurrency market has a total capitalization of $3.086 trillion, with Bitcoin retaining its spot as the world’s largest cryptocurrency.",Coinbase|Brian Armstrong|coinbase|crypto|crypto news|WEF Davos 2026,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 12:00:39

Here’s What Is Happening,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-this-is-just-the-beginning-heres-what-is-happening/,"Crypto investor and analyst Xaif Crypto has highlighted the early performance of XRP exchange-traded funds, describing them as a small but expanding segment of the digital asset market. In a recent post, Xaif Crypto noted that XRP-focused ETFs have delivered stronger-than-expected early inflows and returns, suggesting that institutional exposure to XRP through regulated investment products is beginning to take shape. According to the analyst, these initial metrics indicate that the current phase may represent only the early stages of a longer-term development for XRP-based investment vehicles. The commentary was accompanied by data outlining the performance of multiple XRP ETFs across spot, income, and leveraged categories. The figures, sourced from Bloomberg and VettaFi as of January 16, 2026, show that several spot XRP ETFs have accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in assets under management within a relatively short timeframe. Products such as the Canary XRP ETF, Bitwise XRP ETF, and Franklin XRP ETF reported assets ranging from approximately $287 million to $374 million, with year-to-date returns clustered in the low-to-mid teens. $XRP ETFs are a small, yet growing segment of the crypto space XRP ETFs have outperformed many expectations early flows and returns hint this is just the beginning https://t.co/5GocCnItti pic.twitter.com/Eti62YgcgG — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) January 24, 2026 XRP ETF: Flows, Returns, and Market Positioning Xaif Crypto’s post emphasized that despite XRP ETFs representing a relatively narrow slice of the overall crypto ETF market, their early net flows and performance metrics have surpassed many initial assumptions. While the attached data shows that multiple spot products recorded positive year-to-date net inflows, some leveraged XRP ETFs posted notably higher year-to-date returns, exceeding 20 percent in certain cases. At the same time, since-inception returns for several funds remain negative, reflecting the broader volatility XRP has experienced over the past year. The analyst’s assessment focused on the importance of these early indicators rather than the absolute scale. While XRP ETFs currently trail Bitcoin-related funds in total assets, the pace of adoption and the diversity of available structures were presented as signs of increasing institutional engagement with XRP exposure. Debate Over ETF Impact on Token Prices The post also prompted a direct exchange about the role ETFs play in the crypto market. An X user, identified as RESEDARAN, argued that ETFs are detached from the underlying crypto ecosystem, stating that such products only provide awareness and do not materially affect token valuations. In response, Xaif Crypto rejected that view, asserting that spot ETFs can have a direct and measurable impact on token prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Xaif Crypto, spot ETFs require fund providers to hold the underlying tokens. When investors purchase ETF shares, the issuer must acquire additional XRP to maintain proper backing, thereby increasing market demand. The analyst pointed to the experience of Bitcoin spot ETFs , which coincided with substantial capital inflows and upward price movement, as an example of how ETF-driven demand can influence market dynamics. Xaif Crypto further noted that ETFs open the door to institutional capital that may otherwise avoid direct participation in crypto markets. Xaif Crypto’s analysis positions XRP ETFs as an emerging institutional gateway with tangible market implications. While still modest in size, the combination of early inflows, competitive returns, and expanding product offerings suggests that XRP ETFs could play a growing role in shaping demand for XRP in regulated financial environments.

Analysts Weigh the Odds,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-coin-outlook-2026-can-bnb-smash-1k-barrier-analysts-weigh-the-odds/,"The Binance Coin is in a critical period of valuation because investors are reviewing the extent to which top cryptocurrencies can scale in the upcoming market cycle. Other analysts are of the opinion that even though major tokens might continue to do well, the biggest returns will not be made in assets already valued at scale. Still others hold the view that BNB has the ability to push higher although it will require more stimulating factors to rise out of its gravity of valuation to move into new price bands by 2026. Binance Coin (BNB) BNB is selling at approximately $890 and its market cap is around $120B. The token is also among the most developed assets in the top crypto ranking. BNB has bouncy aggression in the previous cycles, however analysts indicate that there are levels of resistance close to $950 and $1,000 that have rejected the resurgence of several continuations in the recent months. To get through, BNB would require a refreshed demand and increased narrative support in the market. Certain price predictors of crypto have revised their 2026-2027 forecasts. With the moderate growth rate, the BNB would be able to go to a range of $1,050 to $1,200, which is a possible 20% to 35% growth of the present stock. This forecast is positive, but it is not as high as the growth multiples several traders are interested in. This is frequently the case with large caps, since they demand high liquidity and slower prices. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the new cryptocurrency project that has attracted the interest of many investors who seek greater upside. It is developing a decentralized lending and borrowing system in which people are able to deposit assets to earn APY and borrow without selling their collateral. As per the official X account of the project , Sepolia testnet is going to receive V1 protocol in Q1 2026. V1 consists of collateral rules, debt accounting, liquidation systems and structured lending operations. Analysts indicate that V1 is the project at which Mutuum Finance is in its development stage as opposed to being in the usage stage. In the case of valuation models, this change is important since the amount of borrowing, repayment of interest and security requirements are exposed to the market. Presale Structure and Data of Participation In early 2025, Mutuum Finance started its presale at $0.1. In Phase 7, the token has appreciated by 300% to be at a value of $0.04. The pre-sale recorded an amount of $19.9M and attracted over 18,900 holders. Approximately 830M of the tokens are already sold. A leaderboard running 24 hours per day also makes the project a reward to the best contributor, which is 500 MUTM. In addition, card payment access has also been introduced, which simplifies the task of onboarding users who do not already have crypto assets. In addition to lending and borrowing, Mutuum Finance will also launch an overcollateralized stablecoin where users will be able to mint against collateral. Analysts who monitor the emerging cryptocurrency projects cover the issuance of stablecoins as significant since it enables longer-term borrowing, which generates predictable revenue to the protocol. The roadmap also includes layer-2 expansion to lower the user costs and enhance accessibility. Adequate liquidation and collateral protection data is needed. To justify this, Mutuum Finance will be equipped with oracle feeds to feed price input at volatility times. DeFi projects use this reliability layer to avoid liquidation events caused by distorted prices. Final View Security has been one of the major concerns because of lending procedures. Mutuum Finance has undergone an independent audit with Halborn Security and has a 90 out of 100 score on CertiK on a token scan. There is a $50,000 bug bounty which is open to further code review before V1. BNB is commonly viewed as a large-cap hold within the established segment. The asset already trades at scale and carries deep liquidity. Because of that maturity, analysts suggest the outlook for BNB in 2026–2027 may be limited to a move toward the $950 to $1,050 band, which represents a roughly 7% to 18% appreciation from current levels. This profile reflects valuation gravity rather than lack of relevance. Mutuum Finance sits on the other side of the spectrum. It is considered an early utility token preparing for its first activation cycle. Under the scenario where V1 goes live and mainnet follows after, collateral rules are operational, and stablecoin minting opens, analysts outline a path where MUTM could reprice into the $0.35 to $0.40 zone during 2026. From the current $0.04 presale level, that would reflect roughly 500% to 700% appreciation under a bullish utility case. This contrast between a saturated large-cap with slowed return expectations and an early-stage developing crypto entering its first utility cycle illustrates allocation logic for 2026. The maturity of BNB and the premature stage of MUTM highlight two different approaches to exposure. Analysts argue that the spread between their respective outlooks may define how investors choose to allocate across the next rotation window.

Notably, XRP has lost the $2 support in recent sessions, aligning with the broader sell-off in the cryptocurrency market as investor interest in risk assets wanes. At press time, XRP was trading at $1.90, having plunged by about 0.7% in the past 24 hours, while on the weekly timeframe, the asset is down over 7%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold ChatGPT’s analysis indicated that XRP has historically offered better risk-adjusted returns during low-momentum, sideways markets rather than during strong breakouts. Accumulation tends to be more effective when trading volume fades, and market sentiment turns cautious or neutral. Best XRP buying zones The key buy zone identified by the model is the $1.80 to $1.90 range, which has repeatedly acted as strong technical support and attracted sustained buying interest. The preferred timing within this range is after price stabilizes and forms a base, indicating that selling pressure is being absorbed, rather than during sharp intraday sell-offs. From a timing perspective, ChatGPT pointed to multi-day consolidation phases with compressed volatility as the most favorable entry periods. These phases often follow pullbacks and precede renewed moves, typically occurring when the broader crypto market is calm rather than euphoric or panicked. In contrast, ChatGPT flagged elevated risk during rapid price spikes, especially short-term gains exceeding 10%, which have historically led to poor entries and subsequent pullbacks or prolonged consolidation. Buying XRP above $2 Buying XRP above $2 without prior consolidation is also considered unfavorable, as price action in such cases tends to be fragile and sensitive to broader market corrections. Periods of heightened optimism on social media have likewise aligned more often with local tops than durable entry points. Broader cryptocurrency market conditions also matter. In this line, ChatGPT noted that the healthiest accumulation windows usually emerge when Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading in a stable range, allowing more orderly capital rotation into altcoins like XRP. Looking ahead, ChatGPT suggested the best buying timeline is before major catalysts are fully priced in. Historically, XRP has performed better when accumulated during quiet pre-event phases tied to regulatory or institutional narratives, rather than after headline-driven rallies.

As the calendar nears the January 30 funding deadline, decentralized bettors are pushing the likelihood of a shutdown to levels not seen in recent months, with trading jumping dramatically. That reflects a continued stalemate in Congress over federal spending bills and mounting tensions ahead of funding negotiations. This estimate was made at a time when the CLARITY Act , a proposed United States federal bill to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, was advancing in Congress. The previous delays stemmed mainly from the record 43-day US government shutdown that occurred in two consecutive months: October and November. US citizens raise concerns about the possibility of another shutdown this month Collin Rugg, a prominent conservative political commentator and influencer with a massive following of 1.8 million on the social media platform X, shared a post dated Saturday, January 24. Rugg said this increase came after United States Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that Senate Democrats would not support advancing the appropriations bill if it included funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). On January 24, federal agents shot and killed a 37-year-old man in Minneapolis, the largest city in Minnesota, during a federal law-enforcement operation tied to immigration enforcement, drawing protests and public outrage. Schumer described the recent events in Minnesota as “horrific” and said such conditions were unacceptable in any American city. Schumer argued that the DHS funding bill does not do enough to address alleged abuses by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and reaffirmed that he would oppose the legislation without reforms. In the meantime, individuals raised heightened concerns about another government shutdown when US President Donald Trump acknowledged that another shutdown was still possible during an interview. Following his statement, Trump expressed his belief that there is an issue, given the high likelihood that the United States might face another Democrat shutdown. This situation has created mounting uncertainty about the CLARITY Act’s timeline, sparking heated debate within the crypto community . Meanwhile, it is worth noting that this mixed reaction emerged shortly after Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and other industry executives withdrew their backing. Armstrong shared his concerns in an X post dated January 15, stating that, “This version would be significantly worse than what we currently have. We’d rather have no bill than a bad bill. Hopefully, we can all work towards a better draft.” Industry executives withdraw their backing for the crypto market-structure bill Apart from Armstrong, Alex Thorn, head of research at Galaxy Digital, released a report recently expressing similar concerns. According to him, there is significant doubt about stablecoin yields, which the US banking lobby alleged may hinder banks’ ability to compete. To further break this point down for better understanding, Thorn stated that, “There aren’t any strong signs yet that both sides have found a compromise to improve the bill’s chances.” He added that “the extra 4-6 weeks before a second markup attempt should give everyone more time to collaborate on this.” Afterwards, Thorn raised an important question asking whether talks about stablecoin rewards can proceed during this time to foster a successful bipartisan markup.

Analyst Chart Nerd says it’s “ compressing in a corner ,” a classic breakout setup as volatility contracts and price action tightens. Directional confirmation is now the key signal traders are watching. Well, this setup is a textbook compression zone, where XRP’s price coils between rising support and falling resistance. As this range tightens, it signals a standoff between buyers and sellers that rarely lasts, typically resolving in a sharp breakout. Amid this development, XRP’s open interest recently climbed above its 30-day average, hinting at growing speculative pressure ahead of a decisive move. XRP is trading around $1.90, per CoinCodex data, sitting squarely in a compression zone that signals consolidation, not weakness. Rising higher lows show growing buyer demand, while lower highs reveal stubborn resistance, forming a tightening coil primed for a decisive breakout. On the other hand, XRP may also be setting up to outperform gold after seven years of decline, adding a compelling long-term bullish dimension to the setup. What makes this setup especially significant is the broader market context. XRP has shown notable resilience through recent uncertainty, holding firm above key support levels. This strengthens the bullish case if price breaks above descending resistance. However, a failure to defend rising support could trigger a bearish continuation. That’s why Chart Nerd stresses that direction confirmation is the next critical signal. Well, this is a moment for patience, not prediction. Compression patterns can precede major moves, but they don’t guarantee direction. The first decisive breakout above resistance or below support, ideally confirmed by rising volume, will likely define XRP’s short-term trend. Entering too early within the range risks whipsaws and false signals. Therefore, XRP is compressing into a high-pressure technical squeeze that rarely lasts long. With price holding near $1.90 and trendlines converging, a breakout appears imminent. As Chart Nerd notes, momentum is building, but direction awaits confirmation. Until then, XRP’s tightening range has the market on edge, poised for its next decisive move. Adding to the bullish undertone, XRP recently bucked the broader crypto slump, pulling in $69.5 million in weekly inflows, a strong signal of sustained investor confidence. Conclusion XRP is entering a critical compression phase, with price tightly coiling between rising support and falling resistance, a classic setup for a major breakout. Hovering near $1.90, the market is at a tipping point as buyers and sellers converge. As Chart Nerd notes, the breakout is “loading,” but direction remains unconfirmed. The next decisive move beyond this narrowing range will likely define XRP’s short-term trend. As a result, one way or another, clarity, volatility, and opportunity are about to hit a market primed with pent-up energy.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 12:41:13

The meme-inspired cryptocurrency now trades within a narrow band as market participants assess the next directional move. The digital asset continued to decline until Jan. 20, establishing a trading range between $0.12 and $0.129. Current prices show Dogecoin at $0.1228, down 1.34% over 24 hours and nearly 10.5% weekly. Derivatives Activity Signals Potential Bottom Market data from CoinGlass reveals crucial developments in Dogecoin's derivatives landscape. Open interest registered $1.41 billion, up 0.2% over the past day. This modest increase carries weight given the substantial liquidations that preceded it. The recent sell-off triggered widespread derisking among traders. Leveraged positions faced forced closures as prices tumbled. Open interest naturally contracted during this period of market stress. The current uptick suggests excessive leverage has been removed from the system. This flushing process often precedes periods of reduced volatility. Market analysts view such consolidation as necessary before meaningful price movements can occur. Broader cryptocurrency markets experienced turbulence early Saturday. Total liquidations across all digital assets reached $292 million in a 24-hour window. The selling pressure affected most major cryptocurrencies, with red dominating trading screens. Federal Reserve Decision Looms Over Markets Attention now shifts to the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate announcement scheduled for Jan. 28. This policy decision could inject significant volatility into cryptocurrency markets. Market consensus anticipates the central bank will maintain current rates. Projections suggest only two quarter-point reductions throughout 2026. These expectations have already influenced trading behavior across risk assets. The Fed's stance on monetary policy directly impacts liquidity conditions. Cryptocurrencies typically respond to changes in the broader financial environment. Traders position themselves ahead of major policy announcements to manage risk exposure. Recent regulatory approvals have opened new investment channels for Dogecoin exposure. Cyber Hornet submitted paperwork for an S&P Crypto 10 ETF that includes Dogecoin among its holdings. This filing could result in the first S&P-linked spot basket product featuring the cryptocurrency. 21Shares achieved a significant milestone with the Nasdaq listing of its Dogecoin ETF under the ticker TDOG. The launch builds upon a strategic partnership between 21Shares and House of Doge initiated in April 2025. The asset manager previously introduced the 21Shares 2x Long Dogecoin ETF (TXXD) in late 2025. This product offers U.S. investors leveraged exposure equal to twice Dogecoin's daily price movements.

Xiaomi sold 258,164 units of its SU7 electric sedan across China last year, beating Tesla’s Model 3 , which delivered 200,361 vehicles during the same period, based on figures from the China Passenger Car Association. This marks the first time Tesla’s Model 3 has lost its top position in China’s premium electric sedan market since the vehicle started selling in the country at the close of 2019. Chinese competitors challenge Tesla’s market dominance Tesla builds its Model 3 at its Shanghai manufacturing plant located in the Lingang free-trade zone. The vehicle had maintained its leading position in the premium electric sedan segment through 2024, even as several Chinese competitors like Nio, Xpeng, and IM Motors worked hard to challenge its market share. “Tesla’s dominance in the premium EV segment has been eroded by its Chinese competitors that are able to churn out vehicles on par with its technology standards while offering them at lower prices,” said Eric Han, a senior manager at Shanghai consultancy Suolei. “Xiaomi’s success is a strong boost for Chinese carmakers, which are all trying to move up the value chain.” Tesla’s Shanghai facility also produces the Model Y sport utility vehicle, which managed to outsell all other SUVs on the mainland in 2025, including those running on gasoline. Upgraded SU7 draws strong pre-orders Following last year’s strong performance, Xiaomi has moved forward with an improved version of the SU7 sedan. The company started taking small deposits for the updated model on January 7, 2026, and received close to 100,000 advance orders within just 15 days. The new version carries a pre-sale price of 229,900 yuan ($32,500), which represents an increase of 14,000 yuan ($1,980) compared to the earlier model. The updated SU7 is scheduled for its official release in April 2026, though marketing activities began three months ahead of time, according to CLS. Workers at several Xiaomi retail locations in Beijing reported receiving between 200 and 400 orders per store. Outlets in Shanghai and Wuhan have also recorded more than 100 orders each. With 477 stores operating nationwide, Xiaomi calculates that advance orders are approaching 100,000 units. The newer SU7 comes with better driving assistance features an d lo nger battery capacity. Technical improvements include a silicon carbide high-voltage platform rated at 752V and 897V, laser radar equipment standard on all versions, 700 TOPS of computing power for self-driving capabilities, and a CLTC-rated driving range of 902 kilometers. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun hosted three live-streaming events in January 2026 to promote the advance ordering period. The firm began selling off the leftover inventory of the previous year’s model in January 2026 as pre-sales for the revised SU7 got underway. Dealers have ceased accepting orders for specific setups and are now selling these older units from their current inventory. In an effort to ensure a seamless transition between model years and consistent supply chain operation, Xiaomi has changed production priorities to produce more SU7 cars while allocating capacity for the next generation model. Earlier, Xiaomi experienced problems with delivery timelines, especially with the Xiaomi YU7, where customers at one point waited more than a year for their vehicles. To prevent similar delays, the company introduced an early small-deposit approach for the SU7. Sales staff explained that advance orders help the company study demand patterns and handle supply chain stocks, including essential parts, to reduce long waiting periods for buyers. With 411,800 automobiles delivered overall in 2025, Xiaomi exceeded its annual target by 17%. The business has set a goal of 550,000 deliveries for 2026 and intends to launch two more models: an unannounced YU7 GT and the pre-ordered SU7. Talk about a possible range-extender version has not been confirmed. Since first launching in April 2024, the Xiaomi SU7 has sold close to 400,000 units and remains central to the company’s delivery plans as it moves into 2026.

Most altcoins are in the red as well on a 24-hour scale, with ETH solidifying its place below $3,000. XMR has dropped the most from the larger-cap alts. BTC Dips to $88K It was a week ago when the tension between the US and the EU escalated rapidly with new tariff threats and finally some opposition from the bloc. BTC remained still at first and traded above $95,000 during the weekend, but dumped hard on Monday morning when the Asian stock and most futures markets opened. At first, the $92,000 support remained intact, but the bears were more persistent and continued driving the asset further south. The culmination took place on Wednesday when bitcoin slumped to $87,200, which became a new multi-week low. Then came a rollercoaster of a trading period with a run toward $90,000, subsequent rejections, and another attempt at that coveted level as Trump took the main stage at Davos and made some controversial remarks. He refuted previous statements that he might use force to take over Greenland, hinted at a potential deal with Denmark, and cancelled the aforementioned tariffs. However, he threatened a 100% tariff on Canada yesterday if the country signs a big deal with China. BTC failed to decisively reclaim $90,000 and even dipped to $88,000 earlier today before recovering some ground. It now trades below $89,000, with a market cap of $1.770 trillion.

According to a statement from the Panchkula Cyber Crime Police, the criminals were busted and subsequently arrested after investigators unraveled their scam operation, which was mainly being conducted on WhatsApp. According to the Indian police, the fraudsters cheated a resident out of Rs. 16.30 lakh (approximately $17,787) under the guise of multiplying his investment through crypto trading. The criminals were said to have pressured the resident, promising him high returns on his investment at the end of the trading period. However, they ended up stealing the funds using a fraudulent mobile application that was introduced to the victim. Indian police busts fake crypto investment scam ring According to the complaint filed by the Indian resident, the scammers contacted him on WhatsApp in September 2025. He said they were able to convince him to invest in their trading scheme, assuring him of profits on his capital. He said they also showed him several proofs of profits that they made trading. After the back and forth, he agreed to invest, and they sent him a link. The scammers also asked him to download a specific trading application. Over the next few months, the victim claimed he made several transactions to multiple bank accounts provided by the scammers, which he said were for investment purposes. In total, the victim said he transferred a total of Rs. 16.30 lakh to the scammers. The Cyber Security Crime Police said they acted swiftly after he made his complaint, registering the case in November 2025, and starting investigations immediately. The Indian police said under the supervision of the officer-in-charge of the Cyber Crime Division, Yudhvir Singh, the officer in charge of the investigation arrested the first suspect, Arun Kumar. Kumar was a resident of Dhamtan Sahib village and was arrested on January 20. During his interrogation, Kumar provided investigators with crucial information and evidence that pointed them in the direction of other members of the cybercrime network. Police warn residents about the rise in crypto fraud Police claimed that Kumar’s cooperation and information subsequently led to the arrest of three other suspects, Mohammed Rashid in Delhi, Mohammed Alam Khan in Delhi, and Jasbir Singh in Punjab on January 22. After questioning, the three suspects were sent to judicial custody, while Mohammed Rashid was produced in court and ordered to be remanded in police custody for three days. Police say that investigations will continue as they hope to apprehend more members of the gang. In addition, the Indian police have mentioned that they are looking beyond this singular case and would cast their net wide with the hope of apprehending more fraudsters aiming to defraud innocent victims using digital assets and other new technologies. They said that frequent raids are being conducted in Delhi, Haryana, and other parts of India to nab criminals targeting both local investors and international victims. Meanwhile, they have issued warnings to the general public over the rise in criminal activities. The Indian police have advised the general public to seek financial and investment advice from professionals knowledgeable in the field. They have also warned residents to desist from listening to investment advice from strangers on the internet. The Indian police also advised elderly residents to talk to someone in the house if anyone approaches them online with an investment opportunity that seems too good to be true, highlighting that most criminals dealing in fake investments use mouthwatering profits as their main point.

While Ripple’s XRP continues to grapple with regulatory overhang and stubborn price resistance, a newer contender , is generating intense presale momentum with whispers of it being “the next XRP.” In a market that’s increasingly rewarding executable utility over legacy promises, the contrast is stark. Some analysts are now openly forecasting XRP consolidation or even a drop below $1 this year if key supports fail, while RTX’s rapid token sell-out is creating legitimate FOMO. Here’s the breakdown as of late January 2026. XRP: Institutional Promise Meets Persistent Resistance XRP is at over $1.91 and has a market capitalization of about 116 billion with initial technical indicators of a possible trend reversal. A verified 4-hour close on an upward trendline has changed the short-term structure of the market on the lower timeframes, easing the pressure to bear downwards. The escape of a falling wedge pattern being a typically bullish pattern, indicates that the stage of corrective phase might be slipping away although it needs to be confirmed. The main resistance is concentrated around the levels of $1.97 and the psychological level of $2.00; a clear break above these areas would greatly enhance the chances of a run towards the higher area of $2.40 which is closer to the early-2026 high. In the future, it seems that the medium-term and long-term financial prospects of XRP will become more dependent on the implementation of the ecosystem than the technicals. The most recent events in the XRP Ledger are the increased use of the native automated market maker (AMM), further expansion of on-chain activity in the use of payments and tokenized assets, and continued expansion around initiatives related to interoperability, including the XRPL EVM-compatible sidechain, which is designed to attract developers on Ethereum. These variables reinforce the use case of XRP past theory trading. With technical validation on top of macro ecosystem traction and enhanced market dynamics, XRP may maintain a structural recovery, but would not have the ability to maintain momentum beyond $1.80-$1.85, and then would revert to consolidation or bear market. Remittix (RTX): Presale Urgency Reaches Fever Pitch This is where the conversation shifts dramatically. Remittix isn’t waiting for institutional buy-in, it’s building direct crypto-to-fiat bridges that everyday users and businesses can actually use today. The platform enables instant transfers of digital assets straight to bank accounts, with real-time conversion across 40+ cryptos and 30+ fiat currencies. Execution is already underway: the wallet is live on iOS (Android rollout imminent), the project has cleared a CertiK audit , and the full PayFi platform launches February 9, 2026, just weeks away. But the real story right now is the presale. Community channels are buzzing with urgency: over 700 million of the 750 million allocated tokens are gone, that’s more than 93% sold, rapidly closing in on 95%. Messages are flying: “There isn’t long left for investors to secure their tokens” and “Investors are racing to buy the next XRP .” To freelancers, remitters and businesses that require easy off-ramps, this is the improved version. As tokens disappear at a rapid pace, launch catalysts are in place, the arrangement shouts asymmetric upside. The history of this type of utility is to go 100x or more in stage 1 utility plays upon adoption. The Verdict XRP isn’t going away, its infrastructure and institutional ties ensure relevance. But if it can’t break out soon, sub-$1 trading in 2026 isn’t off the table for skeptics, especially in a risk-off environment. Remittix, by contrast, is early, executable, and riding peak presale FOMO. In a cycle that’s punishing delays and rewarding delivery, RTX looks positioned for the kind of explosive growth that turns heads. Crypto is full of surprises, position sizing and due diligence are non-negotiable.XRP might face a tougher 2026 than many expect. But if you’re hunting the next big payment token with serious growth potential, Remittix is where sharp money is piling in before the window closes.

With institutional positioning improving and risk appetite slowly returning, analysts argue that a move toward $100,000 is no longer speculative but structural. Meanwhile, capital is shifting into high-utility crypto investments, and the Remittix presale is nearly 95% sold with increasing market demand. Bitcoin Price Prediction Models Still Point Higher Bitcoin has gone into a volatile consolidation period following a decline below $90,000. However, the market structure indicates that the pullback can be viewed as corrective and not the beginning of a further decline. Despite recent weakness in BTC price today, several signals point to a setup that still favors a renewed push higher, with $100,000 increasingly discussed in Bitcoin price prediction models. Last week’s sell-off was driven by a mix of macro caution and positioning resets. ETF flows briefly turned negative, adding pressure to Bitcoin price. Even so, BTC news shows that downside momentum has slowed as uncertainty begins to ease and risk sentiment stabilizes. A notable shift has occurred in derivatives markets. Hedge funds have sharply reduced Bitcoin short exposure on CME futures since late 2024. This is a move that some analysts interpret as quiet positioning for upside rather than outright bearish conviction. Historically, these reductions have often preceded range expansions higher in BTC price prediction cycles. Macro catalysts now sit front and center. Markets are looking forward to the next Federal Reserve meeting, any dovish indicators would trigger renewed risk asset demand, including Bitcoin. If liquidity expectations improve, Bitcoin news analysts see a clear path for BTC to reclaim the $92,500–$95,000 zone. If this breakout happens, it could open the door toward $100,000. For now, Bitcoin price appears anchored between strong demand near $88,000 and resistance below $95,000. If institutional flows stabilize and macro pressure continues to fade, the case for a six-figure BTC price prediction into the next phase remains firmly intact. Over 700 Million Tokens Sold And Time Is Running Out Capital rotates back into high-conviction crypto plays, and investors are scrambling for exposure to projects that still offer asymmetric upside. One name dominating that conversation is Remittix (RTX). With Bitcoin reclaiming institutional confidence, many see PayFi tokens like RTX as the natural next step in the cycle. Remittix is not chasing hype. It is building infrastructure. The platform connects crypto directly to traditional banking rails. This capability allows users to convert digital assets into fiat and settle payments globally through one streamlined app. For businesses, freelancers and regular users, this eliminates these delays, secret charges and the friction that has kept crypto out of everyday use. That real-world focus is why Remittix is now being discussed as one of the best crypto to buy now as the market shifts toward utility. The numbers explain the urgency. Out of a fixed 750 million token supply, over 700 million RTX have already been sold, pushing the presale past 93% completion. This is no longer an early-stage opportunity. It is the final window.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-27-remains-xrps-extensive-breakout-target-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst ChartNerd has reiterated a long-term bullish outlook for XRP, emphasizing that a possible short-term decline would not invalidate the broader technical structure or the primary price objective. In a recent post on X, ChartNerd stated that even if the market experiences an initial downturn, the $27 level remains the extensive breakout target. According to the analyst, while the route toward that level may differ from expectations, the end objective itself has not changed. ChartNerd stressed that the current market structure holds. This suggests that, from a technical perspective, key support and trend conditions remain intact. The analyst’s commentary points to continuity in the broader setup rather than a breakdown, reinforcing the view that temporary weakness would be part of normal market behavior rather than a signal of structural failure. $XRP : Its important to remember: Even if we burn first, $27 will remain the extensive breakout target. The target doesn't change, but the path might. For now, structure holds, and this boat hasn't raised any sails. https://t.co/a5n7xlfdmE pic.twitter.com/MhfWMU6Hv9 — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) January 24, 2026 Path Versus Target A central theme of ChartNerd’s analysis is the distinction between the destination and the journey. The analyst made clear that price volatility, including a potential downward move, should not be interpreted as a negation of the $27 target . Instead, such movement would reflect the unpredictable nature of markets. By noting that the target remains fixed while the path may change, ChartNerd framed near-term uncertainty as a variable process rather than a decisive shift in outlook. This perspective implies that traders and long-term observers should separate short-term price action from higher-timeframe technical objectives. The emphasis on structure holding indicates that the analyst continues to see XRP operating within a valid breakout framework, even if momentum has not yet fully developed. Community Responses and Market Psychology The post prompted responses from other X users that aligned with ChartNerd’s assessment. One user, Robert W, echoed the analyst’s stance by stating that both the structure and the targets remain intact. He added that patience is the primary requirement at this stage. He further suggested that a significant price rally often starts when market participants least expect it, reinforcing the idea that prolonged consolidation or uncertainty can precede decisive moves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Jack Riley, questioned why a downward move might occur before any advance. In response, ChartNerd attributed such behavior to the nature of financial markets, offering a concise explanation that volatility and unexpected moves are inherent features rather than anomalies. Implications for XRP’s Outlook Taken together, ChartNerd’s comments and the surrounding interaction underline a consistent technical narrative. The analyst continues to view XRP as being in a structurally sound position, with the $27 level standing as the primary breakout objective. Short-term fluctuations, including potential declines, are framed as part of standard market dynamics rather than signals of invalidation. By reinforcing that the structure remains intact and the target unchanged, ChartNerd’s analysis places greater weight on patience and longer-term technical confirmation, rather than immediate price movement, as the key factors to watch going forward.

In remarks that are rippling through market forums and social platforms, CZ underscored his belief that frequent trading rarely delivers better returns than holding core assets like Bitcoin or BNB over the long term. On X, he commented, “I’ve seen many different trading strategies over the years; very few can beat the simple ‘buy and hold’, which is what I do. Not financial advice.” His remarks come a few days after he spoke on his incarceration and the opaque pardon process at the World Economic Forum . CZ doubles down on HODL strategy as Bitcoin eyes historic supercycle CZ’s message has gotten backing among some. However, one X user pushed back , saying buy-and-hold only works in rising markets, noting that many who held assets since Trump took office are down nearly 90%. Another user argued that buy-and-hold only works when you’re purchasing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB, not other altcoins. Anothe r in support of CZ’s view commented , “Buy and hold” isn’t lazy; it’s the only strategy that lets time do the heavy lifting for you. Most people trade their way to zero, while the ones who “do nothing” are the ones who actually build wealth.” Meanwhile, speaking on Friday in a CNBC interview, CZ also predicte d Bi tcoin could break its historic cycle as governments around the world adopt more crypto-friendly stances. In response to Squawk Box’s Andrew Ross Sorkin’s question over his forecast for BTC this year, he remarked, “If you are looking at today, tomorrow, on a daily basis, there’s no way I can predict. If you look at the five ten-year horizons, it’s very easy to predict. We’re going to go up.” When asked if he supported ARK Invest’s Cathie Wood’s bold Bitcoin forecast of between $300,00 and $1.5 million by 2030, he said he shares the optimism, adding that he believes a supercycle is likely this year. He explained that with the U.S. taking a pro-crypto stance and other countries following suit, Bitcoin is likely to break its four-year cycle. Bitcoin has typically followed a four-year cycle, rallying strongly more than a year after each halving — with the next one anticipated in April 2028 and possible highs toward late 2029. CZ encouraged countries to take on crypto asset tokenization During a Thursday panel at WEF Davos 2026, CZ shared that he’s been talking with around a dozen nations about asset tokenization , but declined to specify which assets or countries. He added that the projects would help countries raise capital by selling small stakes in state-owned assets to citizens or investors, much as in past privatizations of oil or telecom companies. He also insisted that the global shift toward crypto-friendly policies is good news for digital assets and for the United States. Zhao also said he’s keeping active, building Giggle Academy, and contributing to YZi Labs alongside other projects. Additionally, he noted that his role in the BNB Chain ecosystem is primarily mentorship, adding, “I just mentor them,” though he holds minority shares. Moreover, in his interview with Sorkin, he also shared that the pardon from President Trump helped ease a long-standing psychological strain following his four-month sentence. In 2023, Zhao admitted that Binance failed to implement proper anti-money laundering controls and resigned as CEO as part of a broad settlement with U.S. regulators. He said he wasn’t expecting to serve time behind bars, based on how similar cases had been handled previously, describing his prison sentence as brutal.

Recent on-chain activity shows whales reducing exposure to Chainlink and Cardano while reallocating into a newer payments-focused token many now describe as a future top 10 crypto. This rotation is not random. It reflects frustration with slow price movement and delayed catalysts across older networks. This new future top 10 crypto is gaining rapid traction as supply tightens and real products go live. With capital moving early, whales appear to be positioning ahead of what they see as the next major payments breakout in 2026. Why Whales Are Reducing Exposure To Chainlink And Cardano Chainlink currently trades at $12.19 with a market cap of $8.6 billion, and daily trading volume near $183 million, yet price action has remained compressed. Despite its importance in Oracle infrastructure , recent weeks have shown limited promise of a surge. LINK charts point to repeated rejections near resistance, keeping LINK locked in a narrow range. Analysts tracking on-chain flows have noted declining large wallet accumulation, suggesting whales are rotating rather than adding. Cardano shows a similar pattern. With the price at $0.35, a market cap of around $12.9 billion, and daily volume above $225 million, Cardano remains liquid but lacks near-term acceleration. Network upgrades continue, but many are long-term focused and slow to impact price. RSI levels remain neutral, and the price sits below key moving averages. Chainlink and Cardano remain strong networks, but slow momentum and delayed price drivers are prompting whales to rotate capital elsewhere. Why Whales Are Accumulating Remittix Aggressively As whales exit Chainlink and Cardano, Remittix is becoming the clear destination. Unlike legacy networks still building toward adoption, Remittix is already executing on a payments-focused model aimed at a $19 trillion global remittance market. This is a key reason it is increasingly described as a future top 10 crypto. Demand is now visible in the numbers. Remittix has sold over 700 million of its 750 million token allocation, pushing it past 93% sold. At $0.123, more than $28.8 million has been raised, and supply is running out fast. This scarcity is driving urgency, with investors openly calling Remittix the next XRP-style opportunity in payments. Trust is another major factor behind whale confidence. Remittix is fully verified by CertiK and ranked #1 on CertiK Skynet among pre-launch tokens, supported by a Skynet Score of 80.09 (Grade A) from over 24,000 community ratings. The team has completed full KYC, secured listings on BitMart and LBANK, and confirmed a third exchange listing. These milestones remove risk and explain the accelerating inflows. Also, the Remittix Wallet is live on the Apple App Store, allowing users to store and manage assets today. The full Remittix platform launches on 9 February 2026, which will unlock all features fully. Combined with a 15% USDT referral program, Remittix stands out as a crypto solving real-world problems with momentum building fast. Core features drawing increased attention to Remittix: Solving a real-world $19 trillion cross-border payments problem Utility first token model built around real transaction volume Deflationary tokenomics with growth potential Global payout rails are expanding, with a focus on key remittance corridors Built for adoption rather than short-term speculation Where Smart Money Is Positioning Next The ongoing exit from Chainlink and Cardano is not a rejection of those networks, but a strategic move toward faster growth and clearer catalysts. Whales are positioning early where supply is tight, products are live, and adoption is measurable, and Remittix checks all those boxes. With over 93% of tokens already sold, a confirmed platform launch date, strong security validation, and accelerating demand, Remittix is no longer under the radar. Investors racing to secure what many believe could be the next XRP-style payments leader understand one thing clearly: the window is closing, and whales have already moved.

Whales are trimming Chainlink and Cardano positions due to prolonged price consolidation and a lack of near-term catalysts. While both networks remain fundamentally strong, slower momentum is pushing large holders to rotate capital into faster-moving crypto opportunities. Why is Remittix being called a future top 10 crypto? Remittix is gaining attention for its real-world payments focus, rapidly selling token supply, and progress toward crypto-to-fiat adoption. With over 93% of tokens sold, strong funding, and verified security credentials, many investors see it as a scalable payments token with top-tier potential. What milestones are driving whale accumulation of Remittix right now? Key milestones include CertiK verification, multiple confirmed exchange listings, a live wallet, and a full PayFi platform launch scheduled for 9 February 2026. Combined with deflationary tokenomics and exposure to the $19 trillion remittance market, these factors are accelerating whale interest in RTX.",Press Release,EN,0,0,ADA|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-25 13:36:25

On-chain data shows that over 26.47 billion SHIB tokens entered exchanges in the past 24 hours. The scale of this transfer marks a notable shift in the asset's behavior. Exchange inflows typically signal bearish sentiment. Investors often interpret such movements as preparation for selling. However, the current situation presents a more nuanced picture. Netflow metrics remained relatively stable despite the massive inflow spike. This suggests strategic repositioning rather than panic-driven liquidation. Network Metrics Point to Growing Engagement Transaction counts have risen steadily across the Shiba Inu network. The increase indicates genuine network activity rather than declining interest. Active addresses have also climbed, demonstrating that participation extends beyond isolated whale movements. The data reveals broad-based engagement. Multiple wallets are contributing to the heightened activity levels. This pattern differs significantly from scenarios where a handful of large holders dominate movements. Wider distribution of activity generally supports healthier long-term price dynamics. Exchange reserves remain elevated when measured in token quantities. However, the USD value of these reserves has trended downward. This divergence stems from price compression rather than aggressive distribution. The distinction matters for understanding underlying market mechanics. Technical Position Reflects Transitional Phase Average inflow and outflow metrics have both increased. This balanced rise suggests active repositioning on both sides of the market. Bulls have not yet established clear dominance. The asset continues trading below key long-term moving averages. Price action has formed higher lows in recent sessions. The pattern indicates weakening downward momentum. Consolidation has tightened, creating a narrowing range. These technical characteristics often precede significant directional moves. Capital flow patterns reveal the primary challenge. Recent inflow spikes have faded quickly. The market has produced shallow retracements instead of sustained rallies. Consistent capital deployment remains absent. Brief bursts of activity have not translated into momentum continuation. At the time of writing, SHIB trades at around $0.00000776, down 1.22% in the last 24 hours. .",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 13:45:14

This follows several criticisms directed at the chatbot and its involvement in generating and distributing sexually exploitative deepfake images. The information was reported by a local news outlet, the Electronic Times, which mentioned that the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) has launched a preliminary fact-finding review into Grok after the allegations were reported in the county by several individuals. The preliminary process is to confirm if the violation actually occurred and whether the matter is within its jurisdiction before a formal investigation can be launched. The Korean government to conduct a review into Grok According to reports , the review follows several reports that surfaced locally and overseas, accusing Grok of being used to create explicit and nonconsensual deepfake images, with most of them involving real individuals and minors. With this, the PICP will reportedly determine its next course of action after reviewing the explanation provided by Grok and other supporting documents. The agency is also expected to review global regulatory trends, which would shape its decision-making. Under the Personal Information Protection Act, altering or generating sexual images of identifiable individuals without consent may constitute unlawful handling of personal data. The AI chatbots, which are integrated into the social platform X and offer both text and image generation on the platform, have faced several criticisms over the creation of fake images of real people since last year. The chatbot has been used to create all sorts of compromising images, which have been frowned upon by the general public. According to the global nongovernmental organization Center for Countering Digital Hate, Grok is estimated to have been used to generate more than three million sexually explicit images between December 29, 2025, and January 8, 2026. The organization claims that among that number, more than 23,000 were images of minors generated using the chatbot. The center warned that the rapid spread of Grok’s AI-generated images has led to a large-scale circulation of explicit content online. The regulator wants a report on measures taken to curb the menace The center has also warned about the serious safety risks that the development poses to children. As a result of this menace, countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, and some others have launched investigations , while countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia have blocked access to Grok. In response to the controversy, xAI announced earlier this year that it had implemented certain technical measures to prevent it. The platform claimed that it has stopped both free and paid users from editing or generating images of real people, adding that it would announce further safeguards very soon. In Korea, the Media and Communications Commission (KMCC) demanded stronger youth protection measures from X on January 14. The Korean regulator told the social media platform that its AI firm needs to come up with a plan to prevent the generation of illegal or harmful content. In addition, the regulator also added that the company needs to limit minors’ access to such content. Currently, X has a designated youth protection officer in Korea in accordance with the law and submits annual reports on related compliance. KMCC has urged the platform to submit additional documentation regarding Grok’s safety protocol, noting that nonconsensual sexual images created and distributed on its platform, especially involving minors, are a criminal offense in Korea. The commission has set a deadline of two weeks. If X fails to respond or ignores the request, it may impose an administrative fine of up to 10 million won ($6,870). The same move has been witnessed in other countries, where xAI has been tasked with coming up with measures to curb the rise of the menace. Like Korea, the countries have also announced substantial fines if the company fails to devise and submit a report showing the steps it has taken to limit the rise in the menace.

Classically, consolidation periods often precede major moves either to the upside or downside of the market. As such, questions on the next trajectory of the flagship cryptocurrency are being asked. A latest on-chain evaluation has offered a positive prognosis on the next direction for the Bitcoin price. Accumulation Demand Metric Surges To All-Time-High In a Quicktake post on CryptoQuant, on-chain analyst CoinNiel hypothesized that the Bitcoin price could be at the beginning of a bullish trend. The market quant based this prognosis on two metrics — the Accumulator Address Demand and the Liquidity Inventory Ratio (month). Related Reading: Bitcoin Metric Suggests Miners Are In Recovery Mode — Price To Follow? The Accumulator Address Demand metric monitors the net buying pressure coming from addresses that buy Bitcoin consistently, and without any significant selling. This behavior (of buying and rarely selling) is typical of the large-scale Bitcoin holders, commonly known as the whales. Notably, CoinNiel also pointed out that when major withdrawals from exchanges occur, they are rarely ever incited by retailers, but by whales. As such, when the Bitcoin whales withdraw their holdings from exchanges, their buying pressure translates into an increase in the Accumulator Address Demand. From the chart above, the indicator has reached an all-time high level. According to the crypto pundit, this could be a sign that the whales are currently experiencing, on intense levels, the “fear of missing out.” The second metric, the Liquidity Inventory Ratio (Month), also reinforces CoinNiel’s bullish outlook. This metric tracks and compares existing Bitcoin demand to the supply available on exchanges, showing whether demand can overwhelm available supply. When this ratio rises sharply, it is usually a sign that demand is absorbing newly created supply. From the data shared by the analyst, the Liquidity Inventory Ratio has also reached an extreme value of 3.8. However, this extreme reading is only a reflection of what is happening on US exchanges. Hence, CoinNiel implied that, for the first time in years, US exchanges are recording exceptionally high demand relative to the coins available. In theory, a 3.8 reading implies the imminence of a supply shock in the scenario where current conditions prevail. But, the analyst highlighted that it may not necessarily happen, as a 3.8 reading is more a sign of intensified whale demand than a surefire means to predict supply shocks. The big picture, especially when these two metrics are looked at together, appears to be distinctly bullish. This is because available data points out that the whales are likely positioning for what could be a resumed bullish trajectory for the Bitcoin price. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $88,520, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

These machines could one day break the math behind wallets and signatures. The team’s work is moving from research into practical tests and experiments, which has drawn attention across the crypto community.

Another $1 million prize supports broader post-quantum research. In total, roughly $2 million are being offered to labs and independent developers to design and test quantum-resistant solutions. Reports say this funding is meant to speed up work and show what can realistically replace current signatures. Early Tests And Community Involvement Multi-client devnets are already active. Developers are experimenting with new signature types to see what works and what fails. Biweekly sessions led by researchers like Antonio Sanso let teams share results and update code. A Post-Quantum Day is scheduled for March 2026 before ETHCC, with a larger event planned in October 2026 to show progress and plan next steps. Quantum computers could, in theory, break the ECDSA and secp256k1 schemes used today. That risk is not immediate but serious enough that Ethereum is acting now. Reports note users should watch for official guidance, follow wallet updates, and avoid reusing addresses once upgrades roll out. Community reaction has been mixed. Some online discussions praised the careful planning, while traders noticed a small dip in ETH price. Others questioned how upgrades would reach millions of wallets and what happens to old keys. The Foundation’s approach is to test solutions early so users and services are better protected when changes happen. This step is part of Ethereum’s long-term plan for safety. Tests will continue, standards will be debated, and progress will be shared publicly. By acting now, Ethereum aims to reduce risk and make future transitions smoother for everyday users and the network as a whole.

The post urges readers to watch a resurfaced video from the late financial commentator Lou, known online as Lou vs Wall Street, describing it as a crucial explanation for why price targets such as $1,000 , $10,000, or even higher are discussed within some XRP-focused circles. RemiReliefX argues that traditional market capitalization metrics are not applicable in this context and maintains that XRP could reach multi-thousand-dollar levels once specific institutional mechanisms are activated. XRP Has To Be In The Thousands Please stop what you’re doing and watch this video from The Late Great Lou (RIP ) I’ve been looking for this video and finally found it. The greatest most bullish 8 minutes of your life! Once you watch this video, you’ll understand the… — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) January 24, 2026 Core Argument Presented in the Video In the attached video, Lou outlines a two-phase perspective on XRP valuation. He explains that if XRP were used solely for standard bank-to-bank money movement, price levels could reasonably reach double or triple digits. His personal estimate for an initial phase is between $1 and $500. According to him, this range reflects liquidity needs associated with transactional settlement rather than long-term holding by banks, which he emphasizes only use the asset briefly to facilitate transfers. Lou then shifts focus to what he describes as the more significant driver of higher valuations: the global derivatives market. He characterizes this market as vastly larger than traditional payment flows, explaining that derivatives can be layered multiple times on top of a single underlying asset, creating exponential transactional volume that requires speed, traceability, and rapid settlement. Role of Distributed Ledger Technology A central point in Lou’s commentary is the relevance of distributed ledger technology for managing derivatives. He references the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, granting its members access to distributed ledger solutions, and notes Ripple’s membership within ISDA. Lou argues that this positioning allows Ripple’s technology to support the tokenization and movement of derivative-based financial instruments, which he says demand far greater liquidity than conventional payments. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to his explanation, once derivatives transactions are routed through distributed ledger systems capable of handling tokenized assets , XRP’s role could expand beyond payment settlement into broader financial infrastructure. It is under these conditions, he claims, that XRP prices could move from hundreds into the thousands. Implications for XRP Valuation Narrative RemiReliefX’s tweet echoes this argument, asserting that skepticism around high XRP valuations stems from a misunderstanding of how derivatives function and how large that market is relative to banking transfers. The post emphasizes that the projected price levels are not tied to retail speculation but to institutional usage tied to derivatives, tokenization, and high-speed settlement. By resurfacing Lou’s commentary, RemiReliefX reinforces a long-standing thesis within parts of the XRP community that extreme price projections depend on adoption within complex financial markets rather than everyday payment use alone.

According to the lawsuit, Meta has been secretly storing, analyzing, and accessing messages it publicly claims are “end-to-end encrypted.” WhatsApp shows users a default privacy warning: “only people in this chat can read, listen to, or share” messages. That’s supposed to mean that not even Meta can see what users send. But the new lawsuit says that entire promise is fake, and it accuses Meta of defrauding billions of users worldwide by making them believe otherwise. Plaintiffs say Meta misled billions about encryption The group filing the case includes plaintiffs from Australia, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa. They argue that Meta’s claims about end-to-end encryption are a complete scam, and that workers inside the company can view the content of so-called “private” WhatsApp messages. The plaintiffs say whistleblowers helped bring this to light, though they didn’t name them or explain how they got the info. Meta bought WhatsApp in 2014 and has repeatedly claimed its platform is fully secure. But the plaintiffs say that’s all just PR spin, not real privacy. They accuse Meta and WhatsApp of building an illusion of safety to lure in users, while in the background, the company collects and studies the messages it claims are out of reach. Meta is not backing down. The company’s spokesperson, Andy Stone, called the entire lawsuit a joke. “Any claim that people’s WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false and absurd,” Stone said in a statement. “WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction.” Meta says it will pursue sanctions against the plaintiffs’ lawyers. Lawyers for the plaintiffs want this case to become a class-action lawsuit. The legal team includes attorneys from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, Keller Postman, and Barnett Legal. Multiple lawyers declined to comment or didn’t respond to requests. Patent fight adds pressure over smart glasses tech As Meta deals with that lawsuit, it’s also being targeted in a separate patent fight. In Massachusetts federal court, Solos Technology Ltd. filed a complaint Friday, saying Meta and partners stole smart glasses technology and violated “core patents” that power products like the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarer Gen 1. Solos is asking for “multiple billions of dollars” in damages. The company also wants an injunction that could stop Ray-Ban Meta products from being sold. The filing claims Meta and EssilorLuxottica had years of access to Solos’ intellectual property, going back to at least 2015. Solos says even Oakley employees tested early versions of its hardware years before Meta got involved. Solos built its first smart eyewear for cyclists over a decade ago. Its more recent “AirGo” models include AI-powered features like translation and ChatGPT integration. On its site, Solos says it holds over 100 patents and applications. The lawsuit alleges that every Meta release since Gen 1 copies Solos’ tech, including the latest smart glasses built with muscle-signal technology. Solos also says that a former MIT Sloan Fellow, Priyanka Shekar, published a 2021 study citing Solos’ patented tech. That same year, she joined Meta as a product manager. According to the lawsuit, Shekar’s work gave Meta internal access to Solos’ designs, making the alleged infringement even more deliberate. The filing claims that by the time Meta and EssilorLuxottica launched smart glasses in 2021, they already had deep, direct knowledge of Solos’ entire roadmap. That lawsuit is now one more legal mess Meta has to clean up, while it’s still trying to convince users that WhatsApp chats aren’t being read behind their backs.

The pre-launch allows the project to continue its fundraising efforts while empowering its growing community and existing token holders. It also helps the team to secure capital, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and support broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu AI’s official launch date is now under three months away. However, the team remains open to the possibility of an earlier or later launch, depending on market conditions. The team will conduct a series of review meetings to determine the project’s launch date. The first two review meetings were held on July 1, 2025, and October 1, 2025, while the third is scheduled for January 1, 2026. Crypto Market Continues Retreat The cryptocurrency market extended its recent decline, falling 0.65% to $3.01 trillion in the past 24 hours. Major tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum, continued trading below key levels, registering notable 24-hour declines. BTC traded above $89,500 on Saturday but slipped below $89,000 on Sunday as buyer momentum faded. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $88,840. ETH failed to reclaim $3,000, briefly reaching an intraday high of $2,962 before dropping to its current level of $2,938. The altcoin is down almost 1% in the past 24 hours.

Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Hedera (HBAR), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered sharp declines over the past 24 hours. Crypto Could See $100 Trillion Inheritance Wave A $100 trillion insurance wave could send crypto prices soaring over the next two decades as younger and more crypto-savvy investors inherit trillions in assets from older investors who have minimal crypto exposure. Nansen founder Alex Svanevik believes the wealth transfer will completely reshape crypto market dynamics, with younger investors allocating a significant chunk of their portfolio to crypto. Svanevik stated, “It’s like a tidal wave, you know, a tsunami that’s coming. There are all these kinds of forces that I think just drive crypto upwards.” Visit the following links for more information on Husky Inu: Website: Husky Inu Official Website Twitter: Husky Inu Twitter Telegram: Husky Inu Telegram Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to the latest Coingecko annual crypto industry report , Tether alone accounted for 41.9% of all stablecoin-related revenue in 2025, outpacing competitors such as Circle, Hyperliquid, Pump.fun, Ethena, Axiom, Phantom, and PancakeSwap. The results show that dollar-backed digital currencies have become the most durable revenue engine in crypto, even as market conditions fluctuated throughout the year. Tether Leads Stablecoin Issuers To Capture Crypto Revenue Crown Among more than 168 crypto protocols tracked in 2025, stablecoin issuers collectively generated the highest revenue, with Tether firmly at the center. INSIGHT: Stablecoins generated $5.2B in revenue in 2025, accounting for 41.9% of total protocol revenue. pic.twitter.com/fjJrAn9k7B — CoinGecko (@coingecko) January 25, 2026 Its $5.2 billion haul placed it well ahead of Circle and other major players, reinforcing USDT’s position as the industry’s primary settlement asset. Within the top ten revenue-generating protocols, just four entities, led by Tether and Circle, produced 65.7% of total earnings, equivalent to roughly $8.3 billion. Source: Coingecko The remaining six protocols in the top ten were all trading-focused platforms, highlighting a sharp divide between stable revenue streams and market-dependent income. That contrast became clear as trading revenues swung widely with investor sentiment during the year. Phantom, for example, recorded $95.2 million in revenue in January at the height of the Solana meme coin frenzy, only to see earnings fall to $8.6 million by December as speculative activity cooled. USDT Claims 60% Share Of $311B Stablecoin Market The broader stablecoin market expanded rapidly, with total market capitalization rising by $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter alone to reach a record $311.0 billion. That marked a 48.9% year-over-year increase, adding $102.1 billion as adoption accelerated across regions. Tether maintained clear leadership with 60.1% of the total stablecoin market cap, or about $187.0 billion, followed by Circle’s USDC at 24.2%, equivalent to $72.4 billion. Source: Coingecko Tether is now the world’s third-largest digital asset by market value at $186.8 billion, up roughly 50% from a year earlier. While the top players strengthened their grip, shifts within the top five reflected changing risk appetites. Ethena’s USDe experienced the sharpest reversal, with its market cap plunging 57.3%, or $6.5 billion, after a mid-October depeg on Binance undermined confidence in high-yield looping strategies. Other stablecoins posted mixed but notable moves as capital rotated within the sector. PayPal’s PYUSD surged 48.4%, adding $1.2 billion to reach $3.6 billion and briefly claiming the fifth spot before World Liberty Financial’s USD1 reclaimed it by nearly $1. Additional high-growth tokens included Ripple’s RLUSD, which expanded 61.8% to add $488.2 million , and USDD, which climbed 76.9% with a $366.8 million increase. Inside Tether’s $500B Valuation Path and Expanding Investment Empire Looking ahead, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan recently suggested that Tether could become the world’s most profitable company if its trajectory continues. “There’s a chance that many emerging market countries will convert from primarily using their own currencies to using USDT, ” Hougan said, pointing to Tether’s near-total dominance outside Western markets. Based on projected interest income, calculations indicate that custody of $3 trillion in assets could generate annual revenue exceeding the $120 billion earned by Saudi Aramco last year. Source: Electric Capital Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino previously told Cryptonews he remains confident USDT will retain its lead due to the company’s deep understanding of real-world usage.

Leading this growth is RLUSD, a fully backed stablecoin attracting corporates and financial institutions. Its adoption underscores XRPL’s ability to deliver stable, transparent, and fast digital transactions. Beyond stablecoins, institutions are tokenizing funds, treasuries, and credit products on XRPL, marking a shift from speculative trading to mainstream financial integration. Well, the XRP Ledger stands out for its lightning-fast, low-cost transactions, settling in seconds with minimal fees, perfect for large-scale institutional use. Unlike many blockchains, it blends decentralization with scalability, letting global finance move assets securely and efficiently. Its adoption of quantum-resistant Dilithium cryptography further strengthens XRPL’s security for the future. Therefore, XRPL’s interoperability and compliance-friendly design make it a magnet for institutional adoption. Firms can issue tokenized fiat, equities, or debt while staying fully aligned with regulations, streamlining treasury operations, liquidity management, and cross-border payments. Surpassing $1 billion in tokenized assets isn’t just a milestone; it signals XRPL’s shift from niche crypto network to a core platform for global finance. Analysts highlight that its blend of stablecoins, tokenized assets, and growing institutional adoption positions XRPL to rival traditional banking, offering faster settlement, lower costs, and programmable assets. As adoption surges, the XRPL is transforming how financial products are issued, traded, and managed. From multinationals exploring tokenized treasuries to fintechs using RLUSD for global payments, XRPL is emerging as a core infrastructure for 21st-century finance. No longer just a ledger for XRP transactions, XRPL now supports complex tokenized assets, stablecoins, and high-value financial operations, positioning itself as a global backbone for the future of finance. Its meteoric rise into the top 6 blockchain ecosystems of 2025 underscores its growing influence and adoption. Conclusion The XRP Ledger has hit $1 billion in tokenized assets and stablecoins, signaling a major leap in blockchain adoption. With RLUSD leading and institutions deploying tokenized funds, treasuries, and credit products, XRPL is proving itself as a scalable infrastructure for global finance. By enabling faster, transparent, and efficient issuance, transfer, and management of assets, XRPL is not just keeping pace, it’s shaping the future of digital finance.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET|XRP|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 14:43:29

By 2029, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $52.92 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $164.91 by 2032. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS allows users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it utilizes its own cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2026-2032. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $8.97 Market Cap $342.84M Trading Volume (24-hour) $16.71M Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $9.22 24-h Low $8.93 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) 5.93% (High) 50-Day SMA $ 10.18 14-Day RSI 38.56 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 25 (Extreme Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $ 17.39 Ethereum Name Service price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : ENS trades below $10 after a sharp breakdown, showing sellers remain in control Price is consolidating near $9 with weak momentum and limited buying pressure A recovery likely needs a strong bounce above $9.50 to $10, while failure risks further downside Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENSUSD chart by TradingView On Jan 25, ENS is trending lower on the daily chart; sliding from the early-January swing near $11.2 toward the $9.0 area. Price is holding around $9.02 after printing a session low near $8.93, suggesting buyers are defending the psychological $9 support. Recent candles show lower highs, meaning rallies are being sold quickly. If $9 breaks, the next downside zone sits around $8.6–$8.8. On the upside, rebounds face supply near $9.6–$10.0, then the prior breakdown region around $10.5–$11.0. Momentum remains bearish until daily closes reclaim $10, but consolidation around $9 could set up a short relief bounce with tight risk for active traders. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENSUSD chart by TradingView ENS continues to weaken on the 4-hour chart, trading around $9.00 after a sharp breakdown from the $10.3–$10.5 zone. The mid-January sell-off created a sequence of lower highs, and recent candles show price consolidating sideways just above support near $8.8–$8.9. Momentum remains soft, suggesting sellers still control short-term structure despite limited follow-through lower. If $8.8 fails, downside could extend toward $8.4. On the upside, rebounds face resistance near $9.4–$9.6, then $10.0. For now, ENS appears range-bound but biased bearish until buyers reclaim the broken $9.6–$10 region convincingly. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 9.90 SELL SMA 5 $9.27 SELL SMA 10 $9.50 SELL SMA 21 $ 10.05 SELL SMA 50 $10.18 SELL SMA 100 $ 11.95 SELL SMA 200 $17.39 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 10.16 SELL EMA 5 $ 10.29 SELL EMA 10 $ 10.23 SELL EMA 21 $ 10.18 SELL EMA 50 $ 11.03 SELL EMA 100 $ 13.26 SELL EMA 200 $ 16.32 SELL What to expect from ENS? Ethereum Name Service appears to be stabilizing after its recent sell-off, but the broader bias remains a cautious state. ENS price is hovering near the $9.0 support zone following a breakdown from above $10, showing that buyers are still testing demand rather than driving a strong rebound. If this base holds, a short-term relief bounce toward $9.6–$10.0 is possible. However, failure to defend $8.8–$9.0 could expose deeper losses toward $8.4. Momentum indicators likely remain subdued, reflecting weak conviction. Overall, ENS may consolidate in a narrow range while traders watch for either a confirmed bullish reversal or another downside continuation. Why is ENS down today? Ethereum Name Service is down today largely due to technical weakness and broader market pressure. Price recently broke below the key $10 psychological level, triggering stop-loss orders and short-term profit-taking after earlier rebounds failed. The daily trend still shows lower highs, keeping sellers in control and discouraging aggressive dip-buying. At the same time, softer sentiment across the crypto market and cautious trading ahead of macro or sector-wide news often weigh on mid-cap tokens like ENS more heavily than majors. Low momentum and reduced volume suggest traders are waiting for confirmation, allowing selling pressure to dominate in the short term. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $45.09 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is not plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $164.91 by 2032. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest. Recent news/opinion on Ethereum Name Service ENS announced it is preparing to roll out ENSv2 and Namechain while celebrating major growth milestones in total registered names and expanding integrations that continue to boost the protocol’s accessibility and real-world utility. As the year winds down, we're gearing up for ENSv2, Namechain and beyond. Total ENS names surpassed massive growth milestones, with integrations continuing to expand accessibility and utility. https://t.co/HecKODJPMm — ens.eth (@ensdomains) December 31, 2025 Ethereum Name Service price prediction January 2026 In 2026, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) forecast suggests an average price of $9.93 and a maximum price of $10.21. The minimum price for ENS could reach $8.98 Month Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price January 2026 $8.98 $9.93 $10.21 Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2026 Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is forecasted to trade at a minimum of $13.49, an average of $13.87, and a maximum of $16.24 in 2026.

This growth is expected due to rising Web3 identity adoption, L2 integrations reducing costs, potential ENS Layer-2 development, and easing token unlock pressures, which will support stronger demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2028 In 2028, ENS is forecasted to trade between $30.17 and $35.93, with an average of $31.03. This rise is attributed to the wider adoption of Web3 identities, stronger cross-chain interoperability, and ENS’s maturity as a decentralized naming standard. Reduced token unlock pressure and sustained Ethereum ecosystem growth will further support higher valuation potential. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2029 It is expected that ENS will trade between $43.85 and $52.92 in 2029, with an average of $45.09. This growth is anticipated as ENS becomes a key Web3 identity layer, widely used in DeFi, NFTs, and payments, and gaining more recognition around the world. Better scalability, lower costs, and more mature governance will all help maintain high demand and value. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2030 In 2030, ENS is forecasted between $62.63 and $76.45, averaging $64.88. Growth is driven by ENS’s role as a universal Web3 identity standard, stronger enterprise and government adoption, and Ethereum’s maturity. Reduced token supply pressures and solidified network effects support higher stability, making ENS a key digital identity infrastructure. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2031 The Ethereum Name Service’s price for 2031 is projected to be a minimum of $93.51. According to expert analysis, ENS could reach a maximum possible level of $109.63 and an average price of $96.11. However, this is anticipated as ENS establishes itself in the crypto space with widespread use in finance, social media, and digital governance. Ethereum Name Service price prediction 2032 In 2032, ENS is forecasted to be between $143.19 and $164.91, with an average of $147.99. This projection stems from ENS’s deep integration into global Web3 and Web2 systems, powering digital identity, payments, and decentralized governance. With entrenched network effects, strong enterprise adoption, and Ethereum’s ecosystem maturity, ENS demand and valuation are expected to rise further.

The proposed product, called the ARK CoinDesk 20 Crypto ETF, would offer broad exposure to major digital assets, led by Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP. The filing shows the ETF is expected to list on NYSE Arca, subject to regulatory approval. ARK is listed as the sponsor and commodity pool operator, registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The filing marks another attempt by a major asset manager to expand regulated crypto investment products beyond single-asset Bitcoin and Ether funds. ETF structure and investment approach According to the prospectus, the ETF would not hold spot cryptocurrencies directly. Instead, it plans to gain exposure through CoinDesk 20 Index futures contracts, with remaining assets held in cash and short-term U.S. government securities. Those holdings would support margin requirements and liquidity management. Because the fund tracks futures rather than spot markets, ARK said performance may differ from the prices of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Futures-based exposure can introduce tracking differences tied to contract roll costs, market structure, and pricing dynamics. The filing states that CoinDesk 20 Index futures are listed on ICE Futures U.S., with final settlement based on CoinDesk’s benchmark reference rates. Those rates rely on volume-weighted pricing during a defined daily calculation window. Index composition led by BTC, ETH, XRP The CoinDesk 20 Index is weighted by market capitalization and liquidity, excluding stablecoins, memecoins, and certain other token categories. As of Dec. 31, the filing lists Bitcoin as the largest component at about 32%, followed by Ethereum near 21% and XRP at nearly 20%. Solana and Cardano follow as smaller allocations, while the remaining constituents make up a limited share of the benchmark. The top five assets account for close to nine-tenths of the index weight, underscoring the dominance of large-cap cryptocurrencies within the structure. ARK also disclosed that the index is rebalanced quarterly, allowing weights to adjust as market conditions and asset capitalizations change. In a related filing wave, ARK also registered an “ex-Bitcoin” version of the CoinDesk 20 ETF, which would exclude BTC while keeping exposure to other large-cap digital assets. The filings come as U.S. regulators continue to review a growing pipeline of crypto-related ETFs, reflecting sustained institutional interest in diversified digital asset benchmarks.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 14:52:03

CryptoQuant data shows new whale realized cap racing higher into 2026, while a separate weekly chart shows Bitcoin sliding to the low $82,000s with RSI pressing into a historically low zone. BTC realized cap for new whales spikes into 2026 New Bitcoin whale wallets expanded their realized cap sharply at the end of the chart, rising toward about $120 billion as BTC price stayed near the top of its range. CryptoQuant’s “BTC: Realized Cap for New Whales” graphic shows the purple area barely visible until 2021, then growing slowly through 2022 and 2023 before turning higher in 2024. BTC Realized Cap for New Whales. Source: CryptoQuant/ X Then the curve steepened. Through 2025, the new whale realized cap accelerated from a modest base into a near vertical climb, ending close to the top of the left axis. Meanwhile, the black price line climbed into 2025 and then moved sideways near the 80K to 100K zone on the right axis, with a slight dip at the far right as the purple area continued rising. Earlier cycles look different on the same chart. Price surged into 2017, dropped through 2018, and recovered into 2021 before sliding in 2022. However, the new whale realized cap did not show comparable scale in those years, because the series only starts to build meaningfully from 2021 onward and remains relatively flat until the late 2024 to 2025 transition. As a result, the image highlights a widening gap: large, newer holders increased their aggregate cost basis rapidly, while spot price advanced more gradually and then consolidated near the highs.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-this-nyse-confirmation-is-big-for-xrp/,"A recent statement from the president of the New York Stock Exchange has renewed attention on how traditional equity markets may integrate blockchain-based infrastructure, and crypto commentator Xaif Crypto has positioned XRP at the center of that conversation. In a post on X, Xaif Crypto reacted to comments by NYSE President Lynn Martin during a FOX Business interview. He claims that the confirmed direction of tokenized equities aligns closely with XRP’s functional strengths as a settlement asset. During the interview, Martin explained that the NYSE has developed infrastructure designed to support the tokenization of equity markets. She stated that the platform enables continuous, 24-hour trading, digital and immediate settlement, and the ability to write transactions directly to a blockchain. According to Martin, the system also accommodates features long requested by market participants, including fractional shares, notional trading, and settlement mechanisms that match the speed of modern digital markets. She emphasized that moving equities onto a tokenized platform represents a significant step for the exchange, suggesting that elements of this technology are likely to be adopted across markets over time. NYSE President confirms infrastructure for tokenized equities 24/7 trading, fractional shares, blockchain-based instant settlement This is big for $XRP . Tokenized markets need fast, neutral, 24/7 settlement rails. That’s exactly where XRP fits. Bullish af. pic.twitter.com/pDugqtb5Zv — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) January 24, 2026 Xaif Crypto Highlights Settlement Demands of Tokenized Markets Reacting to these remarks, Xaif Crypto described the development as particularly significant for XRP. He argued that tokenized equity markets require settlement rails that operate continuously, remain neutral, and process transactions at high speed without interruption. In his view, these requirements closely match the design goals XRP was created to address. His commentary framed the NYSE announcement as institutional validation that future financial markets will depend on infrastructure capable of real-time, blockchain-based settlement rather than legacy batch systems. Xaif Crypto’s post focused less on speculative price action and more on market structure. He suggested that, as equities and potentially other asset classes transition toward tokenized formats, the need for efficient cross-platform settlement will increase. From this perspective, XRP is positioned as a practical solution rather than a theoretical one, particularly in environments that operate around the clock and across jurisdictions. XRPL Capabilities Enter the Conversation The discussion expanded further when X user Patrick Boyuk added context around the XRP Ledger. Boyuk noted that the XRPL was built specifically to support tokenized assets , pointing to its native decentralized exchange functionality. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He argued that, unlike blockchains that rely heavily on complex smart contracts, the XRPL enables the issuance and trading of tokenized assets directly on-chain without intermediaries. This design, he suggested, is well-suited to regulated markets that prioritize reliability, transparency, and predictable transaction execution. Institutional Signals and Market Interpretation Taken together, the NYSE’s confirmation of tokenization infrastructure and the reactions from crypto commentators illustrate how developments in traditional finance are increasingly interpreted through a digital asset lens. Xaif Crypto’s analysis positions XRP as a potential beneficiary of this shift, based on functional alignment rather than narrative appeal. While the NYSE did not reference any specific blockchain or digital asset, the confirmation that tokenized equities, instant settlement, and blockchain integration are now active priorities marks a notable moment for both traditional markets and the digital asset sector.

Quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption standards could expose the cryptographic foundations protecting everything from bank transactions to blockchain wallets. Just this month, Christopher Wood, the global head of equity strategy at Jefferies, reported that he removed Bitcoin from his model portfolio. A long-term proponent for BTC’s attractiveness as a hedge against monetary debasement, the Greed & Fear newsletter author said he made the move in advance of quantum computing threats to the foundations of Bitcoin’s investment case. Pantera’s Bi favors blockchain networks over traditional financial institution s Bi favors blockchai n be cause of what he calls the “unique ability of blockchains to enact a system-wide software upgrade a t gl obal scale.” He pointed to Ethereum’s successful transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in 2022—known as “The Merge”—as evidence of decentralized networks‘ readiness. According to an earlier Cryptopolitan report , Justin Drake revealed the formation of a post-quantum team led by Thomas Coratger, elevating quantum resistance to a top priority for the blockchain. The foundation is backing the initiative with two $1 million prizes and has already begun running multi-client post-quantum consensus test networks, with bi-weekly developer sessions now underway. Research from Chainalysis showed that approximately $718 billion in Bitcoin addresses remain vulnerable to quantum attacks using current cryptographic schemes. Is Wall Street ready for the quantum era? While major institutions like JPMorgan and HSBC have initiated quantum-safe pilot programs, industry surveys reveal concerning gaps. A recent study found that 65% of businesses claim quantum readiness, but most boards remain at the awareness stage rather than being in the active implementation phase. The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center warned against “crypto-procrastination” in a white paper. Europol’s Quantum Safe Financial Forum highlighted the complexity of coordinating changes across vendors, legacy systems, and international regulatory frameworks. Dean Yoost , former MUFG Union Bank board member, noted that artificial intelligence concerns are crowding out quantum preparedness at the board level, despite the existential nature of the cryptographic threat. The Bank for International Settlements and the European Central Bank have both issued warnings about systemic risks from delayed action. Traditional systems, as Bi noted, are “only as strong as their weakest links,” and the banking sector’s dependence on interconnected third-party vendors and central banks creates multiple vulnerability points and dependencies.

CryptoQuant data shows long-term holders are selling, signaling a rare change in market behavior during this bull run. Long-term Bitcoin holders are cashing out like never before, driving record-selling activity as bullish sentiment peaks. CryptoQuant data shows this is the highest long-term holder exit in Bitcoin’s history, highlighting both the rally’s strength and shifting investor psychology. Meanwhile, Gold’s odds of outperforming Bitcoin and the S&P 500 in 2026 rise to 45%. The movement of long-dormant Bitcoin by long-term holders is significant, as these investors usually stabilize the market. When they begin selling, it can signal profit-taking at bull-cycle peaks or renewed confidence in liquidity, creating short-term trading opportunities while raising questions about market sustainability. Timing matters: Bitcoin recently dipped below the key $90,000 mark, trading around $88,655 per CoinCodex data. Therefore, this combination of long-term holder selling and a psychological price breach could indicate an impending market consolidation or short-term correction. As older Bitcoins awaken, the market will be closely watched to see if this signals a temporary rebalancing or a shift in sentiment. Optimism remains, with charts pointing to $132,000 targets, global liquidity models hinting at higher long-term value, and Binance’s Changpeng Zhao predicting Bitcoin could break its four-year cycle and enter a potential “supercycle” in 2026. Conclusion The resurgence of long-dormant Bitcoins marks a key moment in this bull run.

The firm said these digital assets, which are used as stores of value, mediums of exchange, and units of account on public blockchains, could expand at an annual growth rate of about 61% through the end of the decade. ARK projected that Bitcoin could account for roughly 70% of the overall market, while the remainder is expected to be dominated by smart contract networks such as Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Bitcoin Leads ARK’s 2030 Outlook Under ARK’s forecast, BTC’s market capitalization could rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 63% over the next few years, increasing from nearly $2 trillion to about $16 trillion by 2030. The investment management firm estimated that the market capitalization of smart contract platforms could grow at a 54% annual rate to roughly $6 trillion by 2030, which is expected to be supported by annualized revenue of about $192 billion at an average take rate of 0.75%. ARK said two to three Layer 1 platforms could take most of that market. Meanwhile, the US Bitcoin ETFs and public companies held 12% of the total bitcoin supply in 2025, up from 8.7% previously. The firm found that the ETF balances rose 19.7% during the year, increasing from about 1.12 million BTC to almost 1.3 million BTC. Public company BTC holdings also expanded, after climbing 73% from around 598,000 BTC to approximately 1.09 million BTC. ARK also observed that BTC’s risk-adjusted returns surpassed those of most other large-cap cryptocurrencies and indexes for most of 2025. It said bitcoin’s average yearly Sharpe Ratio exceeded that of ETH and SOL, and the average of the other nine components in the CoinDesk 10 Index since the latest cycle low in November 2022, the start of 2024, and the beginning of 2025. It added that Bitcoin has become less volatile as it grows into a safe-haven role. Only a Few Coins Will Survive? Additionally, Layer 1 networks were also found to be evolving from revenue-generating platforms into monetary assets. Applying a high-growth revenue multiple of 50x to Ethereum’s network revenue, ARK estimated that more than 90% of Ethereum’s market value is attributed to its role as a monetary asset. On the other hand, ARK stated that Solana generated $1.4 billion in revenue, which means that around 90% of its valuation is driven by network utility. The firm added that only a few digital assets will retain monetary properties and serve as liquid stores of value based on its research. The post Bitcoin to $16 Trillion?

The most noticeable change affects Gboard, Google’s keyboard application for Android phones. Users who press the apostrophe key will now find themselves back at the letter screen right away, rather than remaining stuck on the symbols page. This brings Gboard in line with what Samsung’s default keyboard and Apple’s iPhone keyboard have done for some time. Beyond the keyboard fix, Android is getting a bigger visual overhaul through Material 3 Expressive. The update brings several changes to how the operating system looks. Users will notice a split design for notifications and quick settings, increased blur effects throughout the interface, and close to thirty new design elements that change shape. The overall result is meant to feel less crowded with better use of empty space. Economic pressures drive software polish These updates come at a difficult moment for the smartphone industry . Reports from January 2026 indicat e th e worldwide smartphone market faces shrinking sales, with shipments expected to drop 2.1% over the course of the year. The main reason is what analysts call an “AI memory crunch.” Companies running AI data centers are buying up high-bandwidth memory for servers, leaving less available for consumer products. This shortage has pushed RAM and storage component costs up by 40% to 50%. For Google, making the interface look and work better is about more than just appearance. With hardware expenses climbing, the a verage selling price for phones is set to jump 6.9% compared to last year. Research firm Counterpoint notes that memory chips now make up 18% to 20% of what it costs to build high-end phones. By closing the gap with Apple through improvements like the Gboard update, Google hopes to give consumers software quality that makes sense with higher prices, especially as people keep their phones longer before upgrading. Google has also changed how voice search appears on Android . The familiar four-dot pattern that showed up during voice commands is gone. In its place sits a gradient version of Google’s “G” logo. When the system listens to a user, a four-color curved line shows on screen to indicate it’s working. The feature for identifying music has been redesigned as well. Instead of a globe made of colored dots, users now see a larger button that says “Search a song.” This tool can figure out what song is playing, whether someone plays it, sings it, or hums the tune. These voice features can be accessed through the microphone icon in the Google app, the search widget on home screens, or the Pixel Launcher on Pixel phones. Sharing security technology Analysis of Google’s application code by Android Authority has revealed clues that scam detection might soon arrive on Samsung’s Galaxy S26 series. The findings, attributed to the tipster AssembleDebug, point to device codenames within the Google Phone app that hint at which phones will receive the tool next. This security feature currently works only on Pixel devices and uses Gemini artificial intelligence to shield users from fraudulent phone calls. Samsung already features Gemini prominently on phones like the Galaxy S25 when users first set them up. The tipster reportedly found device codenames in Google’s Phone app code after a recent update that hint at which phones will receive scam detection next. If true, this signals Google spreading its AI -powered safety features beyond its own products to boost Android’s standing against competing platforms. This represents a change in how Google does business. By giving Samsung access to Pixel-exclusive AI tools, Google is putting the overall Android ecosystem’s health ahead of its own phone sales. In January 2026, Samsung co-CEO TM Roh announced plans to double Gemini-powered Galaxy devices to 800 million units by year’s end. This “Gemini Alliance” responds directly to Apple, which reached a record 20.1% market share in late 2025. With the mobile AI market heading toward a $32.35 billion valuation this year, Google and Samsung recognize they cannot compete with Apple’s integrated approach separately. By combining their software capabilities, they aim to hold onto the premium market segment where customer loyalty runs deepest and profit margins hold up best against ongoing chip supply problems.

A fresh Gallup Workforce survey reveals that 12% of working adults now turn to AI every single day on the job. The research, which questioned more than 22,000 employed Americans this fall, shows how quickly these tools have spread through offices and workplaces nationwide. Around one in four workers tap into AI at least several times each week, the survey found. Close to half reported using these technologies at least a handful of times annually. That marks a big jump from 2023, when just 21% said they used AI even occasionally. The shift comes after ChatGPT kicked off a massive surge in AI tools that can handle tasks like drafting emails, writing code, boiling down lengthy reports, making images, and fielding questions. Gene Walinski, who works at a Home Depot in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, represents this new wave of AI users. The 70-year-old pulls out his phone about once every hour during his shift to ask an AI assistant about products in the electrical department when he runs into items he doesn’t know inside and out. “I think my job would suffer if I couldn’t because there would be a lot of shrugged shoulders and ‘I don’t know’ and customers don’t want to hear that,” Walinski explained. Technology workers stand at the front of the AI adoption wave Around 6 out of every 10 people in tech jobs use AI several times weekly, with roughly 3 in 10 using it daily. The numbers show a big increase since 2023, though signs point to growth possibly leveling off after the sharp spike between 2024 and 2025. Finance workers have also jumped on board. Andrea Tanzi, a 28-year-old investment banker at Bank of America in New York, uses AI daily to process documents and data that would otherwise eat up hours of his time. He also relies on the bank’s internal AI assistant, Erica, for routine administrative work. Most people working in professional services, colleges and universities, or elementary and high school education now use AI at least occasionally throughout the year. Joyce Hatzidakis, a 60-year-old high school art teacher in Riverside, California, began testing AI chatbots to polish up messages she sends to parents. “I can scribble out a note and not worry about what I say and then tell it what tone I want,” she said. “And then, when I reread it, if it’s not quite right, I can have it edited again. I’m definitely getting less parent complaints.” Another Gallup survey from last year found that about 6 in 10 workplace AI users depend on chatbots or virtual helpers. Around 4 in 10 tap AI to pull together information, spark ideas, or pick up new skills. Hatzidakis started with ChatGPT before moving to Google’s Gemini when her school district chose it as the official platform. She’s even used it for writing recommendation letters, noting “there’s only so many ways to say a kid is really creative.” Both the AI business world and the U.S. government keep pushing for more AI use in workplaces and schools. Companies need more buyers to make sense of the enormous sums poured into building and running power-hungry AI systems. But experts disagree on whether these tools will actually lift productivity or hurt job prospects. “Most of the workers that are most highly exposed to AI, who are most likely to have it disrupt their workflows, for good or for bad, have these characteristics that make them pretty adaptable,” said Sam Manning, a fellow at the Centre for the Governance of AI. Manning noted these computer-based workers usually have more education, broader skill sets, and bigger savings to help them weather job loss. Millions face AI disruption without safety net However, Manning’s research identified about 6.1 million American workers who face heavy AI exposure but lack the tools to adapt easily. Many handle administrative and clerical duties, roughly 86% are women, and they tend to be older and live in smaller cities like college towns or state capitals with fewer career options. “If their skills are automated, they have less transferable skills to other jobs and they have a lower savings, if any savings,” Manning said. A separate 2025 Gallup survey found that few employees think new technology, automation, robots, or AI will likely wipe out their jobs within five years. Half said it’s not at all likely, down slightly from about 6 in 10 in 2023. Rev. Michael Bingham, pastor at Faith Community Methodist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, isn’t worried. A chatbot gave him nonsense when he asked about medieval theologian Anselm of Canterbury, and he said he’d never ask a “soulless” machine to help write sermons.

Analysts Compare This Cheap Altcoin and Shiba Inu (SHIB)",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-crypto-to-buy-with-1000-analysts-compare-this-cheap-altcoin-and-shiba-inu-shib/,"Retail investors often look for assets that offer stronger appreciation potential rather than slow, large-cap performance. With many major cryptocurrencies now priced at high valuations, analysts say the rotation toward lower-cost tokens has returned. Two names currently appear in these discussions: Shiba Inu (SHIB) and a cheaper altcoin called Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which has been gaining attention ahead of its protocol launch. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu remains one of the most recognized meme tokens in the market. SHIB trades near $0.000009 with a market cap above $5B which places it firmly in the mid to upper tier of crypto assets. SHIB surged in earlier cycles due to strong community narratives, viral momentum and speculative rotations. However, analysts say the token now faces a valuation ceiling due to its size and lower breakout strength. Charts show resistance levels near $0.000011 and $0.000014 which have been difficult to clear during previous rallies. Breaking those zones would require increased volume and renewed attention. Price forecasts shared by several analysts for 2026–2027 show SHIB reaching only modest upside bands due to liquidity gravity. Under a bullish scenario, SHIB could push toward $0.000015 which represents a small percentage gain relative to emerging assets at lower valuations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The altcoin gaining attention for 2026 allocations is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project is developing a decentralized lending protocol that lets users earn APY on supplied assets while accessing liquidity without selling their holdings. Borrowing is collateralized, and risk is managed through predefined loan-to-value settings and liquidation safeguards. The protocol supports both pooled lending and direct borrowing markets. For example, a user holding ETH could borrow stablecoins at a 60% LTV ratio. If ETH drops in price and the position moves toward the liquidation threshold, the system steps in to protect lenders and keep the pool solvent. This structure introduces rules and predictability, which analysts say is often a requirement for long-term DeFi adoption rather than short-term speculation. Mutuum Finance began its presale in early 2025 at $0.01 and now trades at $0.04 in Phase 7. The presale has raised $19.9M and onboarded more than 18,900 holders. Roughly 830M MUTM tokens have been sold so far. From the 4B supply, 1.82B tokens or 45.5% are allocated for presale access. Analysts tracking new crypto cycles say this structured distribution is more utility-focused compared with meme assets which rely on attention-driven breakout attempts. Why Investors Prefer MUTM in Allocation Scenarios Analysts comparing SHIB and MUTM note that the difference is not narrative versus narrative, but narrative versus utility. SHIB relies on speculation and community activity. MUTM relies on lending, borrowing and yield mechanics that can support future protocol revenue. For investors choosing between the two with a $1,000 allocation, the math also differs. A $1,000 SHIB allocation at $0.000009 buys roughly 111,000,000 tokens. If SHIB reaches the bullish band near $0.000015, that position would be worth around $1,665 which equals a modest gain for the amount of effort to get there. A $1,000 MUTM allocation at $0.04 buys 25,000 tokens. Several experts outline scenarios in which MUTM trades between $0.18 and $0.30 during 2026 after its V1 protocol activation with mainnet launch as planned. As long as MUTM reaches $0.18, the same allocation would be worth $4,500. At $0.30, it would be worth $7,500. These scenarios highlight why some investors seek higher growth exposure in earlier-stage utility tokens. Timing and Rotation Behavior An interesting trend noted by analysts is that several early SHIB investors have begun rotating toward MUTM. The reason is not dissatisfaction with SHIB, but recognition that meme assets often deliver their strongest returns early in the cycle, while utility assets deliver theirs later as protocols activate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) confirmed on its official X account that its V1 protocol is scheduled for the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. This launch window has acted as a timing signal for investors who position before borrowing activity becomes visible. SHIB remains a popular community token, but its forward appreciation potential may be limited by its size and liquidity requirements. Mutuum Finance represents the opposite allocation profile: early valuation, development milestones and upcoming protocol activation. When deciding what cryptocurrency to buy with $1,000, analysts say the distinction between mature meme assets and early utility assets will likely define performance into 2026.

According to a widely followed analyst known as CryptoBull, the current price action echoes earlier runs in the token’s history. Related Reading: Crypto Meets Private Banking: UBS Weighs New Offering The signal is simple: long quiet periods sometimes lead to sharp moves when buying pressure returns. That does not mean a jump is guaranteed. Markets can stay quiet for a long time, and timing is uncertain. Pattern Mirrors Prior Cycles Based on reports, XRP’s weekly structure shows a stretch of range trading after strong breakouts from earlier years. The comparison reaches back several cycles. In past examples, long ranges eventually gave way to impulsive runs that pushed the price far above prior highs. The next impulse will take #XRP to $11 and the last wave to $70. The price pattern is copying the previous bullrun, only difference is time, which makes sense, as we need longer accumulation for higher prices. pic.twitter.com/WJxzYDVRKT — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 23, 2026 CryptoBull argues the present consolidation has lasted longer than previous ones, which, he says, could compress price action and build fuel for a larger expansion when momentum flips. The idea rests on history repeating itself in broad strokes, not in exact moves. Longer Accumulation Could Support Bigger Targets Some analysts see a sixfold move as plausible if the same pattern plays out. That kind of rise would put XRP near $11, a figure being discussed by multiple commentators. There is also talk of a further, final wave lifting the token much higher in a later stage — talk that reaches $70 in extreme scenarios. A bottom test—where price revisits support to confirm strength before a new push—has appeared in a few past cycles and is being watched closely now. The presence of such tests can either validate a base or warn that the range has more work to do. Timelines are vague, and a long accumulation period can stretch for years before any decisive breakout.

On-Chain Data Offers Insight,https://bitcoinist.com/does-capital-really-rotate-from-gold-to-bitcoin/,"“Bitcoin is the digital gold” is one of the most popular narratives in the cryptocurrency industry, reiterating BTC’s growing status as a formidable store of value . However, while the premier cryptocurrency has floundered over the past months, gold and the metals market have largely witnessed explosive growth. These contrasting performances have led to conversations about capital rotation between Bitcoin and gold, as the crowd expects one to always outperform the other at any given time. Recent data, however, suggests that the relationship between the BTC and gold price action is overrated. Capital Flow Link Between BTC And Gold Overestimated In a January 24 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost weighed in on the discourse surrounding capital rotation between gold and Bitcoin. According to the market pundit, the idea that investor funds flow from gold to Bitcoin is somewhat overblown. To highlight this overestimation, Darkfost shared a chart showing periods where BTC outperforms or underperforms depending on gold’s trend. This chart typically provides two signals: positive (BTC above the 180-day moving average [MA] and gold below the 180-day MA) and negative (BTC below the 180-day moving average and gold below the 180-day MA). As observed in the chart above and stated by Darkfost, the relationship between Bitcoin and gold does not appear to be fully substantiated. The on-chain analyst revealed that there have been as many positive periods as the negative ones, suggesting that the flagship cryptocurrency moves independently of gold. Darkfost wrote: This suggests that BTC continues to evolve independently, without clear evidence of a sustained capital rotation from gold. Furthermore, Darkfost noted that a positive signal does not necessarily mean that capital is flowing out of gold into Bitcoin. According to the on-chain analyst, it is simply not possible to determine whether there is a capital flow relationship between the world’s largest cryptocurrency and gold. Bitcoin & Gold Price Overview While Bitcoin started the new year on a pretty strong note, the bullish momentum has pretty much waned over the past two weeks. Meanwhile, the gold price has continued to flourish this year, recently reaching a new all-time high above $4,900 per ounce. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $89,230, reflecting no significant movement in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency is nearly 30% adrift its all-time high above the $126,000 level.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|crypto|gold,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2026-01-25 16:00:45

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $87,983.3 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market. This move represents a notable shift in short-term sentiment and prompts a deeper examination of underlying market forces. Bitcoin Price Drop: Analyzing the Immediate Market Data The breach of the $88,000 support level marks a clear technical development for traders. Consequently, market analysts are scrutinizing order book depth and trading volume across major exchanges. Data from CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko corroborates the Binance figure, showing a synchronized drop across global liquidity pools. Furthermore, the 24-hour trading volume for Bitcoin has surged by approximately 35%, indicating heightened activity. This volume spike typically accompanies periods of increased volatility and decisive price movement. Historically, round-number thresholds like $90,000 and $88,000 often act as magnet points for liquidity. Therefore, their breach can trigger automated sell orders and liquidations in leveraged derivative markets. A review of liquidation data from Coinglass reveals that over $450 million in long positions were liquidated across exchanges in the past 24 hours. This deleveraging event likely contributed to the downward momentum, creating a feedback loop that pressured the price further. Contextualizing the Cryptocurrency Market Correction This price action does not occur in a vacuum. Instead, it fits within a broader narrative of macroeconomic sensitivity that has characterized digital assets in recent years. For instance, traditional finance markets have shown weakness, with major equity indices also facing headwinds. Moreover, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has strengthened marginally, which often creates inverse pressure on dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin. Analysts from firms like Glassnode and CryptoQuant note that on-chain metrics, such as exchange net flows and miner behavior, provided early warning signs of potential selling pressure. The current market cycle, entering 2025, follows the established four-year pattern linked to Bitcoin’s halving events. The most recent halving in 2024 reduced the block reward for miners, a event historically followed by a period of consolidation before potential upward trends. However, short-term volatility remains a constant feature. This recent drop below $88,000 may represent a healthy correction within a longer-term bullish structure, a common phenomenon noted in previous cycles after significant rallies. Expert Perspectives on Market Structure and Sentiment Leading cryptocurrency researchers emphasize the importance of zooming out. “Intra-day or even weekly volatility is noise in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s adoption curve,” states a report from Arcane Research. The report highlights that long-term holder supply remains near all-time highs, suggesting conviction among core investors. Meanwhile, technical analysts point to key support levels now being tested, including the 50-day moving average, which currently sits around $85,500. A hold above this level could be interpreted as a sign of underlying strength. Regulatory developments also form a critical part of the context. The evolving landscape for Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and institutional custody solutions continues to shape market access and liquidity. Flows into U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have been a major narrative, will be closely watched in the coming days to gauge institutional response to this price dip. Sustained inflows could provide a stabilizing foundation. Potential Impacts and Forward-Looking Scenarios The immediate impact of this price movement is multifaceted. For retail investors, it serves as a stark reminder of asset volatility. For miners, whose revenue is directly tied to Bitcoin’s price, profitability margins may compress, potentially affecting network hash rate. However, the fundamental network security remains exceptionally high. The broader altcoin market often correlates with Bitcoin’s movements, and early data shows a market-wide pullback, with the total cryptocurrency market capitalization declining by roughly 5%. Looking ahead, several scenarios are plausible. A swift recovery above $90,000 would invalidate the bearish breakout and reinforce the previous range. Alternatively, a continued descent to test lower supports near $82,000 could indicate a deeper corrective phase. Market participants will monitor several key indicators: Exchange Reserves: A decline suggests coins are moving to cold storage (bullish). Funding Rates: Negative rates after a drop can signal excessive bearishness and precede a squeeze. Macro Data: Upcoming inflation and interest rate decisions from central banks. Conclusion The Bitcoin price drop below $88,000 is a significant market event that demands attention but not alarm. It underscores the inherent volatility of the digital asset class while operating within well-established historical and technical frameworks. This movement provides a real-time case study in market mechanics, involving leverage, liquidity, and macroeconomic interplay. For informed participants, such periods offer critical data on market health and investor behavior. The long-term trajectory for Bitcoin will ultimately be determined by its fundamental adoption metrics, network security, and role in the evolving global financial system, factors that remain distinct from any single day’s price action. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $88,000? The drop is likely due to a combination of factors including leveraged long liquidations, a broader risk-off sentiment in traditional markets, a slightly stronger U.S. dollar, and technical selling after failing to hold key support. Q2: Is this a crash or a normal correction? Based on the magnitude (a few percentage points from recent highs), this currently aligns with a standard market correction within a volatile asset class. Crashes are typically defined by much larger, rapid declines exceeding 20-30%. Q3: What is the next major support level for BTC? Analysts are watching the 50-day simple moving average, around $85,500, followed by stronger support in the $82,000 – $80,000 zone, which was a previous consolidation area. Q4: How does this affect other cryptocurrencies? Most major altcoins (e.g., Ethereum, Solana) show high correlation with Bitcoin in the short term. Therefore, they often experience similar downward pressure during BTC sell-offs, though the magnitude can vary. Q5: Should I buy the dip? This is a personal financial decision. Investors are advised to consider their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and conduct thorough research. Dollar-cost averaging is a common strategy to mitigate timing risk in volatile markets.

The altcoins are in a similar situation, with ETH plunging beneath $2,900 and SOL dropping by over 2.5% in just an hour. BREAKING: Bitcoin falls below $88,000 as $60 million worth of levered longs are liquidated in 30 minutes.

As reported yesterday, he warned that he may slap a 100% tariff on its northern neighbor if it chooses to sign a significant deal with China. Similar to the events that took place during the previous weekend, BTC remained relatively stable at first but started to break down as the opening of the futures markets neared. This time, BTC dumped to a five-day low of $87,500 (for now), after it was rejected at $89,000 earlier today. The past hour has been violent for most altcoins, with some, such as SUI, SOL, ARB, PEPE, ENA, and ADA, dropping by over 2%.

Market indexes climbed 13.3% between inauguration day and January 20, 2026, according to data from CFRA Research seen by CNN. While these returns appear solid on their own, they represent the smallest first-year increase for a president since George W. Bush began his second term in 2005. The performance also trailed Trump’s own previous record, during his initial term as president, markets jumped 24.1% in the first twelve months. Investors pushed stocks upward throughout the year, continuing a rally fueled largely by excitement surrounding artificial intelligence technology. Meanwhile, foreign markets beat U.S. stocks in 2025, a shift that hadn’t occurred in several years. However, the market didn’t start from scratch. Trump took office following two consecutive years where the S&P 500 had climbed more than 20% annually, a streak not seen since the 1990s. This meant expectations were already elevated when his second term began. Tariff turmoil triggers historic volatility spike The past year brought significant uncertainty as the administration changed direction repeatedly on key policies. Markets dropped close to bear market territory in April when confusion over tariff plans spooked investors. Prices then bounced back sharply after Trump stepped away from his harshest proposed measures. Overall, the S&P 500 hit 39 all-time highs during the year. By comparison, the index reached 62 record peaks in 2017 during Trump’s first year in office. Trump has shown he pays attention to market movements and sees them as a measure of how well his presidency is going. This week, he dismissed recent market declines tied to concerns about Greenland and tariffs as “peanuts,” predicting the market would soon be “doubled.” Hours after those comments, he pulled back on tariff threats, which helped stocks recover. Several factors supported market growth in 2025. The artificial intelligence sector remained a major draw for investors. People felt optimistic about potential Federal Reserve interest rate reductions. Company profits stayed strong. The economy held up better than many expected. Trump also signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” during the summer months. The economic boost from that legislation could help markets continue rising this year. “The front-end loading of this stimulus is a big reason why the stock market did well the first year of this term,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, wrote in an email. Maley added that many investors believe the president plans to “let the economy run hot” through the midterm elections. While this doesn’t guarantee the second year will match the first year’s performance, he noted the administration clearly wants markets performing well this year, particularly in the five to six months before those elections. Fear gauge hits pandemic levels The year brought both gains and wild swings. The VIX , which measures how worried Wall Street feels, spiked to levels not seen since the pandemic when tariff confusion peaked in spring. “The only truly exceptional thing was that the VIX went over 50 for the first time since the pandemic during the height of trade policy uncertainty,” Nick Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research, explained in an email. Tim Thomas, chief investment officer at Badgley Phelps Wealth Management, said he’s shifted some client accounts to be more “defensive” with less risky holdings. But he’s ultimately looking beyond short-term price swings and concentrating on fundamentals like earnings growth, the AI boom, and helpful government policies. “The market performance last year was pretty good,” Thomas said. “There is a lot of policy uncertainty out there. Policy uncertainty is hard to invest around, because, by its very nature, it can change in an instant.” After three straight years of strong performance, Wall Street experts generally expect the S&P 500 to keep climbing this year. But questions remain. The U.S. dollar has struggled recently while safe investments like gold and silver keep hitting new highs. Jim Hagerty, CEO at Bartlett Wealth Management, told his main lesson from the past year is that investors need to stay disciplined. “When markets have been really good, or occasionally when they’re scary, it can tempt people away from their disciplines,” Hagerty said. “I would just emphasize: stay disciplined.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This intense activity highlights the inherent risks of leveraged derivatives trading during periods of rapid price movement. Consequently, market participants are reassessing risk parameters while analysts examine the broader implications for digital asset stability. Crypto Futures Liquidations Signal Market Stress Data from leading derivatives platforms confirms the substantial liquidation event. Specifically, this $114 million in forced position closures occurred primarily on exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX. Moreover, the total liquidations over the past 24 hours reached approximately $236 million, indicating sustained pressure. These figures represent trader losses from leveraged positions that fell below maintenance margin requirements. Therefore, automated systems triggered the sales to prevent exchange losses. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on cryptocurrency prices using borrowed funds, amplifying both gains and losses. Typically, exchanges require collateral, known as margin, to open these positions. When market prices move against a leveraged position, the exchange issues a margin call. If the trader fails to add more collateral, the exchange forcibly closes the position. This process protects the exchange from default risk but creates cascading sell orders that can exacerbate price swings. Analyzing the Causes of Derivatives Market Volatility Several interconnected factors likely contributed to this liquidation cascade. First, Bitcoin’s price exhibited sharp fluctuations, dropping nearly 4% within the critical hour. This movement triggered stop-loss orders and liquidations for over-leveraged long positions. Additionally, elevated funding rates on perpetual futures contracts suggested crowded trades. High funding rates often precede corrections as they incentivize counter-trades. Market analysts point to macroeconomic cues as a potential catalyst. For instance, shifting expectations regarding interest rates can influence capital flows into risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, options market data showed a concentration of leverage at specific price levels. When these levels broke, liquidation algorithms activated en masse. The table below summarizes the liquidation distribution by position type during the peak hour: Position Type Estimated Value Liquidated Primary Cryptocurrency Long Positions $78 million Bitcoin (BTC) Short Positions $36 million Ethereum (ETH) Cross-Margin Positions Data Unavailable Mixed Assets Notably, long positions accounted for the majority of losses, reflecting a market caught off-guard by a sudden downturn. This pattern often indicates excessive bullish sentiment preceding the event. Traders using high leverage, sometimes exceeding 20x, faced immediate liquidation thresholds. Consequently, the rapid unwinding of these positions added substantial selling pressure to spot markets. Expert Insights on Risk Management and Market Structure Industry professionals emphasize the structural role of liquidations in derivatives markets. According to common risk management frameworks, exchanges implement these safeguards to maintain system solvency. However, the concentration of liquidity on few platforms can magnify volatility. Analysts recommend that traders employ prudent leverage ratios, especially during periods of anticipated news or economic data releases. Historical data reveals similar liquidation clusters during previous market cycles. For example, the May 2021 market correction saw over $8 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. Comparatively, today’s event remains smaller in scale but follows a recognizable pattern. Experts advise monitoring open interest and funding rates as leading indicators. When open interest rises alongside price, but funding rates become excessively positive, the market often becomes vulnerable to a long squeeze. Regulatory observers also note the growing scrutiny on cryptocurrency derivatives. Jurisdictions like the United States have placed limits on retail access to certain leveraged products. These measures aim to protect consumers from sudden wealth erosion. Nonetheless, global platforms continue to offer high-leverage options, contributing to periodic volatility spikes. The decentralized nature of crypto markets complicates uniform regulatory approaches. Broader Impacts on Cryptocurrency Ecosystem Stability The liquidation event immediately affected spot market prices, creating a feedback loop. As derivatives positions liquidated, the resulting sell orders pushed spot prices lower. This decline then triggered further liquidations in a volatile cycle. Market depth on several exchanges temporarily thinned, widening bid-ask spreads. Consequently, trading costs increased for all participants during the height of the volatility. Beyond immediate price action, such events influence trader psychology and market participation. Newer investors may experience significant losses, potentially reducing future engagement. Conversely, experienced traders sometimes view these periods as opportunities. They might enter the market to provide liquidity or establish contrarian positions. The key impacts include: Increased Volatility: Liquidations amplify price movements in both directions. Liquidity Redistribution: Capital shifts from liquidated traders to those with available margin. Platform Stress Testing: Exchanges validate their risk engine performance under pressure. Regulatory Attention: Authorities may examine consumer protection measures. Furthermore, the stability of lending protocols and decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms interlinked with centralized exchanges comes under scrutiny. Several DeFi applications rely on price oracles that source data from major exchanges. Extreme volatility can cause temporary price discrepancies, potentially affecting collateralized loans. However, the ecosystem has implemented safeguards like circuit breakers and multi-source oracle feeds since earlier incidents. Conclusion The $114 million crypto futures liquidation event underscores the persistent volatility and high-risk nature of leveraged digital asset trading. This activity serves as a stark reminder of the mechanics governing derivatives markets and their influence on broader price discovery. Market participants must prioritize robust risk management, including appropriate leverage use and position sizing. Ultimately, understanding liquidation dynamics remains crucial for navigating the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, especially as institutional adoption increases and market structures mature. FAQs Q1: What causes a futures liquidation in cryptocurrency markets? A futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position loses enough value that their collateral no longer covers potential losses. The exchange then forcibly closes the position to protect itself from default. Q2: How do liquidations affect the overall cryptocurrency market price? Liquidations create immediate sell (or buy) orders, adding pressure to the market. This can trigger a cascade as falling prices liquidate more positions, amplifying volatility in a short period. Q3: Which cryptocurrencies are most commonly involved in large liquidation events? Bitcoin and Ethereum typically see the highest liquidation volumes due to their large market capitalization and active derivatives markets. However, altcoins with high leverage offerings can also experience significant events. Q4: Can traders prevent their positions from being liquidated? Traders can add more collateral (margin) to their position before it hits the liquidation price or manually close the position at a loss. Using lower leverage from the start significantly reduces liquidation risk. Q5: Do all cryptocurrency exchanges offer the same leverage for futures trading? No, leverage limits vary by exchange and user jurisdiction. Some platforms offer up to 100x leverage, while others cap it at lower levels, especially for retail traders in regulated regions. Q6: Are liquidation events more common during specific market conditions? Yes, they often cluster during periods of high volatility, around major economic announcements, or after sustained price trends that encourage over-leveraged directional bets.

The coming days feature earnings from a mix of tech giants and industrial powerhouses, giving investors a broad look at how the economy is holding up. Tech firms will show what’s happening with artificial intelligence and gadget sales, while manufacturers will shed light on production and international commerce. Start of the week Several household names start the parade early in the week. General Motors has beaten Wall Street predictions for 13 straight quarters, and analysts expect the automaker to keep that streak alive. Boeing also reports as it works through its comeback, with observers looking for strong sales numbers. The middle of the week brings the heaviest lineup. Starbucks plans to discuss efforts to boost how its stores are running and serving customers. Three technology powerhouses follow later Wednesday: Microsoft, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Microsoft’s numbers will spotlight its Azure cloud division and artificial intelligence offerings. Tesla’s report comes with uncertainty around how many vehicles it’s building and selling. Meta needs to prove its ad business still works and that users haven’t abandoned its apps. Caterpillar and Apple close out the week Thursday morning belongs to Caterpillar , which just wrapped up one of its best years ever. The maker of bulldozers and construction machines has benefited as data centers get built and infrastructure work spreads nationwide. Wall Street thinks profits will dip a bit from earlier periods, but expectations remain high after the company’s strong run. What executives say about future orders will matter most. Caterpillar carries extra weight because its fortunes typically match the broader economy. Its business touches worldwide growth and building projects everywhere. Apple delivers its report on Thursday after trading ends, following a notable slide in its share price lately. Even with the recent drop, experts feel optimistic about steady iPhone demand and revenue from services climbing in the double digits. Some reports suggest the company may have increased production targets, which could lead to better-than-expected results. Business in China appears solid despite ongoing concerns about that market. Past patterns show Apple stock frequently falls right after the company reports earnings. But when the underlying business looks solid, shares can jump sharply afterward. The services division and loyal customers provide lasting advantages. Apple’s figures will clearly indicate if shoppers are still opening their wallets, with iPhone sales and store activity painting a picture of consumer strength worldwide. Bigger picture emerges A few common threads run through all these reports. Artificial intelligence keeps influencing results, especially for cloud and software businesses. Recent figures show corporate America is nearing its ninth straight quarter of year-over-year profit increases. That represents impressive resilience during uncertain economic times. Yet the S&P 500 fell over the past week, showing how quickly optimism can evaporate. Disappointing numbers from key players like Apple and Caterpillar could either support continued confidence or spark new anxiety about what lies ahead.

Projects that pass through the development cycles and not through social attention would be found by investors that follow development cycles. Analysts indicate that the trend is repeating itself with one new cryptocurrency surging over 300% since the first quarter of the 2025 and is now drawing much more attention than in the silent build phase. What Mutuum Finance Is Developing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the construction of a decentralized lending program with formalized borrowing and collateral repayment policies. Mutuum Finance has two lending markets. APY is earned by lenders in the pooled market by supplying assets in the form of mTokens. The pool is used by the borrowers to access liquidity using collateral at determined loan to value ratios like 50% and 75%. The direct matching market (P2P) is one where users match but use different collateral rules and do not take advantage of a common liquidity source. The two markets enable users to access the liquidity without technically selling original assets hence becoming a common request in DeFi. The official X statement of the team states that V1 will have its release in Q1 2026 in the Sepolia testnet. This will bring collateral logic, liquidation systems, debt accounting and support ETH and USDT. Another finding that appears to be a requirement of lending protocols was done by the independent audit conducted by Halborn Security on Mutuum Finance. First Pricing Signals The participation has increased as the protocol has progressed by levels of development. Mutuum Finance has deployed 18,900 investors and has raised $19.9M. According to analysts, this involvement is important since lending rules require a user base to grow before the activity of borrowing can reach a scale. Lending platforms tend to fail to fulfill their first utility stage unless their onboarding is done early. MUTM presale began at the beginning of 2025 at $0.01 and is currently selling at $0.04. This is a 300% increment amongst early entrants. This kind of appreciation in the build phase according to researchers following new crypto projects indicates that capital is positioning ahead of V1 and not waiting to be fully activated. This is being perceived by many investors as the indication of a premature discovery process that is developing. Mutuum Finance contains a 4B MUTM supply. Out of that supply, 45.5% or 1.82B tokens will be distributed to the community. So far, 830M tokens have been sold. According to analysts, this is striking in two aspects. To begin with, it is a large distribution model, which lowers concentration. Second, it enhances the participation of the network at an early stage, which lending protocols demand to facilitate the volume of future borrowing. Security and Stablecoin Plans The other triggering point has been the security validation. In addition to the Halborn audit, Mutuum Finance is scored 90 out of 100 on CertiK token scan and has a $50,000 bug bounty program. Procedures of lending are based on correct liquidation and collateral data which makes the audits and bounty programs more of an obligatory procedure, and not a marketing feature. An overcollateralized stablecoin is also in the roadmap. Users will be in a position to mint a stablecoin without selling original assets. Analysts writing on DeFi cryptocurrency exchanges observe that the duration of stablecoin borrowing will be higher since users trade in stable coins to hedge and manage their portfolios. This predictable pattern has the ability to grow fee consistency and this could enhance APY to lenders when borrowing grows. Phase 7 has been progressing more than the previous stages. One instance that the market observers cited was a recent whale investment of $100K. According to analysts, the acceleration is important since Phase advancement causes the token pricing to rise as allocations are filled. This is creating an urgency amongst new entrants because the supply is becoming tight.

But what if a project combined breakthrough privacy technology with unprecedented financial backing? Analysts highlight ZKP, a privacy-preserving AI network that experts believe addresses the fundamental flaws plaguing Chainlink and XRP’s growth paths. Industry specialists describe ZKP’s decentralized data marketplace as revolutionary infrastructure that could dominate the $4.45 billion annual data breach industry. Experts predict the presale auction will raise over $1.7 billion, a figure that analysts state will make ZKP the most financially powerful launch in blockchain history, dwarfing the war chests of established competitors. ZKP: The $1.7 Billion Blockchain Powerhouse ZKP operates as a privacy-preserving AI network where users monetize their data while maintaining complete ownership through advanced cryptographic verification. The platform solves a $4.45 million per incident problem, the average cost of data breaches that plague centralized systems like Cambridge Analytica and Equifax. Industry specialists note that ZKP’s dual-token ecosystem and decentralized data marketplace create multiple revenue streams that established platforms cannot replicate. Experts point to these structural advantages when explaining why ZKP could rank among the top crypto coins within its first year of mainnet operations. The presale auction structure reveals something extraordinary about this project’s financial progress. Analysts calculate that the 450-day presale releasing 90 billion tokens will generate over $1.7 billion in development capital before mainnet launch. This figure represents more funding than most blockchain projects raise in their entire existence. Financial dominance translates directly into market dominance, according to industry observers. The project can outspend competitors on exchange listings, marketing campaigns, strategic partnerships, and developer incentives. Specialists argue that this guaranteed funding eliminates the primary risk factor that destroys most crypto projects, running out of capital during bear markets. Ownership of ZKP tokens means owning a stake in what experts describe as the most financially secured blockchain launch in history. The presale auction structure ensures the project enters the mainnet with resources to monopolize the AI data sector. The math is simple: more capital means more aggressive expansion, better talent acquisition, and guaranteed survival through market downturns. Chainlink Price Prediction: Technical Struggles Limit 2026 Upside Chainlink currently trades at around $13.73 with a market capitalization of $9.72 billion, maintaining its position as the #13-ranked cryptocurrency. The Chainlink price prediction landscape shows concerning technical signals; the 50-day moving average is falling while the asset trades within a descending channel after suffering a 40% decline throughout 2025. January 2026 data indicates LINK posted a modest 4.74% gain over seven days, yet analysts project end-of-year targets between $32-$55 in optimistic scenarios. Conservative forecasts place 2026 prices closer to the $32-$36 range, representing potential gains of 133-162% from current levels. The Chainlink price prediction models reveal a fundamental problem: established market position limits explosive growth potential. Expert sources, including CoinCodex calculate bearish technical indicators for 2026, with RSI hovering at neutral 42.20 levels and multiple resistance barriers blocking upward momentum. While Chainlink’s oracle technology powers billions in DeFi transactions and partnerships with major institutions like Mastercard continue expanding, the token’s maturity means 10x returns appear mathematically unlikely. Analysts note that achieving even the optimistic $100 target would require sustained bull market conditions and multi-year timeframes rather than near-term catalysts. XRP Price USD: Regulatory Wins Fail to Reverse Momentum Loss The XRP price USD currently sits at around $1.97-$2.06 across major exchanges, placing Ripple’s token at #5 globally with a market capitalization of $115.94-$125.20 billion. January 2026 shows mixed performance, 24-hour volatility ranges from +4.15% gains to -5.77% losses depending on exchange data, while year-over-year metrics reveal a troubling 38.62% decline. Analysts project 2026 targets between $3-$5 for moderate scenarios, with optimistic forecasters suggesting $8.50-$10 possibilities if institutional adoption accelerates through XRP ETF approvals and Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin integration. Despite catalysts like UK FCA approvals and strong ETF inflows, the XRP price USD faces technical resistance near $2.35, limiting short-term gains. The asset has tested lower support zones, and even reaching its previous all-time high of $3.66 would yield only an 85% rise, modest compared with early-stage cryptos. With a $125 billion market cap, XRP’s growth potential is constrained compared with smaller-cap, high-multiplier assets. Key Takeaway Chainlink price prediction models suggest conservative 2026 targets of $32–$55 despite strong network fundamentals, while the XRP price USD trades near $1.97 with projected gains limited to $3–$10, even after regulatory wins and ETF approvals. Both face mathematical constraints from massive market caps, limiting explosive returns seen in smaller assets. By contrast, ZKP operates under different conditions. Its projected $1.7 billion presale provides unprecedented funding to dominate the AI data sector. Analysts note this level exceeds what most blockchains raise in their entire lifetimes, creating a “guaranteed survival advantage.” With capital to fuel exchange listings, grants, marketing, and acquisitions, ZKP ranks among the potential top crypto coins, offering fundamentally different growth and risk dynamics than assets driven solely by technical trends.

Dogecoin price analysis gives a bearish prediction following current market sentiment. The coin’s value has dropped to $0.122 in the past 24 hours. If sellers keep dominating the market, DOGE’s price might trigger further loss and retest the $0.117 support. Conversely, if the bullish trend revives, the meme coin may surge toward the $0.129 resistance zone. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and your own research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.26006–$0.330985 level by 2027. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price dropped to $0.122 over the last 24 hours as sellers continued to dominate. After DOGE price faced resistance around local highs, sellers took control and pushed the price toward support levels. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2026? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.295522 in 2026. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by November 2029. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin near $1 by 2032. However, this is not investment advice, and one must seek professional consultation or carry out their own research to create an investment strategy. As all cryptocurrency investments carry risk, due to the market volatility that may affect the future performance of the crypto assets. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 4231.11 DOGE in January; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading below its average price of the last year. Currently, the coin is trading below the previous year’s peak price of $0.434, which was observed in January 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $0.92203 mark by 2032, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Chart by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE was trending near $0.214. At the start of October, Doge was trading above $0.21, and at the start of November, it hovered near $0.187. By the end of December, the price of Dogecoin declined toward $0.122. At the start of 2026, Dogecoin is trending near $0.118, as the current Doge sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2026-01-25 17:00:39

On Saturday, he threatened Canada with 100% tariffs if Prime Minister Mark Carney goes ahead with a trade deal with China. Trump said Carney would be “sorely mistaken” to think the U.S. will let Canada turn into a dumping ground for Chinese products. Carney’s deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping was announced on January 16. It allows up to 49,000 electric vehicles from China to enter Canada each year, which is under 3% of the Canadian new vehicle market. In return, Canada gets lower tariffs on its food exports to China. Trump didn’t like it . At first, he said it was fine, but now he’s warning Canada it could cost them if they go further with Beijing. Trade officials defend deal as tensions rise Dominic LeBlanc, who handles U.S. trade for Canada, fired back. He said there’s “no pursuit of a free trade agreement with China.” He called the deal limited and only about fixing tariff problems. He also described the U.S.-Canada relationship as a “remarkable partnership,” despite Trump’s attacks. Carney, speaking in Ottawa, said the plan is to pull tariffs back to where they were in 2023 but keep the EV cap in place. “We’re going to use the expression ‘back to the future’ with respect to EVs, with respect to agriculture,” he said. He claimed it sticks to the rules under the USMCA. Trump’s reaction comes just months before the official review kicks off. The deal marks its sixth anniversary on July 1, and if the U.S., Canada, and Mexico don’t agree to extend it for another 16 years, they’ll be stuck doing yearly reviews until the pact dies in 2036. Any of the three can also pull out with six months’ notice. That clause’s now sitting on the table, and everyone knows it. Economists told Bloomberg they still expect the review to end with a deal, but Trump’s threats are making things shaky. Dominique Lapointe, from Manulife Investment Management, said the new warnings add “downside risks” to the upcoming talks. Canada’s economy vulnerable as review deadline nears This is not great news for Canada, which sends most of its exports to the U.S. Sectors like steel, autos, aluminum, and lumber are already under pressure from Trump’s sector-specific tariffs. But there’s still a large chunk of goods that get through tariff-free under USMCA. If that protection disappears, economists say the average rate on Canada’s exports to the U.S. could spike to over 7%. Trump’s already said this month that he sees “no real advantage” to keeping USMCA, even though it was one of his big wins when he replaced NAFTA. But now he’s acting like the deal is holding America back. That’s not what Derek Holt from Bank of Nova Scotia sees. He said most American industries actually stood up for the deal during official hearings. In a Friday report, he wrote, “The vast majority of U.S. industries that testified at USTR hearings strongly supported the USMCA deal.” Businesses in Canada aren’t feeling steady either. A survey by the Bank of Canada showed most companies are pausing growth plans. They’re only spending money on keeping things running, not expanding. Bloomberg’s economists said Canada’s investment could go up by 1.3% in 2026, but only if the USMCA talks go well. Last year, it was just 0.6%. Randall Bartlett from Desjardins said the noise and drama were always going to be part of it. He said, “It was never going to be a positive environment for business investment in Canada, particularly in the first part of this year.” Even Matthew Holmes from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce had concerns. He said companies are already dealing with the fallout and urged both sides to “come to a better understanding quickly.” Bartlett added that Canada’s talks with China might end up helping them during the USMCA battle. “There are other major trading partners that want to work with us,” he said. And if Canada shifts away from depending only on the U.S., it could create problems for American businesses too. Trump himself seemed fine with the deal at first. On January 16, he said, “That’s OK, that’s what he should be doing. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.” But now, he’s ready to hit back. The politics are changing fast. And with the USMCA review around the corner, the next few months look messy. Get seen where it counts.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/expert-says-this-ark-invest-news-is-huge-for-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"Institutional decisions often speak louder than market speculation, and ARK Invest’s latest ETF filing has done exactly that for XRP. In a space where credibility, liquidity, and regulatory awareness determine long-term survival, ARK’s move places XRP firmly back in the institutional spotlight. The filing has triggered intense discussion across crypto markets, not because of hype, but because of what it signals about how major asset managers now view XRP’s role in the digital asset ecosystem. In his recent X post, crypto analyst Xaif drew attention to the most striking detail in the filing: XRP’s unexpectedly high allocation. His observation quickly gained traction as market participants examined the broader implications of the numbers. Huge news for $XRP holders! ARK Invest's new ETF filing spotlights XRP with a massive 19.88% weighting second only to ETH! This is institutional validation at its finest, proving XRP's dominance in payments and cross-border tech. https://t.co/XnWgOChgua pic.twitter.com/uO22Qv6rwd — Xaif Crypto| (@Xaif_Crypto) January 23, 2026 What ARK Invest Actually Filed With the SEC ARK Invest filed for the ARK CoinDesk 20 Crypto ETF, a product designed to track the CoinDesk 20 Index, which represents the largest and most liquid digital assets in the market. The index excludes stablecoins, memecoins, and privacy-focused tokens, focusing instead on assets with scale, depth, and institutional relevance. Within this structure, Bitcoin holds the largest share at just over 32%, followed closely by Ethereum at around 20.7%. XRP comes next with a 19.88% weighting, positioning it as one of the ETF’s core assets and placing it ahead of other major layer-1 networks such as Solana and Cardano. Why XRP’s 19.88% Weighting Is a Big Deal ETF weightings reflect conviction, not sentiment. ARK’s decision to allocate nearly one-fifth of the fund to XRP indicates confidence in its liquidity, market resilience, and long-term utility. Asset managers typically favor tokens that can absorb large capital flows without severe volatility, and XRP’s deep order books and global trading footprint align with that requirement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 More importantly, this weighting suggests that ARK views XRP as more than a speculative asset . It reflects recognition of XRP’s established use case in payments and cross-border settlement infrastructure , an area where few digital assets have demonstrated comparable real-world adoption. Institutional Validation Beyond the Charts ARK’s filing arrives in a post-litigation environment where XRP no longer carries the same regulatory overhang that once limited institutional exposure. By elevating XRP to a near-Ethereum level allocation, ARK effectively places it among the most institutionally viable crypto assets available today. If approved, the ETF would further integrate XRP into regulated investment products, potentially increasing exposure from traditional investors who cannot access spot crypto markets directly. What This Means for XRP Holders For XRP holders, this development represents more than positive headlines. It signals a structural shift in how large investment firms assess XRP’s relevance. As institutional frameworks expand and regulated products multiply, XRP’s position inside a flagship crypto ETF could strengthen its role in the next phase of market maturation.

57460447,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265174,1769361012,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Gemini-Powered Siri: Apple’s Revolutionary AI Assistant Set for February Unveiling,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/apple-gemini-siri-february-unveiling/,"BitcoinWorld Gemini-Powered Siri: Apple’s Revolutionary AI Assistant Set for February Unveiling In a landmark move for consumer technology, Apple will reportedly unveil its Gemini-powered Siri assistant in February 2026, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This announcement, expected in the latter half of the month from Cupertino, California, represents the first tangible product of the historic AI partnership between Apple and Google announced in 2024. Consequently, this development signals a fundamental shift in how millions of users will interact with their Apple devices, moving Siri from a basic command tool to a sophisticated, context-aware digital companion. The Genesis of the Gemini-Powered Siri Partnership Industry analysts trace the roots of this collaboration to Apple’s public struggles with generative AI development throughout 2024. While competitors like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s own Gemini advanced rapidly, Apple’s internal efforts, reportedly led by a foundation model team, faced significant hurdles. Mark Gurman’s reporting indicates that internal tensions surfaced, with Apple’s Mike Rockwell reportedly dismissing earlier critical reports about the company’s AI progress. However, the strategic decision to partner with Google’s AI division, coupled with the departure of Apple’s AI chief John Giannandrea, ultimately charted a new course. This partnership leverages Google’s established Gemini AI models, which lead the industry in multimodal reasoning and large-scale language processing. Technical Architecture and User Experience The forthcoming Siri update will fundamentally change how the assistant operates. Primarily, it will utilize Google’s Gemini models to understand and execute complex, multi-step tasks. A key advancement involves Siri’s new ability to access and reason across a user’s personal data and on-screen content with explicit permission. For example, a user could ask, “Summarize the key points from the document I just read and schedule a meeting with the team to discuss them next week.” Siri would then parse the document, extract themes, and interact with the Calendar app—all within a single, conversational flow. Initially, this powerful processing may run on Google’s cloud infrastructure to handle the computational load, though future on-device execution remains a likely goal for Apple’s famed privacy standards. Comparing the New Siri to Existing AI Assistants The February update aims to close the perceived gap between Siri and other leading chatbots. The following table outlines the expected competitive positioning: Assistant Core Technology Key Strength Primary Environment Gemini-powered Siri (2026) Google Gemini AI Deep device integration & personal context Apple Ecosystem (iOS, macOS, etc.) Google Assistant with Gemini Google Gemini AI Search integration & web knowledge Android, Web, Google Apps ChatGPT OpenAI GPT Models Creative tasks & long-form reasoning Cross-platform, web-based Amazon Alexa Amazon’s LLM Smart home control & commerce Amazon Ecosystem & Smart Home Therefore, Apple’s unique advantage lies not in creating the most powerful standalone AI, but in integrating a top-tier model seamlessly into its tightly controlled hardware and software ecosystem. This integration promises a more fluid and useful experience for tasks tied directly to the device and user data. The Strategic Impact on Apple and the AI Landscape This partnership carries profound implications for both companies and the broader tech industry. For Apple, it provides a proven, state-of-the-art AI engine without diverting excessive internal resources from its core hardware design and chip development. It also mitigates the risk of falling behind in a critical software domain. Conversely, for Google, embedding its Gemini technology into billions of Apple devices represents an unprecedented distribution victory, potentially setting its AI standard across mobile and desktop computing. Meanwhile, this alliance places immense pressure on other ecosystem players like Microsoft and Amazon to respond with their own strategic counter-moves. The Roadmap: From February Preview to WWDC Vision Gurman’s report clarifies that the February unveiling is merely a preview. Apple plans a more comprehensive showcase of its AI future at the June 2026 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The February version will demonstrate core functionality, while the WWDC announcement is expected to detail: Developer APIs: Tools for third-party apps to integrate with the new Siri. On-device vs. Cloud Processing: A clearer roadmap for privacy-focused local AI execution. Cross-Device Intelligence: How Siri will maintain context across iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Vision Pro. Monetization Strategy: How this advanced AI might be bundled into services or subscriptions. This staged rollout allows Apple to manage market expectations, gather early feedback, and prepare its developer community for the seismic shift coming to its platforms. Conclusion The reported February 2026 unveiling of the Gemini-powered Siri assistant marks a pivotal moment in consumer AI. By partnering with Google, Apple is poised to deliver a conversational, context-aware assistant that finally fulfills long-standing promises. This move validates the power of Google’s Gemini models while securing Apple’s competitive position. Ultimately, the success of this Gemini-powered Siri will depend on its execution—its fluency, reliability, and, crucially, its unwavering commitment to user privacy within Apple’s walled garden. The tech world will be watching closely as these two giants attempt to redefine the digital assistant. FAQs Q1: When exactly will Apple announce the new Gemini-powered Siri? According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple plans to announce the new Siri in the second half of February 2026. A more complete vision for Apple’s AI strategy is then expected at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2026. Q2: How will the Gemini-powered Siri be different from the current Siri? The new Siri will be fundamentally more capable. It will use Google’s Gemini AI for more natural, conversational interactions and will gain the ability to complete complex tasks by accessing and understanding your personal data and on-screen content with your permission, moving beyond simple command recognition. Q3: Will my data be safe with Google’s AI processing Siri requests? While technical details are pending, Apple has historically prioritized on-device processing for privacy. Initial reports suggest complex queries may use Google’s cloud. However, any data sharing will be governed by strict agreements, and Apple will likely emphasize user consent and transparency in its data handling policies. Q4: Do I need a new iPhone or Apple device to use the new Siri? Official device requirements will be confirmed at the announcement. Typically, major new AI features require newer hardware with more powerful neural engines (like the A-series or M-series chips). It is unlikely to be available on older devices from several generations prior. Q5: Why did Apple partner with Google instead of developing its own AI? Reports indicate Apple’s internal AI development faced challenges keeping pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The partnership allows Apple to integrate a leading AI model (Gemini) quickly, ensuring Siri remains competitive, while allowing Apple to focus its engineering resources on seamless integration and privacy-preserving implementation.

According to Etherscan data, Ethereum L1 approached 1.3 million active addresses on January 16, briefly surpassing some of its own Layer 2 networks in terms of raw usage. This sudden surge has renewed discussions about whether on-chain demand for the world’s second-largest blockchain is returning. For a brief window, Ethereum L1 looked like the busiest part of the entire ecosystem again—fueling speculation that user behavior may be shifting back toward mainnet. But rising activity does not always translate into rising prices. ETH Price Still Stuck in a Bearish Trend Despite the impressive surge in active addresses, Ethereum’s price remains under pressure. ETH fell around 1% in the past 24 hours, extending a much more significant 11% weekly decline. Source: coinmarketcap ETH’s technical picture continues to weaken: Below 7-day SMA ($3,134) Below 30-day SMA ($3,101) Well below the 200-day SMA ($3,667) Trading below all these key averages reflects a bearish trend across all major timeframes, showing that increased network activity has not yet translated into sustained buying interest. How Outset PR Helps Crypto Companies Navigate Shifting Market Narratives The disconnect between Ethereum’s rising activity and its bearish price underscores a broader reality of the crypto market: data alone does not shape narratives—interpretation does. This is precisely where Outset PR’s methodology becomes valuable. Outset PR , founded by strategist Mike Ermolaev, specializes in connecting market events with meaningful, data-driven storytelling. Rather than relying on generic coverage or broad distribution lists, the agency treats each campaign as a hands-on workshop aligned with real-time market momentum. At the core of this approach is the Outset Data Pulse , a proprietary intelligence system that tracks: On-chain activity Media trendlines Traffic distribution across major crypto publications This allows Outset PR to identify the exact moment when a client’s message will achieve maximum impact—optimizing not only content but also timing. Another pillar of its strategy is the Syndication Map , an internal analytics tool that reveals which publications generate the strongest downstream visibility across top aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. With this insight, Outset PR is able to produce PR campaigns that achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements. This precision ensures every PR effort is market-fit, cost-efficient, and positioned at the moment audiences are most receptive—an increasingly important edge in a noisy, fast-moving crypto landscape. ETH Outlook: A Positive Fundamental Signal, But Technicals Lag Behind Ethereum’s surging daily active addresses are a strong fundamental signal and suggest renewed life on the L1.However, price remains governed by broader market conditions and continued downward momentum.

The product is built around a revolving credit line that allows users to borrow against their crypto assets while paying interest only on the funds they actually use. Unlike traditional crypto loans that accrue interest from the moment a loan is issued, Clapp’s model applies 0% interest to unused credit . Borrowing costs begin only when funds are drawn, and remain closely tied to loan-to-value (LTV) levels. According to Clapp, the structure is designed to give users access to liquidity without forcing them to pay for capital they do not need. Credit Line Structure Instead of Fixed Loans Clapp does not issue fixed-term loans. Instead, BTC and ETH deposited on the platform act as collateral for a revolving credit line. Once collateral is deposited, users receive a borrowing limit based on the market value of their assets. Funds can be withdrawn at any time, in full or in part, and repaid without a fixed schedule. As repayments are made, available credit is restored automatically. This structure separates access to liquidity from the act of borrowing itself. How Zero Interest Applies Under Clapp’s model, unused funds carry a 0% interest rate. Simply maintaining a credit line does not generate borrowing costs. Interest accrues only on the portion of funds that are actively borrowed. The applicable rate depends on the loan-to-value ratio, which measures the borrowed amount relative to the value of the BTC or ETH collateral. When LTV remains below 20%, borrowing costs stay low and the unused portion of the credit line remains fully interest-free. Focus on Conservative Borrowing Bitcoin and Ethereum price volatility makes risk management central to crypto-backed lending. Clapp’s credit line is structured to encourage conservative use rather than maximum leverage. Lower LTV levels provide: Greater buffer against market fluctuations Reduced liquidation risk More predictable borrowing costs By tying interest to utilization and LTV, the platform aligns borrowing costs with actual risk exposure. Flexible Repayment Terms The credit line does not have a fixed maturity date. Users can repay partially or in full at any time, without penalties. Interest stops accruing immediately once borrowed funds are repaid, while unused credit remains free of charge. This flexibility positions the product for short-term or intermittent liquidity needs rather than continuous borrowing. Addressing Common Misconceptions Clapp emphasized that “zero-interest” does not mean all borrowed funds are free indefinitely. The 0% rate applies specifically to unused credit, while borrowed funds accrue interest based on LTV. This distinction is intended to provide transparency and set clear expectations for users. Availability The zero-interest credit line is available to eligible BTC and ETH holders through the Clapp platform. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The difficult side of deploying the project is getting the right kind of attention: who hears about you, where they see you, and how your story lands among relevant audiences. That’s the job of crypto PR agencies. They help blockchain teams translate dense docs and tokenomics into clear storylines, connect with journalists and influencers who actually move sentiment, and keep communication steady through market cycles—launches, listings, partnerships, and everything in between. Done well, they accelerate brand visibility, credibility, and community growth instead of acting like simple press-release factories. What is a crypto PR agency? A crypto PR agency is a public-relations firm focused specifically on blockchain and Web3 projects, DeFi protocols and infrastructure, exchanges, wallets, NFT/GameFi launches, and onchain apps. They use sector-specific playbooks rather than generic tech outreach. How crypto PR differs from traditional PR Compared to generalist PR firms, good crypto PR agencies usually bring: Web3 fluency – they understand on-chain mechanisms, token models, governance, and can discuss them without constant hand-holding. Crypto-native distribution – access to CoinDesk, Cointelegraph, Decrypt, niche outlets, analytics platforms, and KOLs on X/Telegram/YouTube. Speed in volatile markets – experience adjusting messaging quickly around listings, market swings, and narrative shifts. Crisis playbooks – guidance for hacks, exploits, FUD, and regulatory news that could otherwise damage trust. 1. Outset PR – Data-Led Crypto PR Built for the AI Era Outset PR is known in the Web3 space for taking an analytical, data-first approach to crypto PR and media planning. The team combines sector expertise with analytics, relying on a network of 2,400+ media outlets and a service stack that includes organic PR, traffic acquisition, tier-1 pitching, and long-term communications support. Instead of relying mainly on standard press distribution, the team evaluates the performance of crypto media outlets using its proprietary Outset Data Pulse framework and uses those insights to steer campaigns. The aim is simple: focus on visibility that can translate into measurable outcomes. How Outset PR ensures AI search visibility for Web3 projects One of Outset PR’s core goals today is ensuring that Web3 brands are properly represented in LLMs and AI-driven discovery systems. That means securing placements on sites and sources that AI models use to crawl, verify, and index information about a project. Unlike traditional workflows where analytics only show up at the reporting stage, Outset PR starts from data. Before a story goes live, the team models how it is likely to travel through search engines and AI ecosystems. Their approach rests on three pillars: Data-led strategy: Campaigns begin with concrete visibility targets tied to signals like coverage weight, citation depth, and factual recall accuracy. AI-aware storytelling: Content is written in clear, structured, fact-rich language so it’s easy to interpret for both human readers and machine-learning models, improving how projects are summarized and recalled. Continuous LLM monitoring: The team regularly checks how major models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) describe their clients and adjusts narratives, content angles, and media plans to keep that representation accurate and up to date. Outset PR prioritizes media outlets by syndication impact Alongside AI search optimization, the team also uses an internal Syndication Map – a tracking system that follows how each article gets republished across aggregators, newswires, and regional outlets, and evaluates which initial placements trigger the strongest “tails.” This helps Outset prioritize media that generate longer chains of coverage, not isolated mentions. They back this up with campaign results: for example, traffic-focused content helped Step App grow user acquisition and engagement while contributing to a 138% increase in the FITFI token price. Long-term work for ChangeNOW, Choise.ai, GoMining, and others shows the same emphasis on tangible outcomes — audience growth, token and ecosystem visibility, and sustained presence in both media and AI-driven discovery — rather than vanity metrics. Outset PR are best for Data-led campaigns for token ecosystems, exchanges, DeFi/CeDeFi, and infrastructure projects Syndication-focused PR that tracks how stories travel through the crypto media landscape AI-informed visibility strategy that blends PR with search and content distribution 2. Coinbound – PR with a Heavy Influencer & Community Component Who they are Coinbound is a crypto and Web3 marketing agency that combines PR, influencer marketing, social media, and community growth. The firm emphasizes scale, with contacts at major crypto publishers and a broad network of creators across X, YouTube, TikTok, and more. Industry round-ups often list Coinbound among the top crypto PR agencies, noting that it works with a large share of the top-market-cap crypto companies. How they work Coinbound leans on multi-channel reach: PR campaigns that secure organic coverage from big crypto media and data platforms (CoinTelegraph, Decrypt, and others), supported by tailored pitches and announcements. Influencer marketing programs that coordinate dozens of Web3 voices for product launches, token listings, and NFT/GameFi campaigns. Social and community management on Discord, Telegram, and X, so coverage connects to ongoing conversation rather than one-off spikes. What they do well Turning launches into combined PR + influencer pushes Building and energizing communities through ongoing content and campaigns Supporting teams that want one partner to coordinate several growth channels Best for Projects that view PR as part of a wider growth engine (social + influencers + content) NFT, GameFi, and consumer-facing products that benefit from KOL amplification Teams comfortable measuring success in social and community metrics as well as coverage 3. YAP Global – Story-First PR for Crypto, DeFi, and Web3 Who they are YAP Global is an international public relations and communications consultancy serving cryptocurrency, DeFi, and Web3 companies. Their positioning centers on storytelling: “We tell stories, build trust,” and on bridging quality journalism with emerging technologies. The firm operates with a distributed team across Europe and Asia, and is frequently described by partners as a Web3-native PR agency with strong journalism roots. How they work YAP Global focuses heavily on: Narrative development – turning complex DeFi and infrastructure products into clear angles that generalist journalists can use; Media relations with a journalistic lens – many team members have editorial backgrounds, which helps position clients in ongoing industry conversations rather than isolated announcements; Conference-aligned PR – partnering with major Web3 events and using them as anchors for interviews, bylines, and speaking-driven coverage. What they do well Making complex protocols and infrastructure understandable without oversimplifying Building long-term stories around teams and ecosystems, not only single campaigns Providing a bridge between crypto-native and mainstream tech/finance media Best for DeFi, L2/L3, and infrastructure projects that need clear explanations for non-specialists Teams who want thoughtful, editorial-quality coverage rather than volume Founders aiming to become recognizable expert voices in their segment 4. Melrose PR – Onchain Communications with Bitcoin & Fintech Depth Who they are Melrose PR is an onchain communications firm that focuses on Bitcoin, crypto, and financial-technology companies. The agency has operated in the space for many years and is often highlighted as one of the more experienced, crypto-exclusive PR shops. Recent profiles and awards note their work with tier-1 projects such as Chainlink, Avalanche, and Polkadot, as well as campaigns for major Bitcoin conferences. How they work Melrose PR’s approach emphasizes: Long-term communications programs – ongoing campaigns that support brand visibility, thought leadership, and reputation across cycles; Deep understanding of the crypto media landscape, especially Bitcoin and infrastructure-focused outlets; Bridging crypto and traditional finance – positioning clients in both specialized Web3 media and broader fintech/finance press. Testimonials highlight campaigns that deliver mainstream coverage for Bitcoin events and infrastructure projects, along with advisory support for messaging and positioning. What they do well Supporting Bitcoin- and infra-oriented brands with focused expertise Combining narrative work, media relations, and thought leadership across long timeframes Helping teams appear in both crypto and financial-sector media Best for Bitcoin ecosystems, exchanges, and infrastructure companies Web3 projects that want fintech-style communications and credibility Teams with multi-year roadmaps who want consistent messaging support 5. X10 Agency – Launch-Focused Web3 PR with Modular “Blocks” of Work Who they are X10 Agency is a full-service Web3 marketing and PR shop that covers most of what a crypto founder needs around a launch: PR outreach, influencer/KOL campaigns, community management, paid acquisition, exchange listing support, and even polishing whitepapers and tokenomics. Instead of a single fixed retainer, X10 is structured around modular “blocks” of work. Teams can pick short sprints for a TGE or IDO, or assemble multi-phase growth programs under one umbrella, which cuts down the number of different vendors you have to coordinate. How they work X10 leans on three main strengths: A large KOL and influencer network that can be switched on quickly for launch-heavy campaigns across DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, and token projects. Turnkey launch support, where PR, listings, and growth tactics are scoped together instead of as separate, unaligned services. Category-specific playbooks tuned to different Web3 niches, so a DeFi protocol, an NFT collection, and a GameFi project aren’t treated with the same generic plan. What they do well Running event- and launch-driven campaigns where timing and speed matter Coordinating PR + influencers + community inside one project plan Giving founders a menu of blocks they can sequence as the roadmap evolves Best for Teams planning token events (TGE/IDO/IEO) and wanting an “all-in-one” launch partner Projects that rely heavily on KOLs and community buzz alongside PR Founders who prefer one accountable agency instead of juggling multiple small providers Wrapping Up: Matching Agency Strengths to Your Needs There isn’t one crypto PR agency that fits every Web3 project; each of these firms shines in a different lane: Outset PR – outcome-oriented, data-led PR with a strong focus on syndication behavior, measurable traffic, and search/AI visibility. Coinbound – PR combined with influencer and community growth, suited to teams that see marketing and PR as one integrated growth engine. YAP Global – story-first, journalism-aware PR that makes complex DeFi and infrastructure projects understandable and credible. Melrose PR – an onchain communications specialist with deep roots in Bitcoin, infrastructure, and fintech-style messaging. X10 Agency – launch-focused Web3 PR and marketing with modular “blocks” of work, strong in token events and KOL-heavy campaigns. The real question isn’t “Who’s the best?” but “What do we need PR to do right now?” Once you’re clear on whether you’re optimizing for launch momentum, sustained storytelling, reputation, or measurable visibility, it becomes much easier to choose a partner. The right agency will plug into those goals, show proof they’ve done it before, and give you a way to measure progress—so PR becomes leverage, not just another expense line.

Arun Sai of Pictet Asset Management called the run extreme, saying, “By any measure, that’s an eye-watering few months.” He added that the AI story now centers on memory as the main bottleneck in long-term capital spending. The rally picked up again after Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said “holding the working memory of the world’s AIs” could soon become “the largest storage market in the world.” His comments pushed more money into the sector as traders reassessed what limits AI growth. Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung dominate the supply of fast solid-state chips that feed Nvidia processors. These chips keep large AI systems running, including models behind ChatGPT. As AI tools grew more advanced, data usage exploded. That surge lifted demand for flash products sold by SanDisk and similar firms. Because this type of memory costs more, demand spilled into older systems too. Western Digital and Seagate saw stronger interest in magnetic hard drives as buyers looked for cheaper ways to store rising data volumes. Rene Haas of Arm said demand had jumped fast. “The use for this high-bandwidth memory has just exploded,” he said in Davos, calling demand “an insatiable need.” Investors rotate as hedge funds lock in gains Manufacturers remain cautious. The memory market swings between shortage and surplus every few years. New factories cost billions and take years. Companies are holding back, even as demand runs hot. That restraint tightened supply further. Richard Clode of Janus Henderson compared it to raw materials. “Like any other commodity, you end up with pricing just going berserk,” he said. Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies expects shortages to last until “2028 at least.” The investor shift comes as the megacap rally lost steam. The S&P 500 surge slowed after a mid-November sell-off tied to valuation fears and heavy spending. Nvidia still trades 11 per cent below its October peak, despite becoming the world’s first $5tn company last year. Among hyperscalers like Oracle, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon, only Alphabet reached new highs since November. Sai said the market changed tone. “The AI trade is no longer just about holding a basket of exposed names. The market has turned more discerning between winners and losers.” Hedge fund filings show aggressive bets on the memory theme. DE Shaw raised its stakes in SanDisk, Micron, Seagate, and Western Digital last quarter. Holding those positions through today would have delivered about $3.9bn in gains. Arrowstreet added SanDisk and Seagate and would have earned $1.3bn. Renaissance Technologies doubled its SanDisk position and raised Western Digital holdings fivefold, booking roughly $435mn if held.

57460688,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/clapp-launches-crypto-credit-line-with-0-interest-on-unused-funds,1769361876,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/57460688.jpeg,Clapp Launches Crypto Credit Line With 0% Interest on Unused Funds,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2026/01/clapp-launches-crypto-credit-line-with-0-interest-on-unused-funds,"Clapp has recently introduced a crypto-backed credit line that allows users to borrow against Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) while paying 0% interest on unused funds. The product is designed to give crypto holders access to on-demand liquidity without incurring costs until capital is actually deployed. Unlike traditional crypto loans that accrue interest from the moment a loan is issued, Clapp’s offering is structured as a revolving credit line. Users are approved for a borrowing limit based on the value of their BTC or ETH collateral, but interest applies only to the portion of funds they choose to use. Credit Line Structure and Interest Mechanics Once BTC or ETH is deposited, Clapp assigns a credit limit linked to the collateral’s market value. Users may draw from this limit at any time, in full or in part, and repay without a fixed schedule. As borrowed funds are repaid, the available credit is restored automatically. Under this model, unused credit carries a 0% interest rate . Borrowing costs begin only when funds are withdrawn and are calculated based on loan-to-value (LTV). Keeping LTV below 20% helps maintain low borrowing costs and reduces exposure to market volatility. Clapp stated that the structure is intended to separate access to liquidity from borrowing itself, allowing users to avoid paying for capital they do not actively use. Focus on Risk Control and Transparency BTC and ETH price volatility makes LTV management a central consideration in crypto lending. By tying interest to utilization rather than approval size, Clapp’s model encourages conservative borrowing and clearer cost expectations. Lower LTV levels provide: Greater buffer against price movements Reduced liquidation risk More predictable borrowing costs Interest stops accruing immediately once borrowed funds are repaid, while unused credit remains interest-free. Flexible Repayment Model The credit line does not have a fixed maturity date. Users may repay partially or fully at any time, without penalties. This flexibility positions the product for short-term or intermittent liquidity needs rather than long-term leverage. Clarifying the “0% Interest” Condition Clapp emphasized that the 0% interest condition applies specifically to unused credit, not to funds already borrowed. Borrowed amounts accrue interest based on LTV, reflecting actual risk exposure. This distinction is intended to ensure transparency and avoid common misconceptions around zero-interest crypto loans. About Clapp Clapp is a digital assets platform that combines investing, swapping, holding, lending, and interest accrual in a single application. The platform provides users with access to crypto-backed credit lines, asset management tools, and yield-generating features designed for flexible capital use. Clapp operates as a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). User funds are secured through Fireblocks, which provides institutional-grade custody and transaction infrastructure.

Prime Minister Takaichi Sanae said action was on the table if trading turns speculative and abnormal, a line that immediately changed market behavior after weeks of one‑way positioning. Tension spiked late Friday during US trading when dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reached out to financial institutions to ask about the yen exchange rate. That single move was enough to rattle positions. Japan’s top currency official had already refused earlier that day to say whether Tokyo had carried out its own rate check, keeping markets guessing and pushing volatility higher into the close. US rate checks jolt FX desks and squeeze short positions Talk of intervention gathered pace after reports of the New York Fed’s calls circulated across trading floors. Michael Brown at Pepperstone said rate checks are usually the final warning before action and added that the Takaichi administration shows far less patience for speculative FX moves than past governments. That message landed fast. Traders who had built heavy short exposure were forced to rethink. Short positions linked to the yen had grown to their largest level in more than ten years. As the week ended, the currency swung sharply. It reversed a drop toward levels last seen in 2024 and surged as much as 1.75 percent to 155.63 per dollar. That move marked the biggest one‑day gain since August and left many positions underwater. Takaichi addressed the issue directly on Sunday during a televised debate with party leaders. She said it was not her role to comment on matters decided by markets but stressed that all necessary steps would be taken to deal with speculative and highly abnormal moves. She did not name a specific market, but officials in recent days have flagged risks tied to bond yields as well as the yen. Long‑dated Japanese government bonds had already sent warning signs. Yields on the longest maturities jumped to record highs early last week before pulling back, adding pressure on policymakers as currency swings and debt costs collided. Nick Twidale of AT Global Markets said traders should stay cautious at the Monday open after Takaichi’s comments. He said Japan’s currency could trade near 155 per dollar at the start of the week, a level now watched closely after last week’s violent reversal. Election pressure and US coordination reshape intervention risks The rebound began soon after Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda wrapped up his post‑decision press conference on Friday. Hours later, finance ministry official Atsushi Mimura declined to say whether authorities had stepped in to support the yen, keeping the door wide open to speculation. Gains accelerated through the US session as Wall Street interpreted the rate checks as groundwork for possible intervention, with some traders even pricing in the chance of US participation. Twidale said the market still wants to stay short but will tread carefully given the official warnings. He added that any confirmed US involvement would have effects far beyond the yen, spilling into global markets. Some traders drew comparisons to the Plaza Accord of 1985, when major economies coordinated to weaken the dollar. Debate around fixing imbalances tied to persistent dollar strength had already surfaced more than a year ago, making the idea less far‑fetched. The US has stepped into currency markets only three times since 1996, according to New York Fed data. The last case came in 2011, when G7 nations sold the yen together after Japan’s earthquake to stabilize trading. Anthony Doyle at Pinnacle Investment Management said Japan cannot fix the yen alone without risking domestic strain or global fallout, which makes coordination more realistic. He said calls from the US Treasury usually signal the story has moved beyond normal FX noise. Tokyo has history here. The government spent nearly $100 billion buying the yen in 2024. Each of the four interventions happened near 160 per dollar, turning that level into an informal trigger point. Homin Lee at Lombard Odier said real action is required if authorities want to anchor USD/JPY and noted that joint steps by Japan and the US would stand out as unusually direct coordination. Lee added that 160 is a clean number that cuts through political noise ahead of Japan’s snap lower‑house election in February. Japan votes on Feb. 8, and Takaichi’s pledge to cut food taxes has already shaken the debt market. The 40‑year bond yield jumped past 4 percent, a level not seen since its 2007 launch and a first for any sovereign maturity in more than thirty years.

Despite this, the coin faces uncertainties and volatility like all other cryptocurrencies. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores its expected movements from 2026 to 2032 while considering the past performance. However, this is not investment advice, and one must conduct their own research before taking any investment decision according to their risk tolerance. Why is TAO down? TAO is down primarily due to selling pressure from traders following a solid bullish trend due to strong market sentiment surrounding speculative AI tokens and the AI industry at large. However, recent resistance near key support levels also played a role in the continuation of the bearish trend during the past week, as the token’s price has decreased today.

Bittensor (TAO) historic price sentiment TAO price history by Coingecko TAO launched on March 6, 2023, at $93.4, but fell below its opening price within a week, sliding into the $76 range. By early April, it had lost half its value, dropping to $47, and continued downward to its $30.83 low in May before slowly recovering to $63 by the end of the month. The token climbed to $86.18 in July, just under its launch price, then pulled back again and traded near $54 through October. Momentum returned in November, pushing TAO into the $95 range, showing continuous improvement, and then sharply to a peak of $379 on December 15, 2023. TAO trended downward into early 2024 but surged to its all-time high of $757.60 in March. It quickly corrected to $522 in April and continued weakening through mid-year, reaching $216 in July. A brief rebound to $357 faded again as the token slipped back toward the mid-$200s by late summer, as per the crypto market price history records. Momentum returned in October, pushing TAO into the $660 range before cooling to $468. It climbed once more to $679 in November but ultimately closed 2024 at $440.69, as the broader crypto market turned bearish again. TAO opened in 2025 at $439.73, peaked at $565 in January, and its price decreased to the $324 level in February, taking down the token’s market capitalization as the technical indicators turned bearish due to some fundamental factors. In March, TAO dipped to the $259 mark and descended further to $228 in April; however, in May, it recovered to $467 as the Bittensor market revived. In October, TAO observed its year’s lowest prices extending toward $200.44. TAO opened trading in November at $506, lost 46% of its value, and closed the month at $269.11, while at the start of December, the coin was trading between $256.29 and $298.90.

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday, claims the bank targeted him and his companies intentionally. This legal attack comes straight from the top. Trump, who returned to the White House in 2025, is now going directly after the same financial giants that were once seen as winners under his deregulation plans. This isn’t his first complaint. Trump has warned for years that major banks are cutting off conservatives . He’s finally doing something about it. His lawyers argue this is political targeting. The bank says that’s not true. In a statement, JPMorgan said, “We believe the suit has no merit. We respect the President’s right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves. JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons.” Trump hits JPMorgan, Capital One, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs The fight isn’t just with one bank. Trump’s company is also suing Capital One, claiming the bank closed its accounts for political reasons. On top of that, he went after Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, saying they refused to give him an account. He even blasted Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon last year for the bank’s view on tariffs. Back in 2018, Jamie Dimon told a panel he “could beat Trump” in an election because he was “as tough” and “smarter.” He took it back almost immediately. Trump didn’t let it slide. He called Dimon “a poor public speaker and a nervous mess” online. The tension has never really faded. These days, Dimon chooses his words carefully. In Davos, he said he agreed with some of Trump’s policies, disagreed with others, and stayed quiet when asked why CEOs don’t challenge the president more. But that didn’t stop him from criticizing Trump’s idea to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. On a call, he said it would hit subprime borrowers “dramatically.” He also warned against launching a criminal probe into Jerome Powell, calling it “not a good idea.” Trump fired back at Dimon. “Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates. Maybe he makes more money that way,” he told reporters on January 15. Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, defended the administration’s direction. “The Trump administration is delivering by shoring up financial markets and cutting unnecessary red tape to accelerate growth,” he said. Banks increase lobbying while waiting for $200B capital boost Even with lawsuits coming at them, the biggest banks still expect big wins. Federal regulators under Trump are preparing to release up to $200 billion in capital relief. That means more room to lend, invest, and approve big mergers. The banks are also happy that regulators are loosening up supervision rules. But behind the scenes, these banks are spending big to protect their turf. In the fourth quarter of 2025, the top eight lenders dropped nearly $12 million on lobbying, a 40% increase from the same time in 2024. They’re sending teams to Congress, the White House, and every major agency that touches banking rules. They want influence over everything from swipe fees to crypto regulation. They’ve also backed a new group called the American Growth Alliance, set up in December by the Financial Services Forum. The group plans to spend tens of millions pushing for what they call “commonsense” growth policies. Still, the industry feels under pressure. Todd Baker, a fellow at Columbia University, said, “The industry is losing as many battles as it wins on big issues, and the constant pressure and random nature of developments is taking its toll.” Nicholas Anthony, from the Cato Institute, added , “Banks probably will be more cautious moving forward after seeing this reaction, seeing that they’re no longer just under threat of regulatory retaliation but also lawsuits.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

People scan a QR code, pay from a phone, and the merchant gets paid. According to local reports, owners are trying this out to cut the cost of credit card processing and to attract customers who prefer crypto. Merchants Cut Costs With Bitcoin Reports say the move is largely about fees. Credit card processing often takes away 2.5–3.5% of a sale. For many small operators, that is painful. Payment tools that accept Bitcoin — often routed over the Lightning Network or through services that can convert crypto to cash — have lowered that burden for merchants. According to FOX5, more businesses across Las Vegas are now accepting Bitcoin payments, from chains like Steak ’n Shake to small shops and medical practices. Merchants said Bitcoin helps attract new customers and cut costs, while Square has enabled about 4 million U.S. merchants… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 24, 2026 Square’s program, which lets millions of US merchants enable Bitcoin checkout with no processing fee through 2026, helped speed up adoption in the area. Stores Report Real Transactions Business owners are reporting real use , not just experiments. Juice stands and cafes have processed payments. Some larger outlets are listed on public payment maps so customers can find them. This has meant more foot traffic from people who travel with crypto or who prefer to keep their cards for other uses. Reports note both new customers and savings on fees as clear benefits. Lightning Network Speeds Up Payments The Lightning Network is being used to make payments faster and cheaper at the cash register. It moves small Bitcoin payments quickly without the long wait a base-layer transfer can cause. Merchants scan a code or show one on a screen. The payment is then sent from the buyer’s wallet and settled almost instantly. This technical fix has made in-person Bitcoin payments workable for the first time at many spots. How Owners See It Owners are balancing savings against new risks. Some keep crypto for a short time, then sell it for cash. Others leave part of their receipts in Bitcoin. Chargebacks, a problem with cards, are reduced when crypto is used. A few places say small boosts in sales followed their switch to crypto, yet long-term patterns are still being watched. Reports have disclosed these mixed outcomes as part of a slow but clear shift. Customers Find New Ways To Pay Shoppers are adapting. Tourists who carry crypto find these spots useful. Locals who are curious try the method at least once. Payment apps and merchant directories make the process easier for everyone. For those who like simple steps, scanning a QR code and approving a payment on a phone works fine. For others it is a novelty that might stick.

Some winners dominate because they are priced at absolute rock-bottom levels. Others stay on top because they have proven they can weather any storm. This list reveals the four powerhouses traders are fighting over: BlockDAG for its insane presale potential, TRON for rock-solid liquidity, Cardano for the long-term visionaries, and Solana for its blistering network speed. If you are building a million-dollar watchlist, these are the only names you need to know today. 1) BlockDAG’s $0.001 Reset is Your Final Shot at Generational Wealth BlockDAG (BDAG) is crushing the competition with a simple, brilliant formula: keep the ironclad safety of Proof-of-Work but shatter the speed limits that cripple other chains. By fusing PoW with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, this beast processes blocks in parallel to hit a mind-blowing 100+ blocks per second. Plus, it is fully EVM-compatible, Ethereum developers can port their apps instantly! The presale stats are absolutely legendary. BlockDAG has already hauled in $445M+, and with only 2.3B coins left, the price has been reset to a final $0.001 flash offer! This is a ticking time bomb: the presale ends on 26 January 2026, and the listing is locked for 16 February 2026 at $0.05. That is a guaranteed 50x gap from today’s entry! Beyond the price, BlockDAG is launching the X1 mobile miner, a crypto payment card that burns supply, and elite mining rigs like the X10/X30/X100. Early forecasts even project a post-listing surge to $0.30–$0.43. For anyone hunting top performing cryptos, BlockDAG is the only high-velocity play that matters. 2) TRON (TRX) Still Rules as the King of Reliable Liquidity TRON (TRX) might be a veteran, but it is dominating the charts because it is incredibly liquid and reliable. It is the “go-to” coin for traders who want steady gains without the heart-stopping chaos. Right now, TRX is trading at approximately $0.32, commanding a massive market cap in the $29B–$30B range. Over the last few days, TRX has been flashing green while the rest of the market wobbles. That is critical, stable leaders like this become the “default refuge” when uncertainty hits. While it might not have the “new coin” smell of a presale, its consistency and massive trading volume make it an essential anchor. TRON is the silent powerhouse that stays in the room and keeps your portfolio moving forward, earning its permanent title among the top performing cryptos . 3) Cardano (ADA) is the Patient Millionaire’s Secret Bet Cardano (ADA) is the project for those who value substance over hype. It doesn’t need to scream for attention because it has a fiercely loyal community and a world-class developer culture. As of January 18, 2026, ADA is hovering around the $0.396–$0.40 mark. While it has been moving sideways lately, don’t mistake that for weakness. Experienced traders know this “quiet zone” usually precedes a massive breakout. Cardano is a master of the surprise rally, often exploding when the rest of the altcoin market is just starting to wake up. When you talk about top performing cryptos , ADA is the perfect balance, a stable, large-cap anchor that protects you from the wild dumps seen in smaller projects. It is the ultimate watchlist foundation. 4) Solana (SOL) Wears the “Speed King” Crown in 2026 Solana (SOL) remains a top-tier predator because it combines raw speed with massive real-world usage. It is one of the few chains that can cool off and then rebuild its strength with terrifying efficiency. Right now, SOL is trading at $142, with a market cap sitting at a staggering $80.5B as of January 18, 2026. The charts show SOL consolidating in the mid-$140s, a classic signal that it is gearing up for another legendary run. Solana moves fast once it starts trending, and when it runs, it pulls the entire altcoin market up with it. For those who want the safety of a “blue chip” combined with enough volatility to deliver serious profits, Solana is unbeatable. If the market turns “risk-on,” SOL is the first name every pro trader grabs. Lock in Presale Gold & Proven Giants Now! A winning portfolio needs two things: a high-reward entry with a firm launch date and established giants that preserve your wealth. This mix gives you both. BlockDAG is your high-upside miracle, with the $0.001 window closing on January 26 and the February 16 listing at $0.05. TRON, Cardano, and Solana provide the market strength that new coins just can’t touch. With TRX steady at $0.32, ADA holding firm near $0.40, and SOL looking strong at $142, your path to profit is clear. If you want to own the top performing cryptos , this mix is your ultimate blueprint for success! Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

Analyst Predicts $31K Bottom In 2026,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-bitcoin-supercycle-truly-on-the-horizon/,"The calls of a potential Bitcoin supercycle in 2026 intensified over the past week after former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao — yet another prominent voice in crypto — laid out his predictions for the new year. However, a popular analyst on the social media platform X has released an opposing view, predicting a deep bottom for the BTC price this year. BTC Price At Risk Of Further 65% Decline In a January 25th post on the X platform, prominent crypto trader Ali Martinez said, in a sarcastic tone, that “the super cycle is super cycling.” In what seemed like a response to the buzz around CZ’s Bitcoin supercycle projection, the market pundit tempered the expectations with a $31,000 price bottom call for the premier cryptocurrency in 2026. This bearish prediction is based on the appearance of price fractals on the BTC chart. For context, fractals are repeating patterns in price charts that can help map and project potential price movements for a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Related Reading: Gold Becomes The Whale Safe Haven As Bitcoin Takes A Back Seat As observed in the chart above, the price of BTC is currently following a similar movement pattern as in 2022. The premier cryptocurrency, after initially setting a then all-time high around $67,000 in early 2021, witnessed a nearly 55% correction to just above the $30,000 level by mid-July. While the price of Bitcoin recovered and went back to set a record high of above $69,000 by the end of 2021, the market leader spent the majority of the following year in a downward trend. Exacerbated by the various bearish events of 2022, BTC ended the year at a low of around $15,500. Martinez believes that the Bitcoin price is undergoing a similar movement pattern, having experienced an over 32% decline before climbing to the current all-time high of $126,080. The market pundit postulates that the premier cryptocurrency is currently witnessing the extended decline that saw its price reach $15,500 in 2022. However, it is worth mentioning that the target this time around lies at $31,800, nearly 65% drop from the current price point. Hence, if the historical patterns highlighted by Martinez are to go by, there seems to be a higher likelihood of the Bitcoin price embarking on an extended downward trend rather than a supercycle. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $88,528, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

The meme coin's decline reflects broader weakness across digital assets as investors pull back from risk amid geopolitical tensions and uncertainty surrounding upcoming Federal Reserve policy decisions. The token fell 2.41% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume plummeting 44% to $426 million. Market analysts point to deteriorating sentiment across altcoins as institutional and retail traders alike rotate capital away from speculative assets. Macro Headwinds Trigger Risk-Off Sentiment The cryptocurrency sector faced renewed selling pressure over the weekend as traditional markets grappled with escalating trade tensions. Bitcoin declined to $88,700 while Ethereum dropped to $2,930, dragging smaller-cap digital assets lower. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian goods has intensified concerns about global trade stability. The announcement sent shockwaves through financial markets, prompting investors to reduce exposure to volatile assets. Traders are now focused on the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision scheduled for January 28. Expectations of hawkish commentary from central bank officials have dampened enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies and other growth-oriented investments. The combination of trade war fears and monetary policy uncertainty has created an unfavorable environment for digital assets. Dogecoin, known for its high volatility and speculative nature, has been particularly vulnerable to the shift in market dynamics. Cryptocurrency strategists note that macroeconomic instability typically reduces appetite for high-beta assets. Safe-haven instruments have attracted significant inflows as investors seek to preserve capital during periods of heightened uncertainty. Technical Indicators Point to Further Weakness Dogecoin currently trades below its 30-day average price of $0.134, signaling sustained bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index sits at 38.61, indicating downward pressure without reaching oversold territory. The MACD histogram remains negative at -0.0018943, confirming the continuation of the downtrend. Price action has formed a pattern of lower highs and lower lows, suggesting additional downside risk in the near term. Technical analysts identify $0.116 as the next potential support level based on recent swing lows. The absence of significant buying interest at current prices indicates limited conviction among market participants. Chart patterns show no clear reversal signals, leaving bears in control of short-term price direction. Volume analysis reveals thinning liquidity, which could amplify price movements in either direction.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 18:01:18

Instead, they surface as carefully framed visions of the future, offered by leaders who shape markets long before narratives reach the public. That dynamic played out at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where remarks from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink quietly reignited debate across the digital asset space. In an X post that quickly gained traction, X Finance Bull drew attention to how Fink’s Davos commentary appeared to echo the long-standing framework behind XRP and the XRP Ledger. While no digital asset received a direct mention, the substance of the message resonated strongly with those familiar with Ripple’s decade-long strategy. Larry Fink’s Vision for Financial Markets During the discussion, Fink emphasized the urgency of tokenization and digitization across global finance. He argued that moving assets onto tokenized platforms would reduce fees, increase transparency, and expand access to investments. According to Fink, this shift would democratize finance by allowing investors to move seamlessly between asset classes. BlackRock CEO at Davos gave you the entire $XRP thesis without mentioning XRP Let me translate what Larry Fink said: ""One unified blockchain."" → XRP Ledger ""Every asset tokenized."" → RWA on XRPL ""Fractionalized ownership."" → Already live ""Programmable and… pic.twitter.com/FoQAcCguUn — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) January 24, 2026 He also highlighted Brazil and India as leaders in currency digitization, reinforcing the idea that emerging markets already recognize the efficiency gains of blockchain-based systems. Fink stressed that a fully tokenized financial system could reduce corruption while improving settlement speed and operational security. The Case for a Unified Blockchain One of Fink’s most striking points centered on the concept of a single, common blockchain. He described a platform where tokenized money market funds, equities, and bonds could move back and forth instantly. In his view, shared infrastructure would process transactions more securely than fragmented legacy systems, even while acknowledging the need to manage concentration risks. This vision aligns closely with the architecture of the XRP Ledger , which already supports fast settlement, low transaction costs, and the tokenization of real-world assets. Fractionalized ownership and programmable transfers already operate on the network today. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the XRP Narrative Is Shifting For years, XRP sat outside institutional favor, first ignored and later constrained by regulatory uncertainty. That phase has now passed. As major financial players increasingly discuss tokenization, interoperability, and instant settlement, the conversation has moved closer to XRP’s original design goals . The significance lies not in name recognition, but in conceptual alignment. When the world’s largest asset manager outlines a system that mirrors XRP’s core functionality, it signals a broader acceptance of the underlying model. Institutional Strategy and Market Timing BlackRock oversees roughly $10 trillion in assets and rarely telegraphs its moves. Historically, the firm accumulates exposure quietly and allows narratives to catch up later. This pattern has led many observers to believe that institutions are already positioned for a tokenized future while retail investors debate short-term charts. Whether or not XRP becomes the centerpiece of that future, Larry Fink’s comments confirm one reality: the financial system is moving toward the exact architecture XRP was built to support.

Brian Armstrong, the CEO of the leading exchange Coinbase, shared on X that tokenization was an important topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He also stated that crypto leaders are devoted to making the CLARITY Act a win for consumers. Global banks are pivoting towards crypto After a week of high-level meetings at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong shared a series of updates on the social media platform, X. During the event, Armstrong met with various world leaders and Fortune 500 CEOs. In one specific meeting, a CEO of a top 10 global bank told Armstrong that cryptocurrency is now their top priority. This executive described the technology as “existential.” Armstrong highlighted that the Trump administration is actively working to create a “crypto hub” in the U.S. by passing the CLARITY Act. Investors and tech leaders have frequently questioned whether the U.S. can move fast enough to beat international competition. Armstrong stated that the current administration is committed to getting “market structure done, and done correctly.” China and several other nations are making rapid progress with their own stablecoin projects and digital currencies. To remain competitive, U.S. officials are meeting with industry leaders in both Washington, D.C., and Davos to finalize drafts of the law. Armstrong mentioned that most bank CEOs he spoke with are “pro-crypto” and see the new regulations as an opportunity rather than a hurdle. Recent reports from Washington suggest that the focus on “stablecoin clarity” is a priority for both parties. Lawmakers want to ensure that the U.S. dollar remains the primary currency used in digital trade, and so they hope to bring “money back into people’s pockets” and attract the world’s leading blockchain developers. Why are global banks and AI developers turning to stablecoins? Armstrong also observed that AI and crypto were the two most discussed technologies at the forum. He stated that they are “highly complementary” because of how modern software operates. As AI agents become more common, they will need a way to pay for services, as they cannot go to a bank, an account and pass traditional “Know Your Customer” (KYC) checks like a human. Armstrong explained that these agents will likely use stablecoins as their default payment method. The infrastructure for this already exists, and the usage is growing quickly. Financial leaders are looking to turn every asset class into digital tokens on a blockchain. Armstrong predicts that this will democratize investments for 4 billion adults called the “unbrokered” who currently lack access to traditional brokerage accounts. Coinbase and Circle recently announced a partnership with the government of Bermuda to build a fully digital economy that other nations can eventually copy. Under the influence of new WEF co-chair Larry Fink, the focus of the forum in Davos has shifted away from ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) toward “real, global progress” and technological productivity.

It is usually only after pricing data, audits and roadmap execution become visible that serious attention arrives. A similar pattern is forming around one new crypto that has quietly appreciated 300% since 2025. Analysts who track early-stage DeFi assets say the project is now entering the post-visibility stage where price projections begin to form based on upcoming utility rather than pure narrative. Presale Data Shows Steady Investor Participation The cryptocurrency in question is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . MUTM presale began in early 2025 with a starting price of $0.01. The current presale price sits at $0.04, marking a 300% appreciation for the earliest participants. The project has now raised $19.9M while onboarding 18,900 investors. From the 4B supply, 1.82B tokens or 45.5% have been allocated for early access, and 830M tokens have been sold. Mutuum Finance is now moving through Phase 7 of its presale with more than 6% of the phase already allocated. The launch price is set at $0.06, which positions current buyers at a discount to expected listing value according to the project’s pricing schedule. Market observers note that late presale phases often accelerate as more data becomes public, because valuation uncertainty decreases while pricing remains below launch levels. What Mutuum Finance Is Building Mutuum Finance is developing a decentralized lending platform that allows users to supply assets for APY and open collateralized borrowing positions using digital collateral. The platform routes both supply and borrowing into a unified revenue system. Borrowers generate fees that go to the protocol, while suppliers receive mtTokens that track their position and payout rate. mtTokens can also be staked in the safety module, where users earn MUTM purchased from the open market. A portion of protocol revenue funds those purchases. This buy-and-redistribute model introduces a direct link between borrowing activity and token demand. Analysts like this design because it connects token performance to protocol usage rather than short-term sentiment. Security has been a strong part of the project’s roadmap. Mutuum Finance completed a full audit with Halborn Security and holds a 90 out of 100 token scan score from CertiK. For a lending protocol that deals with collateral and liquidation logic, external audits are considered essential by industry researchers. Stablecoin, Oracles and Analyst Price Models Mutuum Finance also plans to issue an overcollateralized stablecoin that allows users to borrow without selling their assets. Stablecoin borrowers tend to be longer-duration users, which increases revenue visibility for the protocol and helps stabilize APY payout schedules. Layer-2 expansion is also on the roadmap to reduce fees and attract users who avoid higher gas costs on Ethereum Mainnet. The protocol will rely on oracles to feed price data into collateral and liquidation systems. Oracle feeds are considered critical for lending platforms since inaccurate prices can trigger forced liquidations during volatile markets. Some analysts believe that once V1 is released and the team successfully prepares the Mainnet rollout, the token could begin its first major repricing phase. Mainnet activation is expected to align with the official MUTM launch. Under that scenario, several analysts model MUTM in the $0.20 to $0.30 range during 2026. From the current $0.04 presale price, that would represent roughly a 400% to 650% increase under bullish conditions. Phase Progression and Whale Allocations Mutuum Finance has confirmed that its V1 protocol is scheduled for the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026 with ETH and USDT as the first supported assets. V1 will introduce collateral management, liquidation bots, debt tokens and mtToken accounting in a simulated environment before the Mainnet rollout. Phase 7 continues to advance quickly as more participants enter the presale. Reports of $100K whale allocations during 24-hour periods have appeared, alongside consistent leaderboard activity. The 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top buyer with $500 in MUTM, which has kept participation steady rather than clustered into single days. Whale activity is noteworthy because large buyers tend to wait for audits, development updates and payment access to be visible before entering. Their presence during later phases signals that the project has transitioned from narrative to validation. For investors asking what crypto to invest in for upcoming cycles, analysts say this discovery phase is often when valuation frameworks begin to form and when long-term positioning takes place.

Crypto Futures Liquidated: Dissecting the $129 Million Hour Data from leading derivatives analytics platforms confirms a concentrated liquidation event across top exchanges. Consequently, leveraged long and short positions faced automatic closure as prices moved against them. This one-hour figure contributes to a broader 24-hour liquidation total exceeding $395 million. Such events typically occur during rapid price movements, where traders using borrowed funds (leverage) cannot meet margin requirements. For instance, a sharp price drop can trigger mass liquidations of long positions, often exacerbating the downward move. Conversely, a rapid price surge can liquidate short sellers. This mechanism is a fundamental, yet high-risk, component of futures trading. The Mechanics and Triggers of Mass Liquidation Futures liquidation is an automated process enforced by exchanges to prevent trader losses from exceeding their collateral. When the market value of a position falls to a specific threshold—the liquidation price—the exchange closes it. A cascade begins when initial liquidations create selling or buying pressure, pushing prices toward other traders’ liquidation points. Several factors can trigger such a cascade. Firstly, unexpected macroeconomic news can spark rapid price discovery. Secondly, large “whale” orders can create immediate liquidity gaps. Thirdly, cascading liquidations themselves become the primary driver, creating a self-fulfilling feedback loop of volatility. Historical data shows these events cluster during periods of market uncertainty or after sustained trends. Expert Analysis on Market Structure and Risk Market analysts emphasize that liquidation events, while dramatic, reflect the inherent risks of leveraged derivatives trading. “Liquidation clusters are a stress test for market depth and exchange risk engines,” notes a veteran derivatives analyst from a major trading firm. “The $129 million figure, while significant, must be contextualized against the total open interest, which often measures in the tens of billions. The key metric is the speed and concentration. A one-hour spike suggests a very specific catalyst or a critical leverage level being breached.” Furthermore, exchanges have continuously refined their liquidation engines to handle such spikes more smoothly, aiming to prevent the system-wide congestion seen in earlier market cycles. This evolution is critical for institutional adoption. Historical Context and Comparative Impact To understand the scale, we can compare this event to historical precedents. The May 2021 market downturn saw single-day liquidations surpass $10 billion. More recently, the FTX collapse in November 2022 triggered multi-billion dollar liquidation waves. The current $395 million 24-hour total, while substantial, indicates a severe but contained volatility episode rather than a systemic crisis. The table below provides a quick comparison of notable liquidation events: Date Approximate 24-Hour Liquidations Primary Catalyst May 19, 2021 $10+ Billion China regulatory crackdown, market euphoria unwind November 2022 $Multi-Billion FTX collapse and contagion fears March 21, 2025 $395 Million Rapid price movement & leveraged position unwind (Data as of report) This context is crucial for investors. It demonstrates that while disruptive, the current event operates on a different order of magnitude than past market crises. The market’s ability to absorb these liquidations without a complete breakdown shows increased resilience in infrastructure. Implications for Traders and the Broader Market The immediate effect of a liquidation cascade is a rapid increase in volatility and trading volume. For the broader spot market, this derivatives volatility can spill over, causing sharper price swings in underlying assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traders often monitor liquidation heatmaps, which visualize price levels with high concentrations of potential liquidations. These heatmaps act as a map of market vulnerability. For retail traders, such events are a stark reminder of the risks of high leverage. Key risk management practices include: Using lower leverage ratios to increase distance to liquidation price. Setting stop-loss orders independently of exchange liquidation engines. Continuously monitoring margin ratios , especially during high-volatility news events. Avoiding over-concentration in a single position or direction. Ultimately, these events contribute to market efficiency by forcibly closing unsustainable positions, but they also present clear dangers for unprepared participants. Conclusion The liquidation of $129 million in crypto futures within one hour underscores the volatile and interconnected nature of digital asset derivatives markets. This event, part of a larger $395 million 24-hour unwind, highlights the powerful feedback loops created by leveraged trading. While not unprecedented in scale, it serves as a critical real-time case study in market mechanics and risk management. Understanding the triggers and impacts of such liquidation events is essential for anyone participating in or analyzing the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As the market matures, the frequency and severity of these cascades may evolve, but their fundamental role in derivatives trading will remain a key area of focus for traders and analysts alike. FAQs Q1: What does “futures liquidated” mean? A futures liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because it has lost too much value and can no longer cover potential losses. This happens to protect the exchange from default. Q2: Why did $129 million get liquidated in one hour? Rapid price movement, likely triggered by news or large trades, pushed the value of many leveraged positions past their critical liquidation points. This created a cascade as each closure affected the price, triggering more. Q3: Does this mean the crypto market is crashing? Not necessarily. While significant, a $395 million 24-hour liquidation is a volatility event within a much larger market. Historical crashes have involved liquidations many times larger. It indicates high leverage and volatility, not necessarily a long-term trend reversal. Q4: Who loses money in a liquidation? The trader whose position is liquidated loses the collateral (margin) they posted to open that trade. The exchange sells or buys the assets to close the position, and any remaining debt in a worst-case scenario may be covered by exchange insurance funds. Q5: How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can use lower leverage, maintain higher margin balances, set prudent stop-loss orders, and avoid trading with excessive size during known periods of high volatility or major news events. Q6: Are liquidations bad for the overall market? They have a dual effect. In the short term, they increase volatility and can exacerbate price moves. In the longer term, they help clear out over-leveraged, unstable positions, which can contribute to a healthier and more stable market foundation.

According to real-time data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $86,936.01 on the Binance USDT perpetual futures market, marking a notable pullback from recent highs and prompting analysis from traders and institutions worldwide. This movement represents a pivotal moment in the current market cycle, inviting a deeper examination of the underlying factors and potential implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Bitcoin Price Drops Below Key Support Level The descent below $87,000 represents a breach of a significant support zone that market technicians had been watching closely. Consequently, this price action has triggered a wave of automated sell orders and liquidations across major derivatives exchanges. Furthermore, the move coincides with broader macroeconomic data releases, including the latest U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision and inflation figures. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated sensitivity to shifts in global liquidity conditions and risk appetite. For instance, the current trading environment mirrors patterns observed in previous cycles where consolidation phases preceded major directional moves. Market depth charts from Binance and Coinbase show thinning liquidity around the $87,000 mark, which may have accelerated the downward move. Contextualizing the Cryptocurrency Market Shift To understand this price movement, one must consider the broader market structure. Bitcoin had enjoyed a sustained rally throughout early 2025, largely driven by institutional adoption through spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and positive regulatory developments in several jurisdictions. However, markets rarely move in a straight line. Periodic corrections are a healthy and expected component of any financial asset’s price discovery process. The current pullback, while sharp, remains within the bounds of standard volatility for the asset class. Data from Glassnode, an on-chain analytics firm, indicates that the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric had recently entered the “Euphoria” zone, a historical precursor to profit-taking events. Simultaneously, exchange inflows saw a modest increase in the days preceding the drop, suggesting some holders moved to realize gains. Expert Analysis on Market Dynamics Leading analysts point to a confluence of technical and fundamental triggers. “While the break below $87,000 is technically significant, it’s crucial to assess volume and on-chain holder behavior,” notes a report from CryptoQuant. Their data shows that long-term holders, often called ‘HODLers,’ have not significantly increased selling pressure, suggesting this may be a derivatives-led correction rather than a fundamental shift in investor conviction. Additionally, funding rates on perpetual swap markets had turned excessively positive, creating a crowded long trade that became vulnerable to a squeeze. The table below summarizes key market metrics before and after the drop: Metric Pre-Drop (Approx.) Post-Drop (Current) BTC Price (Binance USDT) $88,450 $86,936 24h Trading Volume $42 Billion $68 Billion Fear & Greed Index 78 (Extreme Greed) 52 (Neutral) Open Interest (Aggregate) $38.5 Billion $35.2 Billion This data indicates a clear cooling of sentiment and a reduction in leveraged positions, which can help establish a healthier foundation for the next market phase. Historical Precedents and Volatility Patterns Bitcoin’s history is defined by its volatility. A drop of this magnitude, representing approximately a 1.7% decline from the $88,450 level, is well within its normal daily trading range. For perspective, during the 2021 bull market, intraday swings of 5-10% were not uncommon. The asset’s inherent volatility stems from its relatively young market structure, 24/7 global trading, and evolving regulatory landscape. However, its long-term trajectory has consistently been upward when viewed through a multi-year lens. Key support levels to watch now include the 50-day moving average, currently around $84,200, and the previous cycle high near $82,000, which could act as a strong consolidation zone if tested. The Impact on Altcoins and Market Sentiment Unsurprisingly, the decline in Bitcoin’s price has had a ripple effect across the altcoin market. Major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) have also seen declines, though their performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC dominance) will be a critical indicator of market health. A stable or rising BTC dominance during a pullback often signals that capital is rotating back into the perceived safety of the market leader, rather than fleeing the ecosystem entirely. Social media sentiment, as tracked by platforms like Santiment, shows a shift from ‘greed’ to ‘fear,’ which contrarian investors often view as a potential buying opportunity. Meanwhile, network fundamentals like hash rate and active addresses remain robust, indicating strong underlying utility. Conclusion The Bitcoin price falling below $87,000 serves as a stark reminder of the asset’s inherent volatility and the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. While the move triggers short-term concern, it aligns with historical patterns of consolidation after strong rallies. The key takeaways for investors involve monitoring on-chain data for holder conviction, watching key support levels for stability, and maintaining a perspective informed by Bitcoin’s decade-long history of recovering from drawdowns. Ultimately, this price action underscores the importance of risk management and a long-term, fundamentals-driven approach to cryptocurrency investment, rather than reactionary trading based on single data points. FAQs Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $87,000? The drop appears driven by a combination of technical factors, including the breach of a key support level triggering liquidations, high leverage in derivatives markets, and a natural profit-taking event after a sustained rally. Broader macroeconomic sentiment may also be a contributing factor. Q2: Is this a major crash or a normal correction? Based on historical volatility, a move of this size currently represents a normal market correction. It is significantly smaller than the drawdowns seen in previous bear markets and is consistent with healthy profit-taking within a bull market cycle. Q3: What are the key support levels to watch now? Analysts are watching the 50-day moving average (around $84,200) and the previous all-time high zone near $82,000. Holding these levels could indicate strong underlying demand and provide a base for future upward movement. Q4: How does this affect Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investment? Short-term price volatility is expected by most institutional investors. Long-term adoption trends for spot Bitcoin ETFs are more influenced by regulatory developments and macroeconomic conditions than daily price swings. Net flows into ETFs will be a critical metric to monitor in the coming days. Q5: Should I buy, sell, or hold during this dip? This is not financial advice. Investment decisions should be based on individual risk tolerance, investment horizon, and thorough research. Historically, disciplined dollar-cost averaging (DCA) has been an effective strategy for navigating Bitcoin’s volatility over the long term.

Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/chart-expert-when-ethereum-goes-xrp-will-go-harder-heres-why/,"In every market cycle, leadership shifts first on relative charts before it becomes obvious on price headlines. Traders who focus only on dollar pairs often miss these early signals, even though they usually determine where capital flows next. Right now, one relative chart has started to attract serious attention as it hints at a possible change in momentum between two of crypto’s largest assets. In a recent X post, CryptoBull pointed to the XRP/Ethereum weekly ratio chart as a key signal to watch. His analysis suggests that XRP may be positioning for relative strength, especially once Ethereum resumes a decisive upside move. What the XRP/ETH Chart Is Signaling The XRP/ETH ratio measures XRP’s performance directly against Ethereum, stripping out broader market noise. Since early 2025, this pair has trended lower inside a clearly defined descending channel, reflecting sustained Ethereum outperformance over that period. #XRP vs Ethereum chart is bullish for XRP. When Ethereum goes, XRP will even go harder and outperform Ethereum. pic.twitter.com/DCsyQrL3DM — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) January 24, 2026 That structure now shows signs of stress. Recent weekly candlesticks have bounced firmly from the lower boundary of the channel near the 0.00065 level. This area has acted as long-term support, and repeated defenses of the same zone often indicate seller exhaustion. On higher timeframes, such reactions frequently precede trend shifts rather than continuation. At the time of reporting, the XRP/ETH ratio continues to trade around 0.00065, unchanged from the chart’s latest close. This stability reinforces short-term balance and suggests that downside momentum has weakened. Why Ethereum’s Direction Still Matters Relative outperformance requires a catalyst, and Ethereum often provides that spark. Historically, Ethereum rallies tend to pull liquidity into the broader altcoin market. However, assets that spent extended periods consolidating often react with greater intensity once conditions turn favorable. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 CryptoBull’s thesis rests on this dynamic. If Ethereum breaks higher and confirms bullish momentum, XRP could respond with a sharper relative move due to its compressed position near long-term support. In previous cycles, similar setups led to rapid XRP catch-up phases once ETH established direction. Structural Context Favors XRP From a technical perspective, descending channels rarely persist indefinitely. When price fails to produce new relative lows despite sustained pressure, probability begins to shift. The XRP/ETH pair’s inability to break below 0.00065 increases the likelihood of rotation rather than further decline. A reclaim of the channel’s mid-range would strengthen the bullish case and confirm that capital is rotating from Ethereum into XRP on a relative basis. Until that occurs, the setup remains constructive but unconfirmed. What This Means for Traders This analysis does not undermine Ethereum’s strength. Instead, it frames XRP as a potential high-beta beneficiary once ETH leads the next move higher. For traders tracking relative strength, the XRP/ETH chart now presents one of its most interesting structures in months, suggesting XRP may indeed go harder when Ethereum goes.

According to a new tweet from onchain sleuth ZachXBT, John is not just an opportunist who happens to know how to hack and has a deep grudge against the deep state. His name is reportedly John Daghita, and he is more of a nepo-baby who may just be abusing privileges from daddy dearest. Zach claims John’s father is Dean Daghita, the owner of CMDSS, a company that currently holds an active US government IT contract in Virginia. That contract specifically involves providing assistance to the US Marshals Service (USMS) by helping them manage and dispose of seized or forfeited crypto assets. It all sounds mundane at first, but it all comes together nicely when one takes into account the recent scandal linked to John Lick. The contract access his father’s company enjoys is thought to have helped John obtain some insider information or even direct access, which allowed him to steal from government-controlled wallets. According to Zach, it is still unclear how John may have gotten direct access. However, it is clear that he is linked to digital crimes that have seen millions vanish, and not just from government-controlled wallets. For now, there have been no public arrests or DOJ confirmations, but the onchain evidence has been making rounds across the Internet. Law enforcement could eventually intervene. John Lick Daghita’s flamboyant lifestyle outed him Up until two days ago, John Lick had avoided detection. He had over $20 million in crypto wallets. However, things started to unravel when he got into a heated argument with another threat actor known as Dritan Kapplani Jr. in a group chat to see who had more funds in crypto wallets. By the time the showoff session wrapped up, John had flaunted $23 million in total, moving the funds between wallets ZachXBT claims he clearly controls. After that, Zach began tracing backwards to verify the source of funds and found that one of the wallets, the 0xc7a2 wallet, had previously received $24.9 million from a U.S. government wallet back in March 2024. That transaction was linked to funds the government seized in the Bitfinex hack, and Zach had already flagged that same address in a post from October 2024. Another wallet was linked, the 0xd8bc wallet, which goes back to $63 million obtained from sketchy wallets during Q4 2025. John just enjoys showing off According to reports, it was only a matter of time before this happened, given how much John loves to show off. The Telegram account linked to him reportedly has a long history of bragging about his riches and brokeshaming people. His username is tied to TG ID 8269661864. After he was outed by Zach, he allegedly wiped out his NFT usernames and quickly changed his screen name, but the damage was already done. Zach later revealed that there are rumors circulating in cybercrime Telegram circles indicating John could be John Daghitia, who had previously been arrested in September 2025. He did concede that more research was needed to fully confirm it. Since he made the link between John and his father, Zach claims the CMDSS company X account, website, & LinkedIn were all deactivated, and John Daghita (Lick) began trolling again on Telegram shortly after.

This means that the asset has plunged by almost 25% since January 6, when it peaked at over $2.40. CryptoPotato reported earlier today that the latest uncertainty unravelling in the US, including the expected government shutdown, ongoing protests in some states, and tariff threats from the POTUS against Canada, has harmed the market. At the time, BTC had dipped to $87,500, but it continued its descent to a new 2026 low of just under $87,000. Bitcoin’s crash took the altcoins with it, leaving over $300 million worth of liquidations in the past four hours alone. XRP is no exception. The asset has dropped by 4.5% in the past 24 hours and more than 11% weekly. It slipped below $1.83 minutes ago, which became its lowest price tag since the start of the year. Following its latest retracement, XRP plunged to important levels, as flagged by popular analyst ERGAG CRYPTO. In a new post on X, they argued that $1.75 is the asset’s first key defense, which is close to being tested. This lower-range support could be pivotal in determining XRP’s short-term performance, as the analyst asked whether the next move is a “sweep and bounce or a breakdown” if that level is tapped. #XRP – Sweep & Bounce or Breakdown?

Just three weeks into 2026, markets are showing the same behavior as last year. Trump issues threats, stocks get shaky, things calm down after a few days, and shares start climbing again. The pattern has become routine for those tracking market swings. The Cboe Volatility Index, which measures fear in the market, shot up on Tuesday but quickly dropped back down. By Friday, it sat lower than where it started the previous week. The index’s futures ended the week looking almost the same as before. Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) one-month chart, Source: Cboe.com But behind the scenes, some traders were taking steps to protect themselves. They worried about two main things. Problems that could hurt Chinese stocks and the chance that big tech companies might report weak earnings. Investors snapped up around 400,000 put options set to expire in March for the iShares China Large-Cap ETF. They also grabbed 20,000 contracts in the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF and 150,000 puts in the Xtrackers Harvest CSI China A-Shares ETF. Put options let traders profit if prices fall or limit their losses. Christopher Jacobson works as co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. He said in a written note, seen by Bloomberg, that no clear reason drove these moves. The investors might just be getting ready for worse relations between the United States and China, especially after China criticized the recent trade agreement between America and Taiwan. Traders getting better at the TACO trade Market experts say investors have gotten better at handling what they call the TACO trade. This limits how high fear spikes and how long it lasts. Amy Wu Silverman heads derivatives strategy at RBC Capital Markets. She described Trump’s approach this way: “It seems very much like he’s playing this playbook of like, ‘I’m going to go in kind of mad dog style. No one really knows what I could do.’ And then you almost need the market to have a tantrum and then he will back off.” She added that when these bumps show up, they give good chances to bet against fear or reach for gains. Even serious global tensions have barely moved the fear gauge. Trump talked about the Greenland situation as a national security matter. China might use similar reasoning when discussing Taiwan. Antoine Bracq runs advisory services at Lighthouse Canton. He pointed out that “Markets appear increasingly desensitized to breaches of international laws — whether in Venezuela, Iran, or Greenland.” He said traders showed the same lack of concern about military drills near Taiwan and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Tech earnings protection picks up Traders also bought protection against drops in chip company stocks. Big tech firms including Apple Inc., Tesla Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. will report their earnings this week. Investors picked up January 30 put options in Nvidia Corp., Oracle Corp. and Broadcom Inc. Bracq said market drops will likely stay brief as long as people believe the American economy stays strong. He thinks a VIX reading above 20 might be a good time for everyday investors to sell. But he warned that disappointment from tech companies or a weaker job market could change the current low-fear environment. Retail investors keep buying when prices dip. This helps keep fear spikes short, especially while data suggests more Federal Reserve rate cuts and continued economic growth. That could shift if joblessness and rising prices get bad enough to stop these buyers. Antoine Porcheret handles institutional structuring for the UK, Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citigroup Inc. He said retail traders have been a big part of the buy-the-dip strategy. “So that is a risk if those buyers disappear, which can happen with rising unemployment if they have less disposable income,” he explained. Market structure changes draw attention Analysts at UBS Group AG noted that zero-day-to-expiry options recently created a shorter gamma profile. This could cause bigger swings during the trading day as dealers adjust their positions. Traders are also watching VIX dealer positions and exchange-traded products tied to the index. These products have seen money leave recently. When people cash out volatility bets during market stress, it can soften VIX jumps. With lighter positions now, that steadying effect might weaken, possibly making the VIX react more sharply. The hedging activity comes as Chinese tech stocks continue rallying despite economic challenges. As reported by Cryptopolitan previously, China has announced plans to invest up to 70 billion dollars in its domestic chip industry, positioning itself as a serious rival to American technology firms. AI and robotics advances have pushed Chinese tech shares higher this year, even as the broader economy faces headwinds from weak consumer spending and a struggling property sector. Market watchers note this self-sufficiency push has shifted investor perspectives on Chinese companies. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Analysts track development, security audits and roadmap execution to estimate where value could settle once trading opens. A similar pattern is now taking shape around one new crypto under $0.75 that is entering its final presale stages. Several experts say the project is moving into the visibility phase, where utility expectations begin shaping longer-term price models. Dual Lending Markets and Presale Progress The new cryptocurrency drawing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending protocol that includes two lending markets. The first uses a shared liquidity pool where lenders supply assets and receive mtTokens that earn APY. Borrowers draw from the same pool and secure positions using collateral at preset loan-to-value levels. For example, lenders could earn yields such as 6% to 12% depending on pool demand, while borrowers may select LTV bands such as 50% or 65% based on collateral type. The second market matches users directly instead of using the shared pool. Borrowers still lock collateral and follow LTV rules. If the collateral value drops below threshold, the liquidation bot intervenes to protect available liquidity. Analysts say this dual model allows the protocol to support users with different risk profiles and borrowing preferences. Mutuum Finance began its MUTM distribution in early 2025 at $0.01. The current presale price is $0.04, reflecting a 300% appreciation for early participants. The project has raised $19.9M with 18,900 holders and 830M tokens distributed. From the 4B supply, 45.5% or roughly 1.82B tokens have been allocated for presale onboarding. Phase 7 is now in progress with more than 6% of the current phase allocated and the launch price set near $0.06. V1 Testnet and Security Audit Visibility The next major catalyst for the protocol is the V1 testnet launch scheduled for Q1 2026 on Sepolia. V1 will introduce borrowing, collateral management, liquidation logic and debt tracking in a controlled environment. It will support ETH and USDT as the first assets for borrowing and supplying. Once testnet milestones are completed, the project plans to prepare for Mainnet release and future listings. Security validation has been central to the roadmap. Mutuum Finance completed an independent audit with Halborn Security and holds a 90 out of 100 token scan score from CertiK. These reviews matter because lending protocols must handle collateral, liquidation and pricing data without failure. Many analysts argue that serious capital typically enters after audits and testnet schedules become visible. Several experts believe that if V1 launches on schedule and borrowing activity emerges with mainnet start following, MUTM could reprice into the $0.15 to $0.45 range during 2026. From the current $0.04 presale level, this implies a 300% to 750% increase under a bullish scenario. mtTokens, Stable Revenue Logic and Oracle Support A core part of the Mutuum Finance model revolves around mtTokens. They track supplied assets and calculate APY. mtTokens can also be staked in the safety module to earn MUTM purchased from the open market. A portion of protocol revenue funds these purchases, which creates continuous buy pressure that is tied to real lending volume instead of short-term attention cycles. Oracles will supply pricing data to the protocol for collateral and liquidation systems. Accurate pricing is required during volatile markets to avoid liquidations triggered by distorted data. Market researchers say this type of infrastructure separates lending protocols from meme assets because it connects token economics to performance and usage. Under a longer-term model that factors in mtToken staking, borrowing volume and protocol revenue, some analysts believe MUTM could move into the $0.40 to $0.50 range during 2027. From the current $0.04 level, this would represent a 900% to 1150% increase under an optimistic scenario. Why Solana Comparisons Are Emerging Several experts have compared Mutuum Finance to early Solana. The comparison is not architectural. It is about sequencing and timing. Solana gained broader visibility once V1 was nearly complete, audits were disclosed and listings were taking shape. Mutuum Finance is entering a similar window now, as security reviews, testnet dates and listing expectations are becoming public. The project is attempting to build a full borrowing platform with longer-term components including an overcollateralized stablecoin and a Layer-2 expansion to reduce fees. Analysts believe these features position it within the emerging cheap crypto sector, where valuation often forms around utility expectations rather than hype. As Phase 7 continues to sell through allocation and whales appear in daily contribution data, the presale is now being discussed within top crypto rotation lists for investors searching for next crypto candidates preparing for their first discovery cycle.

Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski pointed to Poland’s stronger growth numbers as reason to avoid joining the eurozone. “Our economy is now doing clearly better than most of those that have the euro,” Domanski said. “We have more and more data, research and arguments to keep the Polish zloty.” The European Commission expects Poland’s economy to grow 3.5% this year. That’s much better than the 1.2% expansion forecast for eurozone countries. The single currency bloc posted just 0.2% quarter-on-quarter growth in the third quarter of 2025. Economic forecasts put eurozone growth between 0.9% and 1.3% for 2025. The weak performance pushed the European Central Bank to cut interest rates by 200 basis points to 2% by June 2025. _*]:min-w-0 gap-3""> Central Europe kept distance from euro _*]:min-w-0 gap-3""> Poland isn’t alone in staying outside the eurozone. The Czech Republic and Hungary also show little interest in adopting the euro despite two decades in the European Union. The Czech government decided not to set an euro adoption date in 2025, marking the twenty-first time officials have delayed the decision. _*]:min-w-0 gap-3""> Public opposition runs high across the region. Some 72% of Czechs are against adopting the euro, according to the last year’s polling . Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said the EU is “disintegrating” and Hungary should reject the euro. He previously stated Hungary won’t adopt the currency until its economy reaches 85% of Germany’s GDP per capita. _*]:min-w-0 gap-3""> The reluctance reflects concerns about losing monetary independence and control over national currencies. These three countries, along with Denmark and Sweden, will remain the EU’s only members outside the eurozone once Bulgaria and Romania join the currency bloc . Political barriers remain high Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s government took office in late 2023 and is considered pro-European . But it hasn’t made joining the euro a priority. The move would face major problems. It needs changes to Poland’s Constitution and support from nationalist opposition politicians who don’t want to give up the zloty. Domanski said his thinking changed on the issue. “Two years ago I was a bit worried that Poland could be left behind in a two-tier EU and outside the eurozone, but today Poland is clearly in the top economic tier, and I see no strong reason to abandon our own currency,” he told Financial Times. Poland will likely keep its distance from euro membership, even as it stays part of the European Union. The country’s economic performance gives officials little reason to pursue the difficult political process needed to adopt the shared currency. Get seen where it counts.

57462966,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=265183,1769370910,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Futures Liquidated: Staggering $154 Million Evaporates in One Volatile Hour,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidated-volatile-hour/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidated: Staggering $154 Million Evaporates in One Volatile Hour Global cryptocurrency markets experienced a sharp contraction today, as a sudden wave of selling pressure triggered the liquidation of approximately $154 million in futures contracts within a single hour. This intense activity, concentrated across major derivatives exchanges, contributed to a 24-hour liquidation total surpassing $547 million, signaling a period of heightened volatility and significant risk for leveraged traders. Market analysts immediately scrutinized the data, seeking to understand the catalysts and potential ramifications of this rapid deleveraging event. Crypto Futures Liquidated in Unprecedented Hourly Volume The derivatives market faced immense stress during the reported hour. Consequently, exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and OKX executed automatic liquidations to close over-leveraged positions. This process occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance requirement, forcing the exchange to sell the position to prevent further loss. Notably, long positions, betting on price increases, reportedly bore the brunt of this event. Data from analytics platforms like Coinglass confirmed the scale, highlighting it as one of the most significant hourly liquidation clusters in recent months. Furthermore, this activity often creates a feedback loop; forced selling can drive prices lower, potentially triggering more liquidations. Understanding the Mechanics of Futures Liquidation To grasp the $154 million event, one must understand futures trading mechanics. Traders use leverage, borrowing capital to amplify potential gains and losses. For instance, a 10x leverage multiplies both profit and risk by ten. Exchanges set liquidation prices based on this leverage and the initial margin. When the market price hits this threshold, the exchange’s system automatically closes the position. This mechanism protects the exchange from loss but can be devastating for the trader. The recent volatility swiftly pushed many assets toward these critical price points, resulting in the cascading series of liquidations observed across the market. Leverage: The primary amplifier of risk in futures markets. Margin Call: A warning that funds must be added to maintain a position. Liquidation Price: The precise price level where an automatic closure occurs. Expert Analysis on Market Catalysts Several seasoned analysts pointed to a confluence of factors preceding the liquidation wave. First, a buildup of excessive leverage in the market created a fragile environment. Second, a slight downturn in Bitcoin’s price acted as the initial trigger. Third, macroeconomic data releases, such as inflation figures, may have influenced broader investor sentiment. John Wu, a veteran derivatives trader with over a decade of experience, noted, “Markets were primed for a correction. The high aggregate leverage ratio was a clear warning sign. A minor price move was all it took to start the cascade.” This analysis underscores the importance of monitoring funding rates and open interest as indicators of market health. Historical Context and Comparative Data While notable, the $154 million hourly figure remains below historical extremes. For example, during the May 2021 market downturn, hourly liquidations repeatedly exceeded $1 billion. The table below provides a comparative snapshot of significant liquidation events: Date Approx. Hourly Liquidation Primary Catalyst May 19, 2021 $1.2 Billion China regulatory announcements June 2022 $800 Million Celsius Network insolvency fears Today’s Event $154 Million Leverage unwind & minor price correction This comparison suggests the current market structure may be somewhat more resilient, though still vulnerable to rapid shifts. The 24-hour total of $547 million, however, indicates sustained pressure beyond the initial hour. Immediate Impact on Traders and Exchange Operations The immediate effect of such liquidations is a direct capital loss for affected traders. Their positions are closed at a loss, and their remaining margin is forfeited. For exchanges, the process is automated and designed to maintain system solvency. However, periods of extreme volatility can test exchange infrastructure, though major platforms reported no technical issues during this event. The broader impact includes increased market volatility and potential short-term price dislocations. Retail traders with high leverage are typically the most affected, while institutional players often employ more sophisticated risk management strategies. The Role of Risk Management Protocols This event serves as a critical reminder of risk management necessity. Experts consistently advise using stop-loss orders, which are distinct from exchange liquidations, to define risk thresholds manually. Additionally, employing lower leverage ratios, diversifying across assets, and never risking more capital than one can afford to lose are fundamental principles. Many trading platforms also offer isolated margin modes, which limit loss to the funds allocated to a single position, thereby protecting the entire account balance from being liquidated. Conclusion The liquidation of $154 million in crypto futures within one hour highlights the inherent risks and volatility of leveraged digital asset trading. This event, part of a larger $547 million 24-hour deleveraging, was driven by high pre-existing leverage and a triggering market move. While smaller than historical extremes, it underscores the critical need for disciplined risk management, continuous market monitoring, and a clear understanding of derivatives mechanics. As the cryptocurrency market matures, such volatility events remain powerful lessons on the balance between opportunity and risk. FAQs Q1: What does ‘futures liquidated’ mean? A futures liquidation is an automatic closure of a leveraged trading position by an exchange. This happens when the trader’s collateral (margin) falls below the required level to maintain the trade, preventing further losses for the exchange. Q2: Who loses money when futures are liquidated? The trader holding the liquidated position incurs the financial loss. The exchange sells the position, often at a loss, and the trader’s initial margin and any unrealized profits are used to cover it. The exchange itself does not typically lose money from the trade itself. Q3: Can liquidations cause the market price to drop further? Yes, they often can. A large cluster of liquidations, especially of long positions, forces the exchange to sell the underlying asset into the market. This surge in sell-side pressure can drive prices down, potentially triggering more liquidations in a cascading effect. Q4: How can traders avoid being liquidated? Traders can avoid liquidation by using conservative leverage, constantly monitoring their positions, maintaining sufficient margin above requirements, and using manual stop-loss orders to exit positions before the exchange’s automatic liquidation price is reached. Q5: Is a $154 million liquidation a large event? It is a significant event indicating high volatility and market stress. However, it is not unprecedented. Historically, the cryptocurrency market has seen single-hour liquidation events exceeding $1 billion during periods of extreme turmoil, such as in May 2021.

The analysis, which was shared on the social media platform X alongside a multiyear chart, points to XRP trading in what is labeled Phase 4.

One full sequence of four phases unfolded between mid-2013 and mid-2017 as the foundation for XRP’s first rally to price peaks. Since then, a second set of four phases has been developing and following a similar pattern. XRP transitioned into a new phase 1 and phase 2 sequence that led to a 2018 peak for phase 1 and then a pullback for phase 2 between 2018 and 2020. This was followed by an unusually long p3 that stretched from 2019 to mid-2024, visible on the chart as a broad, multi-year consolidation with converging trendlines of lower highs and higher lows. During this time, XRP’s price action was trapped inside the compression structure, just like the behavior seen during phase 3 of the first cycle. XRP Price Chart. Source: @amonyx On X Phase 4 Returns: XRP To Double Digits According to the technical analysis, phase 4 began in 2025, when XRP finally broke above the compression range in mid-2024. This breakout was the same structural transition seen in mid-2017, when XRP exited consolidation and entered expansion. Phase 4 has already been in progress for several months and includes the period when XRP rallied to new all-time highs in mid-2025, eventually topping out at $3.65 in July. Since that peak, however, XRP’s price action has been playing out a corrective downward trend and is down by roughly 48% at the time of writing. Despite the ongoing correction, the projection is that XRP is still in phase 4 and is going to break into new all-time highs soon. This shows that phase 4 could unfold over an extended period and not with a single impulse move. The current all-time high of $3.65 is the first major technical hurdle, and a break above it will serve as confirmation that XRP is back into price discovery. Related Reading: Gold Becomes The Whale Safe Haven As Bitcoin Takes A Back Seat Based on this technical analysis, past expansion ratios from the previous cycle are applied and a 6.618 Fibonacci extension is measured from the phase 3 support low. This points to a projected price level near $21.5. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.89, meaning a move to that level would represent an increase of roughly 1,040% from current prices.

Reports say the move will be limited, targeted and tied to advisory checks rather than open to every account holder. Bitcoin As An Option For Qualified Savers Reports note the fund will be offered only to investors who meet a risk profile and pass a tailored advisory process. That means access won’t be automatic; it will be conditional on an assessment meant to match a person’s tolerance with a small, optional slice of crypto. The product is designed for long-term allocation and not for quick trading or speculation, according to market coverage. AFP Protección’s executives emphasized that core pension portfolios will remain focused on traditional assets such as bonds and equities, and that any Bitcoin exposure would be a narrow, complementary allocation. En primicia, Valora Analitik conoció que Protección se prepara para lanzar desde Colombia un fondo con exposición a Bitcoin. El producto no estará enfocado en la especulación de corto plazo, sino en ampliar las opciones de diversificación con una gestión integral de riesgos y… pic.twitter.com/nAO8mbsTLi — Valora Analitik (@ValoraAnalitik) January 22, 2026 The language used by the firm frames the initiative as diversification rather than a wholesale shift of retirement capital. Juan David Correa, who serves as president of Protección SA, confirmed the plan in an interview with local media outlet Valora Analitik. Size And Reach Of The Manager AFP Protección manages assets for millions of clients and has a sizable balance sheet. Reports put its assets under management at roughly 220 trillion Colombian pesos — roughly US$55 billion — and note that the firm serves a broad base of workers through mandatory pensions, voluntary saving plans and severance accounts. The sheer scale of the manager helps explain why even a small, optional product gets wide attention. Regulation And Reporting Reports also point to a tightening regulatory backdrop in Colombia. Tax and customs authorities have rolled out new crypto reporting rules that align with international reporting standards. Those rules are likely to affect how crypto products are structured and how returns or transfers are reported for tax purposes. The change in rules is one reason AFP Protección has framed its product as measured and compliant. How This Fits A Regional Trend Across Latin America, some institutional players have been experimenting with limited crypto exposure for years. Colombia’s move follows earlier steps by one or two other local managers and fits a regional pattern where established firms test small, controlled offerings before widening access. The step will be watched closely by investors and regulators overseas. Reports say potential participants should expect thorough suitability checks, clear disclosures and limits on how much of a retirement portfolio can sit in the new vehicle.

Exchange flow data reveals growing demand for the popular meme cryptocurrency. The digital asset's exchange flow metric shifted into negative territory over the past 24 hours. This change indicates more tokens are leaving exchanges than entering them. Investors appear to be accumulating rather than selling. Data from CryptoQuant shows Shiba Inu's netflow across supported exchanges reached -31,737,600,000 tokens on January 25. The negative reading suggests substantial buying activity. More than 31 billion tokens moved from exchanges to private wallets during this period. Demand Rises Amid Market Downturn The positive exchange dynamics emerge as cryptocurrency markets face continued pressure. Most digital assets have experienced significant declines in recent sessions. Shiba Inu fell 4.38% in the last 24 hours, to trade at around $0.00000747 at the time of writing. However, the exchange outflow pattern tells a different story beneath the surface. The metric points to strengthening demand even as prices decline. This divergence often precedes trend reversals in cryptocurrency markets. Exchange netflow measures the difference between deposits and withdrawals at trading platforms. When outflows exceed inflows, it typically means investors are moving tokens to cold storage. This behavior indicates conviction and reduced selling pressure. The current data shows buying activity outpacing selling by a considerable margin. Large-scale withdrawals suggest both retail and institutional participants are accumulating positions. These holders demonstrate little interest in liquidating their assets at current price levels. Shift in Investor Behavior The exchange flow pattern represents a notable change in market sentiment. In previous weeks, selling persisted as investors reacted to broader market weakness. That trend is reversing. Token holders are increasingly moving their Shiba Inu holdings into self-custody wallets. This transfer activity indicates a shift from short-term trading to longer-term holding strategies. Investors who move tokens off exchanges typically plan to retain them for extended periods.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 20:03:57

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/jake-claver-says-500m-can-move-through-xrp-with-zero-price-action-heres-why/,"Most market participants assume price action reveals the full story. Charts move, indicators react, and traders believe they are watching capital flow in real time. In reality, modern markets operate on multiple layers, and much of the most significant activity never appears on public screens. Crypto markets, despite their transparency narrative, follow the same structure. In a recent X post, Jake Claver highlighted this hidden dynamic by explaining how substantial value can move through XRP without triggering visible price movement. His point challenges the assumption that flat charts equal low activity. Why Public Charts Show Only a Fraction of Activity Spot exchanges display trades that interact directly with open order books. Large institutions avoid executing size in these venues because it exposes intent and causes slippage. Instead, they rely on over-the-counter desks, internalized matching systems, and algorithmic execution tools that minimize market impact. You think you're reading the market. You're seeing about 40% of it. Dark pools swallow the rest. $500 million can move through XRP with zero price action. Your analysis is based on incomplete data. — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) January 24, 2026 These mechanisms allow trades to settle off-exchange or net internally before reaching public markets. As a result, price charts capture only a portion of total transactional volume. When analysts base conclusions solely on candles and indicators, they operate with incomplete information. How XRP Supports High-Volume, Low-Impact Transfers XRP’s underlying architecture enables rapid settlement and efficient liquidity routing. The XRP Ledger processes transactions in seconds and supports deep liquidity corridors across multiple jurisdictions. This design allows institutions to move large sums for settlement or liquidity provisioning without relying on public spot markets. When capital moves through XRP for utility rather than speculation, price impact becomes irrelevant. The network prioritizes speed, certainty, and cost efficiency, not signaling to traders. This reality explains how hundreds of millions of dollars can pass through XRP while charts remain unchanged. The Function of Dark Pools in Crypto Markets Dark pools and private liquidity venues exist to protect large participants from adverse market reactions. These systems match buyers and sellers discreetly, often at predetermined prices, without broadcasting activity to the broader market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Crypto infrastructure increasingly mirrors traditional finance in this regard. XRP fits naturally into this framework because institutions already use it within structured settlement and payment flows. These transactions bypass visible exchanges and leave no immediate footprint on price charts. Why Retail Analysis Often Misses Institutional Behavior Technical analysis remains useful, but it reflects only observable trades. Indicators respond to retail-driven momentum and marginal flows, not to silent institutional transfers. When traders equate flat price action with inactivity, they often misinterpret accumulation or utility-driven usage happening beneath the surface. Claver’s observation reframes price as a secondary signal rather than a complete measure of value transfer. What This Means for XRP’s Market Outlook If significant capital can move through XRP without price disruption, then price becomes a lagging indicator. For long-term observers, this underscores XRP’s role as a settlement asset whose adoption may expand quietly before markets fully reflect its impact.

New data from blockchain intelligence firm Bitrace shows how these operations continue at scale despite recent law enforcement actions against their payment providers. Gambling Platforms Keep Operating After Huione-Linked Shutdowns According to Bitrace’s investigation, a specific trio of crypto wallets, namely Huione Telegram Wallet, Wangbo Wallet, and HWZF (referring to both Huionepay and Overseaspay), act as the main settlement tools for gambling operations connected to the Huione and Tudou Guarantee platforms. These Telegram-based guarantee markets were designed to facilitate transactions for goods and services but evolved into hubs for illicit activity, including scam operations and money laundering. Bitrace revealed that online gambling platforms often join the platforms, which act as escrow-style marketplaces on Telegram. Once onboarded, the gambling sites integrate third-party crypto payment providers through Telegram mini apps, allowing players to deposit and withdraw funds without interacting directly with exchanges. While Huionepay and Tudou Guarantee have already shut down, Bitrace pointed out that gambling platforms that depended on their services are still running and processing large volumes of crypto. The firm said these gambling-related entities received a combined 414 million USDT during a 53-day period, mainly through the Telegram-based payment tools. Multiple intelligence sources cited by Bitrace linked Huione Telegram Wallet, Wangbo Wallet, and HWZF to fund settlement for gambling operations connected to Huione, Haowang, and Tudou Guarantee. The firm said Wangbo Wallet and Huionepay appear to share the same software backend, meaning user funds are pooled rather than kept separate. Despite repeated warnings from payment providers advising users not to send funds directly to centralized exchanges, Bitrace tracked around 9 million USDT flowing straight into platforms such as Binance, OKX, and HTX during the same 53-day window. The firm said these transfers risk triggering compliance reviews, but are still moving regardless. Telegram Markets and Exchanges Part of the Same Pipeline The findings follow years of scrutiny on Huione Group, which U.S. authorities labeled a “primary money laundering concern” in October 2025 after a joint action by OFAC, FinCEN, and UK agencies. Prosecutors also unsealed charges and a $15 billion civil forfeiture case tied to Huione-linked operations. Huione Guarantee, later rebranded as Haowang Guarantee, processed more than $24 billion in transactions before its shutdown in May 2025. After Telegram removed thousands of channels, vendors migrated to Tudou Guarantee, which absorbed much of the activity. Investigations by Elliptic and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) show that these marketplaces support scam groups, money launderers, and online gambling operators using USDT for settlement. Even after sanctions, Huione-linked entities sent hundreds of millions of dollars through major exchanges between mid-2024 and mid-2025, ICIJ reported in November 2025. Bitrace’s latest data suggests the same model remains active. Wallet branding changes, shared infrastructure, and Telegram-based tools allow gambling syndicates to keep collecting revenue while limiting direct exposure. For exchanges and regulators, the continued flow of funds points to unresolved gaps between marketplace shutdowns, wallet providers, and exchange-level controls.

Data from CoinCodex shows both PAXG and XAUT trading above the psychological threshold, reflecting steady buying pressure and tighter alignment with physical gold pricing. Pax Gold Price Breakout. Source : CoinCodex The move places on-chain gold at levels that traditional markets only recently approached, while blockchain-based versions now trade continuously, without market-hour limits. As a result, tokenized gold has become one of the first large-scale examples of real-world assets reacting to macro flows in real time. Tokenized Gold Extends Rally Past Key Level CoinCodex price data shows Pax Gold climbing from the mid-$4,600 range earlier in the week to above $5,000, with higher lows forming across several sessions. Tether Gold followed a near-identical path, confirming that the move reflects broader gold strength rather than token-specific activity. Tether Gold Price Surge. Source : CoinCodex While short pullbacks appeared during intraday trading, both assets held above prior resistance zones near $4,900. That shift signals a structural breakout on-chain, as former ceilings turned into support. Unlike traditional gold markets, these tokens continued trading through weekend sessions, absorbing flows that would otherwise wait for futures or spot markets to reopen. The on-chain breakout also highlights how tokenized commodities now mirror macro trends faster. As inflation hedging demand returned and rate-cut expectations stayed in focus, tokenized gold responded without delay, reinforcing its role as a real-time proxy for bullion exposure. On-Chain Gold Highlights Broader Tokenization Shift The move above $5,000 comes as tokenization expands beyond commodities into equities and credit markets. Nasdaq has also explored tokenized stock trading as exchanges push toward longer hours and faster settlement. Recent announcements around 24/7 tokenized stock trading underscored that trend, positioning gold tokens as early proof of concept rather than niche instruments. Banks and asset managers have already pointed to higher long-term gold price targets in recent outlooks, citing geopolitical risk, central bank demand, and persistent macro uncertainty. On-chain pricing now reflects those expectations continuously, rather than in fixed trading windows. As tokenized stocks prepare to enter round-the-clock markets, gold’s on-chain breakout offers a preview of how traditional assets may behave once freed from legacy settlement hours.

Big names in the software industry have taken a beating on stock markets recently. Salesforce, Adobe, and ServiceNow have each lost more than 30% of their value since early last year. An index tracking smaller software businesses has dropped over 20% during the same stretch. The decline picked up speed this month. That happened after Anthropic launched Claude Code, an AI progra m th at experts say can drastically cut down the time needed to create complicated software programs. The technology has sparked concerns about something called “vibe coding,” where AI systems rapidly generate applications and websites. “The narrative has really shifted,” said Rishi Jaluria, who analyzes software companies for RBC Capital Markets. Market sentiment has swung dramatically, according to Jaluria. Initially, investors believed software firms would gain from AI developments. Now they’re asking a different question: “Is AI just the death of software?” The coming days will offer more clues about technology’s broader health. Apple, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft are scheduled to release earnings reports. The Federal Reserve also has a meeting planned, though no changes to interest rates are anticipated. The reversal marks a stunning turnabout for an industry that dominated Wall Street attention just a few years back. The software boom that was Throughout the 2010s, software appeared to fulfill Marc Andreessen’s prediction that it would “eat the world.” Fast internet connections and cloud computing powered the expansion. Companies could rent storage from providers like Amazon.com instead of maintaining their own data centers.New software ventures sprouted up everywhere They tackled everything from yoga studio scheduling and payment processing to corporate cybersecurity defense. Wall Street’s view of the sector transformed completely. Once considered risky, software earned a reputation for dependability. Companies rarely switched products after integrating them into their operations. Long-term subscription deals brought predictable income streams. Investors valued that highly. Stock prices climbed sharply. The sector attracted floods of borrowed money as private equity firms rushed to buy companies. Remote work requirements during the pandemic sent the boom into overdrive. Falling interest rates made borrowing cheaper, which added fuel. Things started changing whe n ra tes climbed in 2022, and workers returned to offices. Lenders who had funded software acquisitions began seeing cracks. Competitio n in tensified. Companies carrying heavy debt load s st arted struggling. Software loan defaults were virtually unknown before 2020. That was partly because lending to such companies was relatively new. Over the past two years, however, 13 software businesses have failed to meet their debt obligations, according to PitchBook LCD. That includes both bankruptcies and out-of-court debt restructurings. Quest exemplifies the challenges. The company makes OneLogin software for employee authentication. Clearlake Capital purchased Quest in early 2022 using $3.6 billion in investor loans. Despite benefiting from remote work trends, Quest buckled under its debt burden while facing competition from Okta, a larger rival. The company reached a restructuring agreement with lenders last June. Growing investor caution Default rates for software loans remain below those for buyout loans overall. Investors haven’t fled entirely. But the premium that investors demand for holding software loans above benchmark rates has climbed over the past 15 months. That’s happened even as overall loan premiums edged downward, according to PitchBook LCD data seen by WSJ. “The investor base is definitely scrutinizing these software names much more closely,” said Vince Flanagan, who manages portfolios at Seix Investment Advisors. AI’s emergence has deepened the caution. The main dangers include fresh competition from newcomers and companies building their own software instead of paying outside vendors. Most analysts don’t expect software companies to vanish soon. The more immediate worry is slower revenue growth, Jaluria explained. Customers are testing alternatives rather than buying typical upgrades and extras. Jaluria believes AI could hurt “fat, lazy incumbents” while helping innovative companies that use AI to enhance their offerings. Questions about AI’s future add to the uncertainty AI enthusiasm has pushed stocks to records recently. But investors have become pickier about which AI-related companies to back. Firms are borrowing heavily for AI infrastructure projects. Lenders are proceeding carefully. They’re demanding higher interest payments from big spenders like Meta and Oracle relative to their credit quality. Investors are asking hard questions, he added. “Are these investments sustainable? Are they going to be profitable? Are there going to be cash flows, or will there not be?” Get seen where it counts.

The development comes alongside a dramatic increase in SHIB's burn rate. Recent data shows token burns have surged by more than 1,100% following a single wallet transaction that removed 28 million SHIB from circulation. This combination of technical positioning and reduced supply has fueled speculation about a potential price breakout. Historical Demand Zone Shows Bullish Pattern The current price level represents a zone where buyer interest has historically intensified. Since 2022, this demand area has marked the bottom before significant rallies occurred. Each instance saw substantial price appreciation after SHIB entered this range. The most recent example played out in 2024. SHIB climbed from $0.00000809 to $0.000032 after touching this demand zone. That move represented a gain of nearly 300% within a relatively short timeframe. Analysts note that SHIB remains within this zone currently. Early signs suggest upward momentum may be building. However, confirmation requires the price to break through key resistance levels. The meme coin must clear $0.00001385 before targeting the next hurdle at $0.000021. A successful breach of these barriers could open the path toward $0.000032. This level matches the peak reached during the 2024 rally. Technical indicators are adding weight to the bullish outlook. A wedge pattern has formed on SHIB's price chart. This formation typically precedes sharp upward movements when the price breaks above the upper trendline. Market observers estimate a potential surge exceeding 200% if the breakout confirms. The pattern's geometry suggests this magnitude of movement aligns with historical precedent. Token Burns Accelerate While Network Activity Declines The burn mechanism has gained significant traction recently. More than 28 million tokens were destroyed in a single transaction. This event pushed the overall burn rate up by over 1,100% in a short period. Token burns permanently remove SHIB from circulation. The process reduces total supply, which can create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. The recent acceleration represents one of the most aggressive burn periods in recent months. Exchange inflows have also spiked dramatically. This metric tracks SHIB moving onto trading platforms. Higher inflows often signal increased volatility ahead. The direction of that volatility depends on whether the activity skews toward buying or selling. If the surge in exchange activity translates to buying pressure, it could amplify the bullish case. The combination of reduced supply and increased demand would create favorable conditions for price appreciation. Despite positive developments in burn rates and technical positioning, Shibarium faces challenges. The layer-2 network built for SHIB transactions has experienced declining activity. Total Value Locked on Shibarium currently sits at approximately $701,101 according to DeFiLlama. This figure represents a sharp drop from the peak of over $6 million recorded in late 2024. The decline exceeds 88% from those highs. TVL measures the dollar value of assets deposited in a network's protocols. Falling TVL suggests reduced user engagement and capital deployment. This trend could weaken the broader ecosystem supporting SHIB.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2026-01-25 21:03:04

They usually emerge when momentum shifts quietly while the price still looks weak. That phase often marks the turning point between prolonged consolidation and renewed expansion. XRP now appears to be entering that zone where technical structure begins to challenge prevailing bearish assumptions. In a recent X post, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted a developing signal on XRP’s daily chart that points to improving momentum beneath the surface. His analysis focuses on a classic divergence pattern that traders often watch closely at potential market inflection points. What the Daily XRP Chart Shows XRP recently declined toward the $1.92 level after weeks of sideways-to-lower price action. While price printed lower lows, the Relative Strength Index told a different story. Since July 2025, the RSI has consistently formed higher lows on the daily timeframe. This bullish divergence will send $XRP to $5 before you know it! pic.twitter.com/tEkLTIltvl — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) January 24, 2026 This configuration creates a bullish RSI divergence . In technical analysis, this pattern suggests that selling pressure weakens even as the price continues to drift lower. Steph emphasized that this divergence signals diminishing downside momentum rather than immediate upside, a key distinction for proper interpretation. Why Bullish RSI Divergence Carries Weight Momentum often leads the price to turning points. When RSI trends higher while price trends lower, sellers must exert more effort to achieve smaller price moves. Buyers begin absorbing supply more efficiently, setting the stage for a potential reversal. On higher timeframes like the daily chart, bullish divergences tend to carry more significance. They frequently precede strong relief rallies or full trend reversals, particularly after extended consolidation phases. This dynamic explains why traders treat such setups as early warnings rather than entry signals. How the $5 Scenario Fits the Structure Steph’s $5 outlook reflects a broader structural recovery rather than a single technical signal. If XRP confirms the divergence by breaking above short-term resistance, the price could rapidly revisit prior high-volume zones. Those areas often act as acceleration points once momentum shifts decisively. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A sustained move higher would also realign XRP with broader market strength, especially if liquidity rotates back into large-cap altcoins. In that environment, upside targets expand quickly as sidelined capital re-enters the market. What Still Needs Confirmation Despite improving momentum, the price must validate the setup. XRP needs to hold above recent support and reclaim key resistance levels to confirm trend reversal. Without confirmation, divergences can persist without resolution. However, the risk profile has shifted. Downside momentum has weakened, and buyers now hold a structural advantage. What This Means for XRP Traders This bullish divergence does not guarantee an immediate rally, but it changes the technical narrative. XRP no longer trades purely on weakness. Momentum now favors accumulation, and if price follows, a move toward higher targets, including $5, becomes increasingly realistic.

The Treasury Secretary said Sunday that Carney’s latest deal with Beijing is a flat-out reversal of what Canada agreed to just months ago. He said this directly backs Donald Trump’s warning that Canada could face 100% U.S. tariffs if it keeps acting as a trade loophole for China. “The Canadians a few months ago joined the US in putting high steel tariffs on China because the Chinese are dumping,” Scott said on ABC’s This Week . “The Europeans also have done the same thing. And it looks like that Prime Minister Carney may have done some kind of about-face.” Canada lifts EV tariffs after deal with Xi This all started when Canada cut tariffs on 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles, dropping them from 100% to just 6%. That was part of a new arrangement Carney worked out with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Carney said he expects Beijing to respond by dropping restrictions on Canadian rapeseed imports. But Washington sees this as Canada handing China the keys to the North American supply chain. Scott warned that if Canada moves forward with a free trade deal with China, the U.S. will retaliate… hard. “We have a highly integrated market with Canada. The goods can cross across the border during the manufacturing process six times. And we can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.,” he said. Trump already put out a message on Truth Social. “If Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a ‘Drop Off Port’ for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,” Trump posted Saturday. The White House isn’t just talking either. They’re already reviewing which Canadian goods could get slapped with new penalties. Cars are top of the list. Scott also said China could get hit with fresh tariffs too if this agreement expands beyond the current scope. Davos speech sparks tension as new USMCA talks approach The timing is brutal. Carney’s deal comes just ahead of planned talks to renegotiate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement this summer. Scott didn’t say how this China move would affect that, but it’s now clear tensions are running hot. Canada’s trade minister Dominic LeBlanc tried to calm things down Saturday, saying there’s no free trade deal with China in the works. He claimed the Carney-Xi agreement is about ending tariff disputes, not opening the floodgates. But that hasn’t stopped the criticism. Part of the heat is coming from a speech Carney gave at the World Economic Forum in Davos. He told world leaders to start “naming reality,” quoting Czech dissident Václav Havel, and warning against lies about how the world works. While Carney didn’t name the U.S. directly, he took clear aim at American tactics, blasting “tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, and supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited.” Scott wasn’t impressed. “I’m not sure what Prime Minister Carney is doing here, other than trying to virtue-signal to his globalist friends at Davos,” he said. This clash isn’t just about words. Carney has previously tried to cool things down with Trump by removing retaliatory tariffs and apologizing for an anti-tariff ad out of Ontario. But this time, the damage might be harder to walk back. Both Carney and Trump are attending the same summit this week, but no meeting has been confirmed. Carney is leaving the day Trump arrives. Either way, Canada’s sudden China shift is now a front-row issue for U.S. trade hawks. And Scott made it clear: if it keeps up, Washington is ready to hit back. Don’t just read crypto news.

Experts See This New Crypto Outperforming Cardano (ADA),https://www.cryptopolitan.com/next-crypto-to-hit-1-experts-see-this-new-crypto-outperforming-cardano-ada/,"As new cycles form, traders often shift between mature assets and early-stage utility tokens. Mature assets offer stability but slower repricing. Early assets offer higher potential upside if utility arrives on schedule. Analysts say this rotation has already begun as participants search for the next crypto with room to appreciate during the next two-year window. Cardano (ADA) Cardano ADA still holds a position among the top cryptocurrencies by valuation. It trades near $0.36 with a market cap of roughly $13B. The project saw strong early growth when smart contract capability arrived and community expectations surged. That period produced the majority of ADA’s long-term appreciation. Technical analysts now highlight resistance zones near the $0.40 to $0.45 region. Breakouts above these levels require heavy inflows due to liquidity saturation. ADA’s valuation size makes it behave like other mature assets where returns slow because large capital is required for meaningful price moves. Forward projections for ADA show more modest upside. Market commentators mention that ADA’s next cycle may generate single to low double-digit % increases if demand remains steady. While Cardano still benefits from network security and wide ownership, its early explosive phase has already played out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits in a very different part of the cycle. It is building a decentralized lending platform that supports supply-side yield and collateralized borrowing. The protocol design features two lending markets. One uses pooled liquidity where lenders earn APY through mtTokens and borrowers draw against available assets at set loan-to-value levels. The second matches users directly under collateral rules and liquidation safeguards. From the 4B token supply, 45.5% or roughly 1.82B tokens have been allocated for presale access. The presale started in early 2025 at $0.01. The current presale price is $0.04, marking a 300% appreciation for early participants. The project has raised $19.9M and onboarded 18,900 holders. A total of 830M tokens have been sold across multiple phases. Mutuum Finance also completed an audit with Halborn Security and holds a 90 out of 100 token scan score from CertiK, which analysts consider relevant for lending systems. Mature vs Early Utility Contrast The contrast between ADA and MUTM comes down to valuation and utility timing. ADA is mature, widely held and liquid. Its utility is known and fully priced. That leads to slower moves because upside must fight against valuation gravity. Some traders apply simple allocation logic to compare opportunities. For example, a $1,000 position in ADA at $0.36 yields roughly 2,777 ADA. If ADA moves to $0.50 over time, the position gains $388. By contrast, a $1,000 purchase of MUTM at $0.04 yields 25,000 MUTM. As long as analysts’ bullish models of $0.20 to $0.30 during 2026 play out once V1 and Mainnet are operational, the position could appreciate between $5,000 and $7,500. Two paths illustrate how mature assets and early assets behave differently. Roadmap and Utility Catalyst Layer Mutuum Finance has its V1 protocol release scheduled for the Sepolia testnet in Q1 2026. V1 will include collateral management, liquidation logic and borrowing using ETH and USDT. The team also plans to introduce an overcollateralized stablecoin that allows users to mint without selling their assets. Oracles will feed pricing data into liquidation systems to prevent forced closures during volatility. Mainnet activation is expected to align with the official launch. Analysts argue that this phase tends to reprice new crypto assets because utility becomes measurable. ADA’s network already passed that sequence, while MUTM is moving into it. ADA remains a foundational asset with a slower return profile due to maturity and valuation size. MUTM sits in the early utility zone where pricing is still forming and catalysts are ahead rather than behind. That contrast explains why some analysts now place Mutuum Finance on lists for best crypto to invest in during the next cycle as traders search for the next crypto to hit $1 within a realistic utility framework.

This comes after years of tiptoeing around global markets and treating crypto like it was radioactive. Now, they want double the international clients and assets within five years. From 17 million clients outside America today, they want 40 million by 2031. The asset manager currently handles more than $12 trillion globally, making it the second-largest in the world. And it’s not slowing down. Salim Ramji, the firm’s new CEO, said there are “incredible opportunities” abroad as more governments start begging people to invest their savings instead of hoarding them in bank accounts. Vanguard joins UK push as it cuts fees and shifts toward global stocks Ramji said too many people in the UK and Europe keep their money in cash because investing is too expensive, too complex, and full of roadblocks. Governments are now trying to change that. In fact, Vanguard is one of 19 firms backing a UK government push to get savers off the sidelines and into the markets. Last week, Vanguard slashed fees on its £52 billion LifeStrategy fund range, a favorite among its retail users. They also pulled back on UK assets and added more international stocks into the mix, saying clients clearly wanted more global exposure. Chris McIsaac, who heads Vanguard’s international operations, said the firm has already doubled international assets in just three years, and at this pace, “it will take us another five to attract the next $1 trillion.” He added, “We see incredible opportunities in international markets. People are under-participating in capital markets. Index funds and ETFs are under-represented in investor portfolios in international markets.” It’s clear the playbook is working. Index funds and ETFs have exploded globally. That growth has been great for both Vanguard and BlackRock, who’ve been the main winners of the passive investing boom. But unlike BlackRock, Vanguard isn’t owned by shareholders. The people who own its funds are its owners. So when costs go down, it’s the investors who benefit. “The average Vanguard fee in Europe is 14 basis points,” Ramji said. “The average fee that the industry charges is 65 basis points.” In a race to the bottom on costs, that’s a big gap. Vanguard struggles to keep ignoring crypto after explosive ETF launches Here’s the part that’ll make crypto fans roll their eyes. Vanguard has always hated crypto. Flat-out refused to play. But they’re boxed in now. After watching crypto ETFs blow up across the market, even the giants have to pay attention. Back in late October, crypto ETFs tied to Solana and Hedera launched on other platforms. One of them, Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL), became the most successful ETF launch of 2025 across all sectors, according to Eric Balchunas at Bloomberg Intelligence. And the crypto wave started earlier. Since 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have seen record inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone holds around $66 billion in Bitcoin right now. The demand is there. The trading volume is massive. And Vanguard’s old anti-crypto stance looks more outdated by the day. For now, Vanguard hasn’t released its own crypto products. But that wall is starting to crack. With retail pressure and rising ETF competition, even the old-school index giant might have to cave. That would mark a hell of a U-turn.

They want fewer steps and a system where people can donate crypto with one click inside exchange apps. According to recent stats, South Korea has more than 10 million crypto investors and traders. The market is dominated by retail users trading Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins. Korean charities started accepting crypto donations because it is more regulated in the country. The Community Chest of Korea, also known as Fruit of Love, is one of the charities that began accepting crypto donations, according to local media outlets. Donating crypto is a complex process in South Korea To donate crypto in Seoul, donors must go through six steps. First, they have to call the charity to say they want to donate. Next, donors must fill out a form. The form asks for personal details, the reason for the donation, which crypto they are donating, and how much of that crypto they will give. There is no minimum or maximum amount. After that, the charity reviews the donation. This is done to make sure the money is not illegal. If the donation is approved, the charity chooses a donation date and gives the donor a wallet address to send the coins. But not every crypto and exchange is accepted. The selected crypto coin must be listed on at least three major Korean exchanges. Currently, there are five major crypto exchanges in the country, including Upbit , Bithumb, Korbit, Coinone, and Gopax. Charities measure crypto donations in coins, not in won Another issue that makes crypto donations complex is how donations are measured. Donors do not donate by value, like 100,000 Korean won worth of Bitcoin. Instead, they donate by coin amount, such as 0.01 BTC. Once that number is set, it cannot be changed. If the price goes up or down, the donation value changes too. To change the amount, the donor must start the whole process again. This makes price swings a major risk. After receiving the crypto, the charity sells it almost immediately. Large amounts may be sold in parts, but usually within two days. Donors receive a receipt, and the donation qualifies for tax deductions, just like a normal cash donation. Even with these benefits, most people still sell their crypto and donate cash instead. It is faster and simpler. That is why direct crypto donations are rare in South Korea. Last year, the Fruit of Love charity received 1 bitcoin in crypto donations. The Korean Red Cross and Seoul National University Hospital received 1 bitcoin in donations each from the same person. In other countries, crypto donations are simpler and more common. The United States began allowing Bitcoin donations for political purposes as early as 2014, and in 2024, crypto donations there reached about $688 million. Charities across Europe, including in France, have opened their doors to digital asset gifts, with more than 1,300 organizations now accepting crypto. In the Middle East, Dubai charities have started accepting cryptocurrency donations under a new digital-asset giving framework. Major international nonprofits such as UNICEF and the Rainforest Foundation also accept crypto contributions globally. One-click crypto donations are faster, and without them, crypto donations are likely to stay uncommon in South Korea. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The research partner argues that the timeline for cryptographically relevant quantum computers remains distant and that premature migration to post-quantum cryptography could introduce more immediate risks than the theoretical danger itself. Is blockchain facing a quantum threat right now? In a detailed blog post that was also shared on X, Thaler challenged what he described as frequently exaggerated predictions about quantum computing capabilities. He defined a cryptographically relevant quantum computer as a fault-tolerant machine capable of breaking the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in Bitcoin and Ethereum, or RSA-2048 encryption, within approximately one month. Thaler wrote, “We are nowhere near a cryptographically relevant quantum computer by any reasonable reading of public milestones and resource estimates.” Based on publicly available milestones, Thaler assessed such a breakthrough in the 2020s as highly unlikely, pointing to the U.S. government’s 2035 target for widespread post-quantum cryptography adoption in federal systems as a more reasonable planning horizon. However, he stated that “it is not a forecast that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer will exist by then.” The a16z position distinguishes between different categories of cryptographic systems and their respective vulnerabilities. While Thaler acknowledged that post-quantum encryption demands immediate deployment due to harvest-now-decrypt-later (HNDL) attacks already underway, he stated that digital signatures used in Bitcoin and Ethereum face no such risk because blockchain data is inherently public. Zero-knowledge proofs generated before quantum computers arrive would also remain trustworthy, he said. What are blockchain stakeholders doing about the quantum threat? While Thaler makes his submission on what stakeholders should be prioritizing, players in the blockchain space have been making moves in preparation for the post-quantum phase, with the Ethereum Foundation announcing a newly formed post-quantum team . Coinbase has also created an independent advisory board on quantum computing and blockchain. The board comprises industry experts and researchers, one of whom is Justin Drake of the Ethereum Foundation. The board is tasked with assessing the implications of quantum computing for the blockchain ecosystem and providing clear, independent guidance to the broader community. Franklin Bi, general partner at Pantera Capital, reacted to the Ethereum Foundation’s PQ team announcement by stating that blockchain systems may be better prepared to adopt and adapt to the post-quantum phase compared to traditional financial institutions on Wall Street. He wrote , “People are over-estimating how quickly Wall Street will adapt to post-quantum cryptography. Like any systemic software upgrade, it’ll be slow & chaotic with single points of failure for years. Traditional systems are only as strong as their weakest links.” In making his case for blockchains, he stated, “Equally, people are under-estimating the unique ability of blockchains to enact a system-wide software upgrade at global scale,” adding that if done successfully and timely, blockchain networks can evolve into post-quantum “safe havens” for data and assets. What does Thaler recommend? Thaler left some recommendations stating that all stakeholders, companies, governments, and policymakers should “take the quantum threat seriously,” but added that they should not “act under the presumption that a cryptographically relevant quantum computer will arrive before 2030.” He stated that stakeholders should deploy hybrid encryption immediately, especially in places where long-term confidentiality matters and costs are tolerable. Thaler also wrote that “Blockchains don’t need to rush post-quantum signatures — but should start planning now.” For privacy chains that encrypt or hide transaction details, Thaler stated that they should prioritize a transition sooner if performance is tolerable. Another point that he reiterated is that stakeholders should prioritize implementation security and not quantum threat mitigation in the near term. He called for more funding for quantum computing development while also trying to get people to treat new information as progress reports to critically assess, not prompts for abrupt action for now. Thaler acknowledged that there will be innovations and developments that may shorten the timelines, but also said bottlenecks may also arise that may push the timeline forward.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association (SFWA) and San Diego Comic-Con established clear, uncompromising policies that prohibit AI-generated material from their prestigious awards and exhibitions, reflecting growing concerns about authenticity, artistic integrity, and the fundamental nature of creative expression in the digital age. Nebula Awards Implements Strict Generative AI Ban The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association faced significant controversy when it initially attempted to establish nuanced guidelines for AI usage in its prestigious Nebula Awards. According to association documents reviewed in January 2025, SFWA’s Board of Directors first proposed requiring disclosure rather than prohibition for works created with large language model assistance. This approach generated immediate backlash from members who viewed any AI involvement as fundamentally incompatible with authentic creative achievement. Following intense member feedback documented in Jason Sanford’s Genre Grapevine newsletter, SFWA completely reversed its position within days. The organization issued a formal apology and implemented what industry analysts now describe as one of the strictest AI policies in literary awards. The revised rules explicitly state that works “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model tools are not eligible” for Nebula consideration. Defining Creative Boundaries in the AI Era The SFWA controversy highlighted complex questions about where to draw boundaries between acceptable digital tools and prohibited AI assistance. Many professional writers now utilize word processors with built-in AI components for grammar checking and basic editing. Research tools increasingly incorporate language model technology for information gathering and organization. SFWA’s final policy attempts to distinguish between these accepted digital aids and what it terms “generative” AI involvement in the actual creative process. Industry experts note that this distinction remains challenging to enforce consistently. As Sanford observed in his analysis, “If you use any online search engines or computer products these days, it’s likely you’re using something powered by or connected with an LLM.” This technological reality creates practical difficulties for award administrators who must determine whether specific tools cross into prohibited territory. Comic-Con’s Quiet Policy Shift on AI Art Parallel developments occurred in the visual arts community when San Diego Comic-Con, the world’s largest pop culture convention, faced artist protests over its initially permissive AI art policy. Convention records show that for several years, Comic-Con had allowed AI-generated artwork in its exhibition spaces but prohibited its sale. This compromise position became increasingly untenable as AI art generation tools improved dramatically throughout 2024 and early 2025. Artists participating in the convention’s prestigious art show organized formal complaints after discovering the permissive policy. Their concerns centered on several key issues: Originality preservation: Maintaining the value of human-created artwork Copyright integrity: Addressing unresolved legal questions about AI training data Economic protection: Safeguarding artists’ livelihoods against automated competition Creative authenticity: Preserving the human connection in artistic expression In response to these concerns, Comic-Con art show director Glen Wooten implemented a complete ban in February 2025. According to correspondence shared with participating artists, Wooten acknowledged that while the previous policy had served as an effective deterrent, “the issue is becoming more of a problem, so more strident language is necessary: NO! Plain and simple.” The Broader Creative Industry Context These developments represent part of a larger pattern across creative industries. Music distribution platform Bandcamp implemented similar AI content restrictions in late 2024. Major publishing houses have begun developing internal AI usage policies. Film and television production companies face increasing pressure from writers’ and actors’ unions to establish clear boundaries around AI-generated scripts and performances.

Generative AI tools now demonstrate remarkable proficiency in mimicking human creative output across multiple domains. These systems can produce coherent narratives, generate visually compelling artwork, compose original music, and even develop complex character arcs that superficially resemble human creation. However, critics like Sanford argue that this technical proficiency masks fundamental creative deficiencies. In his analysis of the SFWA controversy, he stated that he refuses to use generative AI in his fiction writing “not only because of this theft but also because the tools are not actually creative and defeat the entire point of storytelling.” This perspective reflects widespread concern that AI-generated content, while technically impressive, lacks the authentic human experience, emotional depth, and cultural context that define meaningful art. Legal and Ethical Considerations The creative industry’s AI skepticism connects to unresolved legal questions about training data and copyright. Many generative AI systems train on vast datasets of existing creative works, often without explicit permission from or compensation to original creators. Several high-profile lawsuits filed in 2024 challenged this practice, arguing that it constitutes systematic copyright infringement on an unprecedented scale. These legal challenges have created uncertainty throughout creative industries. Award organizations like SFWA face pressure to establish clear ethical positions while courts gradually develop legal precedents. Their decisions reflect not just artistic preferences but also risk management considerations in an evolving legal landscape. Economic Implications for Creative Professionals The AI bans implemented by SFWA and Comic-Con carry significant economic implications for working creatives. By establishing clear boundaries against AI-generated content, these policies help protect human creators from automated competition in prestigious venues and award competitions. This protection matters particularly for emerging artists and writers who rely on recognition and exhibition opportunities to build their careers. Industry analysts note several economic effects already emerging from these policies: Market differentiation: Human-created work gains premium status Career protection: Emerging creators face less automated competition Value preservation: Artistic authenticity maintains economic value Industry standards: Clear guidelines reduce market confusion These economic considerations intersect with broader questions about technological displacement across creative professions. While some analysts predicted widespread AI replacement of human creatives, the strong institutional resistance demonstrated by SFWA and Comic-Con suggests that human creativity may retain distinctive value that audiences and institutions continue to prioritize. Conclusion The generative AI bans implemented by science fiction writers and Comic-Con represent a watershed moment in the relationship between technology and creativity. These decisions reflect deep-seated concerns about artistic authenticity, economic fairness, and the fundamental nature of human expression in an increasingly automated world. While AI technology continues advancing rapidly, major creative institutions have drawn clear boundaries that prioritize human creativity over algorithmic generation. The ongoing debate about AI’s role in creative industries will likely intensify throughout 2025 as technology improves and institutional responses evolve. What remains clear is that human creativity maintains distinctive value that major cultural institutions continue to recognize and protect through policies like the generative AI ban. FAQs Q1: What exactly did SFWA ban regarding AI? The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association prohibited any work “written, either wholly or partially, by generative large language model tools” from eligibility for its prestigious Nebula Awards, implementing one of the strictest AI policies in literary awards. Q2: Why did Comic-Con change its AI art policy? San Diego Comic-Con changed from allowing AI-generated art exhibition (but not sales) to a complete ban after artists protested, with art show director Glen Wooten stating that “more strident language is necessary” as AI art generation became more prevalent and problematic. Q3: How do these bans affect writers using standard writing software?
