While many investors remain cautious about the possibility of a prolonged correction, Fencer projects strong growth for several top tokens by the end of 2025, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin (BNB), and XRP. BNB Could Approach $3,300 In his latest forecast , Fencer stated that Binance Coin has the potential to rise to a range of $2,800 to $3,300 before the close of 2025. At the time of his analysis, BNB was trading near $833, reflecting a minor daily decline of 1.2% but a year-over-year increase of 46%. My Q4 2025 targets: $BTC : $215K – $230K $ETH : $9K – $12K $BNB : $2.8K – $3.3K $SOL : $800 – $900 $XRP : $8.5 – $9 $DOGE : $1 – $2.5 $LINK : $250 – $400 $ENA : $2 – $3 $PENGU : $0.7 – $1 #FARTCOIN : $4.5 – $6.5 If this looks crazy to you, You're a fool — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) August 19, 2025 Only days earlier, the asset had established a new all-time high of $848, joining a limited group of cryptocurrencies to achieve fresh records in the current market cycle. To reach the upper end of Fencer’s target, BNB would need to increase more than fourfold from its present price. Such a rally would lift its market capitalization to nearly $500 billion, a level that would place it among the world’s largest publicly traded companies, rivaling firms such as Mastercard and Netflix. XRP Outlook Between $8.50 and $9 Fencer also highlighted XRP, setting an end-of-year price target of $8.50 to $9 . The token is presently trading around $2.90 , reflecting a daily increase of 0.36%. Unlike BNB, XRP has not yet surpassed its historic peak but did record a multi-year high of $3.66 in July. Achieving Fencer’s projected range would mark a threefold increase from current levels and would push XRP’s market capitalization above $530 billion, approaching Ethereum’s highest historical valuations. While this estimate is bullish, it remains moderate compared to predictions from other analysts. For example, Alex Cobb has suggested that XRP could rise to $22 in December, while more extreme projections place its potential year-end value between $50 and $99. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Targets Fencer’s broader market outlook includes significant gains for Bitcoin and Ethereum. He forecasts Bitcoin reaching between $215,000 and $230,000 by the fourth quarter of 2025. At present, Bitcoin trades near $113,138, below its recent peak of $124,400. For Ethereum, Fencer anticipates a price range of $9,000 to $12,000. This aligns with forecasts from other bullish commentators, including Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has suggested Ethereum could reach $15,000 by the end of the year. The asset currently trades at approximately $4,281 Predictions for Solana, Dogecoin, and Other Assets Fencer’s projections extend beyond the most widely followed cryptocurrencies. He expects Solana to trade between $800 and $900, representing a more than fourfold increase from current levels. For Dogecoin, he anticipates a price between $1 and $2.50, a milestone that would mark its highest valuation to date. Chainlink is also on his list, with a projected value of $250 to $400 compared to its current trading price of around $24. In addition, Fencer included smaller projects in his analysis, predicting ENA could climb to $2–$3, PENGU to $0.70–$1, and FARTCOIN to $4.50–$6.50. Fencer’s outlook reflects continued optimism among crypto analysts who believe that leading digital assets are positioned for significant growth despite short-term market fluctuations. While his projections for XRP, BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum suggest substantial upside, they also highlight the speculative nature of the market, where expectations can vary widely.

Hwang has admitted to using 4.3 billion won ($3.1 million) worth of funds belonging to her entertainment agency to buy cryptoassets in 2022. Hwang Jung-eum: Crypto Charges Prosecutors claim that the star also took out an 800 million won ($571,866) loan in July 2022 under the same company’s name.

(Source: MBC/Screenshot) They told a branch of the Jeju District Court that Hwang then sent most of these funds to her personal bank account, and then used this money to buy crypto. Prosecutors presented evidence that she made over a dozen similar transactions in 2022, repeatedly using company money to buy coins. They also accused Hwang of using company funds to pay her bills, including property levies and local taxes. Her defence team asked the court for leniency, claiming that she had since sold her assets to pay the company back. The court is set to reconvene in late September for sentencing. Hwang shot to fame in the late 2000s when she appeared in the hit MBC sitcom High Kick Through The Roof . She has also appeared in more recent hit dramas, such as Kill Me, Heal Me (2015) and The Escape of the Seven (2023–2024).

Hwang apologized and said she had had “reflected” on her actions.” Hwang’s defense team also asked the court to consider the fact that the company is question was a one-person agency. A lawyer told the court: “The defendant created the company to manage her own entertainment industry activities. She owns 100% of the shares, and no other entertainers are affiliated with it.” The lawyer added that Hwang had shown “immaturity.” But the attorney said the actress was “deeply reflecting” on the nature of her wrongdoings.

Since its launch in September 2024, Coinbase’s innovative synthetic Bitcoin product, cbBTC , has achieved remarkable growth. This surge marks a pivotal moment, especially as its counterpart, wBTC, experiences a notable decline. What is cbBTC and Why is it Expanding Rapidly? cbBTC , a synthetic Bitcoin product offered by Coinbase, allows users to access Bitcoin’s value within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Launched in September 2024, its journey has been nothing short of impressive. According to data from The Block, cbBTC has grown from a modest 1,000 tokens to more than 30,500 tokens. This represents an astonishing increase of over 160% year to date. Several factors contribute to this rapid expansion: Institutional Backing: As a product from Coinbase, a regulated and trusted exchange, cbBTC likely benefits from institutional confidence and easier access for larger players. Ease of Access: Coinbase’s extensive user base and streamlined integration could be making it simpler for users to acquire and utilize cbBTC within supported DeFi protocols. Market Demand: There is a clear and growing demand for Bitcoin exposure within DeFi, and cbBTC is effectively capturing a significant portion of this market. Is wBTC Losing Its Dominance? The Shifting Landscape In stark contrast to cbBTC ’s ascent, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), which has long been the largest synthetic Bitcoin product on Ethereum, is facing a significant challenge. Since the debut of cbBTC , wBTC’s supply has fallen by 17%. Furthermore, its supply is down 4% so far this year. This decline signals a potential shift in the synthetic Bitcoin market dynamics. Why might wBTC be experiencing this downturn? Competition: The emergence of strong competitors like cbBTC naturally fragments the market. Market Sentiment: Broader market trends and user preferences may be influencing the choice between different synthetic Bitcoin options. Centralization Debates: While wBTC has its own centralized aspects, the discussion around centralization in general could be leading some users to explore newer alternatives or reconsider their holdings. Understanding the Centralization Concerns Around cbBTC Despite its impressive growth, cbBTC has not been without its critics. Concerns regarding its centralization and transparency have drawn considerable scrutiny. Prominent figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun, have voiced warnings that cbBTC could pose significant risks to the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. The core of these concerns revolves around: Single Point of Failure: As a product managed by a single entity (Coinbase), critics argue it introduces a centralized risk that goes against the ethos of decentralization. Transparency: Questions arise about the real-time auditing and collateralization mechanisms, which might not be as transparent as some fully decentralized alternatives. Regulatory Influence: A centralized issuer like Coinbase is subject to regulatory pressures, which could, in theory, impact the availability or functionality of cbBTC . These discussions highlight the ongoing tension between institutional involvement and the foundational principles of DeFi. What Does cbBTC’s Expansion Mean for Your Portfolio? The rapid expansion of cbBTC and the concurrent decline of wBTC signal a dynamic and evolving landscape for synthetic Bitcoin. For investors and DeFi participants, understanding these shifts is crucial. While cbBTC offers a new avenue for Bitcoin exposure within DeFi, it also brings a different risk profile compared to more decentralized options. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify: Do not put all your synthetic Bitcoin exposure into one product. Explore different options and understand their underlying mechanisms. Assess Risk: Evaluate the centralization risks associated with cbBTC and how they align with your personal risk tolerance. Stay Informed: The synthetic asset space is constantly changing. Keep abreast of new developments, regulatory changes, and community discussions surrounding these products. The rise of cbBTC is undeniably a major development, showcasing Coinbase’s growing influence in the DeFi space. The cryptocurrency market is always evolving, and the story of cbBTC versus wBTC is a compelling example of innovation meeting traditional structures. While cbBTC ’s impressive growth underscores a strong demand for institutionally-backed synthetic assets, the critical discussions around centralization are vital. As the DeFi ecosystem matures, the balance between accessibility, trust, and true decentralization will continue to shape the future of products like cbBTC . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a synthetic Bitcoin product like cbBTC? A1: A synthetic Bitcoin product is a token that represents the value of Bitcoin on another blockchain, typically Ethereum. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi activities without directly moving their native BTC, which operates on its own blockchain. Q2: How does cbBTC differ from wBTC? A2: Both are synthetic Bitcoin tokens, but cbBTC is issued and managed by Coinbase, a centralized exchange, while wBTC is a more community-driven initiative backed by a consortium of custodians and merchants. This difference often leads to varying levels of centralization and transparency. Q3: Why are there concerns about cbBTC’s centralization? A3: Critics argue that because Coinbase controls the issuance and redemption of cbBTC , it introduces a single point of control and potential failure. This goes against the decentralized nature of many DeFi protocols and could lead to censorship or asset freezing under certain circumstances. Q4: What are the benefits of using cbBTC in DeFi? A4: Benefits include leveraging Coinbase’s brand trust and regulatory compliance, potentially lower fees for Coinbase users, and seamless integration within Coinbase’s ecosystem. It offers a straightforward way for their users to get Bitcoin exposure in DeFi. Q5: Should I be worried about wBTC’s decline? A5: While wBTC’s supply has decreased, it remains a significant asset in DeFi. Its decline relative to cbBTC suggests a shift in market preference or new competition, rather than an inherent failure of wBTC itself. Users should always assess their own risk tolerance and diversification strategies. Q6: How does cbBTC impact the overall DeFi ecosystem? A6: cbBTC ‘s growth brings more institutional liquidity and users into DeFi, which can be beneficial. However, it also intensifies the debate around centralization and the role of large entities in a decentralized space, potentially influencing how future DeFi protocols are designed and adopted.

50466986,562109,1755820825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50466986.jpeg,"Bitcoin HODLers Have Already Realized More Profit Than Last Cycle, Report Reveals",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hodlers-realized-profit-last-cycle-report/,"A report from Glassnode suggests Bitcoin long-term holders have already realized more profit this cycle than in most of the previous ones. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Profit-Taking Could Hint At Late-Stage Bull Phase In its latest weekly report, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the cumulative profit taken by the long-term holders (LTHs) has looked in the current cycle so far. The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. Statistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they are to move/sell them in the future. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are made up of the diamond hands of the market. Though while this cohort does tend to sit silent for long stretches, it doesn’t mean its members don’t participate in selling ever. Thanks to their patience, the LTHs rack up large gains over the course of a cycle, and eventually, there comes a point where the temptation of profit-taking is too much for even these resolute hands to ward off. Peaks in their profit realization have historically defined the extreme phase of the cycle. As such, it can be worth tracking how much profit these holders are taking. One way to do so is through the Realized Profit indicator. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the cumulative Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit starting from when BTC set a new all-time high (ATH) in each cycle, to the cycle’s final peak. The reason the analytics firm has picked the first ATH breakout as the start point is that these HODLers typically only ramp up their profit-taking around then. The bull run continues as long as enough demand is coming in to absorb their selling, and once inflows run out, the cycle hits its peak. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit has totaled 3.27 million BTC in the current cycle so far. This is more than all previous cycles, except for the 2017 bull run. The trend could be a potential hint that the cryptocurrency is in the late stage of its current cycle. Another metric that could point to a similar conclusion is the Percent Supply in Profit . As displayed in the chart, the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit has exceeded a value one standard deviation above its mean on 273 days in this cycle. This is the second-highest on record, with the 2016-2018 cycle once again being the only one with more. While both of these metrics support the idea of Bitcoin being in an extreme phase, there still remains the possibility that the current cycle will simply turn out to be different from the previous ones. As such, it only remains to be seen how things play out from here. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $113,400, down almost 4% over the past week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin HODLers|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin Realized Profit|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 00:00:25

But the real engine that drives a blockchain’s success is often its ability to pull in and retain developers. BlockDAG is nailing this aspect, shaping a space where coders, builders, and innovators can thrive. The chain’s toolkit includes detailed documentation, strong SDKs and APIs, plus a generous grants initiative that empowers developers to create dApps, NFTs, and DeFi platforms with ease. Add to that a presale tally that has already surged past $379M, more than 25 billion coins sold, and an ROI of 2,660% from batch 1 to batch 29’s price of $0.0276, and the excitement is hard to ignore. BlockDAG Makes Coding Simple and Scalable At the center of BlockDAG’s expansion is its focus on giving developers the smoothest path possible. Its extensive documentation lays out everything from smart contract deployment to advanced DeFi structures. SDKs and APIs provide ready-made tools and plug-ins, letting coders skip repetitive work and instead highlight what makes their projects stand out. This streamlined support system is one reason BlockDAG is showing up in bullish crypto discussions everywhere. Developers can jump in and build without roadblocks, which means projects launch faster, adoption widens, and the overall ecosystem grows stronger. In blockchain, having an active builder base often pushes growth just as much as tokenomics or marketing, and BlockDAG is putting that belief into practice. By focusing on real usability rather than hype, it creates a cycle where each new project brings more users, and each wave of users fuels fresh opportunities for builders. Turning Ambition Into Reality with BlockDAG Rewards Tools make life easier, but incentives are what move ideas into reality. BlockDAG’s well-structured grants program is designed to back ambitious builders from day one. Whether the goal is a DeFi platform, a cross-chain NFT marketplace, or a new gaming project, the program helps fuel creation by providing essential support. These initiatives also open direct revenue channels for developers. Projects on BlockDAG can earn through transaction activity, project launches, and ecosystem rewards, making it worthwhile to keep building. This alignment between creators and the platform echoes what’s often seen in strong bullish crypto stories, where those who build early are positioned to benefit most from the network’s growth. On top of this, grants encourage experimentation, allowing devs to take risks on fresh concepts without the fear of limited resources, which often sparks breakthrough projects that capture attention across the crypto space. Why Devs Trust BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum Developer interest usually reflects community enthusiasm, and BlockDAG’s presale performance is proof of that. The project has already raised $379M, sold 25 billion coins, and reached batch 29 with a price of $0.0276. Since the very first batch, early buyers have already seen a gain of 2,660%, while the confirmed launch price sits at $0.05. For developers, these milestones signal three things: future liquidity is lined up, there’s a large holder base who could become users of their apps, and the project has deep financial resources to keep scaling its tech. That combination makes BlockDAG more than a blockchain startup, it’s a developer-driven hub with the backing to emerge as one of the standout bullish cryptos in the coming cycle. Strong presale momentum also sends a message of stability, showing that the platform has both the attention and support needed to sustain its ambitious roadmap. Looking Ahead The BlockDAG blueprint shows that the real key to becoming the next bullish crypto isn’t hype, it’s building the right framework. With high-quality dev tools, a grants program fueling creativity, and a record-breaking presale, the chain is laying down the pillars of lasting growth. Builders gain access to resources and monetization opportunities, coin holders see a growing ecosystem that drives real usage, and the entire network benefits from an expanding base of applications. Thanks to this developer-first approach, BlockDAG isn’t just gathering attention; it’s gearing up to lead the next era of blockchain adoption and long-term value creation.

The Cardano (ADA) market forecast has shifted bullish after Grayscale’s ETF filing, with potential for a 50–60% rally if technical resistance breaks. At the same time, the Pepe (PEPE) market trend shows a 4–5% dip, yet whales are quietly stacking tokens, a strong sign of confidence. Amid these moves, a different story is unfolding. Cold Wallet is gaining attention for its utility-first approach, offering investors a product with real-world value. In a market driven by memes and speculation, genuine usability may prove to be the best new crypto to buy . Cardano (ADA) Market Forecast: ETF Filing Fuels Breakout Hopes The Cardano (ADA) market forecast is drawing headlines after Grayscale filed for an ADA Trust ETF. The coin recently broke a textbook double bottom pattern, clearing $0.86 resistance. Now trading around $0.99 and holding above its 20- and 50-day moving averages, ADA is showing momentum that could take it to $1.21, with a further push toward $1.50 possible. Analysts highlight how ETF filings boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past, suggesting ADA could see a similar lift. Institutional demand and stronger investor confidence may act as long-term support. Beyond price action, Cardano continues to expand its smart contract ecosystem and improve performance through upgrades. Its academic foundation and evolving DeFi layers give it substance beyond charts, making ADA a serious contender when considering the best new crypto to buy . Pepe (PEPE) Market Trend: Whales Buying as Prices Slide Despite a 4–5% correction, the Pepe (PEPE) market trend shows signs of accumulation. Blockchain data reveals whale wallets on Ethereum boosted their PEPE holdings by 3.2% recently, while exchange balances dropped, clear signals of long-term confidence. Currently, PEPE trades in a range near $0.0000118 to $0.000012, struggling to break overhead resistance. Trading volume has eased, but large-scale buying by whales often precedes fresh breakouts. While PEPE remains highly volatile, its mix of retail exits and whale entry creates opportunities. Still, as an option for the best new crypto to buy , it depends heavily on sentiment cycles and whether big holders keep accumulating. Cold Wallet: Utility-Focused Approach Gains Traction While ADA and PEPE dominate headlines, Cold Wallet is building value on usability. The project offers a mobile-first self-custody wallet that rewards users with transaction-based cashback. Instead of speculative hype, it delivers real-world functionality. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, Cold Wallet has already raised more than $6.35 million. Each presale stage increases token price, creating scarcity while rewarding early adopters. The sign-up process is frictionless, no KYC, no delays. Users can swap, transfer, or bridge crypto instantly, weaving the wallet into their daily use. Loyalty comes from convenience and trust, not memes or hype. Looking ahead, the team plans to integrate Layer 2 solutions for gas-free rewards, making transactions smoother. Cold Wallet’s utility-first design positions it as a crypto with staying power. For those seeking the best new crypto to buy , its structured and practical model is a compelling option. Outlook Ahead The Cardano (ADA) market forecast benefits from ETF buzz and technical breakouts, offering strong potential for disciplined investors. The Pepe (PEPE) market trend remains a high-risk play, but whale accumulation points to speculative upside. Cold Wallet, however, presents a distinct alternative, one rooted in daily usability, structured presale growth, and a clear product roadmap. For investors focused on long-term value, it may be the best new crypto to buy , delivering a mix of clarity, structure, and real utility in a market often dominated by fleeting hype.

50464905,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79608,1755820855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple’s Escrow Could Soon Be Emptied. Here’s When,https://timestabloid.com/heres-when-ripples-escrow-could-be-emptied/,"Ripple’s escrow system , which was introduced to manage the controlled release of XRP into circulation, is gradually moving toward eventual depletion. Current data indicates that 35.6 billion XRP remains locked in escrow, and based on existing release patterns, analysts suggest the reserves may last less than a decade if the current pace is maintained. Escrow Background and Current Status In December 2017, Ripple placed more than 54 billion XRP into escrow accounts to regulate supply and prevent sudden market flooding. Under this framework, 1 billion XRP is scheduled for release each month . However, Ripple routinely locks back a large share of the released tokens, effectively reducing the net amount that enters circulation. As of August 2025, approximately 35.6 billion XRP is still locked across Ripple-controlled escrow wallets, collectively valued at around $106.8 billion. This figure marks a substantial drawdown from the original allocation, underscoring the steady pace at which the reserves are being used. Release and Re-Lock Activity in 2025 Ripple’s transactions in 2025 show a relatively consistent trend. Between January and August, the company executed its standard release of 1 billion XRP each month. Of this amount, 700 million XRP was typically re-locked, leaving 300 million XRP available for use. The only deviation occurred in June, when 670 million XRP was returned to escrow, resulting in a slightly higher net usage of 330 million XRP for that month. This pattern suggests that Ripple is drawing down approximately 300 million XRP monthly, which provides a clear basis for projecting when the reserves might run out under different scenarios. Depletion Projections Analysis from the tracking account “XRP Liquidity,” which monitors Ripple’s escrow behavior, offers multiple timelines based on varying release patterns; if Ripple continues its current pace of utilizing about 300 million XRP per month, the escrow could be fully depleted in roughly 9 years and 8 months, placing the end date near 2035. After September’s re-locking, the balance will fall to approximately 35.3 billion XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If monthly usage rises to 400 million XRP, the reserves would not last as long, with projections showing depletion in about 7.5 years, around 2033. Similarly, if Ripple halted all re-locking, the pace would accelerate significantly. In this scenario, 12 billion XRP would enter circulation annually, which would empty the escrow in only three years. These varying timelines highlight how changes in Ripple’s monthly decisions directly affect the long-term outlook for its controlled holdings. Ripple’s escrow mechanism remains a central focus for the XRP community, as it determines the pace at which new tokens are released into circulation. If the current release and re-lock pattern is maintained, the reserves could extend for nearly a decade. However, any increase in usage or a decision to retain more XRP in circulation would shorten the timeline considerably, with depletion possible in as little as three years. Given these dynamics, market participants continue to watch Ripple’s monthly escrow activity closely, viewing each release as an indicator of how long the company’s holdings will last and how supply conditions may evolve.

Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ Leah Wald told members of the press she expects bitcoin to make a steep move before year end. Her baseline? The vaunted $175,000 mark – a price she called a conservative read compared to some loftier forecasts. The market has already surprised a lot of people — bitcoin hit about $124,000 recently — so big swings are not impossible. Institutional Interest Drives Momentum According to Wald, part of the push comes from big money moving in. She pointed to companies like BlackRock and high-profile investors such as Cathie Wood, and she referenced how comments from leaders like Larry Fink have shifted conversations. Those voices bring models and balance-sheet plans that, she said during a CNBC TV18 interview, support much higher price targets than people used to expect. The industry’s own scars are still visible. After the FTX collapse many firms were de-banked and trust took a hit. But Wald argues that the picture has changed: banks and asset managers are opening doors again, and that makes it easier for large managers to put serious capital into crypto. That doesn’t erase risk though, but it does change how big investors approach the market. Long-Term Bets Stay Very Ambitious Based on reports, some forecasts stretch far beyond this year. Wald mentioned projections showing bitcoin at $1 million by 2030, a level that would dwarf current prices. Those long-range calls are driven by assumptions about adoption, limited supply and the role bitcoin could play in institutional portfolios. Whether reality matches those models is another question. Shorter-term math matters too. If bitcoin were to reach $175,000 before year end, that would be a rapid climb from recent levels around $124,000. Traders and managers watching volatility know such moves can happen, but they also know the path is rarely straight. Expectations, flows, and news — all of it moves markets fast.

She sees a bigger change: mainstream finance is being rebuilt on blockchain tools, she said, and that shift is moving the conversation away from short-term trading toward how the system is built and run. Nation-states thinking about adoption and big asset managers planning custody services are part of that picture, she added, and those pieces matter for how prices form.

Wealthy families and their dedicated family offices are increasingly turning their attention to crypto investments . A recent Reuters report highlights this growing trend, signaling a new era for digital assets within traditional portfolios. This surge in interest isn’t random. It’s driven by evolving regulatory landscapes and a deeper understanding of the immense potential held by cryptocurrencies. This embrace suggests a move beyond mere speculation towards strategic portfolio diversification. Why Are Asian Family Offices Embracing Crypto Investments? Several factors are contributing to this notable pivot towards crypto investments . Regulatory developments, especially in the United States and Hong Kong, are playing a crucial role. Hong Kong’s new stablecoin law, for instance, provides a clearer framework, instilling confidence among institutional investors. This regulatory clarity helps demystify the asset class. It makes digital assets more accessible and less intimidating for traditional wealth managers. Consequently, more family offices feel secure enough to explore this new frontier. UBS, a leading global financial services firm, has observed this firsthand. They note that some overseas Chinese family offices are planning to allocate approximately 5% of their substantial portfolios to cryptocurrencies. This allocation, while seemingly modest, represents a significant vote of confidence given the sheer scale of wealth managed by these entities. It underscores a strategic move to diversify and capture growth opportunities in the digital realm. This isn’t just about chasing trends; it’s about long-term portfolio optimization. Evolving Strategies for Crypto Investments Initially, many of these wealthy investors approached the market cautiously. Industry observers point out that their journey into crypto investments often began with more regulated and familiar instruments, such as Bitcoin ETFs. These exchange-traded funds offered a convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. Investors could participate without directly holding the underlying asset, providing a lower-risk entry point. However, as comfort levels and understanding have grown, a noticeable shift is occurring. Many are now moving beyond ETFs towards direct token holdings. This transition suggests a deeper commitment and a desire for greater control and potential returns. Furthermore, some sophisticated family offices are adopting market-neutral strategies, like arbitrage. These strategies aim to profit from price discrepancies across different exchanges or markets. They minimize exposure to overall market volatility while still actively engaging with digital assets. The Impact of Increased Crypto Investments on Market Activity This surge in interest from Asian family offices coincides with a noticeable uptick in overall cryptocurrency trading activity across the region. The numbers speak volumes, showcasing robust market growth: Hong Kong’s HashKey Exchange: Recorded an impressive 85% year-on-year rise in users by August 2025, indicating robust growth in participation. South Korea’s Major Exchanges: Posted a substantial 17% gain in trading volumes , reflecting increased liquidity and investor engagement. Average Daily Trading: Across the board, average daily trading has seen more than 20% growth , showcasing a vibrant and active market. These figures demonstrate that the institutional embrace of crypto investments is not just theoretical. It’s translating into tangible market expansion and increased adoption. The growing user base and trading volumes create a more mature and liquid environment, which in turn attracts even more institutional capital. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investments? The increasing allocation of wealth from Asian family offices into crypto investments signals a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. It suggests a broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial portfolios. This trend could lead to several positive outcomes: Increased Stability: Larger capital inflows from long-term investors may help stabilize the often-volatile crypto market, reducing extreme price swings. Enhanced Legitimacy: The involvement of respected family offices adds significant credibility to the asset class, encouraging further institutional and retail adoption globally. Innovation and Development: More capital means more resources for blockchain innovation. This will lead to better infrastructure, enhanced security, and new, practical use cases for digital assets. This isn’t merely about a speculative gamble; it’s about strategic diversification. It’s also about recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. As regulations continue to evolve and understanding deepens, we can expect this trend to gain even more momentum, shaping the financial landscape for years to come. The strategic shift by Asian family offices towards significant crypto investments marks a powerful endorsement of digital assets. Driven by clearer regulations and a pursuit of diversification, this trend is reshaping how wealth is managed and grown across the region. Their cautious yet growing engagement, from initial Bitcoin ETFs to direct holdings and sophisticated arbitrage strategies, underscores a maturing market. This institutional embrace is not only boosting trading volumes but also solidifying the legitimacy and future potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem globally. It’s clear: crypto is no longer a niche interest but a compelling, integral part of the modern investment portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How are Asian family offices investing in crypto? A1: They are starting with Bitcoin ETFs and moving towards direct token holdings.

Shares rose 4.5% in after-hours trading. The company said putting AI across its lineup and adding new services is supporting growth in its core meetings product while helping it move into new areas. Zoom, which saw a spike in users during COVID-19 lockdowns as meetings shifted online, raised guidance for the current fiscal year. Accordinf to Reuters , it now projects fiscal 2026 revenue of $4.83 billion to $4.84 billion, compared with a prior range of $4.80 billion to $4.81 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.81 to $5.84, up from $5.56 to $5.59. For the third quarter, Zoom forecast revenue of $1.21 billion to $1.22 billion, slightly ahead of the $1.21 billion average estimate from LSEG. For the second quarter ended July 31, revenue reached $1.22 billion versus expectations of $1.20 billion. Adjusted earnings were $1.53 a share, topping the $1.37 analysts had predicted. In June, Zoom introduced Virtual Agent 2.0, built on agentic AI, to handle tasks such as returns, account updates, and appointment booking without human help. In July, it rolled out more agentic AI features, including a Custom AI Companion add-on that lets small businesses use AI Companion with third-party video services like Google Meet. Zoom Virtual Agent for phone support can replace receptionists This week Zoom introduced Virtual Agent for Zoom Phone, a 24/7 AI concierge that can replace receptionists. The tool is meant to greet callers in natural language, fulfill requests, and trigger follow-up steps to cut missed calls and wait times. At launch, it supports English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Japanese, with more languages planned. Zoom said the Virtual Agent can route calls on its own so customers move toward a solution without a person answering. Zoom describes the Virtual Agent as an AI receptionist. “By combining AI that can listen, understand, and take action with the reach of Zoom Phone, our concierge virtual agent provides seamless and personalized support to all callers,” Chief Product Officer Smita Hashim said. The company said organizations can set it up without code by training the agent with existing documents or by pointing it to a website. “The result is a faster, more personalized, and more scalable experience for everyone,” Hashim added. Examples cited by Zoom include booking visits in healthcare, checking stock and answering product questions in retail, and sending updates in financial services.

It operates on a simple principle: when investors are too fearful, it could signal a buying opportunity. Conversely, when they are excessively greedy, it might indicate that a correction is imminent. This index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing “extreme fear” and 100 indicating “extreme greed.” A score of 50, as we see currently, places the market squarely in the “Neutral” zone. This suggests a period where neither fear nor greed dominates investor decisions. It’s a moment of equilibrium, where market participants are perhaps taking a pause, waiting for clearer signals, or simply reacting to existing data without strong emotional bias. Understanding this balance is key to making informed decisions. Decoding a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index A neutral reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be interpreted in several ways. It’s not necessarily a call to action, but rather an indication of the current market psychology. Here’s what it could imply: Market Indecision: Investors might be unsure about the next major price movement, leading to sideways trading. Balanced Forces: Buying and selling pressures are relatively equal, preventing significant swings in either direction. Waiting for Catalysts: The market could be anticipating a major news event, regulatory update, or technological development that will break the deadlock. Reduced Volatility: A neutral stance often accompanies periods of lower volatility, which can be a relief after intense price fluctuations. For savvy investors, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a chance to re-evaluate portfolios and strategies without the emotional pressure of extreme market conditions. It’s an opportunity to conduct thorough research and plan for potential future shifts. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The methodology behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is robust, incorporating a blend of factors to provide a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Alternative, the platform behind the index, considers six distinct components, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum with long-term averages. High buying volume in a strong market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the number of cryptocurrency-related hashtags and interactions on various social media platforms, along with the speed of these interactions. Increased positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: Surveys are currently paused, impacting this component’s contribution.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising Bitcoin dominance often signals fear in altcoin markets as investors flock to the perceived safety of BTC. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in “Bitcoin price manipulation” searches, for example, might suggest fear. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to offer a holistic and objective measure of the market’s emotional temperature, helping to cut through the noise. Navigating Market Sentiment with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool, it’s essential to use it as part of a broader analytical framework. It provides insight into sentiment, but it does not predict future price movements with certainty. Investors should consider it alongside fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors. For example, during a neutral phase, you might choose to: Refine your Watchlist: Identify promising projects that are consolidating. Educate Yourself: Use this calmer period to deepen your understanding of blockchain technology and new crypto innovations. Dollar-Cost Average: Continue your regular investment schedule, taking advantage of potentially stable prices. Manage Risk: Re-evaluate your stop-loss orders and portfolio allocation. The index is a powerful indicator of human psychology in action, reminding us that emotions often drive market behavior. A neutral reading simply means that for now, the crowd is holding its breath. In Summary: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 50, in its neutral stance, offers a moment of calm in the often-turbulent crypto seas. It’s a period of equilibrium, reflecting balanced market sentiment rather than extreme fear or greed. While not a standalone investment guide, it serves as a crucial indicator, helping investors understand the collective psychology of the market. Use this insight to make rational, data-driven decisions, rather than being swayed by fleeting emotions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A1: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the prevailing emotional sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Q2: How should I interpret a “Neutral” reading of 50 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A2: A “Neutral” reading of 50 indicates a balanced market where neither fear nor greed is dominant. It suggests indecision among investors and often precedes periods of consolidation or anticipation for new catalysts. Q3: What are the main factors used to calculate the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A3: The index considers six factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Q4: Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict future price movements? A4: No, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a predictive tool. It reflects current market psychology but should be used in conjunction with other analytical methods for making investment decisions. Q5: Where can I find the latest Crypto Fear & Greed Index value? A5: The latest value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is typically provided by platforms like Alternative.me and is often cited by cryptocurrency news outlets.

A massive Bitcoin options expiration is looming on August 22, involving a staggering $3.8 billion worth of BTC options. This isn’t just a number; it’s a market dynamic that could influence Bitcoin’s price action and broader crypto sentiment. Understanding these expiries is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset landscape. What’s Happening with Bitcoin Options Expiration? On August 22, precisely at 08:00 UTC, a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) options will reach their maturity. Data from Deribit, a leading crypto options exchange, highlights the scale of this event. Total Value: Nearly $3.8 billion in Bitcoin options are set to expire. Put/Call Ratio: This stands at 1.30. A ratio above 1 suggests more put options (bets on price going down) than call options (bets on price going up), indicating a potentially bearish sentiment among traders for this expiry. Max Pain Price: For Bitcoin, the max pain price is currently $118,000. This confluence of factors creates a fascinating scenario for market observers. However, Bitcoin isn’t the only asset in the spotlight. Ethereum’s Max Pain and Options Expiry Alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) also faces a considerable options expiry on the very same day. Approximately $930 million worth of ETH options will mature. Put/Call Ratio: Ethereum’s ratio is 0.83. Unlike Bitcoin, this ratio is below 1, indicating a slightly more bullish or balanced sentiment among ETH options traders for this specific expiry. Max Pain Price: The max pain price for Ethereum is $4,250. Understanding the “max pain price” is vital to grasp the potential implications of these expiries. Demystifying Max Pain Price in Crypto Options The term “max pain price” might sound intimidating, but its concept is quite straightforward. It refers to the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing the maximum financial loss for options holders. Conversely, this often translates to maximum profit for options writers (those who sold the options). Here’s a simpler way to look at it: For Buyers: If the price settles at max pain, most options buyers lose their premium. For Sellers (Writers): This is where options sellers make the most profit. Therefore, some analysts believe that market makers and large institutions, who often write options, might try to steer the price towards this point as expiration nears. However, it’s important to remember that max pain is a theoretical point and not a guaranteed outcome. What Could This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for the Market? The sheer volume of this Bitcoin options expiration suggests potential volatility. While the market doesn’t always gravitate precisely to the max pain price, it can act as a magnet, especially in less liquid markets or during periods of low trading volume. Consider these potential impacts: Increased Volatility: As traders adjust positions, close contracts, or hedge, price swings can occur. Price Convergence: There might be a tendency for prices to move closer to the max pain level in the hours leading up to expiry. Market Sentiment: A high put/call ratio, like Bitcoin’s 1.30, could signal underlying bearish sentiment, but it also reflects hedging strategies. It’s crucial for traders to monitor price action and volume around the expiry time. However, it’s equally important to avoid making rash decisions based solely on options expiry data. The upcoming Bitcoin options expiration on August 22, coupled with the significant Ethereum expiry, marks a key date for crypto market participants. While the max pain price provides an interesting data point, it is just one factor among many influencing cryptocurrency prices. Smart traders will combine this information with broader market analysis, technical indicators, and fundamental news to make informed decisions. Stay vigilant, and remember that the crypto market is always full of surprises! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin options expiration? A Bitcoin options expiration is the date and time when Bitcoin options contracts cease to be valid. At this point, holders must decide whether to exercise their options or let them expire worthless, which can influence market dynamics. 2. What is the “max pain price” in crypto options? The “max pain price” is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, resulting in the maximum financial loss for the majority of options buyers. 3. How does the put/call ratio indicate market sentiment? The put/call ratio compares the volume of put options (bets on price decline) to call options (bets on price increase). A ratio above 1 typically suggests bearish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 can indicate bullish or neutral sentiment. 4. Will the Bitcoin options expiration definitely cause a price drop? Not necessarily. While options expiries can increase volatility and sometimes draw prices towards the max pain point, they are just one factor among many influencing market prices. Broader market sentiment, news, and technical analysis also play significant roles. 5. What should traders do around an options expiration event? Traders should monitor price action, trading volume, and market sentiment closely. It’s advisable to combine options data with other forms of analysis and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on expiry information. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Originally issued in April 2022, the order cited Anchorage’s failure to meet federal standards for anti-money-laundering (AML) controls and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), pointing to shortcomings in its compliance program. After three years of remediation, the OCC confirmed that Anchorage has addressed those deficiencies. The regulator concluded that the bank is now secure, well-managed, and fully compliant with federal requirements. Regulators verify Anchorage resolved AML fissures The OCC’s discontinuance order emphasized that the consent decree against Anchorage Digital is unnecessary. The regulator said the bank’s compliance program now “satisfies the high expectations” required of any federally chartered institution. This comprises AML, customer credit report, and suspicious activity reporting controls. Anchorage responded with sweeping changes. The firm has hired compliance professionals with experience in both banking and digital assets. It hired outside experts to develop stronger frameworks. Sophisticated surveillance systems were rolled out to spot suspicious trading patterns, and automation tools became faster and better at reporting to overseers. Anchorage also ramped up staff training to ensure compliance obligations were understood at every level. Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley described the OCC’s decision as a landmark for the digital asset industry. He said the bank had exceeded requirements by using the challenge to strengthen its systems. He added that Anchorage had turned regulatory feedback into a compliance success and now positioned itself as the world’s most regulated digital asset bank. The outcome underscores the difference between Anchorage and other crypto firms. Although Anchorage embraced federal oversight and strived to meet stringent standards, many such firms have resisted or wound up in court fights with U.S. regulators. Others have gone so far as to flee the country. Anchorage CEO said the firm deliberately chose the tougher path of seeking a federal charter and enduring years of regulatory scrutiny. He explained that while this route was not the easiest, it was meant to build trust with governments, customers, investors, and international partners, creating a foundation of safety and reliability that the crypto industry needs. Anchorage cements its crypto-banking lead Anchorage Digital made history in January 2021 when the OCC granted it the first national trust bank charter to a crypto native firm. Under the charter, Anchorage is authorized to carry digital assets on behalf of institutions in a way that traditional banks have long done for traditional assets. Today, Anchorage is the only U.S. digital asset bank with a complete banking charter. That puts it in a unique position within the industry when regulators are closely watching the wild market for digital currencies. The South Dakota firm offers custody, staking, trading, and governance services. In April 2025, the asset manager BlackRock chose Anchorage to safeguard some of the Bitcoin and Ethereum the firm owns for its spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). That only strengthened Anchorage’s standing with overseas investors. The reversal of Anchorage’s policy has accompanied broader regulatory clarity. May 2025 saw the OCC provide more clarity for national banks to hold, purchase, and sell crypto-assets and facilitate customer market access. That ruling spurred other companies, including Circle, Ripple, and Paxos, to seek federal charters similar to Anchorage’s. Just a few weeks ago, Anchorage Digital rolled out a new stablecoin issuance platform, naming Ethena Labs as its inaugural partner, according to an earlier report from Cryptopolitan . Through the partnership, Anchorage will bring Ethena’s stablecoin, USDtb, onshore to the United States and issue it via its federally chartered crypto bank. This marked the first time USDtb will be issued in the U.S.—and, according to the firms, the first stablecoin to launch with a defined compliance pathway under the recently enacted GENIUS Act, which sets regulatory standards for stablecoin operations in America. The OCC’s decision to end the order is generally considered a sign of a change of direction in U.S. crypto policy. Regulators are likelier to permit a compliant company to operate under federal supervision than force it offshore. Anchorage is a story of what it takes to succeed here. The bank also had to increase the size of its compliance program and spend heavily on surveillance to convince regulators that it could do business on the same level as other banks.

Here are the top 5 best altcoins to buy now , featuring MAGACOIN FINANCE , Ethereum , TRX , and two other trending altcoins with strong fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE Leading the list of the best altcoins to buy is MAGACOIN FINANCE —a fast-growing presale project gaining major traction across the crypto community.

Growing institutional interest is positioning ETH as “digital oil.” Despite already being a top crypto, Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins to buy for long-term portfolio stability and explosive growth during market expansions.

Essentially, it provides dApps with more efficient speeds and lower transaction costs, however, the security is still maintained by Ethereum. On the off-chance Ethereum wanted to scale, Arbitrum would still be around to back it up. This would highlight the significance of the ARB token as one of the best alternative cryptos to invest in if you are seeking exposure to next-generation infrastructure. Polygon (POL) Formerly known as MATIC, Polygon (POL) is preparing for a major upgrade with the POL token migration . It’s the leading Layer-2 for mainstream partnerships, including Nike, Disney, Reddit , and more.

The index looks strong on the surface, because that small group of tech giants (you know, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms) are pulling all the weight harder than they ever have before. But the problem is those megacaps have grown so big that they now account for around one-third of the total value of the S&P 500. That’s seven companies distorting the signal of 500. For years, the index was considered a leading economic indicator, even used by the Conference Board in its 10-part Leading Economic Index. But now, that predictive function looks damaged. The rest of the market, the so-called “S&P 495,” has become the real indicator of what’s actually happening. Seven tech stocks pull the entire index higher So far in 2025, the S&P 500 has gained over 8%. But that number is a lie if you care about the broader market. The seven largest stocks in the index have risen more than 14% on average, and the median jump among them is above 20%. The other 493 companies? They’ve only managed an average and median rise of just over 5%. That gap shows how top-heavy the index has become. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which gives every stock the same importance, has dropped 0.1% this week. In the same time, the standard market cap-weighted index has lost more than 1%. Without the tech names dragging everything around, the picture changes. Sectors like energy, real estate, and health care, which have been underperforming all year, are finally ahead this week. Meanwhile, the same tech names that led the rally are underperforming. And it’s not just the S&P 500 that’s being distorted. The small-cap Russell 2000 index, which had been stuck with a small 1.6% gain all year, has jumped 2.5% in August. That beats the S&P 500, which gained less than 1% in the same period. If macro conditions improve or if the Fed begins to cut rates, smaller, more debt-heavy firms could move faster. But because the S&P 500 is so tilted toward big tech, those changes might not register in the index, any broader economic recovery could be invisible in the benchmark. And right now, Wall Street isn’t immune. On Thursday, U.S. stock futures barely moved. Dow Jones futures went up by just 50 points. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 climbed about 0.1% each. That flatline followed five straight days of losses. The S&P 500 dropped 0.4%, Nasdaq slid 0.34%, and the Dow lost 152.81 points, or 0.34%. The trend is clear. The bull run is tired, and the megacap rally might be wearing thin. The signal is flashing, but it’s hard to tell if it’s a warning or just noise. Even individual stock stories are showing this instability. Mastercard’s stock pulled back to its 200-day moving average in June. Then it pushed back up. In recent weeks, it regained resistance and is now pushing against its all-time high around $595. It had already recovered all its Q1 losses by early May. After hitting a new record in early June, it once again dropped back down to the 200-day level. That’s where it stands now, testing the edge. Get seen where it counts.

The case targets a decision to set aside the local council’s ruling and allow a 90-megawatt facility on green belt land. Last year, Buckinghamshire Council refused permission for the project on green belt land. In UK planning, the green belt is open countryside where new buildings are tightly restricted to preserve space between towns. Developers wanted to put a large computing site there, but the authority said the scheme clashed with those rules. Data centers are vast buildings that hold banks of servers so companies can run cloud and other remote services. Demand for space has surged as firms race to build and train powerful new artificial intelligence systems, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Environmental groups are advocating against data centers in the UK Environmental groups warn that these facilities use huge amounts of electricity to operate around the clock. AI projects in particular have been criticized for heavy energy use, which can strain local grids and raise concerns over cooling water. The Buckinghamshire plan was twice rejected in earlier rounds. It returned under the Labour government, which says it wants the UK to become a leading global hub for artificial intelligence by boosting national computing capacity. In June 2024, the council again ruled the scheme would be “inappropriate” for the green belt and refused it. But last month, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner granted planning permission, reversing the local decision and clearing the way for construction. On Thursday, campaign groups Foxglove and Global Action Plan said they had filed a statutory planning review. They are asking a court to quash Rayner’s approval, saying the project would. The government has previously argued that strengthening data center infrastructure is vital if the UK is to compete globally in AI development. Thursday’s filing follows a January pledge by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to curb repeat legal challenges by so-called “Nimbys” against major infrastructure plans in England and Wales. Nimby is a term used for people who oppose works they see as unpleasant or risky in their area.

Understanding these cycles is crucial for any investor. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index , a key metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), indicates a clear shift, pointing towards what many call ‘Bitcoin Season’. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? On August 22, at 00:30 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a value of 42. This figure, reported by CoinMarketCap and previously noted by Bitcoin World, represents a slight dip from the previous day, signaling a strengthening Bitcoin dominance in the market. This index is a vital tool for understanding the broader market sentiment and asset performance. The Index’s Core Function: It assesses the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clearer picture of market dynamics. Defining Seasons: The index determines whether the market is in ‘Altcoin Season’ or ‘Bitcoin Season’ by comparing how these top coins have performed relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. How is Bitcoin Season Determined by the Altcoin Season Index? The methodology behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet powerful. It sets clear thresholds to define the prevailing market condition: Altcoin Season: This period is declared when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Think of it as a time when a wide array of alternative cryptocurrencies are seeing significant gains. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, we enter Bitcoin Season when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. The current index reading of 42 falls squarely into this category, confirming that Bitcoin is currently the dominant force. The index itself ranges from 1 to 100. A lower number suggests stronger Bitcoin dominance, while a higher number indicates altcoin outperformance. The current 42 clearly points to Bitcoin leading the pack. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: What Does it Mean for Investors? Understanding the implications of the current Bitcoin Season, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , is essential for informed decision-making. When Bitcoin dominates, it often means: Capital Flow: Investors may be consolidating their capital into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer or more stable asset during uncertain times, or anticipating a major Bitcoin price movement. Reduced Altcoin Volatility (Relative): While altcoins can still be volatile, their relative performance against Bitcoin tends to be weaker. They might not see the explosive growth characteristic of an Altcoin Season. Market Bellwether: Bitcoin’s price action often dictates the overall direction of the market. A strong Bitcoin run can sometimes precede a broader market recovery, eventually lifting altcoins. For those holding altcoins, this period might present challenges, as their portfolios may lag behind Bitcoin’s performance. However, it can also be an opportunity to reassess and strategize. Strategic Insights During Bitcoin Season When the Altcoin Season Index signals Bitcoin Season, investors can consider several approaches. This isn’t financial advice, but rather observations based on market trends: Focus on Bitcoin: Some investors may choose to increase their Bitcoin holdings, riding the wave of its dominance. Re-evaluate Altcoin Holdings: It might be a good time to review altcoin portfolios, perhaps divesting from weaker performers or projects with less fundamental strength. Research for Future Opportunities: Use this period to research promising altcoin projects that could thrive once the market sentiment shifts back towards altcoins. Strong fundamentals and innovative technology remain key. The market is cyclical, and understanding the signals from metrics like the Altcoin Season Index can provide a significant edge. While Bitcoin currently holds the reins, market conditions can change, and being prepared for future shifts is always wise. The Altcoin Season Index at 42 confirms that we are firmly in a Bitcoin Season. This means Bitcoin has been outperforming most of the top altcoins over the last 90 days. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this metric offers a crucial snapshot of the market’s current state, guiding decisions and expectations. While the crypto landscape is ever-evolving, staying informed with reliable data from sources like CoinMarketCap allows participants to navigate these cycles with greater confidence and foresight. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days to determine if the market is in ‘Altcoin Season’ or ‘Bitcoin Season’. Q2: How is Altcoin Season defined by the index? Altcoin Season occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 42 signify? An index value of 42 indicates that 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days, meaning the market is currently in Bitcoin Season. Q4: What are the implications of a Bitcoin Season for altcoin holders? During Bitcoin Season, altcoins generally tend to underperform Bitcoin. This means altcoin portfolios might see less growth compared to Bitcoin, and capital may flow more towards Bitcoin as the dominant asset. Q5: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index is updated regularly, providing a near real-time snapshot of market conditions, though the 90-day lookback period remains constant for its calculation.

Dogecoin has shown signs of stability, holding support near $0.19, and some traders believe this could mark the base for a bullish recovery. Its ability to maintain this level is being closely watched as momentum builds. Pi Network is also back in focus as its community looks for signs of revival. Efforts to strengthen the ecosystem are underway, but the project still faces questions about how quickly it can regain traction after a prolonged decline. In contrast, Cold Wallet ($CWT) is carving its place through real-world utility. It is not driven by short-term hype but by user engagement, turning everyday actions into value. With a model that prioritizes usability, Cold Wallet is positioning itself as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now, offering a vision of sustainability that could shape opportunity in 2025. Dogecoin Holds Support as Traders Watch for Breakout Dogecoin is sitting at a crucial level after dropping nearly 30% from its July highs. The $0.19 mark has become an important base, and how price reacts here could shape the coin’s next direction. Technical signals like RSI remain neutral, leaving room for a rebound if buyers step back in. A push above the $0.21 to $0.22 range would likely trigger momentum, especially if overall market sentiment turns positive. Still, Dogecoin’s long-term story continues to rely heavily on community enthusiasm and cultural relevance, leaving questions about whether it can build a stronger foundation beyond its meme coin identity. Pi Network Seeks Revival Through Ecosystem Upgrades Pi Network is working to rebuild momentum after an extended period of decline. Developers have announced upgrades aimed at strengthening infrastructure and re-engaging the community, sparking cautious optimism. Projections for PI’s value range from small rebounds under $0.10 to more ambitious calls near $0.60 if these updates gain traction and exchange listings arrive. Despite the potential, Pi remains in a speculative stage. Without mainnet functionality or reliable trading data, its current outlook depends as much on execution as on vision. For those searching for the best crypto to buy right now, Pi’s appeal lies in its promise, but uncertainty continues to weigh on long-term confidence. Cold Wallet Redefines Crypto With Real Utility Cold Wallet offers a very different story compared to DOGE and PI. Instead of relying on speculative cycles or development promises, it delivers real utility at the core of every interaction. The wallet rewards users for actions like swapping tokens, paying gas, or bridging assets, with each activity returning value in $CWT. This creates a system where engagement is consistently incentivized. What drives Cold Wallet forward is not only its cashback model but its dedication to practical use. Onboarding is immediate, with no KYC or email required, giving users full control of their keys the moment the app is downloaded. This focus on autonomy and simplicity fills a critical gap in an industry where complicated onboarding has often been a barrier to adoption. The mobile app also stands out for its design. Cold Wallet combines the sleek experience of modern mobile platforms with the security of self-custody. In a sector where most wallets feel outdated or overly technical, its clean interface provides accessibility without sacrificing functionality, making it appealing to both newcomers and experienced users. Backing this user-first model is a growing presale. Now in Stage 17 and priced at $0.00998, Cold Wallet has raised over $6.4 million while building a community around usability rather than hype. With a 150-stage structure that introduces scarcity, it creates strategic interest, yet its long-term appeal lies in everyday practicality. For those considering the best crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet is positioning itself as more than a token. It is shaping up to be a tool for everyday financial routines. Market Takeaways Dogecoin continues to offer the quick upside potential of a meme coin, while Pi Network carries ambitious goals that depend heavily on execution and future milestones. Both have appeal for traders seeking speculative gains, but each comes with uncertainty tied to sentiment and delivery. Cold Wallet presents a different proposition. Its utility-first design turns every transaction into meaningful engagement, supported by a presale that is steadily gaining traction. By focusing on usability rather than hype, it positions itself as the best crypto to buy right now for those looking at long-term value.

Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham announced an expanded “crypto sprint” to strengthen federal oversight of cryptocurrencies while safeguarding U.S. competitiveness in global finance. This move closely follows the commission’s prior action to allow the trading of listed digital-asset spot markets on registered futures exchanges. That decision, announced earlier this month, was seen as a turning point for the industry. Now the CFTC is expanding its lens beyond spot trading rules to the broader digital asset ecosystem. CFTC extends oversight to wider digital asset risks The agency’s focus, Pham said, is to ensure that crypto markets can function with the protections and integrity that undergird traditional financial markets. She said that trading of digital assets on the spot (cash) market is no longer a niche; it is the backbone of U.S. and international market activity. Pham said the new initiative was designed to ensure that the United States takes the lead in global digital finance. She explained that the CFTC’s broader oversight push represented what she described as the beginning of a “Golden Age of innovation.” According to her, this new phase would allow the crypto industry to grow under a clear and responsible regulation framework. She stressed that far from restricting progress, the commission’s approach was intended to create an environment where innovation could flourish while maintaining safeguards for market integrity and investor protection. CFTC’s plan follows the blueprint of the Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology, a report from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The report lays out a plan to strike the right balance between innovation and sound supervision. It singles out potential sources of risk like leveraged, margin, and financed retail trading, which have the potential to leave investors with heavy losses if uncontrolled. In the increased sprint, the CFTC will now cover all of the advice provided in the report. That involves clarifying federal trading rules, beefing up compliance for exchanges, and working with other regulators to fill gaps in oversight. The SEC, the agency that oversees initial coin offerings and cryptocurrencies, is already collaborating with the CFTC through a campaign called “ Project Crypto .” Working in close coordination, the two agencies are trying to draw a line regarding the limits of their authority, even as they close ranks to influence how the United States governs the cryptocurrency industry. CFTC calls on the public to help shape rules There will be strong public involvement in designing the new regulatory regime. For the next 5 years, through October 20, 2025, the CFTC is soliciting comments from investors, industry experts, innovators, and the public via a formal comment period. Pham urged all stakeholders to work together, stressing that contributions from major financial institutions and smaller innovators would be vital in shaping fair and effective regulations. She emphasized that the commission was committed to listening carefully to feedback from across the sector. According to her, the CFTC’s goal was to develop a framework of rules to secure America’s leadership in digital markets while ensuring that consumer interests remained fully protected. The consultation period arrived as the White House, in the Trump administration, pushed for a big increase in U.S. leadership in digital finance. The administration has described crypto and blockchain technology as weapons of national competitiveness, evoking past eras of American dominance in internet and mobile technology. By launching the consultation, the CFTC says that industry views will shape the sector’s future. Such a step would also relieve crypto proponents’ concerns that heavy-handed regulation could stifle innovation.

Binance Coin (BNB) broke past $864 before cooling off, while Mantle (MNT) jumped 15% following whale accumulation and a Bybit staking rollout. But the real spotlight is on BlockDAG . Having already raised $379M, the project holds firm at its Batch 29 entry of $0.0276. Its Buyer Battles inject gamified competition, rewarding top daily buyers, while the upcoming BlockDAG Explorer provides on-chain clarity with real-time data visualization. With the $0.05 launch price confirmed, the presale continues to attract strong attention. The mix of transparent development, community features, and discounted entry is setting BlockDAG apart from both large-cap gains and short-term rallies. BNB Price Strength Supported by Macro Trends BNB has reignited enthusiasm across the crypto space. After Bitcoin surged past $124,000, Binance Coin touched a fresh peak at $864.50. Over the past week, it’s climbed 11.8%, with 26.2% growth this month and a 62.9% rise over the past year. These gains put BNB among the top-performing large caps. Its momentum has been fueled by easing macro conditions. Cooling inflation boosted expectations for rate cuts, which in turn supported higher-risk assets. Analysts at Hash Global now project BNB could eventually climb toward $2,039 if demand holds. Still, volatility lingers, particularly if Bitcoin faces September weakness, historically a tough month. While BNB’s outlook remains positive, its growth potential is limited to percentage gains. By contrast, presale opportunities such as BlockDAG, still priced at $0.0276, offer a more amplified path forward, making them a focal point for those seeking sharper moves. Bybit Partnership Fuels Mantle Price Rise Mantle has become a hot talking point after a 15% daily jump, lifting it to $1.36. The move was sparked by its partnership with Bybit, which introduced staking integration and new yield channels. On-chain data showed $9.78M in outflows from exchanges, reducing near-term selling pressure. Open Interest also rose 43% to $112M, reflecting a surge in leveraged speculation. Much of this momentum is linked to whale-led buying, which has built confidence but also creates the risk of sudden profit-taking. While analysts note strong near-term conditions, volatility remains a core factor in Mantle’s price action. Compared to BlockDAG’s structured presale, Mantle’s growth leans heavily on speculative trading rather than clear fundamentals. That makes BlockDAG’s approach, anchored by transparent features like the Explorer and competitive gamification, all the more attractive to those looking for projects with stronger utility foundations. Buyer Battles Keep BlockDAG Momentum High! BlockDAG’s presale has already crossed $379M, securing its spot among the largest early funding rounds of 2025. Batch 29 currently sits at $0.0276, while the confirmed launch price of $0.05 points to a near double for early participants before it even lists. Three pillars drive its momentum. First, price forecasts remain bullish, with some analysts suggesting long-term valuations between $1 and $20 if adoption follows through on its hybrid blockchain-DAG technology. The presale’s step-by-step structure provides urgency, building anticipation with each batch. Second, Buyer Battles have injected daily excitement into the presale. Each day, the largest single purchase earns the remaining allocation at no cost, creating a competitive atmosphere that keeps activity consistently high. This gamified feature has strengthened community engagement, turning participation into a strategy-driven event. Third, the BlockDAG Explorer is delivering transparency before launch. Users can monitor the DAG structure in real time, track transactions, see miner activity, and follow on-chain education credential issuance. This level of openness is unusual at the presale stage and has reinforced trust in the project’s technical backbone. Together, these elements place BlockDAG ahead of the pack; more than just a presale, it’s shaping into an ecosystem with competition, clarity, and a clear pricing roadmap. Final Thoughts BNB’s record-setting moves and Mantle’s whale-fueled rally highlight the market’s current energy. Still, both come with risks and limited upside at current prices. BlockDAG, meanwhile, continues to offer what many seek: early access at a discounted entry, combined with features that deliver transparency and daily engagement. With $379M raised, 25 billion coins already sold, and Buyer Battles creating constant activity, BlockDAG has moved beyond simply raising funds. It’s proving the strength of its technology and community before launch. The Explorer’s real-time view of its architecture further cements its credibility. At $0.0276, the opportunity remains open. Against Mantle’s speculative swings and BNB’s incremental rise, BlockDAG’s mix of gamified participation, strong presale numbers, and confirmed $0.05 launch price makes it a clear standout.

While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, altcoins are where many traders see the highest upside. Forecasts now highlight three projects — XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Cardano (ADA) — as some of the most promising bets for those aiming for outsized returns. XRP: ETF Catalyst Could Unlock a Breakout After years of uncertainty, XRP has emerged from its long legal battle with U.S. regulators, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. A spot XRP ETF is widely expected to be approved later this year, which could mirror the explosive rally seen when Bitcoin’s ETF went live. Analysts suggest this catalyst could propel XRP well beyond its current range, potentially targeting the $8–$10 zone in a strong bull market. Some bolder predictions point to XRP hitting even $50 if spot ETFs get approved. With its compliance-ready design and growing role in cross-border payments, XRP is positioned to be one of 2025’s biggest winners. Investor Keep Their Eyes on This New Hidden Gem Among emerging presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as one of the most exciting opportunities of 2025 . Its model is built around audits, transparency, and a projected 55x ROI , factors that have created rapid demand during its funding rounds. Investor trust is growing, with early participants securing allocations before wider exchange exposure. Much like the early success stories of SHIB and DOGE, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum that could reward early adopters in dramatic fashion. Cardano (ADA): Whale Accumulation and ETF Speculation Cardano has long been known for its research-driven approach and strong development community. In 2025, ADA is holding steady near $1, even as other altcoins swing wildly. Its previous all-time high around $3.10 has yet to be broken, but growing whale accumulation suggests large investors are quietly building positions. Adding to the excitement, talk of a potential Cardano ETF is gaining traction, which could open the floodgates for new institutional capital. If momentum continues, ADA could realistically revisit its old highs and possibly climb into the $5–$7 range during peak market euphoria. Some experts even say $12-15 is not out of the question in the next few months if momentum continues to build. Conclusion XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Cardano represent three very different paths to potential gains in 2025 — from regulatory clarity to presale growth to ecosystem expansion. For investors hunting for the next big returns, these projects stand out as top contenders, with MAGACOIN FINANCE especially drawing attention thanks to its 55x ROI forecasts backed by strong transparency measures.

50466988,562334,1755824435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50466988.jpeg,Bitcoin Accumulator Addresses Demand Reaches Highest Levels Ever – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-accumulator-address-demand-reaches-highest/,"Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase after several days of consolidation and heightened volatility just below its all-time highs. The price has struggled to sustain momentum, raising concerns about weakening strength in the current trend. Bulls are now tasked with defending key support zones to prevent further bearish speculation and maintain the broader uptrend. Despite short-term uncertainty, the macro picture remains supportive. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major corporations and funds adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a strategic reserve asset. At the same time, increasing legal clarity in key jurisdictions has provided a stronger framework for long-term adoption, encouraging new players to enter the market. These structural factors add resilience to Bitcoin’s price even as speculative activity cools. Adding to this outlook, fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals that demand from long-term holders has been steadily rising. This accumulation trend suggests that underlying conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains intact. Historically, strong holder demand has served as a reliable signal for market resilience during periods of heightened volatility. Bitcoin Accumulator Demand Hits Record High Bitcoin’s latest price dip has triggered a powerful response from one of the market’s most reliable cohorts: accumulator addresses. According to onchain data from CryptoQuant, demand from these addresses has reached a new all-time high in 2025, signaling a wave of conviction buying despite heightened volatility. Accumulator addresses are unique because they have no history of selling. These wallets only purchase and hold Bitcoin, steadily absorbing supply regardless of short-term price swings. Their growing demand is particularly striking now, as broader market sentiment remains cautious and price action consolidates below recent all-time highs. This surge in accumulation suggests that long-term investors see Bitcoin as a secure store of value, especially as macroeconomic conditions continue to weaken. Rising debt levels, persistent inflation risks, and global uncertainty are pushing allocators to seek assets outside the traditional financial system. For many, Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized structure make it the ultimate hedge. Historically, spikes in accumulator demand have preceded major rallies, as these investors gradually reduce liquid supply. With Bitcoin facing strong resistance but holding key structural support, this dynamic could provide the foundation for the next leg higher. Whether immediate continuation follows or consolidation stretches further, the conviction from accumulators highlights enduring trust in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Struggles to Hold Short-Term Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows price action under heavy pressure after losing the $117K–$118K region, where the 50 and 100 SMAs converged. BTC now trades around $113,326, consolidating just above the 200 SMA at $113,121, which is acting as a last line of defense for bulls. The rejection near the $123,200 resistance zone earlier this month triggered a sharp decline, bringing BTC back into its broader consolidation range. Momentum has clearly shifted toward the bears in the short term, with successive lower highs and lower lows forming over the past week. This breakdown highlights the importance of the 200 SMA: if BTC closes below it on the 4H timeframe, the next support levels lie at $111K and potentially $108K, opening room for deeper corrections. On the other hand, holding above the 200 SMA could provide a short-term base for recovery. A rebound would first need to reclaim the $115K–$116K area, followed by sustained strength above the 50 SMA at $117K to re-establish bullish momentum. Until then, market sentiment remains fragile, and traders are closely watching whether the 200 SMA can hold to prevent a slide into deeper losses.

Here’s What MVRV Data Suggests,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/has-bitcoin-bull-run-really-ended-heres-what-mvrv-data-suggests/,"Bitcoin continues to retrace from its record highs, with the asset trading below $115,000 at the time of writing. Current price levels place Bitcoin near $113,098, a decline of around 6.5% over the past week and close to 9% below its all-time peak. Despite the downturn, analysts monitoring on-chain data suggest the broader market cycle may still have room to extend upward. One such view comes from CryptoQuant’s QuickTake contributor, PelinayPA, who analyzed Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio. The analyst noted that while recent corrections may weigh on short-term sentiment, historical patterns in MVRV indicate that Bitcoin has not yet reached conditions typically associated with market cycle tops. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Treasury Bubble Popping? Expert Answers Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Points to Neutral but Upward Potential The MVRV ratio is a widely tracked on-chain indicator that compares Bitcoin’s total market capitalization with its realized capitalization, which reflects the aggregated value of coins at the price they last moved on-chain. Historically, when the ratio climbs into the 3.5 to 4 range, it signals a potential overheating of the market. At these levels, most holders are in profit, selling activity rises, and price tops are often reached. Conversely, MVRV levels below 1 have historically marked accumulation phases and strong long-term entry points. Currently, Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio stands around 2.1. According to PelinayPA, this reading positions the market within a “neutral to bullish” zone, suggesting that while Bitcoin is no longer cheap, the conditions for an extended rally remain intact. The analyst noted that in previous cycles, the MVRV ratio advanced significantly higher before a peak, implying that Bitcoin’s price would need to move into the $140,000–$180,000 range for the indicator to reach historical top levels. However, the data also suggests that corrections along the way are plausible. “Since MVRV is already above 2, the market is not cheap anymore — short to mid-term corrections may occur along the way,” PelinayPA explained. The balance between potential upside and intermittent drawdowns reflects a phase of consolidation within a broader bull market structure. Exchange Flows Signal Mixed Market Behavior In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor BorisD examined exchange netflow data, focusing on Binance, the world’s largest crypto trading platform. The report highlighted notable trends across several altcoins, showing how capital movements may inform future market conditions. According to the data, tokens such as ENJ (Enjin) and FET (Fetch.ai) recorded significant outflows from Binance. This pattern typically indicates that investors are moving assets to private wallets, which can be interpreted as a sign of longer-term holding behavior. In contrast, assets like ANKR and MATIC have seen strong inflows onto exchanges, raising the possibility of either upcoming selling pressure or speculative positioning ahead of market shifts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear Is Back: Traders Flip As Price Plunges To $113,000 BorisD suggested that monitoring which assets are attracting inflows versus outflows could help investors identify potential opportunities in the altcoin market. “Identifying which of these altcoins are currently near potential bottoms and positioning for their next rally seems to be the most rational strategy,” the analyst wrote.

Two people familiar with the deal asked not to be identified because the details are confidential The Information reported. The contract lasts six years. The move fits Google’s push for large cloud wins as it chases Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Earlier this year, Google also picked up work from OpenAI, which had leaned heavily on Microsoft’s Azure. As hightlighted by Cryptopolitan earlier, Alphabet’s Google Cloud generated $2.83 billion in operating income on $13.6 billion in second-quarter revenue . Revenue rose 32%, faster than the company’s total growth of 13.8%. AI infrastructure at the core of the Meta-Google deal One person said the deal is focused on artificial intelligence infrastructure. In its report last month, Meta forecast 2025 total expenses of $114 billion to $118 billion. It is pouring money into AI hardware and staff, upgrading its Llama models and putting AI into many of its apps. Even as the two compete in digital ads, Meta is trying to secure as much computing power as possible. It operates its own data centers and has agreements to use cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft. Meta Platforms is also seeking outside partners to help pay for the large data center needed for AI. A filing said the company plans to sell $2 billion of data center assets as part of that plan. The approach mirrors a wider change at big tech companies as the cost of building and running generative AI data centers climbs. “We’re exploring ways to work with financial partners to co-develop data centers,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday. Meta is shifting how it funds its tech expansion While Meta still expects to fund much of its capital spending internally, some projects could draw “significant external financing” and provide flexibility if needs change over time, she said. In its quarterly filing, Meta said that in June it approved a plan to dispose of some data center assets and reclassified $2.04 billion of land and construction-in-progress as “held-for-sale.” The assets are slated to be contributed to a third party within the next twelve months to co-develop data centers. Meta did not record a loss related to the reclassification, which measures the assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value minus costs to sell. As of June 30, total held-for-sale assets were $3.26 billion, the filing said. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has laid out plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into building AI data center “superclusters” to pursue superintelligence. “Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” he said. The company said ad sales topped expectations, helped by AI tools that improve targeting and content delivery, and said those gains are helping offset higher infrastructure costs from its long-term AI plans.

In a move that has sent ripples across the tech industry, OpenAI’s lawyers are now pulling Meta into the fray, demanding answers about its potential involvement in Musk’s audacious $97 billion takeover bid for the ChatGPT maker . This revelation hints at a complex web of alliances and rivalries at the very top of the AI pyramid, raising critical questions about the future of innovation and control in this rapidly evolving sector. Unpacking the OpenAI Lawsuit: Why is Meta Involved? The core of this unfolding saga lies in the OpenAI lawsuit filed by Elon Musk earlier this year. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, alleges that the company has strayed from its original non-profit, open-source mission to pursue profit-driven ventures, particularly with its close ties to Microsoft. OpenAI, in turn, has vehemently denied these claims, asserting that Musk himself attempted to gain control of the company and merge it with Tesla. It’s within this heated legal environment that OpenAI’s legal team has now cast a spotlight on Meta. In a recent brief, OpenAI’s lawyers publicly disclosed that they had subpoenaed Meta in June. The aim? To unearth any evidence related to coordination between Meta, Elon Musk, and his AI venture, xAI, concerning a potential acquisition or investment in OpenAI. This isn’t just a fishing expedition; OpenAI’s legal representatives claim to have uncovered communications between Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg regarding xAI’s bid to purchase the ChatGPT maker , including discussions about “potential financing arrangements or investments.” The very notion of two of the tech world’s most prominent figures, Musk and Zuckerberg, potentially collaborating on such a colossal deal adds a layer of intrigue to an already complex legal battle. Elon Musk OpenAI Ambitions and the $97 Billion Question Elon Musk’s relationship with OpenAI has been fraught with tension since his departure from the board in 2018. His recent $97 billion takeover bid in February, while unsolicited, underscores the immense value and strategic importance he places on the company he helped create. This aggressive move highlights Musk’s continued desire to influence the direction of cutting-edge AI, especially as his own company, xAI, emerges as a significant player with its Grok AI model. The question then becomes, why would Musk, with his own AI endeavors, seek to acquire OpenAI, and what role, if any, could Meta play in facilitating such a massive transaction? The subpoena suggests that OpenAI suspects more than just casual conversations. They are seeking to understand if Meta was a silent partner, a potential financier, or even a strategic advisor in Musk’s bid to acquire the company. Such an arrangement, if proven, could significantly alter the dynamics of the ongoing Elon Musk OpenAI lawsuit, potentially revealing a concerted effort to reshape the landscape of frontier AI. The sheer scale of the proposed $97 billion valuation itself speaks volumes about the perceived market dominance and future potential of OpenAI’s technology. Meta AI Development: A Parallel Universe of Ambition? While entangled in this legal crossfire, Meta has been aggressively pursuing its own ambitious Meta AI development strategy. Far from being a passive observer, Meta has made significant investments and strategic moves to position itself as a leader in the generative AI space. This includes pouring billions into infrastructure, acquiring vast amounts of computing power, and, notably, poaching top talent from rival AI labs, including OpenAI itself. One prominent example is Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT, who now leads research efforts at Meta Superintelligence Labs – the company’s newest and highly strategic AI unit. This talent acquisition is not coincidental; it reflects Meta’s determination to build its own frontier AI models capable of competing with the likes of OpenAI’s GPT series and Google’s Gemini. Meta has also invested a reported $14 billion in Scale AI and has reportedly approached several other AI labs about potential acquisition deals, indicating a broader strategy of expansion and consolidation in the AI market. This aggressive posture raises questions about whether Meta’s alleged involvement in Musk’s bid for OpenAI was purely financial, or if it was part of a larger strategic play to gain insights, influence, or even a direct stake in a competitor’s future. The High Stakes of AI Acquisition in a Competitive Landscape The current legal skirmish underscores the feverish pace of AI acquisition and consolidation within the technology sector. As AI models become increasingly powerful and foundational to future technological advancements, control over these intellectual properties and the talent behind them becomes paramount. Companies like OpenAI, with their groundbreaking models like GPT-4, represent not just technological prowess but also immense market influence and potential future revenue streams. The prospect of a company like OpenAI being acquired, especially by a figure as controversial and ambitious as Elon Musk, or with the alleged backing of a tech giant like Meta, sends tremors through the entire industry. It raises concerns about market concentration, the availability of open-source alternatives, and the very direction of AI development – whether it will remain diversified or fall under the control of a few dominant players. Every major tech company, from Microsoft and Google to Amazon and Apple, is racing to secure its position in the AI arms race, making every potential acquisition or strategic partnership a matter of intense scrutiny. The legal battle surrounding OpenAI is not just about one company; it’s about setting precedents for how innovation, ownership, and competition will unfold in the age of advanced AI. What Does This Mean for the ChatGPT Future? At the heart of OpenAI’s success and public recognition lies ChatGPT , its revolutionary conversational AI. The ongoing legal battle, the intense scrutiny over its governance, and the potential for a hostile takeover or significant restructuring inevitably cast a shadow over the ChatGPT future . Users and developers alike are watching closely to see how these high-level corporate and legal maneuvers might impact the development roadmap, accessibility, and ethical guidelines governing this transformative technology. Will a change in ownership or a significant shift in strategic alliances lead to new features, different monetization models, or even a pivot in the underlying philosophy of OpenAI’s development? The uncertainty itself can create ripples, potentially affecting talent retention, investor confidence, and the pace of innovation. For a product as widely adopted and influential as ChatGPT, stability and clear direction are crucial for continued growth and widespread adoption. The outcome of this legal drama could determine whether ChatGPT continues its trajectory as a broadly accessible tool or if its future becomes more intertwined with the specific commercial interests of its ultimate controllers. Challenges and Legal Hurdles: Meta’s Objections and the Path Forward Meta, naturally, has not taken OpenAI’s subpoena lightly. Lawyers representing Meta have asked the court to reject OpenAI’s request for evidence, arguing that Elon Musk and xAI can themselves provide any relevant information. Furthermore, Meta contends that its internal discussions regarding OpenAI’s potential restructuring or recapitalization are not relevant to the case at hand. This legal maneuvering highlights the complexities of discovery in high-stakes corporate lawsuits, where parties often resist revealing internal communications or strategic plans.

50467269,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=789484,1755824773,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50467269.jpeg,Investors expect Powell to tee up September rate cut in Friday speech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bond-investors-powell-rate-cut-friday-speech/,"Bond traders are betting that Jerome Powell will send a clear message this Friday morning that interest rate cuts are coming next month. The Federal Reserve Chair is scheduled to speak at 10 a.m. in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, during the Fed’s yearly economic gathering. Powell typically uses this platform before to change expectations, so now investors want to know if he’ll challenge current bets on rate cuts or quietly go along. According to Bloomberg, the market currently shows a 70% chance of a 0.25% cut in September and 50 basis points of total easing in 2025. These expectations come even after interest-rate swaps pulled back slightly following hawkish remarks from other Fed officials and choppy economic reports. Traders prepare for either confirmation or chaos If Powell sounds hawkish, shorter-term bond yields could spike. And that would squeeze the massive bets made in the options market this month. Traders have placed large positions on a deep September rate cut and a total of 75 basis points of cuts before year-end. Jason Pride, head of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said Powell “will not want to lock in a rate cut path for a decision in September.” Pride expects Powell to “fall a little bit on the side of suggesting that the economic data has weakened enough to support consideration of a rate cut.” Tom di Galoma, managing director at Mischler Financial Group, doesn’t expect a firm commitment. “There is a good chance of a hawkish presser and that the chair is not inclined to lower rates,” he said. Powell may want to keep things flexible. That means the decision for September likely hinges on the next employment and inflation reports coming out in early September. Until then, the bond market might stay stuck, with the two-year yield near 3.75% and the 10-year holding close to 4.30%. So far this month, shorter-dated yields have dropped 11 to 16 basis points across two- and five-year notes. That drop followed weak job numbers in July. But in early Asia trading Friday, Treasuries were barely moving. Everyone’s just waiting. Powell expected to signal caution as inflation risk rises In 2024, Powell used the same stage to open the door to rate cuts. That year, job numbers were weakening and two-year yields dropped hard after his speech. It gave traders the green light to bet on easier policy. Now, the labor market is once again showing cracks. But inflation is also back in the picture. The Fed’s July meeting minutes, released Wednesday, revealed that officials are still worried about rising prices as new tariffs take effect. High asset prices are also making some at the Fed think that easing isn’t necessary yet. That’s why Powell has held back this year. The Fed has kept rates steady and is waiting to see if inflation picks up even more before making a move. But many bond investors believe that labor weakness is stronger than inflation fears. Glenmede’s Pride believes the Fed will ultimately move in line with the market. “The Federal Reserve has a bias that when nothing looks like it’s falling apart, you tend to deliver what you have managed to build into market expectations at this point in time,” he said . That view gives weight to the idea that Powell may let the market lead the way, as long as the economy doesn’t fall apart. Still, not everyone is treating Powell’s words as gospel. Strategists at BMO Capital Markets laid out a plan depending on how the market reacts. If Powell leans dovish but doesn’t give clear confirmation, they plan to sell into any rally in the two-year note. If the market takes a slightly hawkish comment too seriously and thinks a cut is off the table, they’ll buy the dip. “We’d look to fade a rally in the two-year sector in the event that Powell is dovish, but doesn’t seal the deal on a September rate cut,” the strategists said. “Conversely, we’d be dip-buyers if the market misconstrues a hawkish comment as an indication that a September rate cut is not in the cards.” Get seen where it counts.

A prominent Bitcoin OG , a term for an early and significant investor in Bitcoin, has reportedly executed a monumental shift in their portfolio. This move involves divesting a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) and making a considerable investment into Ethereum (ETH), sparking widespread discussion and speculation. According to insights from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X, this strategic rotation is not just a minor adjustment but a massive reallocation of capital. Such a significant move by a long-standing Bitcoin holder raises important questions about market sentiment and future trends in the digital asset space. What Sparked This Monumental Bitcoin OG Shift? Over the past two days, this influential investor made a series of calculated moves. They sold a staggering 2,970 BTC, which was valued at approximately $337 million at the time of the transaction. This sale alone is enough to turn heads, considering the investor’s historical ties to Bitcoin. However, the story doesn’t end with the sale. The funds were quickly redeployed into Ethereum. The Bitcoin OG opened significant ETH long positions, totaling 135,265 ETH, with a valuation of around $577 million. Furthermore, the investor directly purchased an additional 50,472 ETH on the spot market, amounting to roughly $215 million. This dual approach of selling BTC and then acquiring ETH through both long positions and spot purchases highlights a strong conviction in Ethereum’s potential. It suggests a deliberate strategy rather than a fleeting impulse. Understanding the Ethereum Play: Why ETH Now? Many are now asking: what makes Ethereum so appealing to a long-time Bitcoin enthusiast? While Bitcoin is often hailed as ‘digital gold’ due to its scarcity and store-of-value properties, Ethereum offers a different value proposition. It is the backbone of a vast decentralized ecosystem. Ethereum’s appeal lies in several key areas: Smart Contract Platform: It powers decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Staking Rewards: With the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), ETH holders can earn rewards by staking their tokens. Ecosystem Growth: The continuous development and innovation within the Ethereum network attract developers and users alike. Potential for Future Upgrades: Ongoing improvements aim to enhance scalability and efficiency, making ETH more robust. This Bitcoin OG likely sees the intrinsic value and growth potential within Ethereum’s utility and expanding network effects. It represents a strategic bet on the future of decentralized computing. Implications for the Crypto Market: Will Others Follow This Astute Bitcoin OG? A move of this magnitude by a respected early investor can certainly influence market sentiment. When ‘smart money’ shifts, others often pay close attention. It could signal a broader trend of capital flowing from established, store-of-value assets like Bitcoin into more growth-oriented, utility-driven assets like Ethereum. However, it’s crucial to remember that individual investment decisions, even by a seasoned Bitcoin OG , do not guarantee future market performance. The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and what works for one investor may not be suitable for another. Key Takeaways for Investors: Diversification: This event underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio in crypto. Research (DYOR): Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. Market Dynamics: Understand that market leadership and narratives can evolve over time. The actions of this particular investor highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape. While Bitcoin continues to hold its ground as a foundational asset, Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to mature and attract significant capital. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for a Bitcoin OG and the Market The recent portfolio rotation by a prominent Bitcoin OG from BTC to ETH marks a truly significant event in the cryptocurrency world. This massive $337 million shift into Ethereum, coupled with substantial ETH long positions, suggests a strong belief in the smart contract platform’s long-term prospects. While Bitcoin remains a titan, this move underscores the growing maturity and diverse investment opportunities within the broader crypto market. It serves as a compelling reminder that even early pioneers are constantly evaluating and adapting their strategies in this rapidly evolving financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘Bitcoin OG’ mean? A1: ‘Bitcoin OG’ stands for ‘Bitcoin Original Gangster,’ referring to an early investor or adopter of Bitcoin who has held significant amounts of the cryptocurrency for a long period. Q2: How much Bitcoin did the investor sell? A2: The investor reportedly sold 2,970 BTC, valued at approximately $337 million at the time of the transactions. Q3: Why might an investor shift from BTC to ETH? A3: Reasons often include Ethereum’s role as a leading smart contract platform for DeFi and NFTs, its staking opportunities, and its potential for growth due to ongoing ecosystem development and upgrades. Q4: What is the significance of opening ‘long positions’ in ETH? A4: Opening a long position means the investor is betting that the price of ETH will increase in the future, allowing them to profit from the price appreciation. It indicates a strong bullish outlook. Q5: Does this mean Bitcoin is losing its value? A5: Not necessarily. Bitcoin continues to be a dominant force as ‘digital gold.’ This move reflects a strategic reallocation by one investor, not a universal abandonment of BTC. The crypto market is dynamic, with different assets serving different purposes. Q6: Should I follow this investor’s strategy? A6: Investment decisions should always be based on your own research, financial situation, and risk tolerance. While it’s interesting to observe the moves of large investors, their strategies may not align with your personal goals. Always Do Your Own Research (DYOR). Share This Insightful Analysis!

Over 15450 investors have already invested in the project presale, and over $14.7 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already at Stage 6 of Presale at $0.035. Phase 7 will be a 14.29% boost to $0.04. Although XRP is trending lower, MUTM is defying the overall sentiment of the market, gaining traction with traders seeking new momentum in decentralized lending and liquidity protocols Ripple (XRP) Holds Steady Amid Rebalancing of the Market Ripple’s XRP hovers at approximately $3.02 with little movement within the constricted intraday range of about $2.95 to $3.10. The token continues robust as a blue-chip asset, supported by its established cross-border payments use case and institutional pipes. While total sentiment remains cautious in response to regulatory uncertainty and market-wide volatility, stability of XRP reflects a period of consolidation and not directional conviction. Decentralized finance tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are instead attracting attention of late with their own energy. Mutuum Finance Progresses to Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance recently concluded Phase 5 of its very successful presale and has progressed into Phase 6. In this phase, tokens are available at $0.035 per token, with early investors having a second opportunity to purchase MUTM at lower rates prior to public listing. The presale has already been very popular, with over $14.7 million in funds raised and over 15,450 holders worldwide. This rising rate of growth signals the tremendous belief that the community has in the project and its future prospects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena. With each round of presale, interest in tokens has continued to rise consistently, painting a picture of robust investor appetite and growing levels of adoption for Mutuum Finance. The transition to Phase 6 symbolizes not only community enthusiasm but also the master plan of strategic growth that the project has had. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Partners with CertiK to Carry out $50K Bug Bounty In its ongoing efforts towards attaining the greatest level of security and transparency, Mutuum Finance has also partnered with CertiK, a leading industry blockchain security and auditing firm.

These innovative companies are now making massive waves, significantly increasing their presence and investment in global athletics. This surge in crypto sports sponsorships marks a pivotal moment, transforming how digital assets connect with mainstream audiences. Why Are Crypto Sports Sponsorships Surging?

The S&P Global UK Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 53 in August from 51.5 in July. Readings above 50 points to expansion, and August marked a fourth straight month in that zone. The gain was led by stronger demand in business services, where firms reported a clearer rise in new work. The UK’s manufacturers also reported better sentiment, but services set the pace and carried the overall index higher compared with the previous month. On the public finance side, separate figures released on Thursday showed the central government borrowed £1.1 billion in July. That was smaller than the Office for Budget Responsibility’s expectation of a £2.1 billion deficit for the month. The gap was narrower than forecast, giving the Treasury slight relief as it deals with weaker-than-hoped revenues and a recovery that has not been even across sectors and regions. Budget choices remain tight. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is still widely expected to lift taxes in the Budget to pay for plans and to meet her rule to cover day-to-day spending from tax receipts by 2029-30. Officials are weighing different paths, including potential changes to property taxes, as ministers face a hole of at least £20 billion in the public accounts that will need to be closed. Growth has cooled. Headline GDP expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, down from 0.7% in the first three months of 2025. On the other hand, the US economy rebounded with 3% annualized GDP growth in Q2, as reported by Cryptopolitan recently. Companies have said that expected tax rises and a steep increase in the minimum wage are hurting confidence, pushing up costs and leading managers to hold back on recruitment. Hiring remained weak despite strong business activity Employment measures fell for an eleventh month in a row. Many companies are reporting reduced hiring and layoffs. At the same time, new vacancies have been unfilled, which suggests that companies are cautious when hiring new talent. The latest Office for National Statistics release also showed that July borrowing was the lowest for that month in three years. Borrowing typically dips in January and July because those months line up with key dates for income-tax payments. That seasonal pattern reflects the calendar of taxpayer deadlines and was visible again this year. July’s total was helped by a £2.7 billion rise in self-assessed income-tax receipts and by interest payments on government debt coming in lower than expected. Revenues also picked up after the decision in October to raise employer national insurance contributions; the OBR said those payments were almost 24% higher than in July last year, boosting the monthly intake. Even with the July undershoot, the broader picture is still fragile. From April to July, the first four months of the fiscal year, borrowing reached £60 billion. The running total is broadly in line with the OBR’s forecast published in March. The watchdog will issue fresh projections for growth and the public finances alongside the Budget. The Treasury is preparing for the risk that the OBR trims its productivity outlook, a change that would likely push borrowing higher. On the fiscal rule measure, the current budget deficit, excluding investment spending, stood at £42.8 billion for the year to date, £5.4 billion more than in the same four months of 2024 and £5.7 billion above the OBR’s profile for the period.

The new figures mark another month above target, stretching a streak that has challenged the view inside the bank that inflation would ease once temporary shocks faded. Investors think the pressure could last through year-end according to a Bloomberg report . Government numbers on Friday showed core consumer prices, excluding fresh food, were up 3.1% in July from a year earlier, after a 3.3% gain in June, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said. Economists expected 3%, thinking cheaper energy would pull the rate down after last year’s spike. These expectations align with earlier projections that the BOJ may be nearing another rate increase, as Cryptopolitan noted when inflation peaked earlier this year An index that removes both fresh food and energy rose 3.4%, unchanged from June and matching the consensus. Japan faces US criticism as inflation stays stubborn Japan’s policy path is also drawing international focus as central banks adapt to new global pressures, particularly in Tokyo. The data show price pressures are stubborn. They landed about a week after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took the unusual step of criticizing the BOJ’s approach, telling Bloomberg TV that “they’re behind the curve.” Hike odds have risen in recent weeks, lifting bond yields. The slowdown in core CPI was broadly expected since energy costs spiked a year earlier when a government subsidy ended. Crude was roughly 10% cheaper than a year before. Rice prices, a major factor this year, climbed 90.7% from a year ago, down from the 100.2% jump in June. The surge in the staple has alarmed households nationwide. Officials see year-on-year gains easing in the months ahead because the run-up started last autumn, but record heat could hurt harvests and worsen shortages. Processed and shelf-stable food prices rose 8.3%, the quickest pace since September 2023. Service costs rose 1.5%, the same rate as in June. BOJ raises inflation view but may hold rates Strains on living costs contributed to a historic defeat for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s coalition in last month’s vote. Having lost control of both houses, Ishiba is facing resignation demands from parts of his party. Analysts are watching to see if he seeks support with fresh fiscal outlays aimed at easing household pain. At the July meeting, Governor Kazuo Ueda’s board raised this fiscal year’s inflation forecast by more than expected in its quarterly outlook, citing food. Most expect the BOJ to leave rates unchanged at the Sept. 19 decision. The chance of a rate increase by late October is about 51%, compared with around 42% last month. On Thursday, the 10-year JGB yield reached its highest since 2008, reflecting bets on further policy tightening.

Coinbase confirmed the listing on its blog and X posts. Eric Trump, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, also shared the news on X and promised more updates “very soon.” Coinbase adds USD1 and starts phased trading U.S users can now access and trade USD1 on Coinbase. The exchange has officially added it as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. This is a big step for USD1’s biggest supporter and developer, World Liberty Financial, as it enters one of the largest and most regulated crypto exchanges worldwide. Coinbase said the rollout for USD1 depends on meeting liquidity requirements , so trading will start in phases. This measure will allow the exchange to monitor supply and demand, prevent sudden price swings, and make sure both buyers and sellers have a smooth experience. Investors will be confident about entering and exiting positions without facing losses because this approach aligns with the platform’s broader policy of maintaining orderly markets. Coinbase also warned users not to send USD1 over other networks that aren’t Ethereum because they risk huge losses. This caution will help new stablecoin users who don’t know the consequences of sending tokens across incompatible blockchains. It also shows how Coinbase is committed to transparency and user protection as it introduces high-profile assets like USD1 to its platform. U.S users can now trade three major stablecoins, USDC, Tether’s USDT, and USD1, on Coinbase. Adding the USD1, backed by the Trump family, gives users more trading options and raises competition for stablecoins. It also directs focus to the rapidly growing market for digital dollars because users avoid traditional banking restrictions. World Liberty Financial increases USD1 supply and plans a rewards program World Liberty Financial recently minted $205 million worth of USD1 stablecoins, as recently reported by Cryptopolitan . The issuance boosted USD1’s total supply to a record $2.4 billion , marking its biggest increase since late April. Launched earlier this year, the stablecoin now ranks as the world’s sixth-largest, with a market capitalization of $2.39 billion. USD1’s 205 million token minting aligned with remarks from Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. Cryptopolitan reported that Wyoming became the first U.S. state to launch a stablecoin earlier this week. Most of USD1’s supply comes from strategic partnerships and large treasury holdings, including a $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based MGX transacted using the token on Binance. World Liberty Financial is committed to developing a stable digital dollar that can compete with USDC and USDT. USD1 is fully backed on a 1:1 basis by U.S. dollars and U.S. Treasuries. This ensures the token represents a real, tangible asset, making it more reliable for its holders. World Liberty Financial has also disclosed the Ethereum contract address for USD1, so that anyone can verify the total supply, track transactions, and confirm that the backing reserves exist as stated. The company also announced its plans for a loyalty points program for USD1 users. It will reward people for trading, holding, staking, and participating in approved decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This program will incentivize engagement with USD1 and generate yield from financial activities that increase liquidity. World Liberty Financial’s Ethereum-based DeFi platform will launch publicly soon and integrate USD1 to offer users borrowing and lending services like other decentralized finance applications built on Ethereum. The project aims to create an ecosystem where users can easily deposit, borrow, lend, and earn rewards using USD1. People won’t rely on traditional banking rails anymore, and capital will move faster and more efficiently. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Recently, a stark reminder of these dangers emerged from South Korea, where a man faced severe consequences for engaging in a substantial crypto investment fraud . This case highlights the critical need for vigilance and informed decision-making in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Understanding the South Korean Crypto Investment Fraud Case In a recent development, a South Korean man in his thirties received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. His crime involved defrauding a former colleague of 440 million won, approximately $314,000 USD. Prosecutors revealed that the perpetrator lured his victim with false promises, guaranteeing extraordinary returns of 10 to 20 percent within a mere four months through cryptocurrency investments. This incident, as reported by Yonhap News, serves as a cautionary tale about the allure of quick profits in the crypto space. What Made This Crypto Investment Fraud So Deceptive? The fraudster exploited a pre-existing relationship, targeting a former colleague. This element of trust often makes such scams particularly insidious. The promise of high, guaranteed returns, especially within a short timeframe, is a classic red flag in any investment, and even more so in the highly volatile crypto market. Unfortunately, the victim fell prey to these exaggerated claims, leading to significant financial loss. This type of deception underscores a common tactic in crypto investment fraud : leveraging personal connections and making unrealistic promises. Investors must always approach such propositions with a healthy dose of skepticism, regardless of who is making the offer. How Can You Identify Potential Crypto Investment Fraud Schemes? Protecting yourself from scams requires awareness. Here are key indicators to watch out for: Unrealistic Returns: Be wary of promises guaranteeing exceptionally high returns with little to no risk. Legitimate investments always carry some level of risk. Pressure Tactics: Scammers often create a sense of urgency, pressuring you to invest quickly before “missing out” on a limited-time opportunity. Lack of Transparency: If details about the investment strategy, company, or team are vague or hard to verify, proceed with extreme caution. Complex Jargon: Some fraudsters use overly complex technical terms to confuse potential victims, making it difficult to understand what you’re actually investing in. Unsolicited Offers: Be suspicious of investment opportunities that come from unknown sources, especially through social media or unsolicited emails. Recognizing these warning signs is your first line of defense against falling victim to crypto investment fraud . Safeguarding Your Digital Assets: Essential Strategies Against Crypto Investment Fraud Taking proactive steps is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto market. Consider these strategies: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly investigate any investment opportunity. Look into the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Verify Credentials: Confirm the legitimacy of individuals or companies offering investment services. Check for proper licensing and regulatory compliance. Start Small: If you’re new to crypto, begin with smaller, manageable investments in well-established assets. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts and wallets. Consult Experts: Seek advice from reputable financial advisors who specialize in digital assets before making significant investment decisions. By adopting these practices, you significantly reduce your vulnerability to crypto investment fraud and enhance your overall security. The Serious Repercussions of Crypto Investment Fraud The South Korean case clearly demonstrates that law enforcement agencies are actively pursuing and prosecuting individuals involved in digital asset scams. Such convictions send a strong message: engaging in crypto investment fraud carries severe legal consequences, including lengthy prison sentences and significant financial penalties. This legal action not only punishes offenders but also aims to deter others from similar illicit activities, fostering a safer environment for legitimate crypto participants. Authorities worldwide are increasing their efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency space and combat financial crimes. This growing focus on accountability means that fraudsters face an ever-higher risk of being caught and brought to justice. In conclusion, while the cryptocurrency market offers exciting prospects, it is also a landscape where vigilance is paramount. The sentencing of the South Korean man for a significant crypto investment fraud serves as a powerful reminder that promises of guaranteed high returns are often too good to be true. Educate yourself, exercise caution, and always prioritize security to protect your hard-earned assets from deceptive schemes. Stay informed, stay safe. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

This significant change resulted from the individuals’ positive attitude towards the Bank of England’s interest rate cuts. This announcement came after GfK’s index, popularly known as the GfK Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers’ perception regarding their household finances, expressed a notable increase of 3 points from last month’s surge to 5. For the overall consumer confidence index, which focuses on consumers’ perception of the general economy, consumer sentiment rose to -17, reflecting a 2-point increase. This shocked analysts as they had earlier predicted that the overall consumer confidence index would remain constant. Additionally, it is the highest record score since December. UK consumers embrace the BoE’s efforts to lower borrowing costs in the country Analysts say the improvement shows that households are responding positively to lower borrowing costs, with overall sentiment now at its highest point since August of last year. This demonstrates that people have finally realized the essence of the Bank of England’s efforts to reduce borrowing costs, bringing about change for average citizens. This happened one year after the bank began lowering interest rates from 16-year highs. Another significant news for prospective buyers is that mortgage costs in the country have also started dropping. This report highlights the economy’s early stage of recovery from the damage caused by Labour’s £26bn, approximately $35 billion, hike in the cost of employing people. In addition, S&P’s business sentiment survey earlier this week showed the strongest growth in the private sector for a year. Savings intentions have fallen, undoing last month’s increase to their highest level since the financial crisis, GfK said. More people say they are ready to make expensive purchases, like cars and furniture. Despite all this, Neil Bellamy, a consumer insights director at GfK, warned that any positive sentiment around the economy could now be under threat. In a statement, Bellamy highlighted some significant challenges ahead, such as inflation, which, according to him, has been at its highest since January 2024, while unemployment is on the rise. Notably, UK inflation in July rose more than expected, with significant costs for households such as food and transport. This cautions that the squeeze on consumers could intensify if retailers raise prices to help cover higher payroll costs. The British Retail Consortium said four in ten shoppers expect to spend more on food shopping over the next three months. On the other hand, poorer households are disproportionately affected by recent rises in food prices because they spend a greater share of their income on basic goods. That creates a scenario where those struggling financially are not enjoying the benefits of appreciating real wages and lower borrowing costs. Raoul Ruparel highlights the economic effects of spending patterns Data from The Boston Consulting Group revealed that its gauge of the difference in spending patterns between those earning more than £48,000 a year and those earning less was four times higher since January. Their latest survey, released on Friday, August 22, showed that about 28% of participants plan to spend more on groceries, up from just 20 percent three months ago. In the meantime, the number of consumers with more disposable income who prefer premium brands is at the highest level observed since May. This suggests that, as the BCG report found, top earners are leading the recovery in demand. Raoul Ruparel, director of BCG’s Centre for Growth, weighed in on the situation. According to Ruparel, wealthier households are contributing factors in a scenario where spending is increasing. “Looking ahead, this ongoing divide will significantly influence how quickly and in what way consumer recovery happens,” he said.

In the last few months, a few names have surged ahead with strong presales, proven use cases, and signals that both retail players and larger holders are paying close attention. What matters now is which projects can turn this momentum into major gains after listings or big upgrades. This year, four standouts are leading the talk: BlockDAG, Cardano (ADA), Cronos (CRO), and Ethena (ENA). Each brings something unique, and together they paint a picture of what could shape the 2025 crypto race. Here’s why these names are making noise as the top trending crypto to buy. 1. BlockDAG: Breaking Records Before Day One BlockDAG is delivering numbers rarely seen in presale history. It blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) speed with Proof-of-Work security, building a system that is fast yet tough to break. On top of that, it is fully EVM-compatible, letting Ethereum-based apps and contracts run smoothly on the network. Even before its official launch, adoption is buzzing: the X1 mobile miner app already counts 2.5 million users, and more than 19,300 ASIC miners are in circulation. This mix of easy entry and pro-level mining gives BlockDAG a two-sided ecosystem. So far, more than $3 million has been raised, marking it as one of the largest presales in years. The coin sits in Batch 29 at $0.0276, and early buyers have seen paper gains of around 2,600%. Analysts speculate it could climb toward $1 after listings, which would be a 36x jump from today’s price. For anyone tracking the top trending crypto to buy, these figures highlight the kind of explosive upside people are chasing. Adding to the hype is BlockDAG’s 200 ETH prize pool, worth about $1 million, offered during presale. It’s designed to fuel more participation and reward active buyers. With hybrid tech, record-breaking fundraising, and heavy retail involvement, BlockDAG is not just in the conversation; it’s setting the pace whenever talk turns to the top trending crypto to buy . 2. Cardano (ADA): Eyeing the Next Big Jump In the past week, ADA surged more than 33%, touching $0.98 on August 14 before easing slightly to $0.90–$0.91. Daily volumes have been steady at $2–3 billion, with a market cap above $32 billion. Analysts note ADA has broken free from a long triangle pattern, and the next hurdles sit at $1.02 and $1.12. If momentum holds, targets as high as $1.50 are being discussed. A major buzz driver is speculation about a Cardano spot ETF. With Grayscale already filing, many expect fresh flows if approvals land in 2025. That possibility has fired up sentiment, putting ADA in the mix as one of the top trending crypto to buy for those wanting both steady fundamentals and sharp upside. Its ongoing upgrades and loyal community make the case even stronger. 3. Cronos (CRO): Exchange Power in Play Cronos, powering the Crypto.com ecosystem, has held steady despite broader pullbacks. Over the last three days, CRO traded between $0.149–$0.150 with a market cap near $4.85 billion and daily trading volume of around $35 million. It has dropped about 7–8% in the past week, but optimism remains tied to its DeFi, NFT, and staking role inside Crypto.com’s platform. Crypto.com has been pushing hard, adding more DeFi links and NFT features that boost CRO’s relevance. Analysts point out that even with a dip, the coin’s strong visibility and utility keep it poised for a rebound. That’s why it often shows up in talk about the top trending crypto to buy. For those looking at exchange-linked assets with payment, reward, and DeFi use, CRO continues to look steady in this cycle. 4. Ethena (ENA): Big Buyers Making Bold Moves Ethena has captured attention after strong whale activity. In the past week, one whale poured $2 million into ENA at $0.69, while Arthur Hayes grabbed 3.1 million ENA valued at $2.48 million. Even with S&P Global assigning a high-risk weighting of 1,250%, the market is signaling confidence in ENA’s ecosystem and its growth path. Currently trading at $0.70–$0.72 with a market cap near $4.7 billion and daily volumes of $800–950 million, ENA is slightly down in the last day but still up more than 130% year-over-year. This mix of whale buying, strong activity, and long-term growth chatter places ENA firmly in the spotlight for anyone hunting the top trending crypto to buy. Even with stablecoin regulatory pressure, ENA is proving its momentum is being backed into 2025. Key Takeaways When scanning the market for the top trending crypto to buy, adoption, price moves, and confidence stand out as the key signals. BlockDAG leads with its record presale, hybrid design, and strong user rewards. Cardano is breaking out with chart strength and ETF buzz that could invite new flows. Cronos gains from Crypto.com’s growth and real-world utility, while Ethena draws heavy backing despite regulatory hurdles. With more than $3 million raised and talk of hitting $1 after listing, BlockDAG is making its case as the headline name among the top trending cryptocurrencies to buy . For those ready to play bold in 2025, this list is where the action is.

While Bitcoin, Solana, and Avalanche dominate headlines, analysts are eyeing a new hidden gem altcoin poised for explosive growth: MAGACOIN FINANCE , which could deliver a staggering 8,500% ROI over the coming cycle. This week’s market snapshot shows that volatility remains high — but that’s exactly where the biggest opportunities emerge. Below, we’ll explore the 7 best altcoins to buy this week and why MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the breakout crypto you’ve never heard of (but definitely don’t want to miss). Bitcoin (BTC) — Still the King, But Facing Short-Term Turbulence Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high of $124,000 on August 14, 2025. However, the market has since pulled back to the $113,000–$115,000 range. Volatility has shaken leveraged traders, but long-term bullish indicators remain intact. Key Bitcoin Takeaways: 7–9% Pullback from ATH due to profit-taking and Fed uncertainty $54.85 Billion ETF Inflows shows ongoing institutional trust 1 ZH/s Hashrate Milestone confirms strongest-ever network security University Allocations Rising : Institutions like Harvard are now investing Despite the short-term dip, Bitcoin remains one of the best altcoins to buy for institutional-grade exposure — especially if Fed rate cuts spark another bull wave. Solana (SOL) — Institutional Favorite With Major Tech Upgrades Solana is enjoying a rapid rise, both technically and institutionally. With network upgrades like Alpenglow , Firedancer , and Confidential Transfers , Solana is narrowing the gap with Ethereum while offering faster, cheaper infrastructure. Solana Highlights: 107,000+ TPS Capacity proves high-performance dominance 6M SOL Held by Public Companies $183M Staking ETF inflows ahead of spot ETF decisions TVL at $8.6B , making it DeFi’s #2 blockchain Solana’s combination of performance and adoption makes it one of the best altcoins to buy this week — especially ahead of the October ETF decision. Avalanche (AVAX) — DeFi, Real World Assets & FIFA Driving Growth While AVAX is trading modestly around $23.34 , the network is booming beneath the surface. Avalanche’s infrastructure, especially after the Octane Upgrade , is being widely adopted for real-world asset tokenization and enterprise use. Avalanche Highlights: FIFA Blockchain now runs on Avalanche $300M Hedge Fund Tokenization via SkyBridge Capital 493% Growth in C-Chain Transactions Validator Cost Reduction by 83% AVAX’s fundamentals make it a high-upside pick among the best altcoins to buy , even if its price hasn’t caught up yet. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Explosive Hidden Gem With 8,500% ROI Potential Among the best altcoins to buy right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most undervalued yet high-potential presale token of 2025. Tipped by analysts to potentially gain 8500% by 2025, this politically-themed altcoin is building a strong ecosystem backed by real utility, viral marketing, and community-first tokenomics. As altcoin markets recover, MAGACOIN FINANCE has all the ingredients of a generational wealth opportunity. It’s already gaining attention among presale analysts as one of the best altcoins to buy before going mainstream. Countdown is now live for MAGACOIN FINANCE , and the presale is almost completely sold out. Investors are rushing in as only a small portion of tokens remain available. With the next major price surge just around the corner, getting in now could mean huge gains once the pump phase officially begins. XRP — Lawsuit Over, ETF in Sight With the SEC case finally settled , XRP is now free to operate in the U.S. without regulatory overhang. ETF applications are advancing, with analysts predicting a 95% approval chance by October . XRP Bullish Drivers: $125M Settlement Finalized — no more legal cloud XRP ETF Approvals Expected RLUSD Stablecoin Gaining Traction Price near support ($2.84–$2.94) = strong entry XRP/USDT Chart: TradingView With legal clarity and product expansion, XRP is easily one of the best altcoins to buy for exposure to the payment and stablecoin sectors. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Community Giant With Institutional Momentum Often overlooked, Dogecoin is gaining steam again with institutional adoption , ETF proposals, and record-breaking wallet growth. Why DOGE Is Back: 8M+ Wallets — 1M added in 2025 alone $500M Treasury Allocation by Bit Origin ETF Decisions Pending with 80% approval odds Entry-level support near $0.22 DOGE’s large user base and renewed institutional interest make it one of the best altcoins to buy , especially as meme coins regain popularity. Cardano (ADA) — Undervalued Layer 1 With Major Upgrades Cardano keeps changing with formal verification improvements, ecosystem growth, and a focus on compatibility. ADA Insights: Stake Pool Refactor improving scalability CIP-112 adds smart contract security 2,005 Active Projects in the ecosystem Price around $0.85 offers solid value for long-term growth For investors looking for technical rigor and ecosystem strength, ADA remains one of the best altcoins to buy on a dip. Final Thoughts: Best Altcoins to Buy Right Now The altcoin market is filled with opportunities, but these 7 projects stand out for their fundamentals, market activity, and strong catalysts. Whether you’re investing for long-term value or short-term gains, these are the best altcoins to buy this week. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the top hidden gem of 2025 and could become a breakout star for early investors. With limited token supply, explosive branding, and analyst backing for a 8500% return, it’s undeniably one of the best altcoins to buy — before the rest of the market catches on.

50469276,562566,1755828018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50469276.jpeg,First Of Its Kind: Ripple Helps Build Real-Time Crypto Crime Response System,https://bitcoinist.com/first-of-its-kind-ripple-helps-build-real-time-crypto-crime-response-system/,"Ripple has signed on as a founding member of the Beacon network, a system built to spot and stop crypto theft as it happens. It’s a move that puts a big-name company behind a new, automated method for tracking stolen funds. Short answer: it tries to catch criminals before they cash out. Beacon Offers Real-Time Alerts According to TRM Labs, the Beacon network watches flagged addresses and follows funds as they move from wallet to wallet and across different blockchains. The system sends real-time alerts to exchanges and financial firms when suspicious coins approach points where they might be cashed out. That means transfers can be noticed 24/7, and alerts arrive before funds leave an exchange. It’s not just a fancy tracker; it is made to act as an early warning system for companies that can freeze assets quickly. Ripple is proud to be a founding member of @trmlabs ’ Beacon Network — a first-of-its-kind real-time crypto crime response network. Working with industry & law enforcement, Beacon helps stop illicit funds before they exit the blockchain. Learn more: https://t.co/6Yp7IpY6Dd https://t.co/EQ0b9yFkks — Ripple (@Ripple) August 20, 2025 Major Exchanges Join In Reports have disclosed that several major platforms are already on board. Ripple, the San Francisco-based payments firm, sits alongside OKX, Crypto.com, and Anchorage Digital as inaugural members. TRM Labs also secured cooperation from Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken to share the real-time status of flagged addresses. The more firms that share information, the harder it becomes for launderers to slip through the gaps. This kind of cooperation speeds up investigations and gives law enforcement a better shot at recovering stolen coins. Real-World Pressure Test: The Bybit Heist According to reports about the February hack on Bybit, a gang tied to North Korea’s Lazarus Group made off with about $1.5 billion. That case shows why Beacon’s approach matters. Hackers used cross-chain tactics and quick movement to wash funds. When time is on the side of the thieves, freezing assets later often comes too late. Beacon aims to change that by alerting exchanges while the trail is still fresh. Gaps Remain Around Stablecoins Not everyone is a participant yet. TRM Labs did not list stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle among the initial collaborators. That’s important because stablecoins move a lot of stolen value and can be the vehicle for quick exits. If major stablecoin issuers don’t link into the system, criminals may still find ways to route funds through liquidity pools and corners of the market that aren’t watching. This is a weakness Beacon will need to close if it wants real effectiveness.

Solana has blasted past the $200 mark, fueled by growing on-chain activity and institutional demand, with targets set between $250 and $260. Meanwhile, Ethereum is riding a wave of $3.71 billion in ETF inflows while supply on exchanges drops to a three-year low, creating bullish momentum toward $5,000. But Cold Wallet is shaking things up differently. Instead of chasing charts or headlines, it’s building a cashback model that pays users. With $6.3 million raised and 740 million tokens sold, it’s already proving that demand is real. Solana’s $200 Breakout Is Built on Real Activity Solana (SOL) has broken through the $200 mark, and this time it feels different. Instead of just being another quick pump, analysts are pointing to strong fundamentals driving the move. Daily active wallets have surged to almost 3 million, DeFi activity is at record highs, and institutional buyers are paying attention. On-chain data shows Solana’s throughput has tripled since July, making the network faster and more appealing to developers. Combine that with a weaker dollar and the possibility of rate cuts, and it’s easy to see why risk assets like SOL are gaining traction. If Solana holds $200 as support, the next key resistance lies between $219–$222, opening the door to $250–$260. Ethereum’s ETF Inflows Give It New Energy Ethereum (ETH) is also showing strength. After bouncing from its $4,490 support, ETH now trades near $4,650. Resistance sits at $4,780, and a breakout could quickly push the price toward $5,000. Still, if ETH fails to clear that level, it risks sliding back to its support zone. The real story lies in ETF activity. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $3.71 billion in inflows in just eight days. Meanwhile, exchange reserves have dropped to a three-year low, signalling supply is tightening. With strong institutional backing and less ETH available to trade, conditions are lining up for further bullish pressure. Ethereum is once again proving why it’s considered the backbone of crypto. Cold Wallet Pays Users Instead of Draining Them Here’s where things get really interesting. Cold Wallet isn’t playing the same game as Solana and Ethereum. While those projects depend on market moves and technical charts, Cold Wallet is focused on one thing: rewarding its users. Every swap, bridge, and gas fee generates cashback in CWT. Instead of losing money on fees, users actually earn from them. This approach isn’t a dream, it’s already live. With $6.3 million raised and 740 million tokens sold at Stage 17 pricing of $0.00998, Cold Wallet has serious traction. The confirmed launch price of $0.3517 means early participants could see a potential 3,423% ROI. And since the presale runs across 150 stages, waiting only means paying more for less upside. The scale is already there, too. Cold Wallet gained over 2 million active users through its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, giving it an instant community before launch. Cashback can cover up to 100% of gas fees, along with rebates on swaps and ramps, with no staking or lock-ins required. It’s direct, simple, and user-first. Cold Wallet doesn’t sell hype, it delivers utility. It turns every transaction into an opportunity, flipping the idea of wallets from storage tools into income sources. In a space crowded with speculation, it’s a model that makes sense for everyday crypto use. Why These Three Coins Are Worth Watching Closely Solana is proving its rally is more than a quick pump, supported by adoption and institutional interest. Ethereum’s ETF inflows and shrinking supply point to further upside if resistance breaks. Cold Wallet, though, is rewriting the rules by rewarding users instead of charging them. With millions raised, hundreds of millions of tokens sold, and 2 million active users already in place, it’s showing that crypto wallets can be profitable, not painful. Each of these projects has a different story to tell, but if the goal is combining utility with growth, Cold Wallet is the one rewriting the playbook.

This volatility has sparked widespread speculation about the current state of the bull market, the potential for an ongoing “alt season,” and whether Bitcoin has reached its peak. In light of the current price action, market expert Miles Deutscher has shared insights on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that August may be viewed as a significant trap in the crypto market. Two Scenarios For Bitcoin First, Deutscher points out a significant change in market strength. Ethereum (ETH) seems to be outperforming Bitcoin in terms of both price and narrative. He claims that Bitcoin has been showing signs of structural weakness since early July. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Slide Toward $88K A key factor contributing to this downturn, according to the expert’s analysis, is the diminishing influence of Strategy’s (MicroStrategy) treasury purchases, which previously fueled the cryptocurrency’s last rally. Deutscher asserts that this decline in demand has resulted in stalling momentum for BTC, leading him to speculate that it may remain range-bound until further clarity emerges from upcoming interest rate decisions. In his analysis, Deutscher outlines two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory. The first possibility involves a dip to the lows around $111,000, which could coincide with Ethereum’s critical support level of $4,000. The second scenario envisions a reclaiming of the mid-range price of $115,500, which could pave the way for renewed upward momentum. Conversely, the narrative surrounding Ethereum continues to significantly gain traction, bolstered by an estimated $27 billion in sidelined capital poised for investment in the decentralized asset token (DAT) ecosystem. What’s Next For Ethereum And Crypto Market? Interestingly, ETH has recently surpassed BTC in terms of trading volume for treasury companies. Deutscher notes that this trend suggests Ethereum still has considerable room for growth relative to Bitcoin, making it a less saturated trade. This relative strength is reflected in the performance of altcoins, which have shown resilience against Bitcoin. Unlike past corrections, where altcoins suffered significant losses, this time the altcoin market has maintained support and exhibited bullish signals. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holder Count Surges Toward New All-Time Highs — Here Are The Figures Amid the current market reaction, macroeconomic factors have played a crucial role in price action. Uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policies, in light of the upcoming Jackson Hole speech, has led to a wave of de-risking among investors. The market’s response to hot Producer Price Index (PPI) data is also highlighted as it has altered expectations regarding interest rate cuts, heightening fears of a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve, contributing to the recent sell-off. Deutscher anticipates that this market behavior may lead to a “classic sell into the end of the month” pattern, particularly as September historically presents volatility for Bitcoin. However, the expert posits that once the uncertainty dissipates, particularly following the Jackson Hole event and the subsequent rate decision next month, the market may be well-positioned for another attempt at new highs. When writing, BTC trades at $113,000, attempting to consolidate 9% below its all-time high reached on August 14.

50469951,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=789537,1755828555,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50469951.jpeg,Crypto handheld buyers hit with sudden import charges,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-handheld-buyers-hit-with-sudden-import-charges/,"Gamers who bought Mysten Labs’ new crypto handheld say they’re getting unexpected import charges, sometimes worth hundreds of dollars, as current U.S. trade rules take effect. Early SuiPlay0X1 customers point to President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs,” and the company has halted its next shipment while it addresses complaints and estimates likely costs. Mysten told Decrypt it is temporarily holding the next batch while it reviews customer feedback and tallies border charges. The SuiPlay0X1 is a portable PC in the mold of Valve’s Steam Deck, but it includes a built-in crypto wallet for Sui blockchain games. It can also run titles from Steam and the Epic Games Store, among other storefronts. The hardware was built with startup Playtron and runs its GameOS. Flat price, thin margins leave Mysten unable to absorb Fees The firm produced 10,000 units for early adopters at a single global sticker price of $599 in more than 100 countries, a figure it says sits close to the per-unit build cost. With such thin margin, the company emailed buyers on Thursday to say it can’t cover the surprise import charges for everyone. “At this small scale, it is not possible to absorb tariffs and duties which differ for every country,” the email read. “It’s important to note: Mysten Labs does not receive any portion of duty fees or taxes. These are set by local and international governments and apply to all cross-border purchases. Given the unpredictable macroeconomic climate, we could not forecast how these fees might change during shipping.” DHL notified this week that more than $138 in duty was due before delivery in Illinois. The parcel originated in Hong Kong . Goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, are currently hit with a 20% tariff when entering the United States. A prior de minimis rule let items under $800 avoid those charges, but Trump ended that relief in April via executive order. Posts on social media and in the official Sui Discord show similar requests for some buyers, while others report far higher totals for one unit, some said DHL sought about $348. A Mysten representative confirmed the wide range of assessments and told customers facing “excessive” bills to email support. The message also suggested residents of certain U.S. states appear to be seeing higher amounts than others. “No customer should be charged duties equal to half their purchase price,” Mysten Labs wrote to buyers. More units delayed until late August When asked how it would assist customers with larger charges, the company did not offer specifics. “While federal duties are harmonized across the U.S., some additional state taxes can apply, as well as courier fees for administering the charge and managing payments,” the representative said. “At this time, we are unsure of the differences in duties and shipping fees between different regions of the U.S., though we are actively working to determine what these are.” With those questions unresolved, Mysten says it has paused further SuiPlay0X1 shipments. So far, 2,000 devices have been delivered; the next tranche of 3,000 is on hold. The company expects to restart deliveries by the end of August. The situation has also sparked jokes and memes. One X user said they “love seeing innovation on Sui” with the “new Tariff-Drop model.” But many customers say the surprise costs are frustrating. “If the outstanding duties of $138.11 stand, how do I get a refund?” one buyer asked in Discord. “I won’t want this product if the fees are this high—especially since I would feel purposely misled by the SuiPlay team about the total cost.” Get seen where it counts.

Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now Revealed Among 4 Hot Picks,https://timestabloid.com/shocking-gains-ahead-top-new-meme-coin-to-invest-in-now/,"What if just one early presale buy turned a $4,000 punt into life-changing money? The crypto market has seen Dogecoin millionaires, Shiba Inu dreamers, and Solana fanatics pull insane gains. But the next question every trader asks is simple—which is the top new meme coin to invest in now? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) , Banana For Scale (BANANAS31), SLERF (SLERF), and Bonk (BONK) are the tokens investors can’t stop talking about. Out of all of them, Arctic Pablo Coin has stolen the spotlight with its mythical backstory, stage 37 presale, and a staggering 100% BONUS offer that doubles tokens instantly. Let’s dig into why APC is roaring ahead as the top new meme coin to invest in now, while also breaking down other meme projects worth watching. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC): The Bullish Presale With 1718% ROI Potential In the Arctic wilderness, it is said that an explorer named Pablo stumbled upon coins glowing with mystical energy—those coins are now known as the Arctic Pablo Coin. The project isn’t just about memes; it’s about building an ecosystem that combines staking, referrals, community competitions, and deflationary tokenomics. The Rewards That Set APC Apart Arctic Pablo Coin offers staking at a jaw-dropping 66% APY, referral rewards for inviting friends, and real USD prizes for community competitions. Beyond the memes, APC runs on Binance Smart Chain for speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Its token burn mechanism ensures unsold tokens disappear forever, making supply tighter and value firmer over time. Stage 37 Presale Details: Why This Is the Moment The presale is currently at Stage 37 (Ice Ice Baby), more than 98% complete. Each APC is priced at $0.00088, and over $3.53 million has already been raised. Analysts project two ROI points: 809% ROI if APC hits the listing price of $0.008 11,263% ROI if APC climbs to the predicted moon target of $0.1 Now here’s where it gets wild: at Stage 37, early joiners are already sitting on gains of over 5,766% compared to Stage 1 buyers. Investment Math: Why People Are Going All In Let’s run a quick example. An investor drops $4,000 at the current presale price of $0.00088. That nets 4.54 million APC tokens. But with the BONUS100 offer, the tokens double instantly to 9.09 million APC. At listing ($0.008), those tokens are worth $72,727—a 1718% gain. If APC climbs to the forecasted $0.1, that same $4,000 turns into a life-changing $909,000. This bonus won’t last long. Once Stage 37 closes, the doubled token offer vanishes. Missing this could be one of those stories told like “remember when Shiba Inu was dirt cheap?” Why Arctic Pablo Coin Dominates This List Arctic Pablo Coin made it here as the top new meme coin to invest in now because of its unmatched meme coin presale structure, lucrative staking, and a presale bonus that could rewrite early investor stories in 2025. 2. Banana For Scale (BANANAS31): The Viral Meme Challenger Few coins embrace meme culture like Banana For Scale (BANANAS31). Known for its quirky branding and banana-themed community contests, this coin has managed to carve out a loyal fan base. Developers are adding gamified staking pools and a banana-swap DEX that could bring more attention to the ecosystem. Why this coin belongs to the top new meme coins to invest in now: BANANAS31 earned its spot thanks to strong meme energy, loyal backers, and new utility in DeFi that could sustain long-term growth. 3. SLERF (SLERF): A Token Born From Chaos SLERF’s claim to fame came from an infamous burn event where its entire presale funds were mistakenly sent to a dead wallet. Instead of dying, SLERF became a cult classic. Now, it’s proving resilience with community-driven marketing campaigns and surprise airdrops to loyal holders. Why SLERF is worth noting: The community has turned a blunder into a movement, making it one of the most resilient meme tokens in recent memory. 4. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Favorite As the first meme token on the Solana network, Bonk (BONK) became the “dog token” for Solana enthusiasts. Its airdrops to NFT holders kicked off one of the most viral runs on Solana in late 2023. Developers are working on integrations with Solana-based DeFi platforms, ensuring BONK remains relevant in 2025. Why Bonk deserves mention: BONK makes this list of the top new meme coins to invest in now because of its massive community and its position as the flagship meme coin of the Solana blockchain.

Kraken, a leading centralized exchange, has made a truly groundbreaking move by fully integrating SSV Network’s Decentralized Validator Technology (DVT) into its Ethereum staking services. This isn’t just a minor technical update; it’s a strategic leap forward for security, reliability, and the overall robustness of the staking ecosystem. This adoption positions Kraken at the forefront of innovation. What is Decentralized Validator Technology and Why Does it Matter? Let’s break down what Decentralized Validator Technology actually means for the average user. Essentially, DVT takes the critical task of running an Ethereum validator and intelligently splits its key responsibilities across several independent, non-trusting nodes. Think of it like a highly secure vault requiring multiple keys, each held by a different, trusted operator. If one operator faces an issue, the vault remains protected and accessible. This innovative approach drastically improves several key areas, making staking far more resilient: Enhanced Fault Tolerance: If one node experiences a temporary issue or goes offline, other nodes can seamlessly take over its duties. This prevents downtime and ensures continuous operation. Increased Uptime: Validators remain operational more consistently. Consequently, this maximizes the potential rewards earned by stakers and reduces the risk of penalties. Superior Security: Distributing the validator’s signing keys across multiple operators significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure or a malicious attack. It creates a stronger, more distributed defense. Therefore, DVT makes Ethereum staking inherently more robust, secure, and resilient for all participants. Kraken’s Bold Move: Pioneering Decentralized Validator Technology Adoption Kraken’s decision to deploy Decentralized Validator Technology at scale is a truly significant development for the entire crypto industry. They are the first major centralized exchange to embrace this cutting-edge solution, effectively setting a new benchmark for how staking services should operate. This move clearly demonstrates Kraken’s unwavering commitment to offering the most secure and reliable staking options available to its vast user base. Historically, centralized exchanges managing large staking pools have faced inherent challenges related to potential single points of failure. By adopting DVT, Kraken is actively mitigating these risks, offering a more decentralized and resilient service even within its centralized framework. This proactive and forward-thinking step could inspire other major platforms to follow suit, leading to widespread adoption of DVT. How Does This Benefit Ethereum Stakers? For anyone currently staking Ethereum with Kraken, or considering it, this integration brings tangible and immediate advantages. You might be wondering, “What does this mean directly for my staked ETH and my rewards?” The impact is quite positive. Here’s how Kraken’s adoption of Decentralized Validator Technology directly benefits you as a staker: Greater Peace of Mind: Your staked assets are now protected by a more robust, fault-tolerant, and distributed infrastructure. This reduces concerns about validator performance. More Consistent Rewards: With reduced validator downtime and enhanced operational stability, your validator is far more likely to be online and earning rewards consistently. Future-Proof Staking: Kraken is investing in the long-term health and security of Ethereum staking. This ensures your participation remains sustainable and aligned with the network’s evolution. Ultimately, this means a safer, more efficient, and potentially more profitable staking experience for Kraken users, backed by advanced technology. The Future of Staking: Decentralized Validator Technology’s Transformative Potential Kraken’s full integration of Decentralized Validator Technology isn’t just about one exchange making a smart move; it’s a powerful signal for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This adoption validates DVT as a critical and necessary component for building scalable, secure, and highly resilient staking operations. We are now likely to see an acceleration in institutional players and even individual stakers exploring and implementing DVT solutions across the board. This technology actively moves us closer to a truly decentralized and robust Ethereum network, where the risks associated with large, concentrated staking pools are significantly minimized. Moreover, it empowers a broader range of participants to operate validators with unprecedented levels of enhanced security and reliability. The future of Ethereum staking looks increasingly robust and decentralized, thanks to transformative innovations like DVT. Summary: Kraken’s full integration of SSV Network’s Decentralized Validator Technology marks a pivotal and revolutionary moment for Ethereum staking. By dramatically enhancing fault tolerance, uptime, and security through distributed key responsibilities, Kraken is not only improving its own services but also setting a formidable new industry standard. This bold step offers significant, tangible benefits to stakers and paves the way for a more resilient, efficient, and truly decentralized future for the entire Ethereum network. It’s a clear win for security, operational excellence, and the ongoing evolution of crypto staking. Frequently Asked Questions About Decentralized Validator Technology Q1: What exactly is Decentralized Validator Technology (DVT)? A1: Decentralized Validator Technology (DVT) is an innovative protocol that splits the operation of a single Ethereum validator across multiple independent nodes. This distribution of key responsibilities enhances security, fault tolerance, and uptime by eliminating single points of failure. Q2: How does Kraken’s adoption of DVT benefit Ethereum stakers? A2: For Ethereum stakers on Kraken, DVT means enhanced security, greater peace of mind, and more consistent staking rewards. The distributed nature of DVT reduces the risk of downtime and slashing penalties, leading to a more reliable and efficient staking experience. Q3: Is Decentralized Validator Technology only for centralized exchanges like Kraken? A3: No, while Kraken is the first major centralized exchange to adopt it at scale, Decentralized Validator Technology is a versatile technology. It can also be used by individual stakers, staking pools, and decentralized protocols to improve the resilience and security of their validator operations. Q4: What role does SSV Network play in this integration? A4: SSV Network provides the underlying Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) infrastructure that Kraken has integrated. SSV Network specializes in enabling this decentralized operation of Ethereum validators, offering the tools and protocols necessary for such advanced deployments. Q5: Does this integration make Ethereum more decentralized? A5: Yes, in essence, it does. By distributing validator operations, even within a centralized service like Kraken, the underlying infrastructure becomes more resilient and less prone to centralized points of failure. This moves the entire Ethereum ecosystem towards greater decentralization and robustness. Q6: Are there any risks associated with using Decentralized Validator Technology? A6: While DVT significantly reduces risks associated with single points of failure, no technology is entirely risk-free. However, DVT is designed to mitigate many common risks in staking, such as validator downtime and potential slashing events, by distributing responsibilities and enhancing fault tolerance.

Understanding why capital moves out of investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs is crucial. Net outflows mean that more money was withdrawn from these ETFs than was invested on a particular day. This recent trend suggests a shift in investor sentiment, possibly driven by a combination of factors: Profit-Taking: After periods of price appreciation, some investors might choose to realize their gains, leading to sell-offs. Broader Market Sentiment: Macroeconomic concerns, interest rate changes, or general risk-off sentiment in traditional markets can influence crypto investments. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions or lack of clarity around crypto regulations can sometimes cause investors to pull back. While a single day’s data provides a snapshot, five consecutive days of outflows signal a more persistent pattern that warrants closer examination. Analyzing Key Players in Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflows The recent data from Trader T on X offers a detailed look at which specific spot Bitcoin ETFs contributed most to the overall net outflows. It wasn’t a uniform movement across all funds; some saw substantial withdrawals, while others managed to attract new capital. BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund led the outflows significantly, with $129.07 million exiting. As one of the largest and most popular ETFs, its movements often have a magnified impact. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Following IBIT, ARKB experienced $43.28 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s offering saw $31.77 million in withdrawals, adding to the cumulative outflow figure. Interestingly, not all funds were in the red. Franklin’s EZBC recorded inflows of $3.25 million, and Grayscale’s mini BTC saw $4.97 million in inflows. This divergence indicates that while a general trend of outflows exists, some specific products or investor preferences still find opportunities. Understanding the Market Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflows When significant capital exits these investment vehicles, it can have ripple effects across the broader cryptocurrency market. While ETFs are designed to track Bitcoin’s price, large outflows can contribute to downward price pressure on Bitcoin itself. This happens as ETF providers might need to sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemption requests. Moreover, sustained outflows can affect investor confidence. If institutional and retail investors perceive a lack of demand or a negative trend in these regulated investment products, it could lead to broader skepticism towards Bitcoin as an asset class. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market is highly dynamic, and sentiment can shift rapidly based on new information or developments. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The recent outflow trend for spot Bitcoin ETFs is a crucial data point, but it does not necessarily dictate the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin or its investment vehicles. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring several factors in the coming days and weeks. Future inflow/outflow data will be key, as will broader macroeconomic indicators and any new regulatory announcements concerning digital assets. The ability of these financial products to attract and retain capital is vital for their long-term success and for fostering broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While a challenging period, such movements are a natural part of a maturing market. The resilience of Bitcoin and the continued innovation within the crypto space remain compelling factors for many. The recent $195.9 million net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 21 mark a notable shift in market dynamics. While leading funds like BlackRock’s IBIT saw significant withdrawals, some smaller ETFs managed to attract capital. This period of consecutive outflows highlights the evolving sentiment in the crypto investment landscape, reminding us that vigilance and adaptability are essential in navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency themselves, offering a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Why did U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experience net outflows on August 21? The net outflows on August 21, part of a five-day trend, likely stem from a combination of factors. These can include investors taking profits after price increases, broader negative sentiment in the financial markets, or concerns related to macroeconomic conditions that lead investors to reduce their risk exposure. Which specific spot Bitcoin ETFs saw the largest outflows? On August 21, BlackRock’s IBIT led with $129.07 million in outflows. It was followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB with $43.28 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $31.77 million. However, some funds like Franklin’s EZBC and Grayscale’s mini BTC actually recorded inflows. How do these outflows impact the broader Bitcoin market? Significant outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, as ETF providers may need to sell Bitcoin to meet redemption requests. It can also affect overall investor confidence in the digital asset space, although the crypto market is known for its rapid shifts in sentiment. Is this outflow trend expected to continue for spot Bitcoin ETFs? It is challenging to predict definitively. The continuation of this trend will depend on various factors, including future Bitcoin price movements, evolving macroeconomic conditions, and any new regulatory developments. Investors should closely monitor subsequent inflow/outflow data and broader market signals. Did you find this analysis of spot Bitcoin ETFs insightful?

Despite broader market consolidation in recent days, BNB’s performance marked a 2.6% increase in the past 24 hours. The development has drawn notable attention from traders and analysts, many of whom are now evaluating whether the momentum is sustainable. CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain shared insights on the rally, pointing to both technical signals and on-chain data as key factors behind the altcoin’s latest upward movement. According to his analysis, the decisive breakout above the $800–$810 resistance zone has turned that range into an important support level. He noted that maintaining this threshold could sustain bullish sentiment, with the $900 level emerging as the next psychological target. Related Reading: BNB Price Coiling for Breakout—Next Leg Higher in Sight Technical and On-Chain Analysis of BNB On the technical side, the altcoin’s entry into “price discovery” mode has raised questions about the sustainability of its rally. CryptoOnchain explained that breaking above historical resistance levels typically attracts new inflows and strengthens confidence in long-term holding. From an on-chain perspective, the analyst highlighted “Rolling Percentage Gains” across multiple timeframes. The data suggests that all major holder cohorts, from short-term to long-term investors, are currently in profit. This reduces potential sell pressure as investors are less motivated to exit positions. At the same time, accelerating short-term gains reflect fresh demand, while one-year rolling gains indicate that the rally is not merely speculative but backed by sustained accumulation. According to CryptoOnchain, the combination of these factors presents a case for continued strength as long as the altcoin holds above the $800 support zone. “The technical breakout is supported by confident, profitable holders,” he wrote. “As long as BNB holds the crucial $800 support level, the outlook for testing higher targets remains highly favorable.” Analysts See Potential for $1,000 Beyond technical and on-chain metrics, independent market observers are also weighing in on the altcoin’s trajectory. A crypto analyst known as BitBull on X noted that BNB’s new all-time high coincides with a structural shift in its price action. The token’s long-standing resistance has now flipped into support, creating what he described as conditions for further growth. “$BNB hit a new ATH of $880 today. It has now flipped its multi-year resistance level into support. With public-listed companies bidding BNB, $1K BNB is just a matter of time,” BitBull commented.

While some have struggled to maintain relevance, BNB has consistently grown in utility, supported by Binance’s ecosystem, which includes trading fee discounts, token launches, and blockchain infrastructure through the BNB Chain. This dynamic has helped position the token as one of the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

The measures include actions against banks, exchanges, and individuals accused of facilitating a ruble-backed stablecoin network that processed billions of dollars in transactions. According to a statement from the UK government, the blacklisted entities are linked to a $9.3 billion stablecoin known as A7A5, which was designed to replicate the ruble on blockchain platforms. Officials claim the network was a direct attempt to mitigate the impact of sanctions imposed on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. The new measures build upon more than 2,700 existing UK sanctions on Russia and mirror steps taken by the United States earlier this month . Crypto Exchanges and Stablecoin Network Under Scrutiny Among those sanctioned was the Capital Bank of Central Asia and its director, Kantemir Chalbayev, who the UK says played a role in financing goods for Russia’s military. Two Kyrgyz-based crypto exchanges, Grinex and Meer, were also placed on the sanctions list. Authorities allege these platforms were central to transactions involving the A7A5 stablecoin, which moved $9.3 billion worth of value within four months. In addition, several entities and individuals tied to the network’s infrastructure were named, including Luxembourg-based Altair Holding, CJSC Tengricoin, Old Vector, and A7A5 director Leonid Shumakov. UK Sanctions Minister Stephen Doughty emphasized that the measures were aimed at stopping Moscow from turning to alternative financial systems: “If the Kremlin thinks they can hide their attempts to soften the blow of our sanctions by laundering transactions through crypto networks, they are mistaken.” Grinex, one of the sanctioned exchanges, has been widely described as a successor to Garantex, a Russian-linked exchange previously targeted by regulators. Earlier this year, Tether froze $27 million in USDT linked to Garantex after US authorities accused the platform of facilitating illicit transactions. Kyrgyzstan’s Response and Broader Implications The announcement drew an immediate response from Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, who criticized the UK’s decision and warned against politicizing the country’s banking sector. Japarov stated that none of Kyrgyzstan’s 21 banks were engaged in helping Russia evade sanctions. To limit exposure, he explained that only the state-owned Keremet Bank is authorized to process transactions involving the Russian ruble. Keremet, however, was sanctioned by the US earlier this year for its role in handling Russian trade payments. Japarov also stressed Kyrgyzstan’s commitment to honoring international agreements, stating: “I will not allow the interests of our citizens and the trade and economic development of the country to be reduced to nothing.” The latest sanctions highlight the growing focus on crypto-financial networks as tools used to bypass restrictions. Western governments have increasingly scrutinized stablecoins and exchanges operating outside traditional banking channels , with both the US and UK arguing that such platforms could weaken the effectiveness of global sanctions regimes.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the bedrock of most portfolios, the real growth often comes from identifying early-stage projects before they explode . One name repeatedly featured as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for high-growth portfolios is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is drawing attention as investors look for ways to multiply small investments into significant returns. Building a Smarter Crypto Portfolio Many newcomers make the mistake of chasing hype without a plan. Instead, a strong portfolio starts with fundamentals. Doing your own research ( DYOR ) is essential – examining a project’s whitepaper, real-world use case, and the strength of its community. Equally important is knowing your own risk tolerance, as crypto’s volatility is not for the faint of heart. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification also plays a vital role. By spreading investments across different sectors such as DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 scaling solutions, investors reduce the risk of a single asset dragging down their entire portfolio. Strategies That Work Over Time One of the most reliable methods for long-term growth is dollar-cost averaging (DCA). By investing small amounts consistently, investors smooth out the market’s ups and downs. Another effective approach is the core-and-satellite model: keeping the bulk of capital in large-cap assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum while allocating a smaller percentage toward higher-growth altcoins. Regular portfolio rebalancing ensures that profits are locked in and reinvested wisely rather than letting gains become overexposed. New Altcoin With Huge Potential Within the high-growth altcoin category, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been singled out as a standout opportunity. Its presale rounds are selling out rapidly, and analysts are pointing to its potential for outsized gains in the upcoming cycle. With great return predictions , even a modest investment could multiply dramatically if the project continues to hit its milestones. This kind of asymmetric upside is exactly what savvy investors look for when building a portfolio designed to turn small amounts into big money. The project even hit a new record , reaching $12.5 million in funding. Security Cannot Be Overlooked No matter how strong the portfolio, none of it matters without proper security. Long-term holdings should be stored in a hardware wallet, while enabling two-factor authentication across all accounts is a must. Investors must also remain vigilant against scams, as guaranteed returns and suspicious offers remain common traps in the crypto space. Conclusion Growing wealth in crypto doesn’t require reckless risk-taking. By focusing on research, diversification, and proven strategies like DCA and rebalancing, investors can steadily build strong portfolios. For those willing to take calculated bets , opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the kind of upside that could turn small investments into significant profits in the coming years.

Stellar’s strong weekly surge and Tron’s climb toward new highs are examples of that momentum. But while both rely on charts and future signals, Cold Wallet is already proving its worth. The app is live, cashback rewards are working, and referrals are paying in USDT. All of this is happening before the project has even been listed. With more than $6.3M raised so far, Cold Wallet is no longer just a presale project. It’s a platform that is already functioning, already rewarding, and already shaping how people look at utility-driven crypto. Cold Wallet Is Delivering Before Its Launch What makes Cold Wallet so different is that it has already achieved what most projects only talk about after listing. The app is live, cashback rewards are active, and referrals are sending real USDT to users today. That kind of traction ahead of launch is rare, and it explains why momentum around the presale keeps growing. Stage 17 is currently open, with CWT priced at $0.00998. The confirmed listing price is $0.3517. That leaves a clear path for gains of 3423 percent for those entering now, while the earliest backers who joined in Stage 1 are already looking at a potential 4900 percent return. Unlike speculative projections, these numbers are locked in by the presale structure. The presale has raised over $6.3M, with more than 740 million tokens already sold. Growth accelerated after the $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet, which instantly added 2 million active users to the ecosystem. This gave Cold Wallet a head start that most projects can only hope for, putting it on a fast track to adoption. What sets it apart even further is its utility. Cold Wallet rewards users on gas fees, swaps, and transfers through cashback, creating ongoing benefits without staking or lockups. In a space where wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet often face complaints over costs and usability, Cold Wallet offers a friendlier design and a reward mechanism that turns everyday use into tangible gains. Every stage that closes raises the entry point, which is why the urgency is real. Cold Wallet is not just another presale; it’s already proving itself, and that is why many now see it as the top crypto to buy ahead of launch. Stellar Price Action Points to Bigger Moves Stellar has impressed with a 12.4 percent weekly gain, driving XLM to $0.4533. Trading volume has topped $706M, and the setup now puts $0.50 as the next critical resistance. Should that level break, Fibonacci extensions point to targets at $0.6083, $0.7194, and even $0.7733. On-chain signals support the move. Open interest has risen 13 percent to $431.87M, while funding rates remain in positive territory. Together, these indicators reflect growing demand and confidence from long-term holders. This is not just a short-term pump. Stellar’s latest breakout attempt shows strength backed by volume and positioning. Those waiting for perfect confirmation may find themselves late to the rally once the next resistance clears. Tron Eyes a Major Price Target Tron is also showing serious momentum. TRX trades around $0.3685, only a step below its all-time high of $0.44. Analysts now point to a 20 percent upside, setting a short-term price target near $0.44 if current strength continues. The technicals are aligned with this move. Support levels remain firm, and trading interest is increasing. At the same time, on-chain traction is undeniable. Tron now manages more than 80 percent of the USDT supply, making it one of the most important networks for stablecoin transfers. That usage gives credibility to the rally. Long-term holders are already sitting on gains of more than 150 percent, showing how consistent accumulation pays off. Price gaps do not stay open forever, and with both fundamentals and technicals pointing higher, Tron’s setup is one worth watching. Cold Wallet Proves Itself While Others Wait Stellar is rising, and Tron is preparing for its next move. Both may see impressive breakouts, but they remain tied to charts and projections. Cold Wallet, by contrast, is already rewarding its users with cashback and referral payouts in USDT before listing even begins. With over $6.3M raised in presale, a live product, and more than 740 million tokens sold at $0.00998 in Stage 17, Cold Wallet is showing that real delivery can outshine speculation. For those looking for the top crypto to buy right now, the decision becomes clear. While others talk about potential, Cold Wallet is already proving it.

Utility, transparency, and proven usability are quickly replacing hype as the deciding factors. That shift has made SpacePay and BlockDAG two of the most talked-about presales of 2025. SpacePay is positioning itself as a payments-first platform, aiming to make crypto spendable at physical retail locations. It’s a big promise with high potential, though execution remains uncertain. BlockDAG(BDAG) , on the other hand, is focusing on reshaping the presale itself. Its newly launched Dashboard V4 delivers real-time functionality typically reserved for post-launch ecosystems. With both names gaining momentum, the conversation is no longer about which project is more ambitious, but which one is already delivering. SpacePay’s Retail Vision Faces Real-World Challenges SpacePay has positioned itself as a solution for making crypto usable in everyday transactions. The idea is to enable seamless payments by linking digital wallets to existing retail point-of-sale systems. It’s a straightforward pitch, and the $SPY Token is being marketed as the key to unlocking this payment utility. However, the gap between concept and execution remains wide. Successful implementation will require large-scale merchant integration, regulatory clearance, and reliable infrastructure. At this stage, SpacePay has not announced any major partnerships or demonstrated active deployment of its system. The excitement around the $SPY Token price is largely speculative, riding on potential rather than progress. Adding to the pressure is competition from other platforms already testing similar solutions. Without a clear path to market, SpacePay risks losing momentum. Until there is proof of real-world traction, investor interest may be driven more by hope than fundamentals. Why BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 Is More Than Just a Presale Portal While SpacePay claims to be building real-world functionality, BlockDAG is transforming the presale experience itself. Its new Dashboard V4 doesn’t just show buyers their coins, it immerses them in a real-time crypto environment that feels like a post-launch exchange. This isn’t common in the presale world, where most dashboards offer little more than a purchase receipt. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 includes live BDAG charts, order books, wallet balance updates, and interactive tools for referrals, bonuses, and rankings. The entire platform feels like a working DeFi interface, offering immediate feedback and trading simulations. This creates not only engagement, but trust. Buyers aren’t left in the dark, they’re actively involved, watching their position shift in real time. But this isn’t just about user experience. It’s a strategic play. By familiarizing users with post-launch tools during the presale, BlockDAG lowers the barrier to trading adoption. The dashboard’s gamified features and daily rankings keep participants engaged long after their purchase. The interface even displays daily purchase activity and bonus tracking to help users gauge their standing and referrals. This kind of transparency boosts credibility and makes the experience feel more like an ecosystem than a presale. As of now, BlockDAG has raised $379 million, sold 25.3 billion coins. The $0.0276 price in batch 29 represents a 2660% ROI for early holders since batch 1, with that figure continuing to rise. By combining strategic design with presale innovation, BlockDAG is giving buyers a reason to stay long after their initial investment. Where Speculation Ends & Substance Begins Choosing between SpacePay and BlockDAG ultimately comes down to how much weight investors place on usability versus engagement. SpacePay presents a polished idea for bridging crypto with everyday commerce, and the $SPY Token price reflects growing optimism. But optimism alone won’t ensure adoption. Without merchant partnerships or working retail integrations, the real-world use case remains largely hypothetical. In contrast, BlockDAG is showing rather than telling. Its Dashboard V4 gives participants access to tools they’ll actually use post-launch, including live charts, instant balance updates, order books, and performance tracking. It isn’t just about buying a token. It’s about stepping into a platform that functions like a live product. For now, SpacePay sells a vision that still needs proving while BlockDAG delivers a working system that users can test, explore, and interact with in real time. As more investors gravitate toward presales with visible infrastructure, BlockDAG’s hands-on approach may offer a clearer path to sustained engagement and long-term confidence. In Conclusion SpacePay and BlockDAG are leading a shift toward real utility and user-centered design. With SpacePay focused on enabling global crypto payments and the $SPY Token price gaining momentum, it’s quickly earning a spot on top watchlists, but questions remain about adoption. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is redefining what it means to participate in a presale altogether. Dashboard V4 turns the passive buyer into an active participant, setting a new standard for crypto launches.

Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market witnessed significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation events, impacting major assets like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Solana (SOL). This breakdown offers a clear look at these liquidations, helping you grasp the underlying market sentiment and potential risks. What is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto perpetual futures liquidation means. When a trader opens a leveraged position (either long or short) in perpetual futures, they borrow funds to amplify their potential gains. However, if the market moves significantly against their position, their collateral might no longer cover the potential losses. At a certain point, the exchange automatically closes their position to prevent further losses, a process known as liquidation. This automated closure is designed to protect both the trader and the exchange. It’s a critical mechanism in highly leveraged trading, highlighting the inherent volatility and risk involved. Understanding liquidation helps traders assess market stability and sentiment. The Last 24 Hours: A Detailed Liquidation Breakdown The recent 24-hour period saw substantial liquidation volumes across key cryptocurrencies. This data provides a snapshot of where traders faced the most pressure and in which direction. Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $83.31 million in ETH positions were liquidated. Notably, 56.07% of these were ‘long’ positions, meaning traders betting on ETH’s price increase were caught off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin experienced $45.72 million in liquidations. An even higher percentage, 73.82%, consisted of ‘long’ positions, indicating a strong downward pressure or unexpected price dip for BTC. Solana (SOL): Solana also saw significant activity with $11.63 million in liquidations. A dominant 76.42% of these were ‘long’ positions, reflecting similar market sentiment to BTC. These figures reveal a clear trend: a majority of liquidated positions were long, suggesting that the market experienced a downward price movement that caught bullish traders by surprise. This phenomenon underscores the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. Why Do We See Such Significant Crypto Liquidation Events? Several factors contribute to large crypto perpetual futures liquidation volumes. Market volatility is the primary driver. Sudden price swings, often triggered by macroeconomic news, regulatory updates, or large institutional trades, can quickly push leveraged positions past their liquidation thresholds. The use of high leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses, making traders more susceptible to these rapid market movements. Moreover, cascading liquidations can occur. When one large position is liquidated, it can create selling pressure, which in turn triggers further liquidations, creating a domino effect. This chain reaction often leads to sharp, rapid price declines or increases, catching many off guard. Navigating the Risks: Actionable Insights for Traders For traders engaging in perpetual futures, understanding and managing risk is paramount. The recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data serves as a powerful reminder of market volatility. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, as it drastically increases your liquidation risk. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predefined point, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis to anticipate potential price movements. By adopting these practices, traders can better protect their capital and navigate the inherent risks of futures trading. The Broader Market Impact of Liquidations Significant liquidation events are not just individual misfortunes; they also offer insights into broader market sentiment. A high volume of long liquidations, as seen in the past 24 hours, often signals a bearish sentiment or a market correction. Conversely, high short liquidations could indicate a bullish reversal. These events can also impact spot market prices, as liquidated positions might involve forced selling of underlying assets. Monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data can therefore be a valuable tool for understanding the overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market, providing context beyond simple price charts. The past 24 hours have underscored the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the crypto perpetual futures market. With millions in ETH, BTC, and SOL long positions liquidated, traders are reminded of the critical importance of risk management and staying informed. While futures trading offers exciting opportunities, it demands a disciplined approach to protect capital from sudden market shifts. Always trade responsibly and prioritize capital preservation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their collateral falls below a certain threshold, preventing further losses due to adverse market movements. Why is tracking liquidation data important for traders? Tracking liquidation data helps traders gauge market sentiment, identify potential support or resistance levels, and understand periods of high volatility, aiding in more informed trading decisions. What does ‘Long 73.82%’ for BTC liquidation mean? This means that out of the total liquidated Bitcoin positions, 73.82% were ‘long’ positions. These are traders who bet on the price of Bitcoin increasing, and their positions were closed because the price moved downwards. How can traders minimize their risk of liquidation? Traders can minimize liquidation risk by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and diversifying their portfolios to avoid overexposure to single assets. Which cryptocurrencies saw the highest volume of crypto perpetual futures liquidation recently? Over the last 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) saw the highest volume of crypto perpetual futures liquidation at $83.31 million, followed by Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). Does liquidation only affect individual traders? While liquidation directly impacts individual traders, large-scale liquidation events can create cascading effects, leading to increased market volatility and influencing broader market prices and sentiment.

It’s claimed through timing, consistency, and showing up before the spotlight. XRP is grabbing attention with open interest blasting past $3 billion, while Stellar’s charts are flashing bearish signals that traders can’t ignore. Both highlight shifting sentiment, yet only one project is acknowledging early contribution before the hype sets in, giving recognition when it truly matters most. That is Cold Wallet , which flips the script by rewarding engagement during its foundation phase. Its Crystal Vault rank tracks referrals, on-chain moves, and active presence, marking who’s been shaping the project from the start. For those searching for the best long-term crypto, recognition of early participation makes all the difference, separating those who build from those who merely arrive later. Cold Wallet Rewards Active Builders With Crystal Vault! Crystal Vault isn’t a shiny badge; it’s live proof of influence inside Cold Wallet’s ecosystem, already active before listings arrive. While most projects reserve recognition for after launch, Cold Wallet is rewarding contributors now. Every app interaction, referral, and vault action counts toward climbing the ranks, providing measurable rewards before the market officially opens its doors. Cold Wallet describes Crystal Vault as “refined mastery and extensive vault influence.” This rank can’t be bought; it must be earned through consistent contribution and authentic engagement. During presale, the project is recording participation in real time, ensuring early actions have lasting weight and recognition that outlives short-term hype. With over $6.3M raised, more than 740M coins sold, and CWT priced at just $0.00998 in Stage 17, those engaging now are locking in both presence and recognition ahead of the confirmed $0.3517 launch price. That’s where Cold Wallet separates itself, rewarding builders, not just spectators, and ensuring its community grows with real recognition tied to their contributions at every stage. XRP Open Interest Crosses $3B Milestone XRP has surged back into the spotlight as open interest smashed through $3 billion after weeks of muted activity. This spike signals a fresh wave of conviction from market participants and sets the stage for a possible price rally. With leveraged positions on the rise, momentum could build quickly in either direction depending on sentiment shifts, adding urgency to the situation. For traders, this isn’t just a technical note; it’s a signal of renewed market engagement. The swelling open interest highlights belief in XRP’s near-term potential, but also warns of heightened volatility ahead. The market now watches closely to see whether this activity sparks a breakout or leads to sharp reversals, making XRP one of the most closely watched names right now. Stellar Charts Signal Bearish Pressure Ahead Stellar enters the scene with red flags flashing. A death cross has formed on shorter-term charts, while positive exchange inflows point to selling pressure rising. Together, these align into a bearish setup that suggests downside risk ahead for XLM, with every indicator flashing warning signs that demand serious attention from market watchers. Currently, Stellar is sliding toward key support zones around $0.29 to $0.26. Momentum indicators and market flows alike reinforce the caution, showing that sellers are firmly in control. Unless buying demand steps in with force, XLM could be preparing for deeper declines. For those watching the charts, these signals reflect mounting pressure that’s hard to overlook, creating a tense moment for anyone following the market. Closing Analysis Price swings make headlines, but long-term staying power is often tied to recognition. While XRP builds momentum and Stellar sends caution, neither offers a system that rewards active contribution during development, leaving builders without acknowledgment until much later. Cold Wallet does. Its Crystal Vault rank is already live, rewarding referrals, on-chain engagement, and early presence. That acknowledgment before exchange listings gives Cold Wallet a clear edge that resonates with those seeking real participation value. For those searching for the best long-term crypto, it isn’t only about market timing; it’s about being recognized for helping build what comes next and being part of something before it hits the mainstream.

Anonymous sources with insider knowledge said the deal could go through, ending the company’s sales drought in China, or crumble if ongoing trade talks between the two countries fail. The sources, who requested anonymity, disclosed that both sides were still ironing out the details of the complicated aircraft sale, including the volume and types of jet models and delivery schedules. Officials in China are already consulting with local airlines to determine their aircraft needs. The Boeing order could potentially end the long-running, contentious trade negotiations between the two nations. China has a similar deal with Airbus SE, but the details are yet to be publicized. The Cryptopolitan reported in April that Chinese officials retaliated against U.S. tariffs by stopping all Boeing orders and deliveries. China sent a $55M jet back to Boeing due to tariff pressures, threatening future sales to the country. The uncertainty over tariffs reportedly threatens to stall Boeing’s recovery efforts and hurt its supply chain. A leadership void in Boeing China also complicates things for the aerospace company. Carol Shen was appointed interim president after Alvin Liu left the company a few weeks ago. Boeing estimates that China will double its commercial fleet by 2045 The aerospace company estimated that the world’s second-largest aviation market could double its commercial fleet to 9755 jets over the next two decades. However, Boeing claimed that China’s airplane maker Comac could not cover the demand. China believes closing the deal will secure slots for aircraft deliveries, which are currently scarce since Boeing and Airbus are sold out into the 2030s. Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies, pointed out that Boeing had flexible deliveries to accommodate its most strategic customers. The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s economic planning agency, recently sought input from domestic airlines about the number of airplanes they wanted. Meanwhile, talks centered on the single-aisle 737 Max were a sign that the country was gearing up for a large aircraft order. The last major order from China was in 2017, when Boeing committed to delivering 300 single- and twin-aisle aircraft worth over $37 billion. “We certainly hope that there’s an opportunity for some additional orders in the next year with China.” – Kelly Ortberg , the CEO of Boeing However, Airbus has reportedly dominated airplane sales and deliveries to China since 2019, when two fatal accidents led the country’s regulators to ground the 737 Max. Boeing’s official website confirmed that the company has delivered only 30 orders to China since 2019. Ortberg believes long-running talks with China will eventually pay off. Tariffs threaten to kill U.S. planemaker’s business China’s recent near-total ban of rare earth mineral exports to the U.S. due to tariffs threatened to choke off Boeing’s business. A 737 Max meant for the Chinese Xiamen Airlines was also sent back to the aerospace company’s field in Seattle due to tariff-related issues. The aircraft was already awaiting completion at the Zhoushan center before it was flown back. China reportedly claimed that any business between its airlines and Boeing was likely to be crippled by tariffs. The IBA noted that tariffs made buying new airplanes from the U.S difficult for Chinese airlines, given that the 737 Max’s price increased to $55 million after all duties were levied. Some Chinese airline CEOs also said they would rather stop new aircraft orders than pay exorbitant tariff rates. The tariff wars and return of delivered airplanes reportedly came as Boeing recovered from dwindling business due to trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

LIBRA token skyrockets 393% in one day, fueled by asset release and renewed investor attention. Despite lawsuit uncertainty, traders push LIBRA higher, with volume rising and volatility returning to the token. Federal Judge Releases Frozen USDC A US federal judge has lifted a freeze on over $57 million in USDC connected to the Libra token lawsuit. The funds were held in two wallets tied to meme coin promoter Hayden Davis and Ben Chow, the former CEO of Meteora exchange. The assets were frozen in May as part of a class-action case brought by investors seeking over $100 million in damages related to the collapse of the Libra token. Judge Jennifer L. Rochon, presiding in the Southern District of New York, said she no longer saw a reason to keep the freeze in place. The court found that both Davis and Chow had complied with earlier restrictions and had made no attempt to move or conceal the funds. Meanwhile, the lawsuit remains ongoing. Although Judge Rochon removed the freeze, she did not dismiss the case. She noted the early stage of proceedings and said the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that keeping the funds frozen was necessary. During the hearing, Chow’s attorney, Samson Enzer of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, referred to the claims as “untested” and said they plan to file a motion to dismiss. The court’s decision to release the funds gives the defendants access to capital as they prepare their defense. LIBRA Token Sees Sharp Price Reaction Following news of the asset release, the price of the LIBRA token jumped sharply. It rose over 393% in the last 24 hours and by more than 409% over the past week. At the time of writing, LIBRA is priced at $0.043 with a daily trading volume of just under $70,000. Source: Coingecko Remarkably, the surge comes months after LIBRA’s collapse in February. The token reached a peak market cap of $4.56 billion shortly after its launch, driven in part by a now-deleted social media post from Argentine President Javier Milei. The post led many to believe the project had government support, but the price dropped by more than 97% within 24 hours. Project Remains Under Scrutiny Davis became the public face of the project during its decline and later claimed he remained in control of the token’s assets. Chow resigned from Meteora after the fallout, with internal disputes over the decision to work with Davis. Although there have been unresolved legal issues, the recent court ruling has raised eyebrows over LIBRA. Demand is back on the rise; however, the future of the project remains uncertain in the long term.

Major financial conglomerate SBI Holdings, in a strategic joint venture with crypto infrastructure powerhouse Startale Group, has officially unveiled an on-chain tokenized stock trading platform . This exciting initiative promises to revolutionize how we perceive and interact with real-world assets (RWAs) and traditional equities. Unveiling the Future: SBI’s Revolutionary Tokenized Stock Trading Platform This new platform represents a significant leap forward for the digital asset space. SBI Holdings, a long-standing titan in the Japanese financial sector, brings its extensive network and regulatory expertise to the table. They are combining forces with Startale Group, a company renowned for its cutting-edge blockchain technology and infrastructure solutions. Together, they aim to create a seamless and efficient marketplace. The primary goal is to launch an on-chain trading platform specifically designed for tokenized stocks and other real-world assets. This collaboration, as reported by The Block, is set to bridge crucial gaps in the existing digital asset landscape. What Makes This Tokenized Stock Trading Platform a Game-Changer? The newly launched platform is not just another trading venue; it introduces several transformative features designed to enhance accessibility and efficiency in financial markets. These innovations directly address some of the long-standing limitations of traditional trading systems: 24/7 Trading: Unlike conventional markets with fixed hours, this platform will allow continuous trading, offering unprecedented flexibility to global investors. Quicker Cross-Border Settlements: Leveraging blockchain technology, transactions will settle significantly faster across international borders, reducing delays and operational costs. Fractional Ownership: Investors can purchase small portions of high-value assets, making investments more accessible and democratized. This is a key benefit of a robust tokenized stock trading platform . Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Linkages: The platform will integrate tokenized stocks with DeFi protocols, unlocking new opportunities for lending, borrowing, and other financial services using these digital assets. These features collectively aim to create a more liquid, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem. It’s a bold step towards integrating traditional finance with the innovative capabilities of blockchain. Bridging Gaps with the New Tokenized Stock Trading Platform Existing tokenized stock markets often face challenges related to liquidity, regulatory clarity, and interoperability. The joint venture between SBI and Startale is strategically positioned to tackle these issues head-on. By merging SBI’s robust financial network with Startale’s advanced blockchain infrastructure, the platform is designed to offer a comprehensive solution. This synergy is crucial for building trust and ensuring operational efficiency. It provides a secure and compliant environment for trading digital representations of traditional assets. The development of such a sophisticated tokenized stock trading platform signals a maturing market for digital assets, moving beyond just cryptocurrencies to include a broader range of financial instruments. The Broader Impact of Tokenized Stock Trading Platforms The implications of this platform extend far beyond just stocks. The ability to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) opens up vast possibilities for various sectors. Imagine owning a fraction of a commercial building, a piece of fine art, or even a share in a renewable energy project, all tradable on a blockchain. This could unlock trillions of dollars in illiquid assets, bringing them into the digital economy. While the benefits are clear, the journey for tokenized stock trading platform s also involves navigating complex regulatory landscapes and ensuring robust security measures. However, with established financial players like SBI Holdings entering the fray, confidence in the future of tokenized assets is growing rapidly. This platform is a powerful example of how traditional finance and blockchain can collaborate to build the next generation of financial markets. In essence, the collaboration between SBI Holdings and Startale Group is not merely about launching a new service; it’s about pioneering a new era of financial accessibility and efficiency. Their innovative tokenized stock trading platform is set to redefine asset ownership and trading, making markets more liquid, transparent, and available to a global audience around the clock. This development truly marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a tokenized stock trading platform?

Ripple, a leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, recently announced a groundbreaking partnership. This collaboration aims to introduce the RLUSD stablecoin to the Japanese market, marking a pivotal moment for digital currencies in the region. This strategic move, detailed on Ripple’s official website, involves a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Japan’s financial services giant SBI Holdings and its subsidiary, SBI VC Trade. Together, they are paving the way for a new era of digital payments and financial innovation in Japan. What is the RLUSD Stablecoin and Why Does it Matter? The RLUSD stablecoin is a digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. Its primary purpose is to offer the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology without the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes stablecoins incredibly useful for various financial activities, including: International Remittances: Sending money across borders becomes faster and cheaper. Cross-Border Payments: Businesses can settle transactions more efficiently. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are a cornerstone of many DeFi applications. For Japan, the introduction of the RLUSD stablecoin signifies a commitment to embracing advanced digital financial tools. It offers a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy. How Will This Partnership Benefit Japan’s Digital Economy? The collaboration between Ripple and SBI Holdings is set to unlock numerous benefits for Japan. SBI Holdings, a major player in Japan’s financial sector, has a long-standing relationship with Ripple, making this expansion a natural progression. Key advantages for the Japanese market include: Enhanced Payment Efficiency: The RLUSD stablecoin facilitates near-instantaneous transactions, drastically reducing settlement times compared to traditional banking systems. Reduced Transaction Costs: Businesses and individuals can expect lower fees for both domestic and international transfers. Increased Financial Inclusion: Access to digital financial services can expand, benefiting a broader segment of the population. Innovation Catalyst: This initiative could spur further development in Japan’s blockchain and digital asset ecosystem. Moreover, the partnership leverages SBI’s extensive network and regulatory expertise, which is crucial for successful stablecoin adoption in a regulated market like Japan. Navigating the Path: Potential Challenges and Opportunities for RLUSD Stablecoin While the prospects are exciting, introducing a new digital asset like the RLUSD stablecoin into a mature market like Japan also presents its challenges. Regulatory clarity, consumer education, and fierce competition are all factors that need careful consideration. However, the opportunities far outweigh these hurdles. Japan has shown a progressive stance towards digital assets, with a robust regulatory framework already in place for cryptocurrencies. This provides a solid foundation for the RLUSD stablecoin to thrive. The partnership’s focus on compliance and security will be paramount in building trust among users and institutions. As a result, this move could set a precedent for other nations considering similar stablecoin integrations. What Does This Mean for the Future of Global Payments? Ripple’s strategy with the RLUSD stablecoin extends beyond Japan. This launch is part of a broader vision to establish a global network of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The goal is to facilitate seamless, efficient, and cost-effective cross-border payments worldwide. The success of this venture in Japan could serve as a powerful case study. It demonstrates how established financial institutions and blockchain innovators can collaborate to modernize payment infrastructures. Ultimately, this move positions Japan at the forefront of digital currency adoption, potentially influencing future global financial trends. In conclusion, the partnership between Ripple and SBI to bring the RLUSD stablecoin to Japan is a landmark event. It promises to revolutionize payments, foster innovation, and solidify Japan’s role as a leader in the evolving digital economy. This collaboration exemplifies a forward-thinking approach to integrating advanced blockchain technology into everyday financial services, setting a new benchmark for global digital finance.

Kanye West Memecoin Launch Leaves 60% Of Investors In The Red,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/another-celebrity-scam-kanye-west-memecoin-launch-leaves-60-of-investors-in-the-red/,"Amid the controversial launch of Kanye West’s official memecoin on Solana, the crypto community has sounded the alarm for another potential celebrity token scam, with insider trading allegations outshining Ye’s party. Related Reading: Chainlink Eyes Crucial Resistance After $25 Reclaim – Breakout Or Breakdown Next? The Rise And Fall Of YZY On Wednesday night, controversial Hip-Hop artist and public figure Ye, better known as Kanye West, launched his official memecoin, YZY, on the Solana blockchain. West announced the token in his X account, posting the contract address (CA) in a picture with the caption “YEEZY MONEY IS HERE. A NEW ECONOMY, BUILT ON CHAIN.” After the announcement, the memecoin skyrocketed to a market capitalization of $3.1 billion before quickly dropping 65% to the $1.1 billion mark in the following hours. Meanwhile, YZY’s price went from an all-time high (ATH) of $3.16 to hover between the $0.95-$1.30 price range. The crypto community reported multiple red flags, including allegations of insider trading and a lawsuit waiver. Notably, the official website has a controversial waiver that raised concerns among investors. In the “What Else Should I Know?” section, the website stated that by purchasing the token, investors agree they “will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy” that they may have against any of the “Covered Parties.” “if you’re buying this ur literally giving them permission to rug you without consequences,” a community member noted. Nonetheless, investors may opt out of the dispute resolution provision by “providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Website,” the page reads. Ye’s Memecoin Supply Owned By Insiders Conor Grogan, director at Coinbase, estimated that at least 94% of the supply was owned by insiders, with 87% of the token being held by a single multisig wallet before it was distributed to multiple wallets. According to the “YZYNOMICS”, 20% of the token’s distribution would be for public supply, 10% for liquidity, and 70% for Yeezy Investments LLC. On-chain analytics firm Bubblemaps affirmed that “the bubble map of YZY mostly MATCHES the distribution on Kanye’s website,” cautioning that “the 17% address ‘public supply’ is UNLOCKED and can sell at any time.” Lookonchain highlighted that only YZY had been added to the liquidity pool, with no USDC, warning that the “Dev may sell YZY by adding/removing liquidity, similar to LIBRA.” Additionally, they noted that multiple insider wallets had prepared funds in advance and bought the memecoin, with one address knowing the CA and attempting to purchase YZY yesterday. The on-chain wallet tracker also cautioned that West had added 30 million YZY, worth $34 million, to the liquidity pool with a price range of $3.17-$4.49, signaling that “once the price climbs above $3.1716, he’ll start earning fees while gradually selling YZY for USDC. If the price rises above $4.4929, all 30M YZY will be sold.” Investors See Red Numbers On-chain researcher Defioasis affirmed that the YZY launch was “more of the same,” revealing that, so far, most wallets holding West’s memecoin are in the red. According to their analysis, 56,050 addresses traded the token in the past 13 hours, with 25,166, or 44.9% of the wallets, engaging in one-sided transactions. Out of these addresses, 23,723 only bought the memecoin, while 1,443 only sold it. They suggested that “some of the former may be dust addresses aimed at increasing the number of addresses, while others are either holding onto their positions or stuck in losses,” adding, “The latter are primarily project teams/large holders using multiple addresses to sell, making it harder to track them directly.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop Below $110,000 Despite Bounce – Is A 15% Pullback Coming? Meanwhile, 30,884 addresses had two-way transactions, with 38.07% of addresses registering realized profits. 30% of these wallets had a profit of up to $500, while only 1.31% of them had profits exceeding $10,000. Among this 1%, only 5 addresses had over $1 million in profits, with one of them being identified as an insider. On the contrary, over 60% of participants are still in a loss position, the report noted, with 28.2% of the addresses losing up to $500.

Cold Wallet Presale + Avalanche, Polygon & NEAR Are Top Picks",https://thecoinrise.com/buying-crypto-in-2025-cold-wallet-presale-avalanche-polygon-near-are-top-picks/,"Momentum defines success in the world of buying crypto. Some projects are pushing forward with bold initiatives, while others enter quieter phases that leave traders weighing risk versus reward. At present, four standout names are steering market conversations for different reasons. Cold Wallet (CWT) is racing through its presale with $6.40 million secured and a huge ROI gap before launch. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) is in an unusual period of inactivity with no major developments. Polygon (MATIC to POL) is preparing for a major token migration and scheduled upgrade, while NEAR Protocol gears up for a hard fork that could shape its next growth phase. Together, these stories highlight the range of opportunities facing the buying crypto community, from explosive presales to technical overhauls. 1. Cold Wallet’s $6.40M Presale Frenzy: Buying Crypto Opportunity on a Countdown Cold Wallet (CWT) is reshaping what a crypto wallet can deliver, and the buying crypto crowd has noticed. In just weeks, the presale has raised $6.40 million, selling 755 million tokens as it moves through Stage 17. At the current $0.00998 price, buyers are targeting a 3,423% ROI by launch, when CWT lists at $0.3517. Instead of draining users through fees, Cold Wallet flips the script by rewarding transactions in CWT without staking or lockups. Its $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet also onboarded 2 million+ active users before launch, a level of adoption most projects struggle for years to achieve. As MetaMask and Trust Wallet face mounting user frustrations, Cold Wallet’s streamlined, reward-driven design offers a major shift for buying crypto strategies. But with each stage completed, entry costs rise, shrinking potential ROI. Stage 17 may be one of the final windows to capture this opportunity at its peak before adoption accelerates. 2. Polygon: Token Migration Draws Buying Crypto Attention Polygon is preparing for a landmark transition as MATIC migrates to POL on August 26, 2025. Major exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, have confirmed support, which should ease concerns about execution. Technically, MATIC’s RSI at 38 shows oversold conditions, hinting at a possible rebound. On August 27, the network will undergo planned maintenance to enable native deployment of USDT0 on Polygon PoS, an upgrade that boosts liquidity and utility, potentially shifting buying crypto sentiment. For traders, these back-to-back events may create volatility but also opportunities. The outcome will depend on how smoothly both migration and the upgrade unfold. 3. Avalanche: A Quiet Phase in the Buying Crypto Market Avalanche has entered an uncharacteristic quiet period, with no major announcements or partnerships in the last five days. While the network remains stable, AVAX price movement is being shaped more by overall buying crypto sentiment than by direct project news. This silence could signal a strategic build-up behind the scenes, or simply a stall in visible growth. For traders, it’s a reminder that not every asset comes with constant catalysts. Long-term signals, such as dApp traction, subnet growth, and cross-chain integrations, may offer clearer insights. In a space often dominated by fast news cycles, Avalanche’s pause is unusual and potentially calculated. 4. NEAR Protocol: Upgrade Momentum Fuels Buying Crypto Optimism NEAR Protocol is preparing for a major upgrade and hard fork scheduled for August 18, 2025. Binance will oversee technical handling, temporarily pausing deposits and withdrawals for one hour while leaving trading active. Market response has been bullish. NEAR’s price is up nearly 6% at $2.79, with trading volume doubling and growing institutional interest adding fuel. Chart signals suggest a breakout, though analysts caution that a pullback toward support could still occur if momentum slows. For the buying crypto community, the coming week is pivotal. Whether NEAR sustains this momentum post-upgrade or faces profit-taking will determine its trajectory. Best Cryptos to Watch Closely Across the buying crypto spectrum, opportunity looks very different for each project. Cold Wallet’s high-ROI presale window is narrowing fast, making timing essential. Avalanche’s silence may test patience but could precede new strategies. Polygon’s token migration and network upgrade create a rare short-term trade setup, while NEAR’s hard fork blends technical improvements with bullish sentiment. The takeaway? Markets reward those who distinguish hype from substance. Cold Wallet is winning attention with real utility and explosive growth, while the others offer measured plays that depend on execution and patience. The post Buying Crypto in 2025?

XRP, Cardano, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all being discussed in the latest rankings, with forecasts pointing to potential 40x gains . Each coin has a different setup, but MAGACOIN is drawing extra attention for how quickly it’s stealing momentum in this market cycle. XRP Whales Shake the Market XRP price prediction has taken a sharp bearish turn. Ripple slipped under the $3 mark for the first time in weeks, now trading at $2.84. The drop represents a 5% decline in the past 24 hours and 17% over the past month. What’s more concerning—whales have dumped nearly 470 million XRP in just 10 days. Such a degree of selling pressure is seldom a positive indicator. Although 90% of wallets continue to display gains, the sentiment has quickly changed. Panic selling has become a genuine threat. The graphs also appear unpromising. RSI is at 42, while XRP is below its 10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages. Experts caution that if $2.86 is breached, a steeper decline may occur Cardano Approaches an Inflection Point Cardano has been trying to hold steady after a volatile stretch. The token was priced at $0.8763 on Wednesday, rising modestly from previous lows but remaining far below the $1 threshold. After momentarily surpassing Tron and Dogecoin in market capitalization, ADA is currently engaged in a close competition with both. All three are above $30 billion, competing for the eighth position among leading cryptocurrencies. Traders are keeping a careful eye on Cardano since it is creating a triangular formation, which is typically a precursor to a major breakout. Support is around $0.88, and resistance is around $0.98. If it stays over $1, it could make a bullish push to $1.10 or higher. Adding fuel to the bullish case, ADA has just flashed a golden cross—a powerful signal that often kicks off longer uptrends. MAGACOIN FINANCE Becomes the Spotlight Pick MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects this season. As Q4 nears, analysts are watching the breakout moves of XRP and Cardano, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight with projections of a 1200% surge. The excitement surrounding the project has been difficult to overlook. In contrast to older tokens struggling with resistance points and whale sell-offs, MAGACOIN is drawing interest from traders seeking new opportunities before the markets become active. The narrative is simple: analysts see MAGACOIN positioned not just for steady growth, but for a potential run that could outpace most top-10 cryptos by year’s end. With the altcoin market shifting quickly, the project is increasingly being seen as the one to watch. Final Word The most recent rankings show three names that traders are still talking about the most. XRP is under negative pressure, Cardano is at a major turning point, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the clear winner with huge upside potential. If analysts are correct about the 40x forecast , these three tokens could define the next big wave of altcoin gains—with MAGACOIN holding the strongest spotlight heading into Q4.

After experiencing a four-day period of outflows, U.S. spot ETH ETFs witnessed a remarkable turnaround, recording an impressive $290.35 million in net inflows on August 21. This substantial influx signals renewed investor interest and a potential change in market sentiment for Ethereum-backed investment products. What Drove the U.S. Spot ETH ETFs Inflow Reversal? The data, meticulously tracked by “Trader T” on X, highlights a strong day for these investment vehicles. The $290.35 million net inflow effectively ended a recent streak where more money was leaving these funds than entering. This positive development suggests a fresh wave of confidence among institutional and retail investors alike. Several key players contributed to this significant daily total: BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge with a substantial $236.34 million. Fidelity’s FETH followed, attracting $28.53 million. Bitwise’s ETHW added $6.99 million. Grayscale’s mini ETH saw $6.36 million in inflows. VanEck’s ETHV contributed $6.21 million. Grayscale’s ETHE also recorded a positive $5.92 million. Interestingly, the remaining U.S. spot ETH ETFs reported no significant changes in their holdings for that specific day, indicating that the bulk of the new capital was concentrated in a few major funds. Understanding the Impact of Ethereum ETF Movements For those new to the crypto space, U.S. spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that directly hold Ethereum (ETH) and trade on traditional stock exchanges. They offer investors exposure to ETH price movements without requiring them to directly buy and store the cryptocurrency. Therefore, significant inflows into these ETFs often reflect growing institutional and broader market appetite for Ethereum. Such a strong day of inflows can act as a bullish signal, potentially influencing market perception and price action for Ethereum itself. It indicates that professional money managers and larger investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to this asset class. However, it is crucial to remember that the crypto market remains dynamic, and sentiment can shift rapidly. Key Players and Their Contributions to U.S. Spot ETH ETFs BlackRock’s dominant performance on August 21, with its ETHA fund alone accounting for over 80% of the day’s total inflows, is particularly noteworthy. This highlights the immense influence and trust that major financial institutions like BlackRock command in the investment world. Their active participation often legitimizes new asset classes for a wider audience. The consistent, albeit smaller, contributions from other reputable firms like Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, and VanEck further underscore a diversified institutional interest in Ethereum. This broad participation suggests that the demand for regulated crypto investment products is not isolated to a single entity but is gaining traction across the financial sector. What’s Next for U.S. Spot ETH ETFs? The $290.35 million inflow marks a significant positive moment for U.S. spot ETH ETFs . While one day of strong performance doesn’t define a long-term trend, it certainly provides a fresh perspective after a period of outflows. Investors will be keenly watching whether this momentum continues or if it was a singular event. Looking ahead, continued inflows could provide a strong foundation for Ethereum’s market stability and growth. Conversely, a return to outflows might signal lingering caution. For investors, monitoring these ETF flows can offer valuable insights into institutional sentiment and potential future price action for Ethereum. Always consider market volatility and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. In conclusion, the substantial $290.35 million inflow into U.S. spot ETH ETFs on August 21 is a compelling development. It signals a notable shift in investor confidence, particularly after a period of withdrawals. This event underscores the growing role of regulated investment products in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and highlights the increasing institutional embrace of Ethereum as a viable asset class. It’s an exciting time to watch how these trends unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. spot ETH ETFs? U.S. spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that directly hold Ethereum (ETH) and trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why are inflows important for U.S. spot ETH ETFs? Inflows signify that investors are putting more capital into these funds than they are withdrawing. This often indicates growing investor confidence, increased demand, and a potentially bullish sentiment for Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Which firm saw the largest inflow on August 21? BlackRock’s ETHA fund led with a significant $236.34 million in inflows on August 21, accounting for a large portion of the day’s total. Does this mean Ethereum’s price will go up? While strong inflows into U.S. spot ETH ETFs can be a positive indicator and may influence market sentiment, they do not guarantee an immediate or sustained increase in Ethereum’s price. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, and prices can remain volatile. What does the “four-day streak of outflows” mean? A “four-day streak of outflows” means that for four consecutive days prior to August 21, more money was withdrawn from U.S. spot ETH ETFs than was invested, indicating a period of decreased investor interest or profit-taking.

A $50 million Trump-linked acquisition of a DOGE mining firm, Wyoming’s launch of a state-backed stablecoin, and comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling a softer stance on digital assets all converged to trigger fresh institutional flows. News Background • Thumzup, a Trump-affiliated entity, acquired Dogehash for $50 million, creating what executives described as the largest DOGE mining operation. The deal signals deep-pocketed confidence in Dogecoin infrastructure. • Wyoming unveiled the Frontier Stable Token, the first government-backed state stablecoin, reinforcing the U.S. regulatory pivot toward digital assets. • Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman warned banks about competitive risks from delaying digital asset adoption, signaling a more crypto-accommodative posture. • SoFi Technologies integrated Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, targeting the $740 billion remittance market — another signal of traditional finance edging deeper into crypto rails. Price Action Summary • DOGE traded in a $0.01 band from $0.21 to $0.22 between Aug. 20 15:00 and Aug. 21 14:00, marking ~4–5% intraday volatility. • The token rallied 5% from $0.21 to $0.22 during the Aug. 20 evening session, establishing $0.22 as near-term resistance. • A late-session 60-minute window (Aug. 21 13:22–14:21) saw DOGE surge 1% from $0.22 to $0.22 with volume spikes above 61.8 million, confirming institutional activity. • Support consistently held in the $0.21–$0.22 zone with bounces on 320–380 million volume across key testing points. Technical Analysis • Support : $0.21–$0.22 established as reliable floor with repeated high-volume retests. • Resistance : $0.22 key pivot cleared, but bulls need follow-through toward $0.225 to confirm breakout. • Volume : Peak surges of 61.8 million and 378.6 million confirm institutional buying interest. • Pattern : Classic consolidation followed by impulsive breakout; upward trajectory if support base holds. • Futures OI : Stable around $3 billion, reflecting sustained leveraged interest despite macro volatility. What Traders Are Watching • Whether DOGE can sustain above the $0.22 pivot and push toward $0.225–$0.23 resistance. • The market’s reaction to Fed policy shifts and Wyoming’s stablecoin launch — potential sector-wide tailwind. • Whale accumulation patterns, already totaling 2 billion DOGE ($500M) this week. • Mining sector expansion via Thumzup’s acquisition and its impact on DOGE’s hashpower distribution.",Markets|Dogecoin|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MINING|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-22 05:17:12

Rick Rieder, CIO of BlackRock Global Fixed Income and head of the Global Allocation team, said on Fox Business that he expects the Fed to cut interest rates in September. “My guess is that the Fed will deliver a message about maintaining economic stability. However, the current data, particularly the slowdown in employment, creates a favorable environment for a rate cut,” Rieder said. Rieder stated that interest rates are currently higher than they should be, adding, “Personally, I think a faster and stronger cut is possible. Even a 50 basis point cut is possible.” Related News: Nasdaq Listed Company Announces $700 Million Purchase of Surprise Altcoin - But Price Remains Flat Drawing attention to the weakness in the labor market, Rieder emphasized that employment growth, excluding the healthcare sector, has been negative in the last three months, signaling a slowdown in the economy. Rieder, noting that inflation is still above the Fed's target but does not pose a serious threat, said, “Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has been at 2.8% on an annualized basis for the last three months. This is not a scary figure.” The program also addressed reports that Rieder could replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Responding to these claims, Rieder stated, “It's an honor to even be considered for such a role.

This move could signal a significant moment for the adoption and perception of digital assets, especially with a figure like Eric Trump at the forefront. His presence is expected to draw considerable media attention, shining a spotlight on the evolving landscape of blockchain and crypto technologies. Why is Eric Trump Advocating for Cryptocurrency in Japan? The decision by Eric Trump to specifically target Japan for his cryptocurrency promotion efforts is quite strategic. Japan has long been recognized as a leader in the cryptocurrency space, having established clear regulatory frameworks earlier than many other nations. This proactive approach has fostered an environment where digital assets can thrive, making it an ideal location for high-profile advocacy. Moreover, the Japanese market shows a strong interest in technological innovation. Eric Trump’s involvement could leverage this existing enthusiasm, potentially accelerating the mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. His visit aims to engage with key stakeholders, from investors to developers, to discuss the future and benefits of decentralized finance. Regulatory Clarity: Japan’s clear rules provide a stable ground for crypto discussions. Tech-Savvy Population: A receptive audience keen on new financial technologies. Market Potential: Opportunities for growth and investment in digital assets. Japan’s Dynamic Cryptocurrency Landscape Japan’s journey with cryptocurrency has been unique. It was one of the first countries to recognize Bitcoin as legal property, setting a precedent for global adoption. This forward-thinking stance has allowed its crypto market to mature, albeit with its share of challenges and triumphs. The country is home to several prominent crypto exchanges and a vibrant community of blockchain innovators. However, the market also faces continuous scrutiny regarding security and investor protection. Eric Trump cryptocurrency discussions could bring renewed focus to these areas, potentially encouraging further innovation while reinforcing the need for robust safeguards. The goal is to highlight the benefits while addressing inherent risks in the digital asset space, fostering a balanced understanding. What Impact Could Eric Trump’s Cryptocurrency Advocacy Have? An endorsement from a well-known public figure like Eric Trump can significantly boost the visibility and credibility of cryptocurrency. This increased exposure might encourage new investors to explore digital assets, leading to greater market liquidity and potentially driving innovation in the sector. His visit could act as a catalyst for discussions on how digital currencies can integrate more seamlessly into traditional financial systems. Conversely, such high-profile promotion also comes with challenges. It may attract heightened regulatory scrutiny and could polarize public opinion, especially given the political affiliations involved. It is crucial for the message to focus on the technological merits and economic benefits of cryptocurrency, rather than political endorsements, to ensure broad appeal and sustainable growth. Increased Awareness: Broader public understanding of digital assets. Investment Influx: Potential for new capital entering the crypto market. Regulatory Scrutiny: Could prompt further examination of crypto policies. Public Perception: Shaping how the general public views digital currencies. The Future of Digital Assets After This Visit The planned visit by Eric Trump to promote cryptocurrency in Japan is more than just a promotional tour; it signifies a growing trend of influential figures engaging with the digital asset world. This trend suggests that cryptocurrencies are moving beyond niche investment circles and into mainstream consciousness. Such endorsements can accelerate the adoption curve, making digital assets a more integral part of the global economy. For investors and enthusiasts, this development underscores the increasing legitimacy of the crypto space. It highlights the ongoing shift towards a decentralized financial future, where blockchain technology plays a pivotal role. The dialogue initiated by such visits can pave the way for more robust infrastructure and wider acceptance for Eric Trump cryptocurrency initiatives. In conclusion, Eric Trump’s upcoming visit to Japan to promote cryptocurrency represents a significant event for the digital asset industry. It brings a prominent voice to the discussion, highlighting Japan’s advanced regulatory environment and tech-savvy population. While the visit promises increased visibility and potential for market growth, it also underscores the ongoing need for clear communication, robust security, and balanced regulatory approaches.

In 2023, this meme coin based on frogs turned a small investment of $72 into more than $10,000, which shocked even the most experienced crypto fans. People who bought PEPE early made a lot of money, and now many people are asking: could another frog meme coin do the same thing? The answer is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a new meme coin with a stronger technical base, meaning it could make even more money. Like its forerunner PEPE, LILPEPE is a meme coin based on the viral meme “Pepe the Frog.” However, LILPEPE is more than a mere novelty token; it is built on an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain. This makes transactions faster, fees lower, and scalability better than regular meme coins. LILPEPE is an exciting investment opportunity for people who want to get in on the next big meme coin. The community is growing, the presale raised more than $20.2 million, and some experts think the price could go up by as much as 12,000% by 2025. Let’s examine how LILPEPE can outperform PEPE in the next few years. How Pepe Coin (PEPE) Made Huge Profits in 2023 Pepe Coin (PEPE) was one of the best things in 2023. The meme coin shocked everyone in a market with thousands of cryptocurrencies. The coin quickly gained popularity, starting at just a few cents. This was due to social media buzz, celebrity endorsements, and its viral link to the famous Pepe the Frog meme. Investors who got in early made a lot of money. For instance, a small investment of $72 grew to more than $10,000 as the price of PEPE rose by more than 10,000% in just a few months. The fast growth of Pepe Coin demonstrated the strength of meme coins and those related to cultural events in particular. It is a risky bet because the high price is driven by the effect of hype and the speculative nature of trading peculiar to most meme coins. The price of PEPE has experienced a setback following its massive spike, which has sparked speculation among many investors about whether another meme coin might blow up in the future. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the answer. It has the same meme culture appeal, real use, and a technical edge. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Next Meme Coin With Growth Potential Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly becoming popular in cryptocurrency because it offers more than just meme value. LILPEPE is built on a Layer-2 blockchain that works with Ethereum. It solves some of the most significant problems of traditional meme coins, such as high transaction fees and slow speeds. LILPEPE is a good choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, decentralized exchanges, and other blockchain uses because it has lower costs, faster transactions, and scalability. The presale for LILPEPE has already brought in more than $20.2 million, which shows significant interest in the token. Analysts believe that the LILPEPE has upside potential of more than 12,000 percent by the end of 2025, when PEPE also performed superlatively in 2023. Suppose LILPEPE will reach the price of $1.00 by 2025, and the investment of $1,000 may increase to $500,000. LILPEPE is in a great position to develop a lot because it combines meme culture, community support, and real usefulness. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin that people are betting on; it’s built to last, which makes it stand out in a crowded market. The Edge in Competition: Why LILPEPE Might Do Better Than PEPE PEPE was popular because of the hype, and the Pepe meme went viral. LILPEPE, on the other hand, has several advantages that make it a better long-term investment. LILPEPE’s blockchain utility is the most significant difference. LILPEPE can grow faster than other meme coins because it uses Ethereum’s Layer-2 technology. Ethereum’s Layer-2 solutions enable faster and cheaper transactions, a big plus in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Also, LILPEPE has already passed a Certik audit, which gives it more credibility and security than many other meme coins. Investors can be sure that LILPEPE has been thoroughly checked for security, which lowers the risk of problems like rug pulls. This gives LILPEPE an advantage over other meme coins with no factual technical basis and that only rely on hype. Since PEPE did so well in 2023, many investors are now looking for the next big meme coin to invest in. LILPEPE has the same appeal as memes but has the added benefits of being safe and sound on the blockchain. LILPEPE could make even more money if it follows the same path as PEPE. This is because it has a strong base and a growing community. The Future of LILPEPE: Predictions for Its Price and Growth Several things could affect LILPEPE’s chances of being as successful as or more successful than PEPE. As the meme coin market and DeFi grow, LILPEPE’s unique position as a meme coin with real value becomes even more valuable. LILPEPE is still in its early stages and priced at only $0.0020. This is a rare chance for early investors to buy in before the price increases. Analysts say that LILPEPE could go up to $1.00 by 2025, a 50,000% return on investment from its presale price. However, LILPEPE is also in a good position to grow as it becomes more popular in the crypto community. LILPEPE has a lot going for it: a unique value proposition, a low market cap, and a growing community of supporters. It could become the next big success story in the meme coin space. How to Buy LILPEPE Before Its Price Goes Up Here’s how to get in before the price goes up if you’re ready to take advantage of LILPEPE’s growth potential: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT) from a trusted exchange and move it to your wallet. Visit littlepepe.com to see the official LILPEPE presale page. Connect your wallet and buy LILPEPE tokens for $0.0020 each. Conclusion: LILPEPE Is The Next Big Meme Coin. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) could grow quickly, just like Pepe Coin (PEPE) did in 2023. LILPEPE has a strong chance of long-term success in crypto because it is a meme with real-world uses. LILPEPE is a great candidate for massive price increases because the meme coin market is constantly changing, and the coin is growing in size and security. If you missed PEPE’s impressive gains, now is your chance to get in early on LILPEPE. LILPEPE could be the next meme coin to turn a small investment into a lot of money, with estimates saying it will increase by 12,000% by 2025. Don’t miss out!

His latest outlook emphasizes both the macro trend and shorter-term price levels that he views as critical for XRP’s market trajectory. In the zoomed-in chart, he identifies $3.65 as a decisive breakout point. According to his analysis , a confirmed close above this level, in conjunction with surpassing the green arch boundary, would trigger a phase of price discovery. He describes this threshold as the point at which XRP could begin a significant upward movement. At present, he highlights $2.90 as the midpoint of the linear log channel, which he views as essential support. He stresses the importance of maintaining price action above this level to preserve the bullish setup. #XRP – Linear Regression Analysis (Log Scale) and The Bent Fork (Zoomed-In Version): Take a close look at the chart below! As I zoom in, remember to keep track of the MACRO view to fully understand the significance of this analysis. Zoomed-In Insights: 1⃣ Closing above… pic.twitter.com/ESyUS62yUt — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 20, 2025 Defense Levels and Risk Zones Egrag outlines several defensive levels that he considers crucial to sustaining XRP’s bullish momentum. The first line of defense is at $2.65, where he suggests that while price wicks may occur, a daily close below this level would be problematic for the overall trend. The last line of defense, in his view, lies at $2.33, which aligns with the 21 EMA on the two-week timeframe. He regards this as a make-or-break level for the prospect of reaching new all-time highs. He further identifies $1.90 as the bear market line of defense. In his assessment, a close below this point would push XRP into bear market territory . An even deeper threshold exists at $1.62, which he marks as confirmation of a bearish trend if the price closes below the middle arch structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Macro Outlook and Cycle Projections In addition to the zoomed-in analysis, Egrag emphasizes the importance of zooming out to view the broader market cycles. His macro chart highlights three key cycles: 2013, 2018, and a projected cycle peak in 2025. He notes that the current setup aligns with the same structural movements seen in previous cycles, suggesting that XRP could be on track for another major market move. The upper boundary of the linear log channel, marked in blue, coincides with the projected “white arch,” which he points to as a long-term target zone. This alignment, according to his analysis, reinforces the case for a strong upside potential if XRP sustains key support levels in the near term. Egrag Crypto’s latest analysis presents a structured view of XRP’s technical positioning within both short-term and long-term contexts. With $3.65 as a decisive breakout level, $2.90 as the midpoint support, and several lines of defense at $2.65, $2.33, and $1.90, his framework highlights the importance of maintaining higher support levels to avoid slipping into bearish territory.

The move is part of the rising trend of corporate altcoin treasuries, with mixed outcomes across different industries. Some firms like VivoPower saw stock surges after adding crypto, while others, including Safety Shot and Windtree Therapeutics, suffered steep declines after more risky altcoin bets. VERB Tech Commits to Toncoin VERB Technology Company announced that it accumulated roughly $713 million worth of Toncoin (TON) alongside $67 million in cash reserves, bringing its total assets to more than $780 million . The company revealed that most of this capital came from a $558 million private placement that was completed in August, which sent its share price surging by over 200%. A majority of the funds raised were allocated to purchasing TON, and VERB plans to capture 5% of the token’s circulating supply — around 128 million coins — through a combination of corporate debt, equity issuance, and staking activities. Announcement from VERB Technologies The strategy forms part of the growing trend of corporations adopting altcoin treasury policies, which sparked some debate among investors. Supporters see these moves as opportunities for companies to outperform traditional crypto holdings, while skeptics warn that high levels of debt-backed crypto exposure could trigger cascading liquidations if markets turn downward, amplifying risks for both equities and digital assets. August saw several other firms expand into altcoin treasuries with mixed market reactions. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Mining announced its first Solana acquisition , joining a wave of companies increasing their exposure to the network. Energy company VivoPower boosted its XRP holdings , which coincided with a 32% surge in its share price. Meanwhile, ALT5 Sigma Corporation raised $1.5 billion to back World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi governance token linked to members of US President Donald Trump’s family. Not all corporate treasury bets paid off. Safety Shot, a beverage company, faced a sharp backlash after revealing plans to add the BONK meme coin to its reserves, with shares collapsing more than 50%.

Recently, the crypto community observed two substantial movements that saw over $169.59 million in Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawn from Binance, hinting at crucial developments behind the scenes. These large-scale transactions often spark curiosity and speculation among investors, making it essential to understand their potential implications. What Exactly Are Crypto Whale Withdrawals? In the vast ocean of digital assets, “whales” are individuals or entities holding enormous amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements, especially large withdrawals from exchanges, are known as crypto whale withdrawals . These aren’t just minor transactions; they involve millions, sometimes billions, of dollars. When a whale moves such a substantial sum, it can signal various intentions, from securing assets in cold storage to preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or even anticipating future market shifts. Therefore, tracking these powerful players offers a glimpse into potential market trends. Just recently, the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reported intriguing activity on X. Two brand-new wallets initiated significant crypto whale withdrawals from Binance. One wallet transferred a staggering 11,950 ETH, valued at approximately $51.32 million, just moments ago. Shortly after, another fresh wallet withdrew 1,046 BTC, an impressive sum worth around $118.27 million. These back-to-back, large-scale movements underscore the considerable capital at play in the crypto ecosystem. Why Do These Crypto Whale Withdrawals Matter? The motivations behind such large crypto whale withdrawals are diverse and can significantly impact market sentiment. Here are some common reasons: Cold Storage Security: Whales often move assets to hardware wallets for enhanced security, reducing exposure to exchange-related risks. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of crypto are sometimes sold directly to institutional buyers or other whales without affecting exchange order books. Accumulation and Holding: Some whales withdraw assets to hold them long-term, signaling a belief in future price appreciation. Market Manipulation: While less common and and often illegal, large movements can sometimes precede attempts to influence market prices. Preparing for Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Assets might be moved to participate in staking, lending, or other DeFi protocols. Understanding these potential reasons helps in interpreting the broader market implications. What Could Be the Impact of These Whale Movements? The immediate impact of crypto whale withdrawals can vary. When whales move assets off exchanges, it often reduces the available supply on trading platforms. This reduction can, in theory, create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Conversely, if these withdrawals are precursors to OTC sales, the market might not see an immediate price dip, but the underlying supply pressure could still be significant. Investors frequently monitor these moves as a leading indicator of potential market direction. Staying Ahead: Actionable Insights for Investors For everyday investors, tracking crypto whale withdrawals can provide valuable insights. While it is not a definitive predictor, it offers a piece of the puzzle. Monitor On-Chain Data: Platforms like Lookonchain provide real-time updates on large transactions. Look for Patterns: Are withdrawals happening consistently across multiple assets or exchanges? Consider Market Context: Evaluate whale moves alongside broader market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis. Avoid Panic: Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. Always conduct your own research. These actions empower you to make more informed decisions rather than reacting purely to market noise. The recent crypto whale withdrawals of $169.59 million in ETH and BTC from Binance serve as a powerful reminder of the influential role large holders play in the digital asset landscape. These significant movements are more than just numbers; they are potential signals of strategic positioning, market sentiment, and future trends. By closely observing these patterns and understanding their underlying implications, investors can better navigate the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. The actions of these powerful whales continue to shape the narrative, and staying informed is key to success. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Whale Withdrawals Q1: What is a crypto whale? A1: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Q2: Why are crypto whale withdrawals significant? A2: They are significant because large withdrawals from exchanges can reduce the available supply, potentially leading to price increases, or they might signal a whale’s intention to hold long-term, engage in OTC deals, or use assets in DeFi protocols. Q3: How can I track crypto whale activity? A3: You can track crypto whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or Etherscan, which monitor and report large transactions on various blockchain networks. Q4: Do crypto whale withdrawals always lead to price increases? A4: Not necessarily. While withdrawals can reduce exchange supply, the ultimate impact depends on the whale’s intentions (e.g., cold storage vs. OTC sale) and overall market demand. It’s one of many factors influencing price. Q5: What is the difference between a withdrawal and a deposit by a whale? A5: A withdrawal means a whale is moving crypto off an exchange, often for holding or private deals. A deposit means they are moving crypto onto an exchange, typically to sell or trade, which can increase selling pressure. Did you find these insights into crypto whale withdrawals helpful?

Popular tokens that once led the charge in speculative rallies are now struggling to recapture past momentum. Yet, in the midst of the carnage, one project shines with promise—LayerBrett (LBRETT). More than just another meme token, LayerBrett combines internet culture appeal with serious blockchain utility, positioning itself as the best meme coin to buy now. For traders seeking growth and potential rewards, it might represent a once-in-a-cycle opportunity. LayerBrett soars as other memes tank LayerBrett is not your average run-of-the-mill meme token. Apart from imbibing meme culture, it also doubles up as a layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum. This gives LBRETT a unique mix of practical blockchain utility and community-driven energy. This strong foundation has sparked significant interest, and that’s why its presale is roaring on. Launched only recently, the LBRETT presale has raised more than half a million dollars, with hundreds of thousands of tokens sold. Investors are not just drawn to its meme appeal but they are also drawn to the genuine growth potential surrounding its ecosystem. But that’s not all. LBRETT also offers an eye-watering 25,000% staking yield. This reward system greatly incentivizes early holders with streams of passive income, effectively rewarding first movers. Traders are piling in, positioning themselves before demand overwhelms supply. Beyond yield, analysts predict LBRETT could be the next 100x meme token. This proclamation is fueled by growing hype, blockchain integration, and a strong presale momentum. While the broader meme market struggles, LBRETT continues to soar, reminding investors that innovation fused with fun drives real value in crypto. PENGU takes flight with meme lovers PENGU is one of the more lovable faces in the meme coin landscape. Inspired by the internet’s fascination with cute penguins, it has quickly caught on, creating a tight-knit community around itself. Due to this playful narrative, PENGU is appealing to investors that thrive in meme-drive hype cycles. As a result, PENGU is starting to make a name for itself in the meme scene. Instead of chaotic marketing gimmicks, PENGU emphasizes inclusivity and consistent engagement, which gives it staying power in the highly competitive meme market. Unfortunately, PENGU remains a speculative investment option. Like most meme tokens, PENGU is affected by market conditions, and the current bears have sent PENGU prospects on a downward spiral. Floki Inu struggles to keep investors interested Floki Inu rode to stardom on the wings of being affiliated with Elon Musk. Inspired by Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, FLOKI leans heavily on Norse mythology for branding. This quickly garnered attention, which is why FLOKI enjoyed several highs in years past. However, Floki’s performance in recent months suggests that the excitement around it is fading. The FLOKI price has all but stagnated, weighed down by market saturation and a lack of real utility. With limited upside and waning hype, many traders now believe Floki Inu has lost its edge. The days of enormous gains are seemingly over, which is why some of them are jumping ship for better alternatives. BONK battles to stay relevant in meme wars BONK entered the market with playful branding and a mission to tap into Solana’s thriving ecosystem. Its narrative focused on being the Solana-native meme token, separating it from ETH-based competitors and earning BONK sizable community excitement. What’s peculiar about BONK is its aggressive distribution strategy, which initially gave tokens away, ensuring fast adoption. It helped BONK become a household name among meme enthusiasts, though the effect has waned in recent times. As for the future, a price rebound is possible given renewed activity on Solana. If ecosystem growth continues, BONK could benefit as the go-to Solana meme, though its long-term trajectory remains uncertain compared with newer entrants like LBRETT. Can PEPE maintain its cult status? PEPE stands apart for being one of the most recognized meme tokens in the world. It draws from the internet’s long-running love affair with Pepe the Frog memes. That’s why its cultural resonance is unrivaled, giving PEPE immediate recognition among crypto investors. From a price standpoint, PEPE has swung through intense volatility but remains higher on trader watchlists than most competitors. With meme-driven hype cycles expected to return, PEPE’s legacy and liquidity could position it as a decent investment option. Though maybe not the explosive rocket it once was, Pepe Coin still offers speculative opportunities to traders banking on meme revival. Conclusion Few tokens bring both utility and hype together quite like LayerBrett. While giants like PEPE, FLOKI and BONK rely on recognition, and smaller projects like PENGU ride on novelty, LBRETT has substance embedded into its DNA as a Layer 2 solution. As a result, it is immune to FUD, and this paves the way to a rocketing rally. Pepe is still available in presale for just $0.0044. Riding on a 100x potential, it is set to usher in life-changing profits for those who take a stab at it. That’s why it is the best meme coin to buy today.

50478150,https://invezz.com/?p=2846886,1755841015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,‘Serious concerns’: Why Australia’s financial watchdog is investigating Binance,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/22/serious-concerns-why-australias-financial-watchdog-is-investigating-binance/,"The long shadow of Binance’s past has reached the shores of Australia, as the nation’s financial crimes agency brought down the hammer on Friday, ordering the crypto giant’s local arm to submit to an external audit. Citing “serious concerns” with the exchange’s defenses against money laundering and terrorism financing, the move signals a new chapter in the global regulatory reckoning for the world’s largest digital asset platform. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, known as Austrac, declared that its alarm bells were triggered by a cascade of troubling issues. The agency was particularly unimpressed with Binance Australia’s latest independent review, which it scathingly described as “limited in scope relative to its size, business offerings and risks.” The clock is now ticking, with Austrac giving the company just 28 days to put forward a list of potential auditors, from which the agency itself will make the final selection. A pattern of lapses: from global failures to local flaws This is not a sudden development, but the culmination of mounting worries. Austrac detailed a litany of internal failures at the local unit, raising red flags about high staff turnover, a lack of local resourcing, and a concerning absence of senior management oversight. The findings paint a picture of a global behemoth potentially failing to meet its fundamental obligations on Australian soil. Brendan Thomas, the chief executive officer of Austrac, delivered a pointed and public warning, aimed not just at Binance but at all global players operating in the country. “Big global operators may appear well resourced and positioned to meet complex regulatory requirements,” he said in a statement. “But if they don’t understand local money laundering and terrorism financing risks, they are failing to meet” their obligations. Echoes of a $4.3 billion fine This regulatory crackdown does not exist in a vacuum. It comes less than a year after Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to sweeping anti-money laundering and sanctions violations in the United States, a landmark case that resulted in a staggering $4.3 billion settlement. The parallels are impossible to ignore, suggesting a potential pattern of compliance issues that stretches across jurisdictions. Thomas hammered this point home, emphasizing the critical importance of localized expertise. “Understanding specific risks of criminality in the Australian context is crucial to ensure they’re meeting their reporting obligations here,” he said. The audit order is the latest salvo in Austrac’s broader war on the illicit activities that have plagued the crypto world. In June, the agency imposed a A$5,000 limit on cash transactions at crypto ATMs, warning that the machines had become magnets for fraudsters and scammers. For Binance, which as of Friday had not responded to a request for comment, this forced audit represents a serious and unwelcome escalation in a market it cannot afford to lose.

Meanwhile, Japanese shares had a mixed day. This came after new data showed consumer inflation in Japan remained well above the Bank of Japan's annual target. On the global front, all eyes are now on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium later today for further clues on the US policy outlook. Silver held firm above $38 per ounce on Friday after two consecutive sessions of gains. Gold extended its recent losses to around $3,330 per ounce on Friday. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.10% to below 42,600 on Friday while the Topix added 0.4% to 3,095, with Japanese equities lacking clear direction. The Japanese yen weakened to around 145.5 per dollar on Friday, its lowest level in three weeks, as traders digested the latest inflation data. Japan's core consumer price index rose by 3.1% in July , a slight decrease from June's 3.3% but still higher than the expected 3%. Food prices in Japan rose 7.6% year-on-year in July 2025, accelerating from 7.2% in June and marking the fastest pace since February. Separately, Japan’s Ministry of Finance is preparing to raise its assumed interest rate for long-term government bonds to 2.6% in its fiscal 2026/27 budget requests, marking the highest level in 17 years, Reuters reported, citing the Yomiuri Shimbun on Friday. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.66% to above 3,780 on Friday, while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.6% to 11,990, with the former touching a fresh decade high as strong fund rotations and retail buying extended the market rally. Sentiment also improved on hopes of fresh stimulus from Beijing after China’s economy slowed in July. Starting in September, the Chinese government will launch a one-year consumer loan subsidy, covering 90% of interest costs, with local authorities funding the rest. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.25% to 25,191 in early trade on Friday, supported by gains across most sectors. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.61% to 81,630 in morning trade on Friday, as traders remained cautious ahead of US Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. The BSE Sensex halted a six-day winning streak that had been supported by optimism over Goods and Services Tax reforms. The Indian rupee held its recent decline to around 87.26 per USD on Friday. India's exports to China surged 20.0% year-on-year to USD 5.8 billion in the first four months of FY 2025-26 (April-July), rebounding sharply from a 4.5% decline during the same period in FY 2024-25. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.37% to slip back below the key 9,000 mark, a record high crossed for the first time in the previous session. The Australian dollar was little changed to around $0.642 on Friday, pausing its four-session losing streak, but on track for a 1.3% drop for the week, its second weekly decline. Australia's private sector activity expanded at the fastest pace since April 2022, with the composite PMI rising to 54.9 in August (vs 53.8 in July), driven by robust growth in both manufacturing (52.9 vs. 51.3) and services (55.1 vs. 54.1) sectors. In the U.S. on Thursday, all three major indexes ended lower , the S&P 500 closed 0.4% lower on Thursday, marking its fifth consecutive decline as investors looked ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. U.S. stock futures ticked up Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole for signals on the path of interest rates: Dow +0.02% ; S&P 500 +0.01% ; Nasdaq -0.08% .

The digital asset market is a dynamic place, and right now, two of its giants – Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) – appear to be charting different courses. Recent insights from CryptoQuant analyst XWIN Research Japan highlight a potential short-term correction for BTC, while Ethereum seems poised for an exciting uptrend. What does this mean for your portfolio? Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Short-Term Correction? The crypto world is buzzing with talk about Bitcoin’s immediate future. According to XWIN Research Japan’s insightful Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis on CryptoQuant, BTC might be heading for a short-term correction. Despite the recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have remained remarkably stable, hovering around 2.53 million BTC. Typically, when investors move their BTC off exchanges, it reduces the available supply for selling, easing downward pressure. However, the current stability in reserves suggests a significant portion of Bitcoin supply remains liquid. This liquidity could potentially be a source for selling, especially as BTC recently slipped from $123,000 to $113,000. This price action, combined with stable reserves, raises concerns among market watchers. Ethereum’s Ascending Path: What’s Driving the Bullish Momentum? In stark contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is flashing strong signals of an impending uptrend. Our Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis reveals a compelling narrative for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Data indicates a steady increase in the volume of ETH leaving exchanges. This trend became particularly pronounced in late July and mid-August, with outflows exceeding 300,000 ETH on multiple occasions. When Ethereum leaves exchanges, it reduces the circulating supply, creating a ‘supply shock’ scenario. This reinforces a bullish outlook, as less ETH available for sale often translates to higher prices if demand remains strong or increases. It’s a key factor driving optimism around ETH’s price action. Navigating Divergent Paths: What Should Investors Consider? Understanding these diverging trends is crucial for any crypto investor. This Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis highlights that while Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory might present challenges, Ethereum’s outlook appears increasingly positive. Investors should carefully monitor exchange reserve data for both assets. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin: Watch for further movements in exchange reserves. A sustained decrease could signal reduced selling pressure, while continued stability might keep correction risks elevated. Ethereum: The ongoing exchange outflows are a strong bullish indicator. Continued demand coupled with shrinking supply could fuel significant price appreciation. Diversification: Consider how these individual asset movements impact your overall portfolio strategy. Do these trends suggest rebalancing or a shift in focus? The crypto market continues its fascinating evolution, presenting both hurdles and opportunities. While Bitcoin faces potential headwinds from liquid supply, Ethereum is building a compelling case for an upward surge driven by strong demand and diminishing exchange supply. Staying informed with detailed Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis is paramount for making sound investment decisions in this ever-changing landscape. The coming weeks will be critical in confirming these emerging trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “short-term correction” for Bitcoin? A short-term correction refers to a temporary decline in an asset’s price after a period of upward movement. It’s often a healthy market adjustment, allowing prices to consolidate before potentially resuming an uptrend. Q2: Why are Bitcoin exchange reserves important? Bitcoin exchange reserves indicate the amount of BTC held on centralized exchanges. High reserves can suggest potential selling pressure, as more coins are readily available for trading. Conversely, decreasing reserves often signal investors are moving BTC to cold storage, reducing immediate selling supply. Q3: What does increasing ETH outflow signify? Increasing Ethereum outflows from exchanges suggest that investors are moving their ETH into personal wallets, likely for long-term holding, staking, or use in decentralized finance (DeFi). This reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges, which can create a supply shock and potentially drive prices higher if demand remains strong. Q4: Should I sell my BTC based on this analysis? This analysis provides insights into potential market trends. It is not financial advice. Investment decisions should always be based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and thorough research. Consider consulting a financial advisor. Q5: How can I stay informed about these trends? To stay updated, regularly follow reputable crypto news sources, market analysis platforms like CryptoQuant, and consider subscribing to newsletters from expert analysts.

Powered by Stripe’s Bridge and M0 protocol, the launch is expected in late 2025. Real-world spending via MetaMask Card will make crypto usable almost everywhere. MetaMask Unveils mUSD Stablecoin MetaMask, the leading Web3 wallet, has announced the launch of its own stablecoin, MetaMask USD (mUSD) , marking a major step toward mainstream crypto adoption. The stablecoin will be deeply integrated into the MetaMask ecosystem, designed to simplify on-chain transactions and bring crypto spending closer to everyday life. Issued by Stripe-Owned Bridge, Powered by M0 According to the announcement, mUSD will be issued by Bridge , a stablecoin platform owned by Stripe. Technical support will be provided by M0 , a decentralized protocol focused on liquidity and interoperability of digital dollars. This collaboration ensures both stability and cross-network compatibility—two key requirements for practical crypto payments. Two Main Use Cases for mUSD MetaMask revealed that users will initially get two primary ways to use the stablecoin: In the Wallet (at launch) : Users can fund wallets, make swaps, and transfer assets across Ethereum and Linea networks. In Real Life (expected in 2025) : Payments through MetaMask Card , allowing users to spend mUSD almost anywhere cards are accepted. This dual approach is designed to blend the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) with real-world usability. Launch Timeline and Network Availability The official launch of mUSD is scheduled for the second half of 2025 , starting on the Ethereum and Linea networks. These are two of the most widely used chains in the Web3 space, ensuring immediate utility for millions of existing MetaMask users. Why This Matters: Stripe’s Growing Crypto Role Stripe’s involvement in this project isn’t a coincidence. The payment giant re-entered the crypto scene in 2023, rolling out support for stablecoin payments like USDC. By powering MetaMask’s mUSD issuance through Bridge, Stripe signals its commitment to bridging traditional finance and Web3. This also follows the broader trend of stablecoin adoption, as major players like PayPal introduced its own stablecoin (PYUSD) in 2023 to facilitate global payments. MetaMask’s move adds a powerful wallet-driven option to this rapidly growing ecosystem. Gal Eldar, Product Manager at MetaMask, stated: “MetaMask USD is a critical step in the mass adoption of Web3. It removes barriers, reduces costs, and allows users to deposit funds into a self-custody wallet, spend them almost anywhere, and use them the way money was meant to be used.” Why It Could Be a Game-Changer If successful, mUSD could become a cornerstone for decentralized commerce , giving millions of MetaMask users the ability to move seamlessly between DeFi , NFTs , and real-world payments . It may also accelerate regulatory discussions , as governments watch the growing role of wallet-issued digital dollars in global finance. This could further reshape the payment landscape , offering businesses an alternative to traditional banking systems and driving financial inclusion for unbanked populations. With Stripe backing the issuance and MetaMask ensuring seamless wallet integration, mUSD has the potential to make Web3 truly usable in everyday life. The second half of 2025 could mark a turning point for crypto adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|BUSINESS|PYUSD,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 05:44:50

Its supply has surged by over 160% year-to-date. The synthetic BTC landscape has significantly shifted since Coinbase first launched cbBTC in September 2024, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. At the time of publication, the digital asset’s supply has increased from 1,000 worth of synthetic Bitcoins to over 30,500 cbBTC. Coinbase delists wBTC cbBTC is onchain. cbBTC is an ERC20 token that is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin (BTC) held by Coinbase. This means millions of BTC holders can now securely access DeFi apps on @base and Ethereum ecosystems—with more chains coming soon. Here’s what you need to know ↓ pic.twitter.com/nF8mF3JGms — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) September 12, 2024 Despite cbBTC’s growth, the largest synthetic BTC token on Ethereum, wBTC, has seen a 17% drop in its supply since the launch of cbBTC. At the time of writing, wBTC has also declined by 4% year-to-date. On-chain data also shows that the total supply of synthetic BTC on Ethereum has only increased by roughly 3% since cbBTC launched in mid-September 2024. The difference in growth of other synthetic BTCs compared to cbBTC’s growth over the past year suggests that there’s been a market share shift inside the total synthetic-BTC space. The shift from the synthetic BTC product on Ethereum notably began in August 2024 after issuer BitGo announced a Justin Sun-related affiliate would be taking a greater role in managing wBTC. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe acknowledged Sun’s involvement in the joint venture, stressing the company’s continued commitment to security. Sun maintained that his involvement in wBTC is entirely strategic. He also acknowledged that he does not control the private keys to the wBTC reserves and cannot move any BTC reserves. Coinbase later delisted the synthetic BTC product on Ethereum on December 19, 2024. The crypto exchange argued that it regularly monitors the assets on its platform to ensure they meet its listing standards. Coinbase revealed that it moved its wBTC order books to limit-only mode, meaning that users could place and cancel limit orders of the token on the platform. It also allowed users to move their wBTC tokens off the exchange even after its delisting. The delisting of wBTC resulted in a legal challenge from BiT Global, a firm backed by Sun. The company later dropped the lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice, meaning it can’t be brought again. Since its inception, the substitution and migrational flows from wBTC to cbBTC have driven a large portion of the token’s growth on Ethereum. cbBTC’s growth can also be attributed to Coinbase’s ability to funnel BTC holders directly into cbBTC through its existing custody, prime brokerage, and exchange rails. The initiative has reduced the hops and operational friction compared to third-party exchanges, making cbBTC easily accessible to institutions and treasuries that already clear through Coinbase. cbBTC’s growth can also be linked to its integration into Persistence DEX V2 on June 25. The initiative enables cross-chain swaps between Base and BNB Chain via an unaudited mainnet in closed beta. Cross-chain swaps of cbBTC require users to have a minimum of $10 in cbBTC and roughly $0.005 ETH for gas fees to participate. The initiative for Coinbase’s Wrapped Bitcoin expands its use case beyond the exchange’s ecosystem into decentralized cross-chain liquidity. cbBTC’s unaudited status and gated access also limit its immediate adoption, but increased demand could follow if Persistence scales its BTCFi sector. cbBTC-backed loans surpass $1B in collateral Coinbase also revealed on July 15 that its cbBTC-backed loans surpassed $1 billion in collateral, facilitated by Morpho Labs on Base. The token has become the exchange’s collateral option due to its role in Coinbase’s on-chain ecosystem. The increase in cbBTC collateral suggests a surge in its utility, signaling institutional and retail demand for holding Coinbase’s wrapped BTC variant. The token’s reliance on centralized custody, through Coinbase, limits its growth among decentralized exchanges. Coinbase also plans to introduce proof of reserves for cbBTC’s BTC collateral. The platform announced the initiative during the token’s initial launch, which would verify the 1:1 backing of cbBTC with Bitcoin held in the exchange’s custody. Coinbase also plans to expand cbBTC’s cross-chain Bitcoin utility beyond Ethereum and Base to chains like Solana to leverage its high-speed infrastructure for low-cost swaps and lending use cases.

His commentary centers on the market risks for XRP holders , particularly about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Hilton said while there are always concerns about potential downturns in digital assets, the current state of the market suggests that XRP is not facing a severe downside scenario in the near term. Bitcoin’s Role in XRP Market Movements Hilton emphasized that Bitcoin holds the dominant position in the cryptocurrency market, representing nearly 60% of total market capitalization. He stated that where Bitcoin goes, the broader market, including XRP, tends to follow. In his analysis, the consensus across research and market evaluations indicates that Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $100,000 through the end of 2025. With Bitcoin currently trading around $115,000, this provides a level of stability that reduces the probability of XRP seeing a dramatic decline. Hilton acknowledged that XRP maintains its market drivers, such as partnerships, acquisitions , and potential regulatory or institutional developments. However, he insisted that its performance remains strongly correlated to Bitcoin’s broader market direction. If Bitcoin were to fall significantly, for example, to $80,000, Hilton argued that XRP would inevitably be impacted. Conversely, with projections that Bitcoin potentially reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 by the end of 2025, he views this as a supportive environment for XRP growth. XRP Holders! It's not going to happen! pic.twitter.com/gTvH7yMi19 — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) August 19, 2025 Assessing Risk and Price Projections Hilton explained that one of the main concerns for any crypto holder is the worst-case scenario for asset pricing. Addressing this directly, he said the current market outlook shows limited downside risk for XRP. Even in a situation where Bitcoin retraces to $100,000, Hilton suggested that XRP would not collapse into ranges as low as $0.50. Instead, he estimated that downside risks would likely be contained above $2, barring extreme global circumstances. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Looking ahead, Hilton described a more optimistic scenario in which XRP could rise significantly if Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. In his view, XRP could move into ranges between $4 and $10 or higher by the end of 2025, especially if additional catalysts such as exchange-traded funds or large-scale partnerships materialize. Market Perspective Hilton evaluates the importance of assessing XRP not in isolation but within the broader dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. He encouraged holders to consider Bitcoin’s role as the market leader and highlighted how its movements influence other major assets, including Ethereum and Cardano. By recognizing this connection, Hilton argued that XRP investors can have a clearer understanding of both the risks and opportunities in the coming months. He concluded his video by reinforcing his main message: XRP holders are unlikely to see a severe price collapse under the current market conditions. According to Hilton, the data suggest that both Bitcoin and XRP are positioned for long-term growth, with only limited downside risk in the short to medium term.

50477918,562721,1755842404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50477918.jpeg,"Chainlink’s Unprecedented Feat: ISO 27001, SOC 2 Compliance Achieved",https://bitcoinist.com/chainlinks-unprecedented-feat-iso-27001-soc-2/,"Decentralized oracle provider, Chainlink (LINK), has made significant progress in terms of regulation by becoming the first oracle platform to achieve both ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliance, enhancing the protocol’s security standards. How Chainlink’s Certifications Enhance Its Oracle Services The announcement detailed that the compliance assessments encompass Chainlink Data Feeds—particularly focused on Price Feeds and SmartData, including Proof of Reserve and Net Asset Value (NAV)—as well as the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). By achieving these certifications, Chainlink sets a new benchmark for data and interoperability oracle platforms within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Chainlink’s dominance in the oracle market is evident; it currently holds approximately 68% of the total value secured (TVS) in DeFi, which translates to over $90 billion in secured assets. However, given the recent achievement of compliance standards, it is expected further adoption and usage of the protocol, as well as demand for LINK tokens, not only from retail, but also from institutional investors. Chainlink’s interoperability standard is also gaining traction among financial institutions and asset issuers, such as Swift and UBS, marking a significant step towards bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology . The ISO 27001 certification confirms that Chainlink has established a comprehensive Information Security Management System (ISMS) that governs the infrastructure, development, operations, and security of its services. Meanwhile, the SOC 2 Type 1 attestation validates that Chainlink has implemented a robust set of security and operational controls, ensuring reliable and compliant oracle services designed to safeguard both the organization and its clients. Leveraging US Crypto Regulations The timing of these certifications is ideal for the protocol, as the regulatory landscape in the US is seeing a major shift under President Donald Trump’s administration and its pro-crypto vision . With the recent passage of key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, experts assert that Chainlink is well-positioned to capitalize on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the adoption of blockchain technology by institutions. Market analysis firm Birb Nest underscores that no other project provides such a comprehensive suite of services in the crypto market, positioning Chainlink as the essential link between traditional finance and blockchain economies. Major financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Fidelity, have publicly acknowledged their collaboration with Chainlink technology, signaling widespread adoption. The firm notes that as institutions increasingly adopt blockchain technology, the demand for secure data, interoperability , compliance, privacy, and integration with legacy systems will only grow. Interestingly, Chainlink is set to stand out as the only unified and modular platform capable of delivering these needs at scale. As a result of the excitement surrounding the protocol’s potential, LINK has been the top performer of the market with a nearly 9% surge on the weekly time frame. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) on the other hand, record losses of 8% and 5% during the same period. When writing, the token trades at $25, 52% below its all-time high of $52.

Speed, Mobile Mining, & 300+ dApps Pre-Launch",https://thecoinrise.com/what-sets-blockdag-apart-from-kaspa-speed-mobile-mining-300-dapps-pre-launch/,"When Kaspa entered the scene with its rapid blockDAG system, it reshaped the possibilities of proof-of-work chains. Now, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention as the logical evolution, a scalable, hybrid Layer 1 chain that brings together performance, protection, and adoption strategies few projects can match. Having raised over $378 million during its presale, with more than 2.5 million mobile miners and 4,500+ developers working on 300+ dApps, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most talked-about names in crypto. But beyond the buzz, what is BlockDAG really about, and why do analysts believe it builds on Kaspa’s foundation? Combining DAG Structure with Proof-of-Work Strength BlockDAG’s design is built around a directed acyclic graph (DAG) combined with a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus system. DAG allows for many blocks to be processed at once, eliminating the slowdowns caused by the linear nature of traditional chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum. PoW, meanwhile, provides the security that early blockchain systems became known for. The result is a network that can handle up to 10 blocks every second, a pace that rivals post-launch projects such as Solana and Avalanche. But unlike Solana, BlockDAG doesn’t trade decentralization for speed. Its structure is intended to encourage broad participation without leaning on validator centralization. While Kaspa was the first to bring blockDAG consensus to life, BlockDAG enhances it with easier mining access and tools that appeal to developers, giving it wider appeal across different groups. Building a Large Community Before Mainnet A key part of BlockDAG’s strategy is building a large user base even before the mainnet goes live. The X1 mobile miner app, with more than 2.5 million users, allows anyone to mine BDAG coins right from their phone, with little technical effort required. This move has created one of the largest networks of users before a chain’s full launch. BlockDAG has also sold 19,350 ASIC miners, adding serious hash power from institutional-grade setups. This mix of individual and industrial participation means BlockDAG is launching with a built-in ecosystem. Unlike Kaspa, which had to gradually attract its mining community, BlockDAG starts with both community and infrastructure in place. Developer Activity & Expanding the Ecosystem The success of any blockchain hinges on its ecosystem, and BlockDAG is already making progress here. Over 4,500 developers are currently building more than 300 decentralized apps (dApps), covering categories from DeFi to games. This level of developer involvement before launch is rare, and it shows how much value BlockDAG’s EVM compatibility brings. Developers can move Ethereum apps over with little need for code changes, making the switch smoother. Kaspa impressed with its architecture, but BlockDAG appears to be addressing a more complete equation: high speed, strong security, user access, and ecosystem adoption. By bringing together everyday users, technical developers, and industrial-scale hardware all before launch, BlockDAG is creating the foundation for long-term activity. Its presale, already past $378M, reflects this momentum. With Batch 29 coins priced at $0.0276 and a confirmed listing price of $0.05, early participants are looking at a possible 3025% return. This rapid presale growth shows more than just retail enthusiasm. Larger buyers have also started getting involved in recent stages, suggesting a shift toward institutional backing. Unlike Layer 1 chains that focus heavily on media attention, BDAG has moved quietly, focusing on network building and long-term infrastructure. This approach sets it apart from hype-driven projects. With careful execution and growing participation, BDAG is heading into its listing phase with strong preparation. Why BlockDAG Draws Comparisons to Kaspa The question many are asking is whether BlockDAG can follow Kaspa’s path. Analysts believe that if the ecosystem grows as expected, BDAG could reach $1 within 12–18 months after listing. From the Batch 29 price of $0.0276, that would be a nearly 36x gain. Some longer-term forecasts go even higher, to between $5 and $10, depending on how adoption scales, much like what Solana and Avalanche achieved. Of course, this growth depends on consistent developer activity, reliable exchange listings, and system stability. Still, with hundreds of dApps underway, millions of users on board, and real hardware supporting the network, BDAG has already built more than many L1s had at launch. Kaspa made history by showing how blockDAG consensus could deliver speed and efficiency. BlockDAG builds on that idea with added infrastructure, a strong community, and compatibility with Ethereum-based applications. If Kaspa proved what was possible, BlockDAG looks like the version made for broader adoption. Its progress toward a $600M presale goal is a sign that the market sees its long-term value. Closing Thoughts BlockDAG isn’t just running another presale for attention. It’s taking Kaspa’s key breakthrough and stretching it into a larger, more complete strategy. With its combination of DAG and PoW, its large user base before launch, strong developer involvement, and a fast-moving presale, BlockDAG could become one of the most important Layer 1 projects in recent memory. Whether it hits the $1 mark after launch or climbs even higher over time, the foundation already laid is impressive. At a time when many projects chase headlines, BlockDAG is focusing on real results, and that’s why many are calling it the best crypto to buy before it reaches exchanges.

Ethereum Perpetual Futures Volume Dominance Has Hit 67% According to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Ethereum perpetual futures volume has shot up recently. Below is the chart cited by Glassnode, showing the trend in the perpetual futures volume dominance breakdown between Ethereum and Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, Ethereum overtook Bitcoin in perpetual futures volume a while ago, indicating that speculators shifted their attention from BTC to ETH. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Volume Signal Nailed The Top & Bottom: Analytics Firm The two have only continued to diverge since then, meaning that trader interest in the coin ranked number two by market cap is only going up. Following the latest continuation to the increase, the ETH perpetual futures volume dominance has reached the 67% mark, which is a new all-time high (ATH). The analytics firm explains, Over the years, Ethereum has generally been considered a bellweather asset, with periods of its out-performance usually correlated with broader a “altseason” phase in the digital asset market. As such, this pronounced rotation in trading activity can be a sign of growing focus on the altcoin sector among the investors. Glassnode also notes the trend could point to “an acceleration of risk appetite within this market cycle.” Ethereum’s dominance has also grown in terms of another perpetual futures market indicator: the Open Interest. This metric measures the total amount of contracts related to a given asset that are open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. Here is a chart that shows how ETH’s dominance of this metric has changed relative to BTC over the past few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum perpetual futures Open Interest dominance has climbed to 43.3% recently. Bitcoin remains dominant with the metric sitting at 56.7%, but compared to earlier in the year, the difference is a lot closer. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear Is Back: Traders Flip As Price Plunges To $113,000 In terms of the futures sector as a whole, the combined Open Interest across major altcoins (Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin) set a new ATH of $60.2 billion recently. Though, this high couldn’t last, as the indicator suffered a sharp $2.6 billion drawdown soon after. This drop in the Open Interest of the major altcoins is the tenth largest on record. The report notes, These rapid fluctuations underscore that altcoins are currently drawing a significant amount of investor attention, and have meaningfully contributed to heightened reflexivity and fragility across digital asset markets. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $4,200, down almost 7% in the last seven days.

The analysis shows that when China's money supply (M2) outpaces that of the US, Bitcoin typically trends upward. The report argues that Bitcoin prices have seen a strong increase in the past few weeks, particularly following liquidity injections from the People's Bank of China (PBoC). Furthermore, the decline in US M2 money supply dominance is also considered a positive signal for BTC. According to available data: China's M2 Money Supply: 329.94 trillion yuan. This represents a 0.10% decrease compared to last month and an 8.78% increase compared to last year. US M2 Money Supply: $22.02 trillion. This represents a 0.63% increase compared to last month and a 4.53% increase compared to last year. Related News: Nasdaq Listed Company Announces $700 Million Purchase of Surprise Altcoin - But Price Remains Flat However, according to the analytics firm, the overall crypto market sentiment is currently shifting into the 'Bearish' territory. M2 Money Supply is a measure of the money supply that includes, in addition to M1 money supply, financial assets primarily held by households, such as savings deposits, time deposits, and balances in retail money market mutual funds. M1 includes more liquid financial assets such as cash, traveler's checks, demand deposits, and other withdrawable deposits. *This is not investment advice.

This pivotal shift, as reported by U.Today citing a Financial Times report, indicates a move away from earlier considerations of private blockchains. The decision underscores the EU’s urgency to accelerate its digital currency efforts, driven by concerns about lagging behind the U.S. in the rapidly evolving stablecoin market. Why Public Blockchains for the Digital Euro Project? The EU’s potential pivot towards public blockchain networks for its digital euro project signals a strategic re-evaluation. While central banks often prefer private ledgers for control, public chains offer distinct advantages: Enhanced Transparency: Public blockchains allow verifiable transactions, fostering trust and accountability. Innovation Ecosystem: Leveraging platforms like Ethereum or Solana taps into vast developer communities, potentially accelerating the digital euro project’s development and adoption. Resilience: Building on a public network can offer decentralized aspects, making the system more robust and less prone to single points of failure. This strategic choice reflects a proactive stance by EU officials. They aim to prevent the EU from falling behind in digital currency innovation, especially given global stablecoin advancements. Ethereum or Solana: Which Platform Will Power the Digital Euro Project? The choice between Ethereum and Solana presents a critical decision for the digital euro project , with each offering unique strengths: Ethereum’s Strengths: As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum boasts a massive developer community, robust security, and a proven track record. Its mature ecosystem and extensive tooling provide a reliable environment for complex applications. Solana’s Advantages: Solana is known for its high speed and low transaction costs. Its impressive throughput capabilities are crucial for a national digital currency expected to handle millions of daily transactions. Solana’s scalability could efficiently address high user volumes for the digital euro project . The EU’s technical assessment will carefully weigh these factors. The chosen platform must balance security, scalability, cost-efficiency, and a strong community to support the long-term vision of the digital euro project . What Are the Hurdles Facing the Digital Euro Project? While a public blockchain-powered digital euro project is exciting, several significant challenges require robust solutions: Regulatory Frameworks: Integrating a digital currency into existing finance demands extensive regulatory adjustments and clear legal guidance for public ledgers. Scalability: Even advanced public chains face pressure handling national-scale payment systems. Ensuring peak demand without compromising speed or cost is vital. Privacy Concerns: Balancing user privacy with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance is delicate, given the transparency of public blockchains. Interoperability: The digital euro must seamlessly integrate with current banking infrastructure and other digital payment systems. Addressing these challenges effectively is paramount for the successful implementation and widespread adoption of the digital euro. The EU’s exploration of these options shows a serious commitment to overcoming potential hurdles. The EU’s contemplation of Ethereum and Solana for its digital euro project is more than a technical decision; it’s a profound statement about the future of finance. This move signals a growing recognition of blockchain technology’s transformative potential. Should the EU proceed with a public blockchain, it could set a significant precedent for central banks globally, influencing the trajectory of central bank digital currencies and the broader crypto landscape. The journey ahead for the digital euro project promises to be immensely fascinating, shaping how we transact and interact with money in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions about the Digital Euro Project Q: What is the digital euro project? A: It’s an EU initiative to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the eurozone. This digital euro, issued by the ECB, would complement physical cash and bank deposits. Q: Why consider Ethereum and Solana? A: The EU explores these public blockchains for their transparency, innovation ecosystems, and resilience. This also helps avoid falling behind other nations in digital currency development. Q: What are public blockchain advantages for a CBDC? A: Benefits include greater transaction transparency, access to a vast developer community for innovation, and enhanced system resilience compared to private ledgers. Q: What challenges might the project face? A: Challenges involve complex regulatory adjustments, ensuring scalability for national transaction volumes, balancing user privacy with compliance, and achieving interoperability with existing financial systems. Q: How does it differ from cryptocurrencies? A: Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, the digital euro would be a centralized CBDC issued and controlled by the ECB, offering stability and trust similar to physical cash.

While long-time $DOGE holders watch closely for a breakout, there’s a new dog in the pack. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is aggressively marketing itself as the next contender in the meme coin space, already securing over $1.3M in presale commitments. Will $DOGE break out? Can $MAXI catch him? Buckle up for a wild ride. Dogecoin’s Familiar Playbook Despite being down 18% in the past 30 days, Dogecoin’s chart structure keeps drawing attention from analysts who point to its repeating four-to-five-year rhythm. Popular analyst, Trader Tardigrade , highlighted on X this week that $DOGE has entered the lower range of its long-term pump channel. Those points have, in past cycles, preceded face-ripping rallies to new highs. Adding weight to the bullish narrative, $DOGE also printed a golden cross earlier last week, a technical signal that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day. Historically, this has preceded momentum-driven upswings across both traditional and crypto markets. On-chain activity also suggests Dogecoin remains relevant beyond speculation. Payment processor BitPay recently reported that $DOGE accounted for 6% of all crypto transactions on its network in July. Add in a dash of the normal Elon Musk crypto news – inevitably seen as a boost for $DOGE, a perennial Musk favorite – and $DOGE, while down, is certainly not out. Meme Coins in Context The same is true for the broader meme coin sector. It has proven resilient despite volatility across digital assets in 2025. According to CoinGecko, the category holds a combined market capitalization of around $70B, led by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu ($SHIB), and Pepe ($PEPE). Though critics often dismiss meme coins as mere speculative vehicles with little intrinsic value, they have consistently drawn liquidity during bullish phases. And during those bullish phases, nothing explodes quite like a good meme coin, which can see winners come out of nowhere to boom 10x or even 100x or more, leaving more established altcoins in the dust. And dog-themed coins do their own thing; taken broadly, the dog-themed meme sector accounts for roughly $45B of the $70B total meme coin market. And it’s about to get another boost from the biggest Doge yet. Enter Maxi Doge ($DOGE) , a new Doge-themed meme coin with a booming presale. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Enters the Arena Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Doge for the gym-bros among us. Styled with gym culture aesthetics and high-risk trading promises, the project has already raised an eyebrow-raising $1.3M+ in less than four weeks. Its main premise is to embody and embolden the risk-takers in the crypto market. Its 1000x leverage philosophy is more than a joke — it’s a lifestyle. It’s about embracing the pump, chasing max gains, and trusting your skills. Speaking of skills, the project even teases futures partnerships and derivatives trading competitions with airdrop rewards for top ROI traders. Overall, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a high-risk, high-reward meme asset for degens, with community building for futures traders under the hood as well. A gym-heavy, meme-filled project, $MAXI is still a reliable one; its smart contracts have been audited by Coinsult and SOLIDProof. Our guide on how to buy $MAXI covers more key project details, including its roadmap, features, and community sentiment. Currently priced at $0.0002535 in its presale round, $MAXI’s price is scheduled to rise within two days. Buyers can immediately stake their tokens for an estimated 214% dynamic APY through the project’s native staking platform. Check Maxi’s presale for more information. Market Outlook: Looking Up for $DOGE, $MAXI Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has no intention of staying in $DOGE’s shadows. $MAXI is a bigger, better version of $DOGE itself, swollen with raw gains potential and a desire to profit, profit, profit. Dogecoin is once again flirting with its trademark cycle, and history suggests traders ignore it at their peril. But as new challengers like Maxi Doge step forward with aggressive marketing and bold promises, the meme coin market could be gearing up for another chaotic chapter.

Powell will deliver a speech that will be closely followed by global central bankers at an event to be held at Jackson Lake Lodge in Wyoming tomorrow at 17:00 (UTC+3). Powell's seven Jackson Hole speeches to date have covered a wide range of topics, from the history of monetary policy to employment targets, from inflation-fighting strategies to pandemic-era support promises. Each speech has been a highlight, offering clues about the Fed's next interest rate move. Related News: Attention: Binance Issues Serious Warning Against New Scam Method - It Could Happen to Anyone Here's what he said in previous years and what happened next: 2018 – Powell emphasized the importance of gradually raising interest rates. Four interest rate hikes were implemented during the year. 2019 – Powell, highlighting the slowdown in global growth and trade uncertainties, stated that they would take action when necessary. The Fed cut interest rates three times during the year. 2020 – In a speech held online due to the pandemic, Powell announced the new strategy, which includes maximum employment and average 2% inflation targets. 2021 – Powell argued that inflation would be temporary and said there should be no rush to raise interest rates. However, this approach later drew criticism. 2022 – Powell made it clear that higher interest rates and an economic slowdown to combat inflation would bring “pain.” The Fed continued its aggressive rate hikes. 2023 – Powell, arguing that inflation is improving, stated that interest rate hikes could continue if necessary. The policy rate was held steady at 5.25%-5.50%. 2024 – Focusing on preserving employment as inflation risks decline, Powell announced that it's time to cut interest rates. The Fed will cut rates by 50 basis points in September 2024. Powell's speech this year is expected to include critical messages about whether the interest rate cut process will continue. *This is not investment advice.

Anthony Pompliano, a prominent figure in the crypto space, has shared a compelling outlook, suggesting a significant Bitcoin rally September . His insights, stemming from his role as founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, offer a strategic perspective on what could be an exciting period for BTC holders. Why Expect a Bitcoin Rally September ? Pompliano, in a recent interview with CNBC, highlighted that Bitcoin currently finds itself in an “oversold zone.” This technical indicator often suggests that an asset’s price has dropped below its intrinsic value, potentially signaling an upcoming rebound. Historically, August tends to be a quieter month for investor participation across various markets, including crypto. However, the narrative shifts dramatically as we enter the latter part of the year. Pompliano points to late Q3 and early Q4 as historically optimal times for investors to engage with Bitcoin. This seasonal pattern, coupled with the oversold status, sets the stage for a potential surge in buying activity. Oversold Conditions: Bitcoin’s current state indicates a potential undervaluation. Seasonal Trends: August is typically slow, paving the way for increased activity in September. Optimal Investment Window: Late Q3 and early Q4 are historically favorable for BTC investment. Driving Forces: Interest Rates and Corporate Buying Fueling the Bitcoin Rally September Beyond seasonal patterns, Pompliano identifies additional catalysts that could significantly bolster short-term demand for BTC. One major factor is the increasing likelihood of a U.S. interest rate cut in September. Such a move by the Federal Reserve often makes riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, more attractive to investors seeking higher returns in a lower-yield environment. Moreover, the potential for increased corporate buying pressure could provide a substantial boost. As more institutions and companies recognize Bitcoin’s value as a digital store of value and a hedge against inflation, their entry into the market can create significant demand. This institutional interest often acts as a powerful upward force on price. These combined elements – an oversold market, favorable seasonal timing, potential interest rate adjustments, and growing corporate interest – paint a compelling picture for a robust Bitcoin rally September . Navigating the Market: What Pompliano Sees Ahead While optimistic about a near-term surge, Pompliano also offers a dose of realism. He forecasts that despite the anticipated buying momentum, Bitcoin is unlikely to cross the ambitious $1 million mark in the current market cycle. This perspective helps manage expectations, grounding the excitement in a more pragmatic outlook. His analysis suggests a period of significant growth and recovery, but within a defined range. It underscores the importance of understanding both the short-term catalysts and the broader market cycles when making investment decisions in the volatile crypto landscape. Key Takeaways from Pompliano’s Outlook: Short-term Optimism: High probability of increased buying activity from September. Macroeconomic Influence: Potential U.S. interest rate cuts could be a strong catalyst. Institutional Impact: Corporate buying pressure is expected to rise. Long-term Perspective: BTC unlikely to reach $1 million in the current cycle, signaling a more measured growth trajectory. Understanding these expert insights can help investors position themselves strategically. The confluence of technical indicators, seasonal trends, and macroeconomic shifts creates a unique window of opportunity that many are now keenly observing. Conclusion: Positioning for the Potential Bitcoin Rally September Anthony Pompliano’s forecast for a strong Bitcoin rally September offers a valuable perspective for anyone involved in the crypto market. His analysis, rooted in both market mechanics and macroeconomic trends, suggests that the coming months could see renewed vigor in Bitcoin’s price action. While the crypto market remains inherently unpredictable, insights from seasoned experts like Pompliano provide a framework for understanding potential movements. Investors should consider these factors as they navigate the evolving landscape, keeping an eye on the indicators that could signal the start of this anticipated rally. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an “oversold zone” for Bitcoin? A1: An “oversold zone” typically indicates that Bitcoin’s price has fallen significantly and rapidly, suggesting it might be undervalued and due for a rebound. It’s a technical analysis indicator often used by traders. Q2: Why does Anthony Pompliano expect a Bitcoin rally in September? A2: He attributes this expectation to Bitcoin being in an oversold zone, historical seasonal trends where late Q3 and early Q4 see increased investor participation, the likelihood of a U.S. interest rate cut, and anticipated corporate buying pressure. Q3: How do U.S. interest rate cuts affect Bitcoin’s price? A3: When interest rates are cut, traditional investments like savings accounts or bonds offer lower returns. This can make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive to investors seeking higher yields, potentially increasing demand and price. Q4: Does Pompliano believe Bitcoin will reach $1 million soon? A4: No, despite his short-term optimism for a Bitcoin rally September , he forecasts that BTC is unlikely to cross the $1 million mark in the current market cycle, advising a more realistic outlook. Q5: What is Professional Capital Management? A5: Professional Capital Management is a global asset management firm founded and led by Anthony Pompliano, specializing in managing capital across various asset classes, including digital assets.

BlockDAG understands this well and has made security and openness a key part of its roadmap. Instead of relying on claims alone, it offers tools and access that let the public verify every part of its progress in real time. With nearly $378 million raised in its presale, over 25.3 billion coins sold, and a strong 2,660% ROI since Batch 1, the numbers show growing demand. Now in Batch 29 at $0.0276, BlockDAG is showing that real transparency can be a serious driver of success in the crypto space. Third-Party Security Audits: Proof, Not Promises Security often determines a crypto project’s future. BlockDAG has taken this seriously by hiring third-party auditors to review its infrastructure and code. These reviews go far beyond surface checks, diving deep into possible vulnerabilities, code structure, and how well the project follows key security principles. By sharing these audit results publicly, BlockDAG removes the guesswork and gives its community a clear view of how its system performs. For those seeking the best crypto to invest in , this openness provides added peace of mind. It removes the need to rely solely on claims and allows people to make decisions based on verified information. Most projects at this stage avoid such scrutiny. BlockDAG, on the other hand, invites it. These audits act like a public agreement between the project and its supporters, showing that its foundation is focused on long-term stability, not shortcuts. Open Testnet: Letting Everyone Interact with the Technology The open-access testnet from BlockDAG is more than a tech preview, it’s a working sandbox for anyone to use. Developers, future users, and even observers can simulate real use cases, deploy smart contracts, and check the system’s behavior under live conditions. This approach builds a feedback loop between the team and the community, helping resolve any weaknesses early. For people deciding on the best crypto to invest in , this testnet offers a firsthand look before launch. Instead of waiting until mainnet, users get to test and verify months in advance. It lowers risks and gives the project a more active supporter base, one that helps shape what the final version looks like. When you combine this openness with stats like $378M raised and a 2,660% ROI since Batch 1, the appeal becomes even stronger. Blockchain Explorer: A Clear View of What’s Happening On-Chain Transparency is a central part of blockchain, but it means little if users can’t easily view the data. BlockDAG solves this with a real-time blockchain explorer, giving users the ability to see transactions, block confirmations, and overall activity instantly. You don’t need to wait for an update or trust secondhand reports, everything is there, live and verifiable. Whether you’re checking wallet activity or monitoring major transactions, you have full access to network details. That’s one reason BlockDAG is being recognized as the best crypto to invest in . The blockchain explorer brings transparency to life. It ensures every transaction is recorded and visible, helping both newcomers and experienced participants feel confident before mainnet even arrives. Final Thoughts BlockDAG’s security strategy is simple but powerful: keep things open, testable, and easy to verify. Through third-party audits, an interactive testnet, and a full blockchain explorer, it gives the public direct insight into how the network functions, long before it goes live. In the presale stage, trust is everything. And BlockDAG backs that trust with results: nearly $378 million raised, over 25.3 billion coins sold, and a 2,660% ROI since the start, with Batch 29 currently priced at $0.0276. It’s not just about early momentum, but the systems being put in place to support sustainable growth. For those exploring the best crypto to invest in , BlockDAG presents a rare mix of early opportunity and visible, verifiable progress, making it a strong pick for both short-term potential and long-term confidence.

However, as the altcoin has struggled due to the current bearish market, the analyst has called out multiple important levels to watch. While he continues to call for new all-time highs, EGRAG warns that XRP must hold this last line of defense or risk falling into a bear market. XRP Price Must Not Fall Below $2.33 As the analysis points out, the XRP price is still holding at reasonable levels that could suggest a restart of the bullish momentum. But the further the price falls, the more at risk XRP is of completely falling into the hands of bears and risking a complete crash. As the price fluctuates, the $2.90 now serves as the midpoint of the Linear Log Channel. This makes it an important level, and EGRAG suggests that the price being able to hold above this level would suggest a strong bullish setup for XRP. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holder Count Surges Toward New All-Time Highs — Here Are The Figures In the case of a failure, then the next major support and defense for XRP falls to the $2.65 level. The importance of this level cannot be overestimated, as the price must hold it even if it wicks below it. Closing below here would mean that the altcoin is ‘in trouble’, as EGRAG explains. Further down is what could arguably be the last line of defense for bulls to stage a reversal, and this last line of defense is at $2.33. This is the 2-Week EMA and is the major level to hold if the price is to reach new all-time highs. Otherwise, control falls completely into the hands of the bears, signaling a bear trend. Other major levels that signal bear control are the $1.90, which EGRAG paints as the “bear market line of defense.” A close below this puts XRP firmly in bear territory. Then $1.62 is the point of confirmation of the bearish trend as the price completely loses support. Why There Is Still Hope Despite the sentiment skewing toward the negative, the crypto analyst remains optimistic when it comes to the long-term performance of the XRP price. He points out that the White Arch outlined in the chart coincides with the Blue Upper Boundary of the Linear Log Channel. Related Reading: Economist Who Predicted Bitcoin Would Go To $100 Before $100,000 Returns At the top of this channel, the price is sitting well above $20. The major move required here is that the XRP price manages to close above $3.65, which would push the altcoin into price discovery. If this happens, then the analyst says, “That’s the end of the story,” expecting the price to rocket.

Bitcoin Retail Volume Has Gone Down Over The Past Month In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand Change , which is an on-chain indicator that measures the 30-day change in the demand of the retail holders . The retail investors are the smallest of entities on the network. As such, the size of their transfers tends to be small as well. The Retail Investor Demand Change makes use of the transaction volume associated with transfers carrying a value of less than $10,000 as a proxy for the demand among this cohort. When the value of the metric is positive, it means the retail investor volume has witnessed an increase over the past month. On the other hand, it being under zero suggests this group has lowered its activity. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand Change over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand Change spiked to a notable positive level earlier, but since the asset’s all-time high (ATH) above $124,000, the metric’s value has fallen off fast and has now dipped into the negative zone. The current value of the indicator suggests the transaction volume associated with transfers valued at less than $10,000 has dropped by around 5.7% over the past month. Thus, it seems the retail investors are leaving the cryptocurrency. “They’re the tourists of the crypto market here for the hype, gone when it fades,” notes Maartunn. The latest flip in retail sentiment has come as the Bitcoin price has declined by around 10% since the ATH. From the chart, it’s visible that the last time the Retail Investor Demand Change fell into the negative region was around the time of BTC’s dip under $100,000 back in June. What followed this bearish sentiment among the small hands was a surge in the asset to new ATHs. It now remains to be seen whether hype fading among the retail investors would act as a contrarian signal for the cryptocurrency this time as well. In some other news, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index, which tells us about the phase BTC is in based on various on-chain indicators, has declined into the neutral region recently, as the analytics firm’s head of research, Julio Moreno, has pointed out in an X post . “For risk management purposes, further softening in the index indicates price could go lower,” explains Moreno.

In a new post on X, HighVibeAssets, the Co-founder of Algopear, emphasized that mass adoption of cryptocurrency will only be achieved once institutions can securely custody digital assets. Tagging a video on this subject matter by David Schwartz, he argued that the majority of users will not need to understand private keys or the technical mechanisms of blockchain, noting that user-friendly solutions will be key to growth. In his words, “Soon you won’t even know what a private key is. Truth is mass crypto adoption comes when institutions can custody crypto. Ripple has built custody infrastructure through numerous acquisitions.” His remarks place focus on institutional involvement as a foundation for wider market acceptance. According to his perspective, the infrastructure developed by Ripple through its acquisitions provides a framework that can help bridge the gap between complex blockchain processes and a seamless user experience for mainstream financial consumers. Ripple CTO’s View on Accessibility The post was accompanied by a video of Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, who elaborated on the importance of simplifying blockchain usage for the general public. Schwartz stated that blockchain adoption cannot rely on individuals having deep knowledge of the technology or the role of private keys. SOON YOU WONT EVEN KNOW WHAT A PRIVATE KEY IS TRUTH IS MASS CRYPTO ADOPTION COMES WHEN INSTITUTIONS CAN CUSTODY CRYPTO RIPPLE HAS BUILT CUSTODY INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH NUMEROUS ACQUISITIONS pic.twitter.com/0T4bcXQDZw — HighVibeAssets AlgoPearRich (@HighVibeAssets) August 20, 2025 Instead, he believes that mass adoption will occur when financial services built on blockchain function in a way that allows people to use them without understanding the underlying infrastructure. He suggested that Ripple is close to advancing solutions that make this possible, describing the current stage as being only “a couple of months away from turning some of those corners.” According to Schwartz, the aim has been to provide financial services that ordinary people can use naturally, without requiring additional steps or technical knowledge. He underscored that this goal has been central to Ripple’s long-term development efforts.

Mike Gehosky, responding to the video, said that “99% of the users do not need to understand the technology and how it works, it needs to be highly simplistic.” He pointed out that requiring multiple steps for actions such as account creation or sending money undermines usability and slows adoption. From his perspective, solutions need to reduce friction and resemble the ease of use expected in traditional financial platforms. The Importance of Custody Infrastructure HighVibeAssets’ observation about Ripple’s acquisitions highlights the strategic importance of custody solutions in driving mainstream crypto adoption. Custody infrastructure provides secure management of digital assets, which is particularly relevant for institutional participants such as banks, asset managers, and corporations. By ensuring that these entities can handle digital assets in a regulated and secure manner, Ripple’s approach could enable broader market participation and reduce technical barriers for retail users who interact with simplified services built on top of these systems.

Ethereum (ETH) After being rejected at $4,800, Ethereum entered a significant pullback in the past two weeks. This is why the price closed this week in red with a 7% loss. Nevertheless, this is an expected pullback after the breakout at $4,000. At the time of this post, the price holds well above the $4,000 support, and this re-test of the breakout point could be the catalyst for ETH to finally challenge and surpass its all-time high at $4,868. Looking ahead, Ethereum buyers appear determined to have another go at breaking the ATH resistance. This could happen towards the end of August or in early September. If successful, then ETH will enter price discovery and aim for 6k and 7k next. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP lost its support at $3. This is bearish and led this cryptocurrency to close this week with a 9% loss. Buyers also appear to have retreated to the $2.7 support level. With the sell pressure building up, a test of the $2.7 support could follow in the days to come. It is critical for XRP to hold here, as losing this support would open the way for sellers to take the price much lower and towards $2.5. Looking ahead, the downtrend appears to be accelerating based on the 3-day MACD, which did a bearish cross this past week. This makes lower price levels likely in the days and weeks to come. Hopefully, buyers will return to stop the downtrend soon. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano had a good shot at reclaiming a price above $1, but sellers only allowed it to stay there for less than a day. Since then, ADA has been correcting and is under $0.90 at the time of this post. While this pullback is normal, it will be challenging for ADA to return above $1 if the overall market remains bearish. The current support is found at $0.77, and buyers still have an advantage with clearly higher highs and lows on the chart. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency is much better positioned to return on an uptrend compared to XRP. For example, its 3-day MACD is still bullish, and buy volume is making higher highs. Ideally, this will allow ADA to secure $1 as support later on, which will open the way for higher price levels like $1.3. Chart by TradingView Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin is the undisputed champion of this week after it managed to make a new all-time high at $883 yesterday. Since then, the asset has entered a pullback, which has brought it to similar levels to last week. The current support is found at $830, and this level was already tested and confirmed several times to date. Nevertheless, if this support is put under pressure again, that could be a sign of weakness as sellers are becoming more insistent. Looking ahead, BNB has to hold here if it wants to capitalize on this recent rally. Otherwise, bears will take advantage and push it into a more significant correction. Even so, the chart remains bullish as long as the price is above $800. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE has been struggling since early July when it failed to move above $50. Most recently, buyers tried again to break this key psychological level in mid-August, but were rejected a second time by sellers. This is bearish, and the price closed the week with a 17% loss. At the time of this post, the price is close to $41, and the current formation on the chart looks similar to a double top. If sellers put more pressure, the asset has good support at $39 and $37. Looking ahead, if HYPE loses its support at $37, then the price will likely fall towards $30. This would end its uptrend and push buyers to find a new support base to recover from. The most likely candidates for that are the $30 and $27 levels.

Ethereum is holding its place as the leader of smart contracts, Avalanche is scaling fast with institutional adoption, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise as a fresh rising contender. Together, they line up as some of the top crypto to buy now heading into 2025. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE Setting the Stage for Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE has started gaining traction among traders looking for altcoins with 25x potential. The project’s positioning leans on a mix of strong community backing and unique growth mechanics. Analysts point out that its breakout phase is aligning with Ethereum’s reliability and AVAX’s scaling strength. What’s drawing attention is the early access code PATRIOT50X , which gives participants a 50% bonus. This has fueled growing interest in MAGACOIN as one of the best crypto to invest in 2025, especially for those who want exposure to high ROI crypto presales. By blending political energy with a market-driven token model, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become a standout in the next adoption cycle. 2. Ethereum Price Prediction and Market Setup Ethereum continues to stand as a reliable altcoin in every discussion about the best crypto to invest in 2025. Analysts tracking the Ethereum price prediction suggest that after testing resistance levels, ETH has the potential to revisit its all-time highs and possibly extend toward the $9,000 mark. Recent movements show ETH pulling back from $4,788 to around $4,064, driven by ETF outflows and liquidations. While funding rates turned negative, many traders see this as a healthy reset after a 60% monthly rally. Technical charts highlight support near $4,134, with $3,651 as a deeper fallback zone. With institutional exposure growing, Ethereum still stands tall as one of the top crypto to buy now. 3. AVAX Coin Forecast Signals Upside Avalanche is starting to attract big institutional players and even state-backed projects. From SkyBridge tokenizing $300M on its chain to Wyoming launching the first state stablecoin on Avalanche, the project is building serious traction. Circle also expanded its USDC liquidity across seven chains, strengthening AVAX’s ecosystem reach. The AVAX coin forecast points toward a potential breakout, with analysts calling for a move toward $146 in 2025. This projection places Avalanche firmly among the best altcoins to buy, offering strong upside for long-term investors. With its growing role in cross-chain liquidity and institutional finance, AVAX continues to secure its position as a top crypto to buy now. Final Thought: Three Altcoins Leading the Charge The search for growth in crypto often comes down to finding projects with both adoption power and long-term staying strength. Ethereum holds its ground with unmatched security and utility, Avalanche rides institutional partnerships and technical scaling, while MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture as a bold, rising star. Together, these three projects not only fall into the category of altcoins with 25x potential, but they also reflect the best crypto to invest in 2025 for those seeking real upside. With Ethereum price prediction models pointing toward $9K, the AVAX coin forecast showing strong breakouts, and MAGACOIN FINANCE offering high ROI crypto presales plus a bonus, investors have clear options.

On-Chain Investigator Sees Red Flags,https://cryptopotato.com/yzy-and-libra-meme-coin-launches-rigged-on-chain-investigator-sees-red-flags/,"An on-chain investigator pseudonymously known as Dethective recently uncovered a suspicious pattern involving wallets that made massive profits from the launches of two tokens – Kanye West’s YZY coin and another token called LIBRA. According to the findings, one wallet was able to buy $250,000 worth of YZY tokens at a price of just $0.20 each, while most traders had to pay over $1 per token. This gave the wallet a huge advantage and allowed it to secure nearly $1 million in profit within only eight minutes. After the quick win, the profits were moved to a new “treasury wallet.” YZY and LIBRA Extraction Pattern Identified What makes this case even more interesting is that the same treasury wallet had already received large sums from earlier activity connected to the LIBRA token launch six months ago. Back then, two special wallets managed to snipe LIBRA tokens at the earliest opportunity. The first wallet walked away with around $9 million, while the second did even better and managed to extract about $11.5 million. Both wallets used similar tactics to the YZY trade. They bought tokens before the general public could access them. In total, across both YZY and LIBRA launches, these wallets pulled out close to $23 million. Most of the money has since been moved to platforms like Kamino or exchanges like Binance. Dethective pointed out that this pattern strongly indicates that insider knowledge was involved. The wallets in question did not randomly trade many different coins. Instead, they only appeared during the launches of YZY and LIBRA, and each time they were ready to invest huge sums of money. This level of timing and scale would be nearly impossible without advance information about when and how the tokens would launch. While it’s not clear who exactly is behind these wallets, speculation has emerged about whether it could be linked to Hayden Davis, the controversial figure behind the LIBRA token. However, there is no proof of that connection yet. Dethective argued that what looks like “celebrity coins” meant to attract new people into crypto might actually be serving another purpose – transferring wealth from regular traders to well-prepared insiders. Instead of being an equal opportunity market, these launches appear to make the rich even richer, with influencers and insiders benefiting the most while everyday traders end up paying higher prices. Over 60% of YZY Traders Lost Money, So Far Researcher Defioasis shared data showing how traders fared with the YZY token. Out of 56,050 wallets that traded YZY in a single day, nearly 45% either bought or sold, but not both. Many of the “only buying” wallets might be fake accounts created to inflate activity, while most of the “only selling” wallets were linked to big holders or project insiders cashing out, which makes it harder to track. Among the 30,884 wallets that both bought and sold, around 38% made profits, but most earned very small amounts, less than $500. A small group of 406 wallets made over $10,000 each, and just five wallets scored more than $1 million, including some linked to insiders. On the other hand, more than 60% of traders actually lost money. In fact, almost half of them ended up losing up to $500. In one extreme case, a single trader ended up losing over $1 million.

SBI Holdings, a major Tokyo-based financial services powerhouse, has announced its agreement to acquire shares in CoinPost, a prominent Japanese Web3-focused media and event firm. This SBI CoinPost acquisition marks a pivotal moment, signaling a deepening commitment by traditional financial institutions to the burgeoning Web3 ecosystem. What Does the SBI CoinPost Acquisition Mean for Web3? This strategic move, detailed in a recent press release from SBI Holdings, involves acquiring shares from CoinPost’s existing shareholders. The transaction is set to finalize by October 1, pending the completion of all necessary procedures. For the Web3 space, this means a powerful financial entity is directly investing in a platform dedicated to its growth and understanding, potentially accelerating mainstream adoption. The acquisition highlights several key aspects: Increased Mainstream Visibility: SBI’s backing can significantly amplify CoinPost’s reach, bringing complex Web3 concepts to a broader, more traditional audience. Enhanced Credibility: A major financial group’s investment lends substantial credibility to Web3 media, encouraging more traditional users and businesses to explore the space with confidence. Resource Infusion: CoinPost will likely benefit from SBI’s extensive resources, potentially leading to expanded content offerings, more impactful events, and technological advancements in its platform. Why is SBI Holdings Investing in Web3 Media? SBI Holdings has long been a forward-thinking player in the digital asset sector, consistently exploring new frontiers. Their interest in Web3 media is not accidental; it aligns with a broader strategy to embrace and integrate cutting-edge technologies. By investing in CoinPost, SBI is positioning itself at the forefront of information dissemination and community building within the Web3 sphere, a crucial step for future growth. Consider these strategic drivers: Education and Adoption: Effective communication and clear explanations are crucial for Web3 adoption. CoinPost’s media channels can educate potential users and investors about decentralized technologies, demystifying complex topics. Market Intelligence: Owning a leading Web3 media firm provides SBI with invaluable, real-time insights into market sentiment, emerging trends, and community needs, informing its own strategic decisions. Ecosystem Expansion: This SBI CoinPost acquisition helps SBI build a more comprehensive Web3 ecosystem, complementing its existing ventures in crypto exchanges, tokenization, and various blockchain solutions. CoinPost’s Role in Japan’s Web3 Landscape CoinPost has established itself as a go-to source for Web3 news and events in Japan. It plays a vital role in informing, educating, and connecting the Japanese Web3 community. Its platform covers a wide range of topics, from foundational blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to decentralized finance (DeFi) and the immersive metaverse experiences. Moreover, the firm’s influence extends beyond just reporting. CoinPost actively organizes influential events that bring together industry leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts, fostering crucial dialogue and collaboration. This active engagement makes it a highly valuable asset for any entity looking to deepen its roots in the Web3 space, and certainly for a visionary like SBI Holdings. Ripple’s Connection and Future Implications of SBI CoinPost Acquisition This news follows closely on the heels of another significant announcement involving SBI Holdings. Ripple recently disclosed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with SBI Holdings and its subsidiary, SBI VC Trade, to introduce Ripple USD (RLUSD) to the Japanese market. This initiative aims to enhance cross-border payments and digital asset services, showcasing SBI’s commitment to innovation. The timing of the SBI CoinPost acquisition alongside the RLUSD announcement strongly suggests a coordinated effort by SBI to strengthen its position across multiple facets of the digital economy. It indicates a clear vision to not only participate in but also actively shape the future of Web3 and digital finance in Japan and beyond. What could this mean for the future? Synergy with Digital Asset Offerings: CoinPost could become a key channel for communicating updates and educational content related to SBI’s digital asset services, including the upcoming RLUSD. Broader Web3 Integration: Expect SBI to leverage CoinPost’s expertise and community reach to explore new Web3 initiatives, potentially involving NFTs, decentralized applications (dApps), and other emerging technologies more effectively. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges The SBI CoinPost acquisition presents immense opportunities for both entities and the broader Web3 market. For SBI, it solidifies its reputation as a pioneer in digital finance and a leader in embracing new technologies. For CoinPost, it offers resources, stability, and an expanded platform to further its mission of informing and connecting the Web3 community. However, integrating a dynamic media company into a large financial group also comes with challenges, such as maintaining editorial independence and adapting to corporate structures. Ultimately, this move underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance and the decentralized Web3 world. It’s a powerful indicator that mainstream institutions are not just observing but actively participating in building the next iteration of the internet, shaping its future for a global audience. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the main purpose of SBI Holdings acquiring CoinPost shares?

Trader faces $1.85M loss on ENA long; adds $1.7M USDC to avoid liquidation. ENA tests key support near 200 EMA and Fibonacci zone, with bulls eyeing possible bounce. 140 Million ENA Removed From Exchanges Over a four-day span, 140 million Ethena (ENA) tokens were taken out of exchanges. The data, shared by analyst Ali Martinez, shows a drop in exchange supply from 1.3 billion to 1.16 billion ENA between August 17 and August 21, 2025. The chart used confirms the steady outflow over that time. 140 million Ethena $ENA withdrawn from exchanges in the last 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/hGaO0ESDT0 — Ali (@ali_charts) August 22, 2025 Despite these withdrawals, the ENA price fell from above $0.80 to around $0.64. Withdrawals of this scale often suggest reduced sell-side pressure. However, the continued price drop points to weak demand or possible off-exchange trading activity. As of press time, ENA traded at $0.65. Over the past 24 hours, it has seen a slight rise of 0.55%, with a total volume of $442 million. Over the last week, however, the token has fallen by over 10%, showing ongoing market weakness. In a related update, tracking account Lookonchain reported that a trader identified as 0x2611 is facing more than $1.85 million in losses on a long ENA position. To avoid liquidation, they added 1.7 million USDC into Hyperliquid earlier today. Technical Support Level Under Watch Technical trader Altcoin Sherpa posted a chart showing ENA trading around a confluence of key indicators. The recent price area is close to the 200-day EMA at $0.62, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement at $0.61, and an older resistance level in late July. The coincidence of these factors indicates a potential support zone. Source: X Meanwhile, the asset is reacting around this area, which could serve as a decision point. If the support holds, buyers may step in. If it fails, further downside toward the next Fibonacci level around $0.53 could follow. Protocol Update and Long-Term View Ethena Labs shared recent performance data for its USDe protocol. Over $500 million in total revenue has been generated to date. Weekly protocol revenue hit $13.4 million, and USDe supply reached a record high of $11.7 billion, reflecting increased adoption of synthetic stablecoins. Long-term analysis from Altcoinpedia points to a possible downside toward $0.50. If the price holds there, a bounce toward $1.10 may follow. A move above that level could bring higher targets in the $2–$5 range.

Ethereum Would Outperform Solana in Bull Run: Arthur Hayes When asked about Hayes’s preference between the rise in Solana and Ethereum prices now and the end of the cycle, he said both assets would show a bullish trajectory. “They are both going to go up, but the question is which asset could go up more,” he noted. He said that Solana would probably not surpass Ethereum in the bull run, but said that it would be a “bigger asset move.” Is ETH Breakout Imminent? Ethereum fell 0.64% in the past 24 hours to $4,289, per CoinMarketCap data . The token has slightly bounced back and is seen trading at $4,306 at press time. However, the significant demand for a spot ETH ETF, along with massive institutional inflows, including companies like Bitmine and Sharplink Gaming acquiring over 2 million ETH since June, has contributed to the recent surge in ETH prices. The crypto has surged over 15% over the last 30 days, hitting a local high of $4,700 last week and inching closer to an all-time high. The crypto billionaire’s $20k call isn’t wild if macro and ETF demand align. For now, the crypto community is keeping a close eye on Hayes’ wallet activity, particularly as more capital flows into mid-cap Ethereum ecosystem tokens.

With Bitcoin hovering around $112,000, Rogoff admitted he was wrong in his prediction, saying he was “overly optimistic that the US would take a sensible path” on cryptocurrency regulation.

Rogoff indirectly criticized the current regulatory environment for not being vigilant enough, which is why cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have seen such unexpected growth. Rogoff argued that he failed to foresee Bitcoin becoming the preferred medium of transaction, competing with fiat currencies in the $20 trillion global underground economy. Furthermore, Rogoff pointed out a clear conflict of interest as regulators “hold millions or even billions of dollars in cryptocurrency and have virtually no consequences.” *This is not investment advice.

A recent court ruling mandates the company to pay a substantial sum for WEMIX compensation to its former and current employees. This development sends a clear message across the crypto industry regarding employee agreements and digital asset promises. What’s Behind the WEMIX Compensation Ruling? The Seoul Central District Court delivered a partial victory to a group of plaintiffs on August 22. This civil lawsuit targeted Wemade, ordering the company to pay a total of 9.9 billion won, which translates to approximately $7.1 million USD. This ruling stems from a dispute involving employees who previously worked at Wemade Tree, a former subsidiary of the blockchain gaming giant. The core of the lawsuit revolved around claims that Wemade failed to deliver WEMIX tokens, which had been promised as a vital part of their overall compensation package. Consequently, the court found Wemade liable for these undelivered digital assets, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling such agreements. Why is This Verdict So Crucial for Crypto Companies? This court decision holds immense significance, particularly for companies operating in the rapidly evolving blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. It sets a precedent, highlighting the legal enforceability of token-based employee incentives. Therefore, companies must approach their digital asset compensation strategies with extreme caution and clarity. The ruling underscores several key takeaways for the industry: Clarity in Token Distribution: All agreements regarding token distribution to employees must be crystal clear, leaving no room for ambiguity. Transparency in Compensation: Companies need to be fully transparent about how and when tokens will be delivered as part of compensation. Legal Enforceability: Promises of crypto assets, like WEMIX compensation , are legally binding and can lead to significant liabilities if not honored. How Does This Impact Wemade and the WEMIX Ecosystem? For Wemade, the immediate impact is a substantial financial payout of $7.1 million. This sum will undoubtedly affect the company’s financial planning. Beyond the monetary aspect, the ruling could also influence Wemade’s reputation within the blockchain community and among potential employees. Maintaining trust is paramount in the crypto space, and legal disputes can sometimes erode that trust. Furthermore, this situation brings renewed attention to the WEMIX token itself. As the primary asset at the center of this compensation dispute, its role in employee incentive programs will likely be scrutinized more closely by other industry players. Lessons Learned: Navigating Employee Token Agreements The Wemade case offers invaluable lessons for any company considering or currently offering crypto tokens as part of employee compensation. It demonstrates that verbal or vaguely documented promises can lead to serious legal and financial repercussions. Businesses must establish robust legal frameworks for their digital asset programs. Here are actionable insights for blockchain companies: Document Everything: Ensure all token promises, vesting schedules, and delivery mechanisms are meticulously documented in legally binding contracts. Seek Expert Legal Counsel: Engage legal professionals specializing in blockchain and employment law to draft and review all compensation agreements. Manage Expectations: Clearly communicate the risks, benefits, and market volatility associated with token compensation to employees. Regular Review: Periodically review and update token compensation policies to align with evolving legal and regulatory landscapes. In conclusion, the Seoul Central District Court’s order for Wemade to pay $7.1 million in WEMIX compensation serves as a powerful reminder. It highlights the critical need for meticulous planning, transparency, and legal diligence when structuring employee incentive programs involving digital assets. This case will likely influence how future crypto companies approach token-based compensation, ensuring greater protection for employees and clearer obligations for employers.

With Chainlink and Cardano (ADA) both trending, the spotlight is shifting toward new Ethereum Layer 2 projects like Layer Brett ($LBRETT), which analysts claim could 100x in the upcoming bull run. The ongoing $LBRETT presale, ultra-high staking APY, and meme-fueled energy make this a standout in a crowded market. It is a rare opportunity where meme power and real blockchain utility meet, and the chance to buy in early may not last long. Why Layer 2 gives Layer Brett the edge Layer Brett isn’t just another memecoin . It’s a next-generation Layer 2 project that brings speed, scalability, and true community ownership to the Ethereum ecosystem. Using Ethereum Layer 2 scaling, $LBRETT delivers near-instant transactions and ultra-low gas fees, thus solving the congestion and high cost issues that plague Ethereum Layer 1. Layer Brett is designed for real-world use, unlike competitors such as LINK and ADA, with staking, gamified rewards, and NFT integration. Key features setting Layer Brett apart: Built on Ethereum Layer 2: High-speed, low-cost, and scalable, anchored to the most secure smart contract blockchain. Presale access: Early entry at just $0.0044 per token with ETH, USDT, or BNB. Massive staking rewards: Advertised APY over 3,500%, with early participants seeing 55,000%+. $1 million giveaway: Active community campaigns and reward incentives. Layer Brett Rewards early buyers Staking on Layer Brett is simple and accessible, with no complicated lock-up periods. Early buyers can stake directly via MetaMask or Trust Wallet and receive high-yield rewards thanks to Layer 2’s low operating costs. This is a major advantage over Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA), where staking returns are minimal, and transaction fees on non-L2 platforms eat into profits. Early supporters also benefit from transparent tokenomics: 10 billion token supply, 30% allocated for presale, and 25% for staking rewards. As the project grows, staking rates decrease, adding urgency for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. The ongoing presale and community-focused approach mirror the viral success of other well-known memecoins, but Layer Brett adds DeFi coin credibility and altcoin scalability. Chainlink, Cardano, and the new wave of Layer 2 tokens Chainlink continues to expand its DeFi and smart contracts integration, showing resilience with a market cap of around $16.93 billion and a price near $21.93. LINK remains a pillar among top altcoins, but lacks the explosive staking rewards and presale upside of $LBRETT. Similarly, Cardano (ADA) is gaining momentum with a recent price surge to $0.92 and continued development, yet still faces investor skepticism after disappointing price predictions. As other trending cryptocurrencies like Bonk and Brett (original) fluctuate, Layer Brett’s blend of meme culture, staking crypto incentives, and Layer 2 blockchain speed positions it as the best crypto to invest in for the next 100x altcoin opportunity. With Ethereum gas fees often exceeding $10, Layer Brett’s fees remain just pennies, making it a top DeFi token and low gas fee crypto contender. The best crypto to buy now is Layer Brett Layer Brett’s presale is live, but will not last long. The platform merges memecoin excitement with real DeFi, NFT, and staking utility, all anchored to the most powerful Layer 2 technology. With a smaller market cap than Bonk, Brett (original), or even Chainlink and Cardano (ADA), $LBRETT offers greater room for growth in the 2025 crypto bull run. Don’t miss this chance to join the next big crypto before the market catches on.

The answer points to slightly above average volatility, not the extreme swings that the widespread attention on the event might suggest. ""BTC options are pricing in about a ±2.0% move around Powell’s Jackson Hole speech,"" Pulkit Goyal, head of trading at crypto market maker Orbit Markets, told CoinDesk. Orbit specializes in crypto options and structured derivatives. The anticipated 2% price swing around Powell’s speech suggests slightly higher volatility than the average daily volatility of 1.52%, which is derived from the 30-day realized volatility of 29%. Traders use the pricing of options with different strike prices and maturities and implied volatility and option greeks to gauge an expected range of price movement. Implied volatilty refers to the market's expectation on how much the underlying asset is expected to move over a specific time frame. Volmex's one-day implied volatility index (BVIV1D) has increased to an annualized 49% as of writing, the highest since May 26, according to data source TradingView. That equates to a 24-hour price swing of 2.5%.Note that volatility is direction-agnostic, meaning price swings hinted by options and implied volatility indices can unfold in either direction. That said, downside volatility looks more likely in case Powell sounds balanced, contrasting widespread expectations for rate cut hints. Some traders have been picking up put options preparing for such an outcome. ""If his tone leans more balanced than dovish, markets could see a retracement, which has driven demand for downside protection. The skew tells the story: overnight 25-delta risk reversals are currently 6 vols put over call,"" Goyal told CoinDeskPowell is scheduled to speak Friday morning at the Fed’s annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium.",Markets|Trading|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-22 07:32:34

With a staggering 6,000% staking APY and a buzzing presale already raising over $500,000, LBRETT is shaping up to be one of the boldest contenders in 2025’s DeFi race. Is LBRETT The Best Crypto To Add To Your Portfolio? Layer Brett has quickly entered conversations as one of the biggest opportunities in 2025. The meme project has raked over 10,000 impressions, with reports of a whopping 6,000% in staking rewards. This type of return is rarely seen in the meme coin space, making Layer Brett a mouthwatering offer in today’s market. In fact, many investors who once relied on ADA for steady growth are now turning their attention to LBRETT, which offers greater returns at a fraction of the cost. Its staking model is not only highly rewarding but also straightforward and efficient. Holders can lock their coins and earn at a pace that surpasses ADA and even top meme coins like PEPE and SHIB. But LBRETT doesn’t stop there. The project integrates NFTs into its ecosystem. These collectibles are linked to rewards and status, making its community feel alive and active. Additionally, the ongoing presale has already attracted eager investors, with transactions flowing more smoothly than those on ADA. Does PEPE Have What It Takes To Dominate Charts Like Cardano? Things might finally be turning around for PEPE. Analyst Jacob Crypto Bury made a post on X where he mentioned believing the token could be gearing up for a major move. On the charts, PEPE’s price is tightening inside a narrowing triangle. Each swing is getting smaller and the lines are closing in which has left traders watching closely. Usually, this type of pattern comes before a breakout for most cryptos. The pressure builds until the price has no choice but to make a sharp move. If it breaks upward, the rally could be strong. Right now, sentiment around meme coins leans bullish which means that an upward push for PEPE is even more likely. That said, PEPE has already proven it can surprise doubters. Another strong move would only add to its legend. Specifically, a climb toward $0.000015 may not be as far-fetched as it once seemed. Can SHIB’s Next Crypto Rally Earn It A Reputation Like ADA’s? SHIB appears to be gaining traction, though the journey to this point has been challenging. Buyers tried to push past the $0.00001411 resistance, but sellers stepped in and forced the token back. Now, SHIB’s price movement shows signs of consolidation, a phase analysts often consider a crucial stage before a potential breakout. For SHIB, support has been spotted near $0.00001196 and $0.00001154. These levels are acting as a solid base where traders expect demand to build. From here, SHIB could be gathering strength for its next move. The first real obstacle lies at $0.00001267. Bulls will need to break this barrier if they hope to somehow start a fresh rally. Until that happens, SHIB sits in a tight range. Conclusion While ADA, PEPE, and SHIB strive to maintain their relevance in the DeFi space, LBRETT is emerging as a strong contender, offering compelling reasons for investors to take notice. Its presale has already raised over $500,000, with each token priced at $0.0044.

A recent and significant development highlights these dangers: a South Korean appeals court has firmly upheld a 12-year prison sentence for a senior recruiter involved in a massive crypto fraud case . This crucial decision sends a powerful message to those attempting to exploit unsuspecting investors in the digital asset space, emphasizing accountability and the growing enforcement against illicit activities. What Happened in This Major Crypto Fraud Case? The core of this legal battle revolves around Ado International, a company that orchestrated a staggering 440 billion won, equivalent to approximately $315.7 million, in a sophisticated crypto fraud scheme. According to reports from Newsis, prosecutors detailed how the operation systematically lured countless investors with enticing promises of exceptionally high returns. The deceptive strategy involved funneling investor funds into a proprietary cryptocurrency specifically created by the company itself. This elaborate scheme was far from a simple misrepresentation; it was a carefully constructed deception designed to extract maximum funds. The senior recruiter, whose substantial sentence was upheld, played a pivotal role in expanding this vast network of victims. Their direct involvement clearly underscores the hierarchical and organized nature of such fraudulent operations, where individuals at various levels actively contribute to the overall illicit activity. Why is This Crypto Fraud Case Sentence So Significant? The upholding of a 12-year sentence in this high-profile crypto fraud case marks a pivotal moment for legal enforcement within the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. It unequivocally demonstrates a clear and determined intent by South Korean authorities to take a hard line against financial crimes involving digital assets. For investors, this provides a significant measure of reassurance, indicating that legal systems are indeed adapting to effectively combat sophisticated crypto-related scams. Consider the broader impact of such a ruling: Strong Deterrent: The lengthy prison term serves as a potent warning, designed to deter other potential fraudsters from engaging in similar illicit activities. Investor Protection: It powerfully reinforces the idea that victims of crypto fraud can seek and obtain justice through established legal channels, fostering greater confidence. Legal Precedent: This landmark ruling contributes significantly to a growing body of case law, which is essential for helping to define and solidify the legal landscape for cryptocurrencies globally. Such decisive judicial actions are absolutely vital for building trust and stability within the broader crypto ecosystem. They send a clear signal that the digital realm is not a lawless frontier and that accountability will be pursued vigorously, regardless of the complexity of the crime. How Can You Avoid Falling Victim to Crypto Fraud Schemes? In light of this major South Korean crypto fraud case , understanding how to effectively protect yourself from similar schemes is more important than ever. Fraudsters often employ similar, identifiable tactics, making it possible to spot red flags before you commit your hard-earned funds. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the crypto landscape safely: Be Skeptical of High Returns: Always approach promises of guaranteed, unusually high returns with extreme caution. If an investment offers little to no risk for substantial profit, it is almost certainly a scam. Legitimate investments inherently carry some level of risk. Research Thoroughly: Always conduct extensive due diligence on any cryptocurrency project, platform, or company. Look for transparent whitepapers, reputable and identifiable teams, and clear, viable use cases. Critically, check for independent reviews and credible news coverage. Verify Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that the platform or company operates strictly within the legal and regulatory frameworks of your jurisdiction. Unregistered or unregulated entities are a significant and immediate red flag. Guard Your Private Keys: Never, under any circumstances, share your private keys or seed phrases with anyone. Scammers frequently impersonate support staff or trusted figures to trick you into revealing sensitive, critical information. Beware of Urgency: Fraudsters commonly create a false sense of urgency, pressing you to invest quickly to avoid “missing out” on a limited-time opportunity. Always take your time to make calm, informed, and well-considered decisions. What Are the Broader Implications of This Crypto Fraud Case for the Market? This significant South Korean crypto fraud case will undoubtedly have ripple effects across the global crypto market. It vividly underscores the increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide on digital asset activities. Governments are actively working to establish clearer guidelines and implement stronger enforcement mechanisms specifically designed to protect consumers and maintain overall financial integrity. The decisive outcome of this case could very well encourage other jurisdictions to adopt similar stringent measures against crypto-related crimes. As the nascent industry continues to mature, such legal battles are absolutely crucial for clearly distinguishing legitimate innovation from fraudulent enterprises. Ultimately, these actions contribute to fostering a safer, more trustworthy environment for all genuine participants in the digital asset space. The South Korean court’s unwavering stance in the Ado International crypto fraud case sends a clear and resounding message: financial crimes in the digital asset space will not be tolerated. This significant ruling not only delivers justice for the victims but also sets a powerful precedent for future enforcement efforts globally. It serves as a stark reminder for both investors and innovators to prioritize security, transparency, and diligent due diligence in the ever-evolving, complex world of cryptocurrency.

Most of them are shams anyway. That’s why a little help can go a long way. And no, by help we don’t mean following a self-proclaimed guru on X or a random ‘proven performer’ on Reddit. There’s something better out there: listening to everyone but no one directly. Combine that with a layer of sharp analysis, and suddenly you’re way ahead of the average investor. Confused? We’re talking about AI, specifically Grok. Why Grok? Because it’s built directly into X, the single biggest platform where crypto news, under-the-radar alpha, and breaking updates from publications all flow in. With so much happening every hour, it’s easy to miss the signals that really matter. Grok cuts through the noise, sweeps everything, and highlights where hype and big money are flowing, pointing out the best altcoins to buy . Keep reading to see Grok’s top 3 crypto picks right now, what makes each unique, and why they could undergo serious upside in the months ahead. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Supercharging Bitcoin with Solana-Like Performance Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new cryptocurrency project that aims to supercharge the Bitcoin ecosystem by building a next-gen Layer 2 solution. It stands out with its Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, unlocking lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and enhanced programmability for Bitcoin. The project’s revolutionary goal is to crank up Bitcoin’s real-world use cases, pushing it far beyond just a passive store of value. No wonder Bitcoin Hyper has already attracted over $11.2M from early investors. The best part? According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could hit $0.32 by the end of 2025 – a staggering 2,400% return on the cards. At the core of Bitcoin Hyper’s design is the SVM integration, which enables developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications directly on its network. Users will be able to interact with this Web3 environment through Hyper’s canonical bridge, which is a decentralized, non-custodial bridge that converts native $BTC into wrapped $BTC fully compatible with Layer 2. These converted tokens will open the door to $HYPER’s Web3 ecosystem, from DeFi trading and NFTs to staking, DAOs, governance, lending, and even blockchain gaming. Want in? Grab $HYPER now while it’s still super cheap, with each token priced at just $0.012775. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . For more information, visit $HYPER’s official website. 2. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Flipping the Script on Wall Street Whales If you’re tired of watching institutional players and crypto whales rake in fortunes using insider information and advanced tools, Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) ’s Frog Army might be the community you’ve been waiting for. $WEPE is flipping the script on unfair big-money players whose profits often come at the cost of everyday investors – people who usually don’t get timely access to information, lack strategy execution tools, and often miss the chance to ride the biggest pumps (let alone know when to exit before whales dump). That’s where $WEPE changes the game. By holding the token, you essentially join a tight-knit insider group where the community feeds off each other, offering market insights, trading strategies, alpha calls, and exclusive opinions in a safe, lively space. $WEPE is already a record-breaker: it was one of the most successful meme coin presales in history, raising over $70M in just a few months. The presale wrapped up earlier this year, and the token quickly listed on major decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and KCEX. While its February launch faced some turbulence, as it came right after the January rally cooled off, momentum is well and truly back. $WEPE is up nearly 400% since the beginning of June, including a jaw-dropping 112% in just the last three days, a clear sign that the Frog Army is gathering steam. And the project isn’t slowing down. While it currently runs on Ethereum, $WEPE has also announced plans to launch on Solana sooner rather than later. On top of that, it has introduced an NFT minting feature, wherein 5,000 lucky $WEPE holders who participated in a 30-day quest campaign will get to create their very own WEPE NFT profile. This move not only gives holders the chance to own unique digital collectibles but also boosts the project’s visibility and hype across the market. 1 $WEPE is currently available at just $0.00007008. Visit Wall Street Pepe’s official website to know more. 3. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Dogecoin’s Cousin Out for Revenge and Real Gains Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has all the makings of an explode-worthy token. It’s raw, degen-powered, doesn’t bother wooing investors with a polished roadmap, and thrives on pure meme energy. And most importantly, it’s fronted by a mascot that investors want to rally behind and support in their mission, no matter how ridiculous it is. And make no mistake, Maxi does indeed have a very ridiculous mission: to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet. Why Dogecoin? Because the two are cousins, and $DOGE’s hyper-popularity left Maxi stuck in the shadows. But instead of fading away, Maxi used that time to bulk up like Hulk in his cave, hitting the gym, lifting heavy, downing protein shakes and caffeine, and assembling a loyal degen crew who live by his philosophy: never skip leg day, never skip a pump. $MAXI’s master plan is to go all-in on virality. Developers have reserved 40% of the token supply for PR pushes, paid campaigns, social media blitzes, and high-profile collabs. Holders also get access to exclusive weekly trading competitions with prizes that can crank up their gains even further. The good news keeps rolling, as Maxi is also eyeing a futures platform listing, which could give holders up to 1000x leverage to go full degen and shoot for true moonshot gains. Currently in presale with over $1.37M already in its kitty, you can buy $MAXI for just $0.0002535 per token. Check out Maxi Doge’s official website for more information. Conclusion We’re thoroughly impressed by Grok’s picks for the best altcoins to buy now, courtesy of their sheer range. The AI didn’t just stick to one lane, but instead highlighted projects across the spectrum, from $HYPER ’s mission-driven, Bitcoin-focused Layer 2 approach, to $WEPE ’s degen-fueled rebellion with proven momentum, to $MAXI ’s absurd yet hype-worthy community movement.

A recent, truly alarming Bitcoin scam has sent ripples through the community, serving as a stark reminder of the ever-present dangers. This incident saw a staggering $91 million in Bitcoin vanish, orchestrated by fraudsters employing sophisticated social engineering tactics. It’s a wake-up call for every crypto holder. What Happened in This Massive Bitcoin Scam? Blockchain security expert ZachXBT recently brought this devastating Bitcoin scam to light on X. On August 19, a victim lost 783 BTC, valued at approximately $91 million at the time, to a cunning social engineering attack. The perpetrators didn’t use advanced hacking tools; instead, they exploited trust. These scammers meticulously posed as legitimate support staff from both a cryptocurrency exchange and a hardware wallet provider. Their goal was clear: to trick the victim into revealing crucial access information. This highlights a critical vulnerability in personal security protocols, not just technological ones. The Deceptive Tactics: How Social Engineering Works to Fuel a Bitcoin Scam Social engineering is a manipulation technique designed to trick individuals into divulging confidential information. In this Bitcoin scam , the fraudsters likely used a combination of: Impersonation: Pretending to be a trusted entity, like your exchange or hardware wallet support. Urgency: Creating a false sense of emergency to pressure the victim into acting quickly without thinking. Trust Exploitation: Building rapport and gaining confidence to make their requests seem legitimate. These tactics are incredibly effective because they target human psychology rather than system vulnerabilities. It’s a stark reminder that even the most secure hardware can’t protect against human error. Tracing the Stolen Funds: The Role of Wasabi Wallet in This Bitcoin Scam Following the successful execution of the Bitcoin scam , the stolen funds were reportedly funneled through Wasabi Wallet. Wasabi Wallet is known for its privacy features, particularly its CoinJoin implementation, which mixes transactions from multiple users to obscure the origin and destination of funds. While Wasabi Wallet provides enhanced privacy for legitimate users, it unfortunately also makes it more challenging for investigators to trace illicit funds. This incident underscores the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between privacy tools and law enforcement’s efforts to combat financial crime within the crypto space. Protecting Yourself from a Bitcoin Scam: Actionable Insights Given the increasing sophistication of these attacks, vigilance is paramount. Here are essential steps to safeguard your assets and avoid falling victim to a Bitcoin scam : Verify Everything: Always independently verify the identity of anyone claiming to be support. Use official channels only – never click links from unsolicited emails or messages. Never Share Private Keys or Seed Phrases: Legitimate support will NEVER ask for your private keys, seed phrase, or full password. These are the keys to your kingdom. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use 2FA on all your crypto accounts. Hardware-based 2FA (like YubiKey) is generally more secure than SMS-based 2FA. Be Skeptical of Urgency: Scammers often create a sense of urgency. Take a deep breath, verify, and don’t rush into decisions. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics. Knowledge is your best defense against a Bitcoin scam . This $91 million Bitcoin scam serves as a powerful, albeit painful, lesson for the entire cryptocurrency community. It’s a vivid demonstration that even experienced users can become targets. While blockchain technology itself offers robust security, the human element remains the weakest link. By understanding the methods of these fraudsters and adopting rigorous security practices, we can collectively build a more resilient and safer crypto ecosystem. Stay alert, stay secure, and protect your digital wealth. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Scams Q: What is social engineering in the context of a Bitcoin scam? A: Social engineering is a manipulation tactic where scammers trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, like login credentials or private keys, by impersonating trusted entities (e.g., exchange support) or creating deceptive scenarios. Q: How can I verify if a support message from an exchange or wallet provider is legitimate? A: Always go directly to the official website of your exchange or wallet provider. Use their official contact methods (phone numbers, support portals) listed on their site. Never rely on links or contact information provided in unsolicited emails or messages. Q: Why do scammers use privacy-focused wallets like Wasabi Wallet? A: Privacy-focused wallets utilize features like CoinJoin to mix transactions, making it significantly harder to trace the flow of funds. This helps scammers obscure the origin and destination of stolen cryptocurrency, complicating investigations. Q: What are the absolute essentials for protecting my Bitcoin from scams? A: The essentials include never sharing your private keys or seed phrase, enabling strong Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on all accounts, being skeptical of unsolicited communications, and independently verifying all support requests. Q: Is hardware wallet protection enough to prevent a Bitcoin scam? A: While hardware wallets offer excellent security for storing your crypto offline, they cannot protect against social engineering. If you are tricked into approving a transaction or revealing your seed phrase, even a hardware wallet cannot prevent the loss of funds. The fight against crypto scams requires a collective effort.

Once hesitant, the financial giant now classifies Bitcoin as a ‘reliable store of value.’ This monumental change signals a growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance, particularly for Bitcoin’s role as a Bitcoin credible store of value . Why is Bitcoin a Credible Store of Value for Allianz? Allianz’s updated investment report outlines several compelling reasons for this new classification. The firm previously avoided Bitcoin investments, citing regulatory uncertainty and volatility concerns back in 2019. However, the landscape has evolved dramatically, leading to a fresh perspective on why Bitcoin can indeed be a Bitcoin credible store of value . Here are the key factors Allianz highlighted: Deflationary Design: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. This inherent scarcity naturally makes it deflationary, which helps protect against inflation over the long term. Decentralized Governance: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning no single entity controls it. This independence from central banks and governments enhances its appeal as a hedge against traditional financial system risks. Low Correlation with Traditional Markets: The report emphasizes Bitcoin’s low correlation with assets like the S&P 500 and gold. This characteristic makes it an attractive tool for portfolio diversification, potentially reducing overall risk for investors. What Drives Institutional Adoption of Bitcoin? Beyond its inherent characteristics, external factors are also accelerating institutional interest in Bitcoin. Allianz specifically points to clearer global regulations as a primary driver. As governments and financial bodies establish more defined frameworks for cryptocurrencies, the comfort level for large institutional players to engage with digital assets naturally increases. This regulatory clarity is paving the way for more firms to consider Bitcoin a credible store of value . Moreover, the diversification benefits are proving increasingly irresistible. In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating market conditions, assets that move independently of traditional indices offer a valuable safety net. Bitcoin’s distinct market behavior provides a unique opportunity for asset managers like Allianz to enhance portfolio resilience and stability. Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Bitcoin Investment Allianz’s shift is not an isolated incident; it reflects a broader trend among major financial institutions re-evaluating their positions on digital assets. This growing institutional confidence can potentially lead to increased liquidity and stability in the Bitcoin market. However, it is important for investors to understand that while Bitcoin offers significant advantages, its market can still experience volatility. For individuals and institutions considering Bitcoin, this news from Allianz provides powerful validation. It underscores the importance of thorough research and a long-term perspective. As more traditional players acknowledge Bitcoin’s potential, its integration into the global financial system continues to deepen, solidifying its role as a Bitcoin credible store of value . Allianz’s remarkable change of heart regarding Bitcoin marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency’s journey towards mainstream acceptance. By recognizing Bitcoin as a credible store of value, one of the world’s largest insurers has sent a clear signal: digital assets are no longer a fringe investment but a serious contender in diversified portfolios. This move reinforces Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its enduring potential to reshape how we think about wealth preservation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Allianz change its stance on Bitcoin? A1: Allianz reversed its position due to Bitcoin’s deflationary design, decentralized governance, low correlation with traditional markets, and clearer global regulatory frameworks that support institutional adoption. Q2: What makes Bitcoin a “credible store of value” according to Allianz? A2: Allianz highlights Bitcoin’s fixed supply (deflationary), its independence from central control (decentralized), and its ability to act as a hedge against traditional market fluctuations due to low correlation. Q3: How does regulatory clarity impact institutional Bitcoin adoption? A3: Clearer regulations reduce uncertainty and risk for large financial institutions, making them more comfortable investing in and integrating digital assets like Bitcoin into their portfolios. Q4: What are the benefits of Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional markets? A4: A low correlation means Bitcoin’s price movements are often independent of traditional assets like stocks and gold. This characteristic offers valuable diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Q5: Does Allianz’s new position mean Bitcoin is risk-free? A5: No, Allianz’s recognition of Bitcoin as a credible store of value highlights its potential and legitimacy but does not eliminate market volatility or other associated risks. Investors should always conduct their own research. Did you find this insight into Allianz’s Bitcoin stance valuable?

A recent report shared that wealthy Asian investors are seeking to grow their digital asset portfolios. High-Net-Worth Investors Bet On Crypto Wealthy Asian families and family offices are reportedly planning to increase their cryptocurrency investments amid the bullish market, mainstream adoption, and positive regulatory developments in multiple jurisdictions, including the US and Hong Kong. In a Thursday report, Reuters revealed that high-net-worth Asian investors are seeking more exposure to crypto assets, with wealth managers receiving more inquiries, crypto funds seeing an increase in demand, and exchanges’ trading volumes surging. Jason Huang, founder of NextGen Digital Venture, told the news media outlet that they had raised over $100 million in just a few months for a new long-short crypto equity fund launched in May. He noted that the response from Limited Partners (LPs) that represent high-net-worth individuals “has been encouraging,” adding that his firm’s investors, which are mainly family offices and fintech entrepreneurs, recognize the “growing role of digital assets in diversified portfolios.” Swiss investment bank UBS said that some overseas Chinese family offices are looking to raise their crypto exposure to approximately 5% of their portfolio. Lu Zijie, head of wealth management at UBS China, shared that many second and third-generation members of multiple family offices are starting to learn about digital assets and how to participate. Meanwhile, some wealth managers highlighted a mindset shift among Asian clients over the last few years, moving from a small allocation to embracing the crypto sector as a “must-have” in their portfolios. Reportedly, investors are increasingly treating Bitcoin as a “portfolio diversifier” to protect themselves against macro uncertainties due to its low correlation with stocks and bonds. Zann Kwan, CIO at Singapore-based Revo Digital Family Office, affirmed that family offices “started to dip their feet” into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year following the approval of the crypto-based investment products in the US. “Now they have begun to learn the difference of holding a token directly,” he added. Asia’s Market Gains Momentum Reuters noted that the surging interest of Asian high-net-worth investors follows the recent market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 last week, as well as positive regulatory developments, including the enactment of the GENIUS Act in the US and the passage of Hong Kong’s stablecoin legislation. Cryptocurrency exchanges have also benefited from the increase in trading demand, with the number of registered users at Hong Kong’s HashKey exchange surging 85% year-on-year (YoY) by August. As reported by Bitcoinist, Hong Kong’s new stablecoin framework has sparked a frenzy of fundraising activity among fintech firms, raising around $1.5 billion via share placements to invest in stablecoins, blockchain payment systems, and digital assets. South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines are also experiencing high interest in Asian-pegged stablecoins despite authorities’ concerns of capital outflows, while Japan and China explore launching their stablecoins. Meanwhile, the broader stablecoin push has seen investors shift from US big tech stocks to crypto-related equities. Recent data revealed that South Korean individuals investing in overseas stocks have shifted from US big tech equities to crypto-linked stocks over the past two months, with increasing interest in stablecoin-related companies.",Crypto News|Asian crypto investors|bitcoin|Bitcoin Asian Investors|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto and South Korea|crypto exchanges|crypto market adoption|crypto market correction|Stablecoins|Wealthy investors,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|ASIA|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 08:00:07

Solana: Arthur Hayes Picks His Winner For This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum-vs-solana-arthur-hayes-winner-this-cycle/,"Arthur Hayes has a clear answer to the market’s favorite bar fight. In an August 21 interview with Ran Neuner, the BitMEX co-founder said both Ethereum and Solana will rally hard, but he is explicitly tilted toward ETH for the remainder of the cycle. “Do I believe Solana is going to go up? Absolutely it’s going to go up. Do I believe it’s going to go up more than ETH? I don’t know. Probably not,” Hayes said. When pressed on portfolio construction, he didn’t hedge: “In terms of a position… you’d be more overweight ETH? Correct. Yes.” Ethereum Vs. Solana: Who Wins This Cycle? Neuner framed the context that has flipped the conversation from “Solana-only” to an Ethereum-led trade, citing a sequence of catalysts—from stablecoins to marquee advocates—that has turned ETH into “the darling asset of Wall Street.” Hayes didn’t contest the premise. Instead, he described the contest between the two chains as a “race” increasingly defined by the scale of capital now zeroing in on Ethereum: “ETH is a bigger asset to move, but there’s a lot of money chasing it. So it’s going to be [an] interesting race.” In other words, size is not a bug if flows are thick enough; it’s the feature that channels the largest bid. Related Reading: Altseason Things: Ethereum Perps Volume Sets New Record Against Bitcoin That flows-first view also explains why Hayes sees ETH’s upside accelerating once resistance is convincingly cleared. Responding to Neuner’s observation that Bitcoin sits well above its prior all-time high while ETH had been “struggling to break,” Hayes raised his sights beyond catch-up toward open-ended momentum: “I think ETH goes to $10,000 [or] 20,000 before the end of the cycle… once it’s broken through, then… it’s a gap of air to the upside.” He added that on shorter time frames, “the chart says it’s going higher now,” noting he had “bought back some of the ETH” he previously sold. None of this means Hayes is bearish on Solana. He disclosed he advises Upexi, a Nasdaq-listed company with a Solana-focused treasury, and reiterated his expectation that SOL will benefit from the same risk-on currents: “They’re both going to go up. The question is which one goes up more.” But even with that proximity to the Solana ecosystem, he returned to the relative case: “Do I believe [Solana]’s going to go up more than ETH?… Probably not.” Related Reading: Whale Loads Up $300M Ethereum Onchain: Did He Just Catch The Bottom? Neuner summarized the narrative shift bluntly—ETH “caught this massive Wall Street narrative,” with stablecoins, tokenized assets and high-profile champions such as Joseph Lubin and Tom Lee putting a megaphone behind Ethereum, after a period when “it’s a SOL cycle” dominated discourse. Hayes’ answer was not to relitigate the tech stack—Neuner even joked about Solana as the “fast monolithic chain”—but to anchor the ETH-over-SOL call in the mechanics of capital formation and passive demand now assembling around Ethereum’s market structure. In his telling, as institutional vehicles and public ETH treasury companies marshal fresh inflows, the “bigger asset to move” becomes the natural sink for the thickest flows. Hayes’ comparative view therefore rests on three on-record pillars. First, positioning: he is overweight ETH versus SOL on a percentage basis. Second, flows: he expects more money to chase ETH in this phase of the cycle, despite (and because of) its larger base. Third, trajectory: once ETH sustains a breakout, he sees “the sky’s the limit” dynamics taking over, with a cycle target of $10,000–$20,000 for ETH. The respect for Solana’s upside remains, but the winner—on Hayes’ numbers and his own book—is Ethereum. At press time, ETH traded at $4,285.

Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, has taken a firm stance, ordering a mandatory Binance Australia audit . This isn’t just a routine check; it stems from “serious concerns” regarding the exchange’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls. For many, this raises crucial questions about regulatory oversight in the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Why is AUSTRAC Demanding a Binance Australia Audit? AUSTRAC, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, recently identified significant issues within Binance’s local operations. According to a Bloomberg report, the regulator found the exchange’s previous independent review to be insufficient for an entity of its size and risk profile. This isn’t a minor administrative hiccup; it points to fundamental weaknesses that could have broader implications. The concerns highlighted by AUSTRAC include: High staff turnover: A fluctuating workforce can impede the consistent application of compliance protocols. Insufficient local resources: Lack of adequate personnel and tools to manage regulatory requirements effectively. Weak senior management oversight: A critical gap in ensuring that robust AML/CTF measures are not just in place, but actively enforced and monitored from the top down. These findings collectively led AUSTRAC to give Binance Australia a strict 28-day deadline to nominate external auditors, underscoring the urgency of the situation. What Does an External Audit Mean for Binance Australia? An external audit, particularly one mandated by a regulator, is a comprehensive and independent examination of an organization’s financial records, internal controls, and operational processes. For Binance Australia, this means a deep dive into its AML and CTF frameworks. The appointed auditors will scrutinize every aspect to ensure compliance with Australia’s stringent financial regulations. This process aims to: Identify specific vulnerabilities in existing controls. Recommend actionable improvements to strengthen compliance. Restore confidence in the exchange’s ability to operate responsibly within the regulatory landscape. Ultimately, a successful Binance Australia audit could pave the way for a more secure and compliant operational future, benefiting both the exchange and its users. Broader Implications for Crypto Regulation and Compliance This regulatory action against Binance Australia sends a clear message across the global cryptocurrency industry. Regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinizing digital asset exchanges, emphasizing the importance of robust compliance frameworks. This incident highlights a growing trend: the era of “move fast and break things” in crypto is steadily giving way to an era of “move cautiously and comply thoroughly.” It underscores that: Regulatory maturity is evolving: Governments are developing more sophisticated tools and understanding to oversee the crypto sector. Compliance is non-negotiable: Exchanges must invest significantly in AML/CTF resources, regardless of their size. Transparency is key: Regular, independent reviews are becoming standard practice to build trust and ensure accountability. The outcome of this Binance Australia audit will likely influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto exchange oversight. What’s Next for Binance Australia and Its Users? For Binance Australia, the immediate priority is to comply fully with AUSTRAC’s order. This involves not only appointing qualified external auditors but also cooperating transparently throughout the review process. The findings of the audit will dictate the next steps, which could range from implementing new controls to potential penalties if significant breaches are uncovered. For users of Binance Australia, while this news might seem concerning, it ultimately aims to enhance the security and integrity of their funds and transactions. Stronger AML/CTF controls protect users from illicit activities and foster a more trustworthy trading environment. Users should stay informed about official announcements from both Binance Australia and AUSTRAC. This situation serves as a vital reminder that regulatory compliance is not merely a bureaucratic hurdle but a fundamental pillar for the long-term sustainability and mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. The diligent completion of the Binance Australia audit will be a critical step in reaffirming the exchange’s commitment to responsible operation within Australia’s financial ecosystem. Summary: AUSTRAC’s order for an external Binance Australia audit is a significant development, highlighting the growing global focus on robust AML/CTF compliance within the crypto industry. This move underscores the importance of strong internal controls, adequate resources, and senior management oversight for digital asset exchanges. While presenting immediate challenges for Binance Australia, it ultimately aims to strengthen the integrity and trustworthiness of the Australian crypto market, setting a precedent for regulatory expectations worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions About the Binance Australia Audit What is AUSTRAC and why are they involved? AUSTRAC is the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, Australia’s financial intelligence agency. They are responsible for monitoring financial transactions to detect and prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, and other serious crimes. Their involvement ensures that crypto exchanges like Binance Australia adhere to these critical national security standards. What are “serious concerns” regarding AML/CTF controls? AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and CTF (Counter-Terrorism Financing) controls are measures financial institutions use to prevent illicit funds from being processed. “Serious concerns” indicate that AUSTRAC believes Binance Australia’s existing systems might be inadequate to effectively identify, report, and mitigate the risks associated with money laundering and terrorism financing activities. Who will conduct the external audit for Binance Australia? Binance Australia has been given 28 days to nominate external auditors. These auditors will be independent third-party firms specializing in financial compliance and regulatory reviews, chosen to ensure an unbiased and thorough examination of Binance’s operations. How might this audit affect Binance Australia users? While the audit is ongoing, users might not experience direct immediate changes to their services. However, in the long term, a successful audit is expected to lead to stronger compliance measures, enhancing the security and integrity of the platform for all users by reducing the risk of illicit activities. Is this an isolated incident, or part of a larger trend? This action is part of a broader global trend where financial regulators are increasing their scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges. Governments worldwide are working to integrate digital asset services into existing financial regulatory frameworks, emphasizing compliance and consumer protection. Found this article insightful?

The incident occurred on Tuesday, August 19, 2025, at 11:06 UTC, according to blockchain investigator ZachXBT. The victim was tricked by fraudsters posing as customer support for a major crypto exchange and a hardware wallet provider. Believing the impostors were legitimate, the investor shared access credentials, enabling the scammers to drain 783 Bitcoin from the wallet within minutes. ZachXBT revealed the theft on X Thursday, calling it one of the largest Bitcoin losses caused by a social engineering attack. Notably, the wallet address that first received the stolen funds appeared “clean,” showing no prior links to hacks or illicit activity—suggesting the attacker carefully planned the heist to avoid immediate detection. Launderer hides trail with privacy wallet The thief quickly moved to hide their tracks. A day after the $91 million heist, the stolen Bitcoin began flowing into Wasabi Wallet , a well-known Bitcoin privacy tool. Using Wasabi’s CoinJoin feature, the funds were bundled with other users’ transactions, scrambled, and redistributed. This process makes it difficult to match the original inputs with outputs, creating a smokescreen that complicates investigators’ efforts to follow the trail from victim to thief. The tactic is a familiar one. Blockchain analysts say the goal is clear: launder the coins until they appear clean and sizable enough to offload through exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) brokers without drawing suspicion. So far, the laundering is ongoing. Small amounts are being siphoned off from the main stash, likely as test runs to check whether exchanges or services block the funds. If not, larger moves may follow. Interestingly, blockchain investigator ZachXBT ruled out the Lazarus Group , North Korea’s notorious state-backed hackers responsible for some of the biggest crypto heists in history. Instead, he attributed the theft to independent scammers — individuals or loose groups skilled in impersonation and social engineering rather than advanced cyberattacks. The timing of the heist also fueled speculation. It happened exactly one year after the $243 million theft targeting Genesis creditors in 2024. While no evidence links the two, the anniversary sparked debate online, with some suggesting it was intentional symbolism and others calling it a coincidence. For many in the crypto space, the theft underscores a troubling truth: while Bitcoin operates on a transparent public ledger, privacy tools still offer criminals powerful ways to erase their digital fingerprints. Social-engineering scams surge in 2025 The attack underscores the increasing threat of social engineering scams. Rather than relying on technical vulnerabilities, these attacks trick the victims into providing sensitive data, such as passwords, recovery phrases, or private keys. Recently, scammers have pretended to be trusted crypto companies such as hardware-wallet firms like Ledger and Trezor. A few had tried to send fake letters and emails, saying there were “critical security updates” that required users to hand over their recovery phrases. The strategies are growing more sophisticated. In April 2025, fraudsters mailed out fraudulent physical letters to U.S. people who own cryptocurrency. The letters falsely warned that wallets would be disabled unless users responded right away. Those who complied lost everything. Earlier this year, an elderly American lost more than $330 million worth of Bitcoin to a similar scheme. Crypto-related thefts continue to climb. Security firm CertiK said in June that hacks, scams, and exploits stole over $3.1 billion in the first five months of 2025 alone. The value stolen year-to-date was 17% higher through the end of June than at the same point in 2022. If the pace continues, stolen services will add up to more than $4 billion for the entire year, representing a clear escalation of theft amounts. Individual compromised wallets now constitute 23.35% of the stolen amount, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan . Now, the focus of hackers is shifting towards personal users rather than exchanges, and around $8.5 billion worth of stolen crypto is currently on chain and being held for laundering.

50482462,562957,1755850092,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50482462.jpeg,A CBDC Ban in the US? Here’s Why Best Wallet and $Best Could Be Winners,https://bitcoinist.com/did-us-ban-cbdcs-and-why-best-token-gains/,"In a surprising move, the U.S. House of Representatives has slipped a provision to ban central bank digital currencies (CBDC) into a massive, 1,300-page defense policy bill. This new legislative move, a revision of the House’s version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) , aims to stop the Federal Reserve from ‘testing, studying, developing, creating, or implementing’ a digital currency. The House has already passed a similar bill, the ‘ Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act ,’ but its future in the Senate is really shaky. Putting it in the NDAA is a smart way to try and guarantee it becomes law. In a crypto context where privacy and digital security are at the forefront, new projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) are seeing broad adoption and presale attention. Read on for the full context and Best Wallet’s simplified self-custody app for crypto and Web3. D.C. Drama: How a Crypto Ban Hijacked a Defense Bill The decision to add the CBDC ban to the defense bill was the result of some serious political bargaining. Recent GOP infighting had stalled three crypto bills . Some Republican hard-liners wanted a guarantee that a CBDC ban would be included in the must-pass military spending legislation. This led to a nine-hour standoff, the longest in House history, that only ended when House Majority Leader Steve Scalise promised to include the CBDC ban in the NDAA . This new provision would not only stop the Fed from issuing digital currency but also prevent it from offering financial services directly to people. The bill does, however, make an important exception for stablecoins, defining them as ‘open, permissionless, and private’ digital currencies. This latest move shows just how determined House Republicans are to stop a CBDC from ever seeing the light of day. If the ban on CBDCs comes to fruition, then freedom-first and user-control-first solutions like Best Wallet should flourish, bringing increased attention to Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , one of the best crypto presales this year. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): Governance Crypto, DeFi Upgrade, and a 15M+ Presale Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has a booming crypto presale.

Your Crypto, Your Control: Why This Matters With the future of a U.S. central bank digital currency hanging in the balance, the stage is set for a major shift in the digital finance world.

And cryptos like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) are highlighting the advantages even more. This whole debate just proves how important it is for you to do your own research and understand the tech and politics that will shape your financial future. This article isn’t financial advice.

This monumental “custodial flippening,” highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnChain, marks a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, signaling its evolution into a truly mainstream institutional asset. What Does This “Custodial Flippening” Signify for Bitcoin? This development is more than just a change in rankings; it reflects a fundamental reorientation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. As of August, IBIT reportedly holds an astounding 781,160 BTC. This volume means that institutional ETFs are now driving a significant portion of Bitcoin demand, moving beyond the traditional retail exchange landscape. Institutional Shift: Traditional financial giants are now the primary holders of large Bitcoin quantities. Demand Driver: ETFs are becoming the dominant force in shaping Bitcoin’s market dynamics. Accessibility: Institutional vehicles like IBIT offer a regulated and familiar pathway for large-scale investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The role of a Bitcoin custodian is crucial, as they are responsible for securely storing and managing large amounts of Bitcoin on behalf of their clients. BlackRock, with its extensive experience in asset management, brings a new level of trust and infrastructure to this role. The Astounding Rise of Institutional Interest in Bitcoin BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin space through its spot ETF, IBIT, has legitimized Bitcoin in the eyes of many traditional investors and institutions. This move has paved the way for unprecedented capital inflow, demonstrating a strong appetite for digital assets within conventional finance. For years, many financial advisors and large funds hesitated to invest directly in cryptocurrencies due to perceived risks, lack of regulation, and complex custody requirements. However, ETFs like IBIT simplify this process dramatically: Simplified Access: Investors can buy shares in IBIT through their regular brokerage accounts, avoiding the complexities of direct crypto purchases and wallet management. Enhanced Security: BlackRock employs robust security measures and complies with stringent financial regulations, offering a secure environment for Bitcoin holdings. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by regulators has provided a clear framework, boosting investor confidence. This institutional embrace signifies that Bitcoin is no longer a niche asset. It is transforming into a recognized component of diversified investment portfolios, with a leading Bitcoin custodian at the forefront. Navigating the Centralization Debate: A New Era for Bitcoin Custody? While the institutional adoption of Bitcoin brings significant benefits, it also introduces valid concerns about centralization. When a small number of Wall Street entities, such as BlackRock, control a substantial portion of the circulating Bitcoin supply, it raises questions about the fundamental decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. Critics argue that such concentration could lead to: Market Influence: Large custodians might exert undue influence on Bitcoin’s price and market direction. Single Points of Failure: Although BlackRock is highly secure, any large centralized holding carries inherent risks. Reduced Decentralization: The very essence of Bitcoin, designed to be permissionless and distributed, could be diluted if too much power consolidates with a few players. Understanding the implications of a dominant Bitcoin custodian is essential. It requires a balanced perspective, weighing the benefits of broader adoption against the potential for increased centralization. The community continues to monitor these developments closely. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Its Custodial Landscape? The “custodial flippening” by IBIT is likely just the beginning of a larger trend. We can anticipate more institutional players entering the Bitcoin ETF market, further solidifying its position within traditional finance. This competition could lead to innovations in custody solutions and potentially more diversified holdings across different institutional custodians. For investors, this shift means: Continued Maturation: Bitcoin is evolving into a mature asset class, attracting more diverse capital. Market Stability: Institutional involvement often brings greater stability, though volatility remains a characteristic of crypto markets. Informed Decisions: Stay informed about which entities are becoming significant Bitcoin custodian players and what their strategies entail. The future of Bitcoin custody will undoubtedly be a dynamic space, balancing the need for secure, regulated storage with the community’s desire for decentralization. Conclusion: BlackRock’s IBIT becoming the largest Bitcoin custodian marks a truly historic moment. It underscores Bitcoin’s journey from a fringe digital asset to a recognized institutional investment. While this shift brings undeniable legitimacy and capital, it also ignites important conversations about centralization and the future direction of the crypto ecosystem. This custodial flippening is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and its continuous evolution in the global financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for IBIT to be the largest Bitcoin custodian? A1: It means BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holds more Bitcoin on behalf of its investors than any other known entity, including major cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. This signifies a significant shift towards institutional custody. Q2: How much Bitcoin does IBIT currently hold? A2: As of August, BlackRock’s IBIT was reported to hold approximately 781,160 BTC, making it the dominant Bitcoin custodian. Q3: Why is this “custodial flippening” important for Bitcoin? A3: This event highlights Bitcoin’s increasing mainstream adoption and institutionalization. It indicates that traditional financial vehicles like ETFs are now major drivers of demand and custody, bringing more legitimacy and capital into the crypto market. Q4: Does institutional custody lead to centralization concerns for Bitcoin? A4: Yes, while institutional involvement brings benefits like security and regulatory clarity, it also raises concerns about centralization. When a few large entities control a significant portion of Bitcoin, it can lead to questions about market influence and the decentralized nature of the asset. Q5: What are the benefits of investing in a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT? A5: Investing in a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT offers simplified access for traditional investors, enhanced security through regulated custodians, and regulatory clarity, allowing them to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges.

The Federal Reserve chair faces stubborn inflation , weaker job data , and mounting political pressure . His message will not only influence traditional markets but could also sway risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Markets expect Powell to hint at a September rate cut, but his tone is crucial. A dovish message could reassure investors and spark rallies across equities and crypto. On the other hand, if Powell sounds cautious or sticks to a tougher stance against inflation, volatility may return quickly. Beyond short-term moves, Powell is also expected to defend the Fed’s independence as political attacks intensify. Any mention of long-term changes to the Fed’s policy framework may shape his legacy well beyond his tenure. For crypto traders, this is a classic “wait and see” moment. If Powell signals easier conditions, Bitcoin and other digital assets may benefit from renewed risk appetite.

In a recent interview, the influential investor also disclosed a strategic preference for ETH over its rival, Solana (SOL). Hayes Shifts From Caution to Confidence In early August, Hayes sold over $8 million worth of ETH alongside PEPE and ENA, saying he was expecting a correction in the market due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and ongoing global tensions. At the time, he projected the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could retreat toward $3,000. However, that view quickly unraveled, with ETH surging past $4,000, forcing Hayes to buy it back after the asset pumped 20% in a week. By mid-August, the crypto entrepreneur had added more than 1,700 ETH to his stash, worth over $8 million, alongside several trending altcoins, including HYPE and LDO. In this latest interview, he explained why he repurchased the cryptocurrency despite taking profits earlier: “I bought back some of the ETH that I sold,” he admitted. “The chart says it’s going higher. So I can’t fight the market. I think ETH goes $10, $20,000 before the end of the cycle.” The Maelstrom CIO suggested that once Ethereum convincingly clears its all-time high, “it’s a gap of air to the upside.” In addition, he pointed to how crypto-native companies are raising funds to buy the asset. “It’s gonna be even easier to raise money if the asset they’re buying has just broken through its all-time high and it’s just sending upwards. So I think that the sky’s the limit.” He also tied his forecast to broader macro trends, noting that political and economic dynamics in the U.S. could fuel risk assets, arguing that any financial asset Trump backs and believes is important will go on a massive bull run between now and when he leaves office. Ethereum vs. Solana The interview also touched on the rivalry between Ethereum and Solana, with Hayes asked which he would back over the current cycle. “They’re both gonna go up,” he said. “The question is, which one goes up more?” Pressed further, he confirmed, “Correct,” when asked if he would be more overweight on ETH than SOL. At the market, Ethereum is currently trading at $4,288 per CoinGecko, slightly down by 0.2% in the last 24 hours and a more noticeable 7.4% over the past week. However, it is still up 14.8% in the past month, even as the price remains 12% below its November 2021 all-time high of $4,878. Meanwhile, Solana has slipped 2.4% in 24 hours and 6% over the last seven days to $183. The token has struggled to maintain momentum after peaking at $293 in January, leaving it down nearly 37% from that high. But looking at it on a monthly scale, the asset remains in positive territory with a modest 5.1% gain.

Fast forward to today, and the crypto community is buzzing about a new token, Little Pepe ($LILPEPE), which could potentially replicate Solana's success. Introducing $LILPEPE, the New Contender Designed as a Layer 2 blockchain solution, Little Pepe aims to revolutionize meme cryptocurrencies by not only offering ultra-low transaction fees and enhanced security but also rapid transaction finality that could even rival some of the quickest tech giants. Unlike many meme-based tokens, $LILPEPE boasts robust security as evidenced by its high scoring CertiK audit . Current Token Sale and Investment Opportunities The presale of $LILPEPE has been progressing at an astonishing pace, with the token price currently at $0.0020. Early investors have seen significant returns, with analysts predicting potential gains of up to 10,000%. This kind of upside is not only rare but could set up $LILPEPE as the breakout star of this cryptocurrency cycle. Community and Marketing Initiatives Little Pepe's roadmap is community-focused, highlighting phases such as 'Pregnancy' and 'Birth' where the project will develop through several strategic stages. From presales and partnerships to wide-scale launches anticipated on platforms like Uniswap, the strategic development is designed to fuel both growth and market cap. An exciting component of their marketing campaign is the enticing $777K giveaway , which is already drawing vast attention with over 220,000 entries. Vesting and Token Economics Little Pepe is committed to fairness in its token distribution. Presale tokens are locked up initially, releasing gradually to prevent market dumping and ensure stability. This strategy aims to foster trust and long-term holder commitment. Comparative Analysis: Solana and Little Pepe While Solana's fast technology and infrastructure built for DeFi and NFTs made headlines in 2021, Little Pepe is carving out its niche with a focus on memes and fast transaction capabilities, starting from a zero market cap. The differences highlight Little Pepe's potential to offer explosive returns similar to or exceeding those Solana once did. Engagement and Further Information For those looking to explore this burgeoning cryptocurrency, more information can be found on Little Pepe's official website and detailed insights in their whitepaper .

Over the past day, PENGU underperformed the broader market with a 2.42% decline while the market slipped only 0.32%. At press time, the token traded around $0.031 with a 24-hour range between $0.03008 and $0.03194. Notably, PENGU’s price drop comes amid a choppy stretch in Ethereum (ETH) and a pullback in NFT marketplace activity that has clipped risk appetite. NFT market decline weighs on PENGU Ethereum’s decline last week triggered a notable drop in NFT valuations, shaving billions off sector-wide capitalisation. Pudgy Penguins, despite climbing in profile and even overtaking Bored Apes in market cap rankings, were not spared from the slowdown. Trading volumes across blue-chip NFT collections fell, highlighting a cautious mood among investors. Seeing that PENGU remains tied to the health of the NFT space, its valuation continues to reflect broader market fragility. Rising competition from new meme coins At the same time, speculative attention has shifted to newer meme assets. Bitcoin Penguins , a Solana-based project, quickly drew investors with its branding and lower market cap. This diverted capital away from PENGU, cutting its daily trading volumes by more than a third. The rotation illustrates the challenge established tokens face in keeping momentum when fresh alternatives attract traders hunting for outsized gains. Technical analysis paints a cautious outlook PENGU’s chart reveals a period of consolidation around its $0.028 to $0.030 support zone. The breakdown below short-term moving averages initially added to selling pressure, but oversold conditions hint at a possible rebound. Technical indicators, such as the MACD, have turned negative, suggesting a waning momentum. However, the appearance of reversal patterns, including a Morning Star formation and a TD Sequential buy signal , has brought renewed optimism among analysts. A potential breakout if support holds Recent sessions show PENGU holding steady near $0.032, climbing almost 10% in 24 hours and outperforming larger meme coins like DOGE and SHIB. Market analysis now points to $0.033 as a level to confirm strength, with upside targets stretching to $0.048 and the psychological $0.05 mark. According to the renowned analyst, KALEO, a sustained move higher could even mirror PENGU’s June–July breakout, when similar consolidation led to an explosive rally.

The upcoming Jackson Hole Speech by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is one such event that often sends ripples far beyond traditional finance, potentially influencing everything from bond yields to Bitcoin’s trajectory. As the US Dollar strength continues to build ahead of this pivotal address, crypto investors are keenly watching for clues that could dictate the next market move. Jackson Hole Speech: Why Does This Annual Gathering Matter So Much? Every August, the quiet mountain retreat of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, transforms into a global economic hotspot. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City hosts its annual Economic Policy Symposium here, attracting central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world. While the setting is serene, the discussions are anything but. Historically, this symposium has served as a critical platform for central bank leaders, particularly the Federal Reserve Chair, to signal significant shifts in monetary policy or offer nuanced insights into the economic outlook. These pronouncements can have immediate and profound effects on global markets, including the Forex market . A Stage for Policy Shifts: From Ben Bernanke’s hint at quantitative easing in 2010 to Janet Yellen’s discussions on inflation, and Jerome Powell’s recent pronouncements, Jackson Hole has often been the launchpad for major policy discussions. Global Implications: What the Fed Chair says at Jackson Hole isn’t just about the US economy; it reverberates across international markets, influencing currency valuations, commodity prices, and investor sentiment worldwide. Forward Guidance: It provides invaluable forward guidance on the Fed’s thinking regarding inflation, employment, and interest rates, offering a glimpse into future policy decisions. Unpacking US Dollar Strength: What’s Driving the Greenback’s Ascent? In the days leading up to Powell’s Jackson Hole address, the US Dollar strength has been a prominent feature in currency markets. This upward trend isn’t accidental; it’s a confluence of several powerful macroeconomic factors: Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global economic uncertainty or geopolitical tension, the US Dollar traditionally acts as a safe haven. Investors flock to US assets, particularly Treasury bonds, pushing up demand for the dollar. Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hiking cycle over the past year has made dollar-denominated assets more attractive compared to those in other major economies where central banks might be perceived as less hawkish or further behind in their tightening cycles. Higher yields on US bonds and savings accounts draw capital, increasing dollar demand. Resilient US Economy: Despite fears of a recession, recent economic data from the United States has often surprised to the upside, showing resilience in employment and consumer spending. This relative strength compared to some other major economies, particularly in Europe and China, makes the US a more appealing investment destination. Market Positioning: Traders often position themselves ahead of major events. Anticipation of potentially hawkish remarks from Jerome Powell or a continuation of the “higher for longer” narrative for interest rates encourages dollar buying. The interplay of these factors creates a robust environment for the greenback, making it a critical asset to monitor for anyone involved in global finance, including the crypto space where dollar strength can sometimes weigh on risk assets. Jerome Powell’s Pivotal Role: What to Expect from the Fed Chair? All eyes and ears will be on Jerome Powell as he takes the podium at Jackson Hole. His words carry immense weight, capable of shifting market sentiment in an instant. The primary focus will be on any signals regarding the future trajectory of interest rates and the Fed’s overall stance on inflation. Investors will be scrutinizing his speech for: Inflation Outlook: Will he reiterate the Fed’s commitment to bringing inflation down to its 2% target, even if it means further economic tightening? Or will he acknowledge recent disinflationary trends and suggest a more cautious approach? Future Rate Hikes: The market is divided on whether the Fed will implement another rate hike this year. Powell’s speech could provide clues, either reinforcing the possibility of further tightening or hinting at a prolonged pause. Economic Growth Projections: How does the Fed view the current state of the US economy? Will he acknowledge the resilience or express concerns about potential headwinds? “Higher for Longer” Narrative: This phrase has dominated discussions recently. Will Powell double down on the idea that rates will need to stay elevated for an extended period, even if further hikes are off the table? This has significant implications for borrowing costs and investment decisions. The tone of his speech—whether decidedly hawkish, cautiously optimistic, or dovish—will be paramount. A hawkish stance could further bolster the US Dollar strength and potentially weigh on risk assets like cryptocurrencies, while a more dovish tone could provide some relief. Federal Reserve Policy: Navigating the Future of Interest Rates The direction of Federal Reserve policy is arguably the single most influential factor for global financial markets. Since early 2022, the Fed has embarked on an aggressive campaign to tame inflation through rapid interest rate increases. The upcoming Jackson Hole speech is expected to offer crucial insights into the next phase of this policy. Consider the potential scenarios for future Fed policy: Policy Stance Potential Implications Hawkish (More Hikes/Strong “Higher for Longer”) Further boost to US Dollar, potential pressure on equities and crypto, increased borrowing costs, risk of economic slowdown. Neutral (Extended Pause/Data-Dependent) Dollar might consolidate, markets may find some stability, focus shifts heavily to incoming economic data. Dovish (Hints at Future Cuts/Softer Tone) Dollar likely to weaken, potential rally in risk assets (equities, crypto), reduced borrowing costs, increased liquidity. The Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability means that every policy decision is a delicate balancing act. Powell’s challenge will be to communicate the Fed’s path forward without causing undue market volatility, while still ensuring inflation remains on a downward trend. The implications for the Forex market , bond yields, and ultimately, the broader investment landscape, are immense. Forex Market Dynamics: How Will Currencies React? The Forex market , the world’s largest and most liquid financial market, is already pricing in a certain degree of anticipation for Powell’s speech. As the US Dollar strength has been a key theme, other major currencies have felt the pressure. Here’s how different currency pairs might react: USD/JPY: A hawkish Powell could see the dollar strengthen further against the Japanese Yen, especially given the Bank of Japan’s continued ultra-loose monetary policy. EUR/USD: The Euro has been struggling against the dollar. A strong dollar narrative from Powell would likely push EUR/USD lower, while a more dovish tone could offer the Euro some breathing room. GBP/USD: Similar to the Euro, the British Pound could face renewed selling pressure if the dollar strengthens, though the Bank of England’s own inflation battle adds complexity. Emerging Market Currencies: A strong dollar typically spells trouble for emerging market currencies. It makes dollar-denominated debt more expensive to service and can lead to capital outflows. Traders will be particularly attentive to interest rate differentials and carry trade opportunities. If the US maintains significantly higher rates than other major economies, it incentivizes investors to borrow in low-yield currencies and invest in higher-yield dollar assets, further supporting the dollar. This dynamic, driven by Federal Reserve policy , is a powerful force in the currency world. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Jackson Hole Aftermath As the Jackson Hole symposium approaches, what can investors, particularly those in the crypto space, do to prepare? Stay Informed: Closely follow live coverage and analyses of Powell’s speech. The initial reaction can be volatile, but the underlying message is key. Watch the Dollar Index (DXY): The DXY measures the dollar’s value against a basket of six major currencies. A rising DXY often signals broader dollar strength, which can be a headwind for risk assets. Assess Risk Appetite: A hawkish Fed generally dampens risk appetite, leading investors to pull back from more speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a dovish pivot could reignite interest. Diversification and Hedging: Consider how your portfolio is positioned. For crypto investors, understanding the dollar’s trajectory is crucial for managing exposure to highly correlated assets. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility is likely, focus on the long-term implications of Fed policy for inflation, economic growth, and the overall investment environment. The decisions and rhetoric coming out of Jackson Hole will not only shape the immediate future of the Forex market but will also influence the broader economic landscape, creating both challenges and opportunities for discerning investors. Conclusion: The Unfolding Narrative of Global Finance The impending Jackson Hole Speech by Jerome Powell is more than just an annual event; it’s a critical juncture for global financial markets. As the US Dollar strength continues to be a dominant force, driven by expectations surrounding Federal Reserve policy , the world watches with bated breath. The insights shared will undoubtedly steer the direction of the Forex market and ripple through every corner of the investment world, including the ever-evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Understanding these macro currents is essential for making informed decisions in an increasingly interconnected global economy.

Nevertheless, the conversation on crypto forums is shifting. Traders are beginning to contrast the payments focus of XRP with Remittix (RTX) , a presale token that costs just $0.0969 per token, which is developing as one of the most promising DeFi projects for 2025. XRP price vs future payment initiatives While XRP Price is grabbing the headlines with its predicted move to $10, initiatives like Remittix are in the background, building the pipes for the next generation of blockchain adoption. In contrast to meme coins and arbitrage plays, Remittix is developing actual real-world issues: cross-border payments, crypto-to-fiat conversion, and seamless integration with centralised exchanges as well as decentralised platforms. The latest project broke a major presale record, securing over $20.6 million with more than 612 million tokens sold. This prompted its first publicly confirmed CEX listing on BitMart, a milestone that adds liquidity and makes the token accessible to more worldwide users. The strategic edge driving Remittix adoption Being a payment-first company, Remittix is solving inefficiencies in the $19 trillion world payments market. Its Q3 2025 beta wallet launch is core to this approach, giving users the ability to remit cryptocurrency to bank accounts in 30+ countries with instant FX conversion. The initiative is gaining recognition as more than a token sale. With audited security measures, open book tokenomics, and strong community interest, RTX is set to become an evident top contender on the list of best crypto presales for 2025. Global reach with direct bank deposits Mobile-first wallet being released in Q3 Over $20.6Million raised in presale First CEX listing announced $250,000 giveaway now live A utility-driven altcoin to watch Unlike the story of the XRP Price pump, Remittix is a different type of growth. Instead of hype, it is being built to be used — filling the gap between crypto holders and regular payments. For that reason, it is a leading candidate in discussions about the next big altcoin in 2025 or the best DeFi projects for long-term usage. Early-stage investors are sitting up and taking notice of RTX not only because of its token price of $0.0969, but also because of its roadmap. With presale traction, future integration into wallets, and continuous exchange partnerships, Remittix is setting itself up as a crypto with real-world utility. For investors considering where to invest in July 2025, investments like Remittix can offer exposure beyond the mere market hype — combining cross-chain DeFi economics with the convenience of central exchanges.

Creditors claimed that their personal information was leaked in a 2023 data breach, exposing them to phishing attacks. The lawsuit was submitted on Tuesday by Hall Attorneys representing FTX customer Jacob Repko and other affected parties, in a US court for the Western District of Austin, Texas. According to court documents, the breach occurred on or about August 19, 2023, when an unauthorized third party got a hold of a mobile phone number belonging to a Kroll employee. After obtaining the contact, the hackers used it to infiltrate Kroll’s cloud-based systems and obtain files containing sensitive creditor data including customer names, home addresses, email addresses, and balances in the fallen crypto trading platform’s accounts. Kroll issues notice for data breach Kroll confirmed the breach in a notice to creditors, insisting that no FTX passwords or digital assets were compromised. “The attacker might use this information in a further scam, for example, by sending phishing emails to trick you into providing sensitive personal information,” Kroll said at the time. The firm added that other accounts and systems were not impacted and that FTX assets were unaffected. However, Hall attorneys claim the breach has exposed creditors to scam emails and direct financial losses. Repko, the lead plaintiff, told the court that he lost 1.9 ETH in July 2025 after a phishing attack diverted funds he was attempting to transfer into his digital wallet. The complaint also mentioned there were operational problems with the FTX Customer Claims Portal. According to Repko, his Know Your Customer (KYC) status repeatedly toggled between “Verified” and “On Hold/Unverified,” preventing him from uploading the necessary tax forms required for distributions. Per the plaintiff, even after making multiple attempts and writing dozens of support emails, he was unable to resolve the issue. “Because the FTX Portal gates tax-form upload behind ‘KYC Verified,’ Plaintiff cannot complete the final prerequisites; under the confirmed plan and trust communications, claims may be expunged or distributions forfeited if tax forms are not timely uploaded,” the filing read. Daily phishing complaints from creditors According to a Thursday X post made by FTX creditor and activist Sunil Kavuri, creditors have been receiving scam emails nearly every day. Kavuri shared one message he received with his name embedded in the message, alongside several phishing attempts between August 14 and as recent as last Sunday. FTX Creditors now daily receive scam emails impersonating FTX, Bahamas. Just received one few hours ago Full name is included Nicholas has filed a class action for the alleged data breach at Kroll https://t.co/kILxhygv90 pic.twitter.com/GcpEn2pu1I — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) August 21, 2025 Other users joined Kavuri with incidents of their own phishing attempt experiences, with one responding that they had also received similar fraudulent messages. The class action demands Kroll to make systemic changes in how it handles creditor’s information, such as including multi-channel notices through both email and physical mail, mailed status-change letters with mandatory cure windows, and the option for creditors to upload tax forms manually without KYC gating. “ This is a servicing case, after a known security incident and impersonation wave, you can’t run deadlines on email-only and offer no mailed confirmations or manual fallback ,” wrote Nicholas Hall, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, in a press statement. Hall also said that eligible participants could receive monetary compensation depending on the court’s ruling, and the case could force operational changes at Kroll. His firm, Hall Attorneys, also operates the beleaguered exchange’s claims website and provides assistance to creditors managing their claims. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

This milestone completes the company’s multi-phase restructuring strategy focused on modernization, compliance readiness, and real-world asset integration. Key Token Details Token Name: Maya Preferred PRA – Preferred Class Regulated Security Token Symbol: SMPRA Total Supply: 23,000,000 (reduced from 200,000,000 MPRA an 88.5% cut) Public Float: Capped at 1,000,000 for the life of the project, never to increase Ownership Impact: ~770% increase in ownership value per token Retirement Plan Program recipients will receive the new Maya Preferred Retirement Plan Program Wrapped Token (RPWMPRA) at a 400,000:1 ratio, delivering ~400,000% additional ownership and creating massive leverage for long-term holders. Verified Contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8252804BD3424d1A82D9c5077298404c0C00c616 Compliance & Infrastructure Built under the ERC-3643 standard, SMPRA introduces advanced regulatory controls including KYC verification, whitelisting, and compliant transfer restrictions. Verified Compliance Contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3F95Ad28A0b68Ea29C5beCb86A6e6d135628ec19#code Verified Identity Registry Contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x9ea4c988261c3166764b691c2297fe6975c4ab0e#code This framework ensures transparency, security, and readiness for regulatory engagement, including potential SEC registration. Retirement Plan Integration The new RPWMPRA Token is a fully owned project asset and directly linked to the Preferred Class. Each RPWMPRA equals ownership of MPRA/SMPRA at 400,000× leverage. A $1 price movement in MPRA/SMPRA equates to a $400,000 change in RPWMPRA value. MPRA tokens held under the Retirement Plan will be auto-converted to RPWMPRA at the set ratio. This restructuring has also boosted the intrinsic value of the Maya Preferred Common Class Token (MPRD) by over 800%, ensuring benefits across both token classes. Market Outlook With MPRA expected to revalue at $250 per token, today’s ~$92M market price implies a valuation of only ~$230 per token equivalent—signaling strong upside potential. The RPWMPRA Token will soon trade live side by side with MPRA and MPRD on CATEX Exchange and other top-rated CMC exchanges. Maya Preferred PRA and all UK Financial Ltd Tokenized projects trade on Catex Exchange, a top CoinMarketCap listed exchange.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/binance-futures-announces-listing-of-a-new-altcoin-trading-pair-here-are-the-details/,"Binance Futures is taking a new step to offer its users a wider range of trading options and enhance the trading experience. Binance Futures Lists XPLUSDT Trading Pair The company announced that it will launch pre-market trading for its XPLUSDT perpetual contract at 12:30 PM on August 22, 2025. This new contract will provide investors with up to 5x leverage. The underlying asset for the XPLUSDT contract has been announced as Plasma (XPL). Plasma is an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain specifically developed for high-volume, low-cost global stablecoin payments. The project's total supply is 10 billion XPL, with an unlimited maximum supply. USDT will be used as the settlement asset in transactions. During the pre-market trading period, the contract's mark price will be calculated every second and determined based on the average of the last 10 seconds of trading. If there are insufficient transactions during the relevant time period, the price of the last 20 transactions will be used as the basis. This method aims to reflect price fluctuations more fairly and consistently. The funding rate will be fixed at +0.005% during the pre-market period and will fluctuate between +2.00% and -2.00% once the pre-market trading concludes. Funding fees will be calculated every four hours. Binance Futures also announced that the XPLUSDT perpetual contract will be tradable 24/7 and support multi-asset mode. This move is expected to increase investors' access to new stablecoin-based payment-focused projects. *This is not investment advice.

Every cycle brings tokens that outperform expectations, and after SOL’s breakout, attention is quickly shifting toward other high-growth opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as one of those rare projects blending strong presale traction with the type of utility-driven adoption story that fuels real growth. Presale momentum meets real utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is progressing through its presale at Phase 6 with tokens priced at $0.035. So far, over $14.74 million has been raised, with more than 15,550 holders and 24% of tokens sold. With its listing set at $0.06, investors today still have a clear 71% upside locked in before the public market even begins trading. Early participants from Phase 1 at $0.01 already sit on 250% paper gains, a strong demonstration of the momentum behind the project even before its official launch. What sets this protocol apart from speculative hype-driven crypto coins is its tangible decentralized finance model. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with two lending systems: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2C, liquidity providers deposit assets directly into pools and earn dynamically adjusted returns based on usage. For example, a depositor placing $18,000 worth of BNB into a pool during high utilization at 15% APY secures $2,700 in annual passive income. That income is tracked transparently through the issuance of mtTokens, ERC-20 assets that represent deposits and automatically grow in value. Borrowers gain significant advantages as well. Instead of selling off assets, a user can lock $2,500 worth of MATIC and borrow $1,750 USDC at a 70% loan-to-value ratio. This allows them to free up liquidity for trading or investing while maintaining exposure to MATIC’s growth. By using overcollateralized models, borrowers retain upside potential and avoid taxable selling events. Meanwhile, P2P lending gives investors direct control over negotiated rates. A lender providing $2,200 in DOGE funding at a 20% return for one year earns a predictable, high-yield outcome. This hybrid design between pooled liquidity and peer-negotiated terms positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most versatile lending protocols preparing to launch. Why this token stands out post-SOL rally Crypto investing often requires spotting value before mainstream adoption, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sits right at that sweet spot. The beta platform launch is expected to drive significant traction by showcasing real use cases ahead of the full release. Exchange listings on major platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase will further enhance visibility and liquidity. As activity scales, the buy-and-distribute mechanism—where protocol revenue is used to purchase MUTM from the open market and reward stakers—will add continuous buy pressure and incentivize long-term engagement. Confidence in the project is further reinforced by its security and community initiatives. A comprehensive CertiK audit delivered strong scores, the $50K bug bounty program invites developers to strengthen the codebase, and a $100K giveaway builds both loyalty and awareness among retail investors. With more than 12,000 followers actively engaging across channels, community growth is aligning with presale progress. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also outlined a clear roadmap from its introduction through building, finalizing, and delivering phases. This includes not only the platform’s live launch but also multi-chain expansion, institutional partnerships, and advanced features designed to scale globally. With these steps laid out, investors are equipped with a transparent path toward growth and adoption. The context of rising crypto prices and renewed market sentiment means tokens with strong fundamentals will separate themselves from speculative plays. Crypto predictions increasingly favor projects that provide income streams, borrowing tools, and mechanisms that attract consistent demand rather than chasing short-lived hype. For investors asking why crypto is down on certain days, the answer often lies in weak token utility or limited adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sidesteps those pitfalls by ensuring users are engaged with real financial products from day one. After SOL’s surge, traders are looking for the next standout. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings the rare mix of presale traction, protocol innovation, and upcoming exchange exposure that signals breakout potential. For those planning their next move in crypto investing, this DeFi token stands out as one of the strongest plays to maximize growth in the unfolding altcoin season.

Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) said it has identified ""serious concerns"" with the crypto exchange's AML and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) controls. Binance Australia has 28 days to nominate external auditors for AUSTRAC's consideration. AUSTRAC said it has flagged concerns about Binance's AML/CTF governance based on its high staff turnover and a lack of local resourcing and senior manager oversight. “We have engaged openly and transparently with Austrac over the past several months and continue to value their guidance, expertise, and oversight,” Matt Poblocki, general manager of Binance Australia and New Zealand, said, according to a Bloomberg report . “We remain committed to maintaining best-in-class compliance standards and will continuously enhance our capabilities.” Binance did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for further comment. The Binance empire has had a difficult relationship with regulators over the years.

The Solana price recently defended the $180 support and eyes a breakout toward $220. Sui crypto is riding fresh listings and institutional adoption toward $7. But despite the buzz around SOL and SUI, the strongest narrative in the market right now belongs to Remittix (RTX) . This presale project has raised over $20.6 million amid recent CEX listing announcement buzz. Solana price builds toward $220 breakout Solana has been grinding higher after months of consolidation. Technical setups show an ascending triangle taking shape, a classic structure signaling accumulation before expansion. If buyers can hold the $180 floor and push through $200, analysts see $220–$240 as the next upside zone. Solana Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko Fresh capital flows support the move. More than $1 billion bridged into Solana over the past month, outpacing Ethereum and other major chains. That inflow strength reinforces the bullish case, as does Solana’s 42% share of total bridging activity. However, whale activity raises a caution flag. A recent $17.8M transfer of SOL to Binance suggests potential near-term selling pressure. Traders are watching closely to see if buyers absorb the supply or if the Solana price pulls back toward $176. If support holds, the next major rally leg could ignite fast. Sui crypto eyes $7 with fresh catalysts Sui crypto has been carving out an ascending triangle of its own. Trading near $3.50, the setup looks primed for a breakout once $4.50 resistance gives way. A measured move projects targets near $5.50 in the short run, and bulls are already eyeing $7 if momentum builds. Sui Price Chart | Source: CoinGecko The fundamentals line up. Robinhood just listed SUI , opening the door to millions of retail traders in the US. Meanwhile, Swiss Bank Sygnum added custody services, and a Goldman Sachs veteran joined Mysten Labs to lead capital markets integration. Those developments bolster institutional credibility. With a strong base support of around $3.40, the technical and fundamental picture suggests that Sui crypto is entering a key accumulation zone before its next leg is higher. Meet Remittix, the PayFi token dominating market discussions While Solana and Sui chase breakouts, Remittix (RTX) works from a different angle. It’s not about meme hype or chart patterns. It’s about solving the fundamental problem of moving money across borders. Remittix lets users convert 40+ cryptocurrencies into fiat and deposit directly into bank accounts in over 30 countries. Transactions settle within 24 hours. Recipients don’t need to know it started as crypto; they just see fiat in their account. That simplicity makes RTX unique in a crowded market. The project has already raised $20.6 million+ in presale, selling more than 612 million tokens. And with a Q3 Wallet Beta on the way, everyday users will soon be able to test real-time FX, transparent fees, and instant settlement. The Remittix Pay API unlocks global reach for businesses by accepting crypto and cashing out in fiat seamlessly. Why analysts call Remittix the hottest narrative Traders looking for asymmetric upside aren’t ignoring RTX . Analysts are calling it one of the most exciting early-stage projects for several reasons: Confirmed BitMart listing: Gives RTX global liquidity and exposure right out of presale. Q3 Wallet Beta launch: Real product, not just promises. Business integrations: Remittix Pay API positions it for freelancers and merchants worldwide. $250,000 Giveaway: Growing community traction and visibility fast. Presale traction: Over $20.6 million was raised, showing investors already backed the vision. Many believe RTX isn’t just another presale because of the combination of adoption drivers, early liquidity, and a clear payments narrative. It’s potentially the hottest crypto narrative on the market. With analysts projecting significant upside, some even frame RTX as a realistic high-ROI play heading into 2026.

With traders waiting to witness if the second-biggest crypto can push towards a fresh all-time high, attention is also turning to promising new projects that provide utility and strong presale demand. Among them, Remittix (RTX) is gaining momentum, underpinned by rapid fundraising and concrete milestones like a CEX listing and upcoming wallet beta. Combined, ETH momentum and early-stage altcoin interest are driving investor strategies into 2025. ETH price indicates increasing investor confidence Ethereum is still consolidating close to resistance levels, with traders considering the next step. ETH is at $4,258.23, based on CoinMarketCap’s Ethereum statistics, with a market cap of $513.78 billion and daily trading volume of $43.05 billion (down 17.91%). Although ETH price direction is elusive, investor confidence isn’t. Ethereum, ETH Price levels above the significant levels can trigger inflows, with some traders hedging long positions against short-term market volatility. It is for this reason that the majority are also diversifying into presales, searching for the next opportunity before prices surge. Market shifts toward utility-driven altcoins Other than Ethereum, investors are currently interested in tokens with real-world practical applications. Projects offering low gas fee cryptocurrency transactions, staking rewards, and cross-border payments are being sought after. All of these are excellent adoption use cases, especially in 2025, with institutional and retail buyers searching for the best crypto presale offers. Ethereum, ETH Price helps to maintain overall market optimism, but smaller projects with tangible real-world solutions are often where early investors can find the most outrageous growth potential. Among the most promising in this sector is Remittix, which is shaping its presale success into global payments. Remittix presale growth and milestones Remittix will be a participant in the $19 trillion payments economy through bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. The project has already realized amazing milestones: Why Remittix is making waves: Raised $20.6 million + with 612 million + tokens sold First CEX listing confirmed on BitMart Wallet beta launch for Q3 2025 scheduled $250,000 giveaway to build community interest Presale price now at $0.0969 These developments place Remittix among the best altcoins to watch in 2025, combining clear utility with strategic exchange listings. Why investors are watching Remittix closely For most traders, Ethereum, ETH Price determines the overall sentiment of the market. Nonetheless, altcoins like Remittix offer entry points at early-stage valuations with high upside potential. By targeting cross-border payments and introducing staking functionality, Remittix positions itself as more than just another presale—it’s a project with long-term adoption goals. With ETH at breakout prices and Remittix carving its position in global payments, both are being watched closely by investors. Whether Ethereum is back at all-time highs or Remittix breaks out as a next-gen presale, 2025 is shaping up to be a defining year.

The recent downturn in both XRP and Solana has caught the crypto community’s attention, especially investors searching for the next big Layer 2 crypto opportunity. With SOL and XRP consolidating, momentum is shifting toward new entrants like Layer Brett, which is currently in presale and promising staking rewards of up to 5,000% APY for early buyers. Analysts predict that $LBRETT could outperform many established meme coins, ushering in a fresh era of DeFi coin innovation and community-driven blockchain projects. The presale is live , and the urgency for early access is mounting as market sentiment toward mainstream altcoins softens. Why Ethereum Layer 2 gives Layer Brett the edge over Solana and XRP Layer Brett leverages Ethereum Layer 2 technology to deliver lightning-fast, low gas fee crypto transactions, addressing the scalability bottlenecks that have challenged Solana and Ripple (XRP). While SOL maintains high throughput and XRP continues to pursue institutional adoption, both have faced recent price dips and stagnation. In contrast, $LBRETT stands out with: Near-instant transactions and ultra-low fees, improving on Ethereum Layer 1’s congestion. Seamless staking crypto integration, letting users buy and stake with ETH, USDT, or BNB via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Gamified staking and NFT rewards, energizing the ecosystem beyond simple financial utility. Transparent tokenomics with a fixed 10 billion supply and robust DeFi and crypto governance plans. XRP price and SOL dip: Why investors are turning to Layer Brett’s presale With Ripple’s XRP price consolidating near $3.00 and SOL drifting below recent highs, many investors are moving to new crypto coins with higher growth potential. The Layer Brett presale is capturing this shifting interest, offering a low entry point ($0.0044 per token) and immediate staking options with extraordinary rewards. Early participants enjoy up to 5,000% APY, a figure unmatched by most top altcoins and DeFi tokens. Community-first initiatives—such as a $1 million giveaway—further distinguish Layer Brett from older projects like Shiba Inu, Bonk, and Brett (original). Layer Brett is engineered for scalability and high-yield staking with Layer 2 functionality and real utility. Solana meme coin launchpads cannot match the Ethereum Layer 2 backbone or the 5,000%+ APY staking rates of $LBRETT. Shiba Inu and Pepe remain popular, yet their ecosystems have struggled to deliver the same blend of meme power and tangible blockchain rewards. Community and growth incentives shape Layer Brett’s roadmap, ensuring it stays ahead of legacy meme tokens. SOL, XRP, and the rise of the next 100x Memecoin As SOL and XRP prices dip, trend-driven investors are scouting for the next 100x altcoin. Layer Brett checks every box: it is a best crypto presale, a top meme coin contender, and a new crypto coin with real-world scaling utility. The ecosystem encourages creative blockchain experimentation, and its presale offers a rare chance to join before a potential crypto bull run in 2025. Conclusion: Don’t miss Layer Brett’s staking boom Layer Brett is in its presale stage—but not for long. With Solana, Ripple (XRP), Brett (original), and Bonk showing signs of fatigue, now is the moment to pivot to a Layer 2 memecoin built for the future. Secure your $LBRETT early, stake for up to 5,000% APY, and join the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum. The next top gainer crypto could be just a click away.

SoSoValue’s data suggested that the total net outflows recorded by ETH ETFs have now hit $678 million. This marks the largest outflow since launch in the third consecutive day of negative performance. Despite the headwind, some experts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s longer-term prospects. They are standing behind their earlier Ethereum price prediction, which suggests that ETH will reach $9K in 2025. This post explains everything and why a rising ERC-20 token can potentially increase by 30x if Ethereum reaches its $9,000 target. Ethereum’s reserves remain strong despite outflows ETH ETF issuers continue to hold over 6.3 million ETH despite recent outflows, which is roughly 5% of the total circulating supply, valued just under $26 billion. This means that its recent outflows are a result of its corrective price movements and not otherwise. Some experts call it “mere profit-taking action” by institutional players, which is forcing liquidity in the market. Once the market absorbs this liquidity shock in favour of higher ETH prices, the next bullish phase may likely set in. However, the downside to this event is smart money manipulations, which can move prices explosively in any direction. These large players do this to accumulate positions from the early sell-off of retail investors. Ethereum price prediction: Trend continuation on the horizon? After a strong rejection from the $4,700 supply zone, ETH has witnessed a downward spiral and is now at its critical support area. On-chain indicators are flashing signs of caution. ETH’s price is consolidating just above the 20-day EMA, which, as of now, is acting as a short-term support. Meanwhile, the bigger picture is still positive. The 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs are still sloping upwards. The RSI has dropped to 54, from overbought territory earlier this month, signalling a waning buying climax and more room for expansion. ETH’s cooldown has now reset market sentiment to neutral, allowing it to enter a balanced territory which is neither overheated nor oversold. If it manages to hold above the $4,100 support zone, there’s a high chance of a trend continuation and a breakout of the $4,700 range. Layer Brett: Primed for a 30x boom from Ethereum’s rally The overflow of funds from ETH is expected to spill to Layer Brett , since it packs an immense potential, while running on the Ethereum chain. The project brings mouthwatering features to the table, unlike other hype tokens. As an Ethereum Layer 2 meme coin, Layer Brett combines viral meme culture with serious blockchain technology. This includes lightning-fast transactions, cheap gas fees, and lucrative staking rewards up to 3,800% APY for early adopters. Layer Brett’s ultra-low market cap means there’s loads of room for growth, and its attractive entry price of $0.0044 buttresses this sentiment. Its presale is reaching towards $1 million, which is particularly impressive for a project of its size. By the time Ethereum hits $9K, LayerBrett would’ve fetched early investors more than 30x ROI. It has a unique offering, it is ambitious, and above all, it is buoyed by a tight-knit community that will keep it afloat at all times. Conclusion If you missed out on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and other blue-chip assets, don’t miss out on Layer Brett . Conceived with big ambitions, this coin is going to dominate the meme coin space and turn a lot of investors into crypto millionaires. Investing in the Layer Brett market is a no-brainer for investors who want to maximize their crypto profits in 2025.

Jajodia explained that the company manages its purchases to remain in proportion with available market liquidity, ensuring their entry does not distort the trading environment. Strategy, which began buying Bitcoin in 2020, now holds 629,376 BTC worth roughly $70.85 billion, according to data from SaylorTracker. Large institutional buyers typically use over-the-counter (OTC) desks to execute such trades privately, avoiding the slippage that occurs when enormous buy orders are placed on public exchanges. Market Moves Around Strategy Buys While speculation often swirls that Strategy’s buys directly push Bitcoin higher , historical data shows mixed outcomes. For example, between November 18 and 24, 2024, the company purchased 55,000 BTC for $5.4 billion at an average of $97,862 per coin. By mid-December, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $106,000, aided by broader market momentum following Donald Trump’s election victory. In contrast, on July 29, 2025, Strategy bought 21,021 BTC for about $2.46 billion. Within four days, Bitcoin’s price fell nearly 4%, dropping to $113,320. Despite these varied outcomes, traders closely monitor Saylor’s posts on X, often interpreting his Bitcoin-related updates as signals of another looming corporate buy. Continuous Accumulation Strategy According to Jajodia, Strategy does not time the market in a traditional sense but instead maintains a consistent buying approach. “We’re actually buying Bitcoin around the clock. Almost every day, every hour, every second we are in the market,” he said. He added that the company may accelerate purchases during downturns to capitalize on lower prices. Saylor himself has repeatedly emphasized that price is secondary to accumulation. In May, after Bitcoin slipped from $112,000, he wrote on X, “I only buy Bitcoin with money I can’t afford to lose.” By late 2024, Saylor had pledged to keep acquiring Bitcoin even at record highs, signaling that the company’s commitment to BTC is a long-term accumulation strategy rather than a short-term price play.

In separate meetings, executives from Shinhan, Hana, KB Financial and Woori Bank will discuss potential partnerships on distributing and transacting with dollar-pegged stablecoins in the country, as well as explore the issuance of a stablecoin pegged to the won. The moves come as President Lee Jae Myung’s pro-crypto administration pushes to establish a market for stablecoins, digital tokens whose value is pegged to a conventional asset, tied to the won, a key pledge from his election campaign. The Bank of Korea shelved plans to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in June following Lee's election earlier in the month. Upbit, one of the country's largest crypto exchanges, has already said it's working with Naver Pay on a stablecoin.

In the tweet, SMQKE stated that Ripple is the only cryptocurrency company that monitors and reports suspicious activity on the blockchain, pointing to security and compliance on the XRP Ledger as long-standing priorities for Ripple. He encouraged his followers to carefully consider O’Gorma’s statements, which were shared in a video clip attached to the post. O’Gorma on Global Regulatory Limitations In the video, O’Gorma began by addressing the potential effectiveness of global anti-money laundering regulation. She noted that even if AML regulations were uniformly introduced and made applicable to all financial institutions and digital currency exchanges worldwide, these measures would not adequately address transaction risk. She reasoned that transactions are recorded on blockchains beneath the operations of digital exchanges, and while exchanges monitor activities within their platforms, the actual blockchain-level activity often goes unmonitored. She pointed out that no financial institution currently takes on this responsibility, and emphasized that Ripple Labs stands out as an exception. According to O’Gorma, Ripple has been required by regulators to monitor and report suspicious blockchain-based activity, a responsibility that most other entities in the digital asset space have not undertaken. Ripple’s Antoinette O’Gorma: “Ripple is the ONLY CRYPTO COMPANY that monitors and reports suspicious activity on the blockchain.” Security and compliance on the XRP Ledger have always been top priorities for Ripple. Listen closely. https://t.co/PN6seJtP1T pic.twitter.com/xRsxiyG9X6 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 21, 2025 Monitoring Blockchain Transactions O’Gorma explained how digital wallets can be created independently of exchanges and are accessible globally for cross-border transfers. She stated that anyone with internet access can open these wallets. Once created, provide immediate capabilities for transactions without traditional onboarding requirements. She illustrated this by showing examples of wallet addresses on the blockchain, including both XRP Ledger and Bitcoin wallets . O’Gorma stressed that cryptocurrency transfers occur directly from one address to another, typically without additional identifying information. She also underlined it’s difficult to determine the physical location of a wallet holder due to techniques such as IP address spoofing, which obscure the origin of transactions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Internal Reporting and Investigations O’Gorma detailed how Ripple responded to this challenge. With hundreds of thousands of wallet addresses active on the XRP Ledger , the company developed mechanisms to handle reports of unusual or illegal activities. Users were provided with a repository to submit allegations relating to thefts, phishing scams, pyramid schemes, and other suspicious behavior. Ripple then used this information to initiate investigations aimed at identifying culprits and uncovering broader patterns of activity that could indicate illegal conduct. She explained that Ripple worked to link allegations of suspicious activity with blockchain data to detect trends and address concerns about illicit use. The process involved examining reported incidents, consolidating user feedback, and building cases to identify potential threats operating on the XRP Ledger. SMQKE’s tweet reinforced the significance of Ripple’s approach in the broader cryptocurrency industry. By highlighting O’Gorma’s comments, he drew attention to Ripple’s position as an entity required by regulators to go beyond exchange-level monitoring and actively report blockchain-based suspicious activities. Her explanation demonstrated Ripple’s efforts to combine compliance, user feedback, and blockchain analysis to build a system of accountability that addresses risks in the digital asset ecosystem.

50486239,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=789766,1755855374,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50486239.jpeg,Nvidia asked suppliers to halt production of its H20 chips,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nvidia-to-stop-h20-chip-production/,"Nvidia told several of its suppliers to halt work on its H20 processors made specifically for China, following growing pressure from Beijing. The move comes after Chinese regulators told domestic technology firms to stop purchasing the U.S. company’s chips over national security concerns, according to reports published Friday. The company has reportedly instructed Amkor Technology, based in Arizona, to suspend its advanced packaging work on the H20 chips. Samsung Electronics in South Korea, which supplies memory for the processors, has also been asked to pause its part of the production. A separate account from Reuters said Taiwan’s Foxconn was told to stop related work as well. It is now uncertain if H20 chips will be back in China The development brings fresh uncertainty about whether Nvidia’s H20 chips will make their way back into the Chinese market. Earlier this year, Washington announced it would grant export licenses for shipments to China, after a previous restriction in April had blocked them. Last month, China’s Cyberspace Administration called Nvidia in for discussions over risks of national security tied to the H20 processor. Regulators asked Nvidia to provide more details on how the chips function. Beijing has voiced fears that the H20 chips could contain hidden tracking tools or features that might allow outside control, as reported earlier by Cryptopolitan . In May, U.S. lawmakers introduced the Chip Security Act, which would require firms such as Nvidia to include security and location protections in advanced AI processors. Speaking in Taiwan, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on Friday that the Chinese side had raised questions about possible security “backdoors.” He emphasized that the company made clear that no such features exist. He added that Nvidia had been caught off guard by the inquiries but was working to satisfy regulators. Huang said he had made efforts to help secure licenses for the H20 and hoped the matter could be settled soon. Nvidia clarified that the H20 was safe for use The company noted that both Washington and Beijing understand the chip is not intended for military or government infrastructure. Nvidia added that, just as the U.S. government does not rely on Chinese chips, China would not use American processors for state functions. However, it said commercial use of such chips benefits both economies. Huang had previously called it a victory when the United States government agreed to let the company sell the H20 in China. The company has lobbied against Washington’s limits on chip exports, which have reduced its business in one of its biggest markets. During his remarks on Friday, Huang also mentioned discussions with the United States President Trump about the company’s overseas operations. He said he highlighted the importance of maintaining America’s lead in AI technology and argued that global AI development would advance regardless, so U.S. firms should maximize exports during this key moment for the industry. Nvidia recorded a $4.5 billion write-down in May due to unsold H20 stock, following the export restrictions. The company also reported that its revenue for the last quarter would be higher by $2.5 billion without those curbs. Industry experts warn that the current scrutiny in China could further complicate the company’s prospects. Bernstein analyst Qingyuan Lin told CNBC that a full ban on H20 sales in China could put more than $20 billion of Nvidia’s annual revenue at risk. He said the company might still generate sales from less advanced chips until 2026, but by 2027, local competitors would likely meet much of the demand themselves. Analysts also believe Beijing’s measures reflect its push for self-reliance in semiconductors, a response to Washington’s efforts to maintain U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence hardware.

Recent remarks from Eric Trump hinted at a secretive sovereign accumulation of over 200,000 BTC, fueling speculation about massive institutional demand. One token in particular, Remittix (RTX) , is emerging as a $0.09 “XRP alternative,” poised to benefit from surges in Bitcoin price and growing adoption across real-world payment networks. Analysts argue that if Bitcoin price reaches its projected highs, Remittix could quickly break $3, offering both utility and speculative upside for early investors. Bitcoin price momentum and market context Bitcoin price has again become the center of attention, currently trading near $112,952, as speculative and institutional activity intensifies. Recent comments from Eric Trump suggested a sovereign might have quietly acquired 200,000 BTC, fueling excitement around Bitcoin price reaching $160K this cycle. Such surges in Bitcoin price often trigger spillover effects across altcoins, particularly those with real-world utility. One standout token, Remittix (RTX), is gaining traction as a $0.09 “XRP alternative,” combining practical payment solutions with upside potential if Bitcoin price hits new highs. Bitcoin price has seen consistent accumulation in recent months, supported by rising institutional exposure and global awareness of digital assets. Metrics from Coinglass and on-chain data show funding rates flipping positive, signaling bullish sentiment for Bitcoin price among leveraged traders. Analysts note that if Bitcoin price continues toward $160K, it could lift correlated assets, especially altcoins that serve as functional alternatives to established tokens like XRP. Moreover, high-profile mentions and sovereign-scale purchases indicate that Bitcoin price could act as a catalyst for renewed market rallies, drawing more attention to emerging cryptocurrencies with real utility. Remittix surges with real-world utility Remittix (RTX) is currently priced at $0.0969, with over 612 million tokens sold and more than $20.6 million raised. The Q3 2025 wallet launch enables cross-border payments in 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, making RTX a practical solution for freelancers, remitters, and businesses worldwide. Key highlights include: Global Payouts: Send crypto directly to bank accounts in seconds Security First: Audited by CertiK for transparency and trust Built for Adoption: Supports real-world business and individual payments Infrastructure Ready: Scalable network handling multiple crypto and fiat pairs These features, combined with increasing community support and institutional interest, position Remittix as a token capable of outperforming hype-driven alternatives. Investors are actively accumulating RTX ahead of wallet launch and exchange listings, expecting that surges in Bitcoin price could accelerate its trajectory. Conclusion Bitcoin price growth remains the primary market driver, but tokens like Remittix demonstrate that utility and adoption can generate outsized returns even during speculative cycles. While BTC price could rally based on macro trends, Remittix offers both a functional use case and a high-upside investment. With strong infrastructure and global payment capabilities, Remittix is poised to emerge as a leading altcoin if Bitcoin price continues toward $160K.

BlackRock ( IBIT ), the leading fund with over $85 billion in assets under management, alone shed approximately $127.5 million worth of BTC, according to August 22 data on SoSoValue . However, Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs saw a reversal of fortune, seeing $287.6 million in inflows, with BlackRock ( ETHA ) adding $233.6 million just one day after reporting $257 million in withdrawals. Accordingly, investors are speculating whether we’re looking at a short-term profit strategy or whether we might see a rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum if the trend continues in the future.

BlackRock’s Ethereum holdings have grown 230% since January 1, reaching 3.55 million ETH, worth around $15 billion, according to Arkham Intelligence . More broadly, spot Ethereum ETFs now hold $27.66 billion worth of the crypto. The appeal is quite clear: the cryptocurrency’s proof-of-stake (PoS) design continues to generate 3–5% staking yields. Regulatory clarity has also worked in the asset’s favor, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) designated it as a non-security, paving the way for broader ETF adoption. Still, Bitcoin remains BlackRock’s store of value, accounting for around 85% of the firm’s crypto portfolio, while Ethereum drives yield and other assets attempt to seize more niche opportunities.

In 2027, it will range between $124.52 and $147.87, with an average price of $136.20. In 2031, it will range between $280.18 and $303.53, with an average price of $291.85. Hyperliquid is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) . It has its own Layer 1 blockchain, and HYPE is its native token, which is used for staking, governance, and payments within the ecosystem. One of the key features of Hyperliquid, along with its high-speed platform, is that it offers crypto perpetual futures for trading by its users without the need to own the asset. The platform supports a number of cryptocurrencies, including but not limited to BTC, ETH, SUI, AVAX, and SOL, to name a few. Technically, the Hyperliquid blockchain is based on two protocols, namely HyperEVM and HyperBFT; combined, they help provide high-speed trading and Ethereum-based smart contracts with reliability. The Hyperliquid platform revolves around community participation, as token holders have voting rights to govern and influence developments taking place on the platform. On November 29, 2024, Hyperliquid conducted an airdrop of its native token, HYPE, but unlike other players, it was selective in allocating the airdrop to only 94,000 users with an average value of $45,000 to $50,000, making it one of the most worthy airdrops in crypto history. Let’s take a deep dive into what the future holds for the HYPE token in Cryptopolitan’s Hyperliquid price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

While the technical analysis can change from bullish to bearish, price predictions paint a different picture. However, a risk analysis is recommended. Will Hyperliquid reach $50? The current price action does not justify predicting a $50 target. However, in the cryptocurrency market, things change rapidly, and if the token maintains its price levels, a recovery can be initiated. It can be expected that HYPE will reach above $50 by October 2025. Can Hyperliquid Coin reach $100? According to Hyperliquid price prediction, HYPE price might surpass $100 in 2026. The highest price HYPE could attain that year is expected to be above $108.96. Will Hyperliquid reach $500? According to crypto analysts’ price predictions, Hyperliquid may not reach this level in the next five years. Considering the current market cap of the token, it seems like far target. Will Hyperliquid reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Hyperliquid is unlikely to reach $1000 before 2031. How high can Hyperliquid go? The highest expected price for Hyperliquid is $303.53, which it will achieve in 2031. Does Hyperliquid have a good long-term future? Hyperliquid is trading higher than its December 2024 price levels, making it an ideal time for buyers to enter the market. Given its current price and a favorable future valuation of $303.53 by the end of 2031, the asset appears to be a worthwhile investment.

However, you should note that HYPE is still quite volatile. Negative market sentiment, such as market crashes, could derail the predictions. Hyperliquid Historic Price Sentiment Hyperliquid price history: Coingecko The native token of Hyperliquid, called HYPE, was launched on November 29, 2024, through an airdrop targeted at a limited number of only 94,000 users. This was one of the most lucrative airdrops, with an average allocation of value of $45,000 to $50,000. Hyperliquid kept away from venture capitalists, who usually get most of the tokens in usual airdrops; rather, 76% of the supply was slated for user-centric initiatives. Usually, tokens dump after airdrops until the market momentum picks up, but Hyperliquid’s approach helped garner trust, and the token jumped from $4 to $35 from November 2024 to December 22, 2024. Hyperliquid’s market cap improved significantly during this period, reaching above $8 billion, as it received super positive market sentiment. In late December and early January 2025, the HYPE token corrected down to $20.24, shedding significant value as per crypto market data. Price stabilized through February as it traded in a range of $19.92 to $27.42 before taking a dive at the end of February. HYPE stumbled to $12.34 by mid-March, and it touched a low of $10.21 on April 7, 2025. The token saw nothing but improvement in the remainder of the month of April, and its price surged to $18.57 by the end of the month. On June 16, 2025, HYPE reached an all-time high of $45.57. A month later, on July 14, it marked another all-time high of $49.75, and at the start of August, it is trading near the $38 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|HYPE|Hyperliquid,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|AIRDROP|ETH|ALTCOIN|USDC|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-22 09:50:00

Will the token continue to see more corrections ahead? According to data from XRP , XRPwas trading at $2.93, up 19% over the last 3 months and 63% higher than its year-to-date low. Much of these gains came amid investor hype after Ripple, the company behind XRP, secured a decisive win in its years-long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite XRP’s notable performance this year, there are signs the token could be poised for a correction. The token has already dropped 16.8% over the past month after hitting its year-to-date high last month. “So how can we safeguard our assets and keep what’s ours in our wallets before XRP takes a major dive?” How to jump in Wondering if it’s possible to get a piece of the action too?

Policy change offers relief to crypto developers. Shift aligns with Trump administration's regulatory approach. DOJ Clarifies: Writing Code Without Malicious Intent Is Not a Crime The U.S. Department of Justice has made a decisive statement that simply writing software code without malicious intent does not constitute a crime. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew J. Galeotti announced this during an American Innovation Project event, emphasizing that developers creating decentralized solutions are legally protected if they do not intend to commit fraud or facilitate illegal activity. Understanding the Legal Boundaries: What Developers Can and Cannot Do Galeotti explained that the DOJ will continue to prosecute only intentional wrongdoing, such as fraud, money laundering, or sanctions evasion. However, under 18 U.S.C. § 1960, developers of decentralized applications who lack intent to commit crime will not face charges. If software merely automates peer-to-peer transactions and developers do not control user assets, the DOJ will not pursue prosecution. Galeotti stated plainly: ”We believe that simply writing code without malicious intent is not a crime.” This marks a major policy shift from prior aggressive prosecutions of blockchain projects, signaling a more developer-friendly approach to crypto regulation. The announcement comes weeks after Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm was convicted for operating an unlicensed money transmitter. Legal experts like Jake Chervinsky, General Counsel at Variant Fund, suggested that the DOJ's clarification could influence appeals or future cases: This new stance reflects the current administration’s broader regulatory philosophy: criminal law will not be used as a regulatory tool in the digital asset industry. Specialized agencies are expected to handle oversight, while prosecutors focus on real crimes . Why This Matters: Legal Clarity Could Fuel Innovation By drawing a clear line between intentional wrongdoing and innocuous coding, the DOJ is providing certainty for crypto developers, DeFi platforms, and blockchain startups. This policy reduces the fear of prosecution for software creation and aligns with global trends toward more structured crypto regulation. Observers note that such clarity could also influence international regulatory frameworks, as other countries look to balance innovation with oversight. The decision ensures that legitimate blockchain projects can operate without undue legal risk, fostering growth and experimentation in the digital asset ecosystem.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 09:57:19

Since gaining takedown powers two years ago, the ASIC has shut down over 14,000 investment scam and phishing websites, averaging about 130 removals weekly. In the past six months, the commission has cited AI-washing, scam website templates, exploitation of third parties, fake news articles, and cloaking as the most used investment website scam tactics. Its 2024 review also sounded the alarm over deepfakes and other AI-generated images, warning they make it even trickier for people to identify scams. ASIC warns people to take extra precautions before investing Australian authorities claim investment scams are becoming more sophisticated and more damaging. Since July 2023, ASIC has organized the removal of over 14,000 scam websites and advertisements, with at least 3,000 scams being associated with crypto. Now it is expanding its takedown powers to cover social media ads. ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said while the regulator’s traditional tools, including investigations, court action, and administrative enforcement, are still important, they are not enough to combat the rise of online scams. The regulator’s ability to takedown websites was an example of how ASIC was evolving to deal with the challenges and to help protect Australians from fraudsters, she added. She added that the expansion to cover social media ads will help to block more scammers from steering people toward online investment scams and protect Australian consumers. She further asked Australians to be cautious, noting that much still needs to be done. So far, investment scams remain the biggest driver of financial losses among Australians, with the National Anti-Scam Centre estimating $945 million lost in 2024 alone. While the losses are down 25.9% compared with 2022’s record of $3.1 billion, the commission still insists on consumer vigilance as scam tactics continue to evolve. The commission also urged Australians to take their time before making investment decisions, avoid relying on AI-generated safety assurances, and steer clear of offers made through social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram. Moreover, it asked users to check if the company they want to invest in is licensed. ASIC reports $57.5 million in H1 penalties According to the ASIC’s latest update, the year’s first six months resulted in six convictions and $57.5 million in civil penalties. Among the penalties was an $8 million fine for Firstmac Limited, marking the first enforcement action against a distributor for DDO non-compliance. The Supreme Court of NSW also imposed $16.8 million in penalties on Allianz Australia Insurance Limited and AWP Australia Pty Ltd after finding them guilty of making false or misleading statements. The court determined that from 2016 to 2018, Allianz and AWP misrepresented aspects of their travel insurance by publishing misleading information on Allianz’s domestic and international travel insurance web pages. HCF Life Insurance Company Pty Limited (HCF) was fined a penalty of $750,000 and asked to publish corrective disclosures after finding that a pre-existing condition clause in some of its policies would likely mislead consumers. Additionally, the regulator sued Choosi in June 2025 for falsely claiming that it compared products from various funeral and life insurers.

50486494,562902,1755856803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50486494.jpeg,Ripple And Banking Giant SBI To Roll Out RLUSD Across Japan,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sbi-roll-out-rlusd-across-japan/,"Ripple and SBI Holdings, together with SBI VC Trade Co., Ltd., have signed a memorandum of understanding that outlines their intention for SBI VC Trade to distribute Ripple USD (RLUSD) in Japan. The agreement positions RLUSD for entry into one of the world’s most tightly regulated digital-asset markets, with availability targeted for the first quarter of 2026, according to the companies. Ripple Exports RLUSD To Japan The parties frame the move against what they describe as a rapidly expanding market for fiat-backed tokens. The release estimates today’s stablecoin sector at “nearly $300 billion” and asserts it is “expected to grow into the trillions in the coming years,” with the next phase of adoption driven by “utility and institutional demand.” Within that context, RLUSD is presented as an “enterprise-grade” dollar-denominated stablecoin whose design emphasizes compliance, transparency, and institutional safeguards. Ripple says RLUSD is “fully backed by high-quality reserves, including US dollar deposits, short-term US government bonds, and other cash equivalents,” and that it will publish “monthly attestations from a third-party accounting firm.” The company characterizes this approach as a differentiator that “sets RLUSD apart from other stablecoins and provides the security that institutions require and expect.” SBI is anchoring the distribution through SBI VC Trade, described as a licensed Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider in Japan and a subsidiary of SBI Holdings. In remarks accompanying the announcement, SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo linked the RLUSD rollout to the company’s broader strategy to expand regulated stablecoin offerings in Japan. “The introduction of RLUSD will not just expand the option of stablecoins in the Japanese market , but is a major step forward in the reliability and convenience of stablecoins in the Japanese market, and an important step in further accelerating the convergence of finance and digital technology,” Kondo said. “We will continue to work with Ripple to build a safe and transparent financial infrastructure.” Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, Jack McDonald, positioned the collaboration as an extension of the companies’ long-running alliance. “Our partnership with SBI has always been about more than just technology; it’s about building a trusted and compliant financial future,” he said. “The distribution of RLUSD in Japan with SBI VC Trade is a culmination of that work. RLUSD is designed to be a true industry standard, providing a reliable and efficient bridge between traditional and decentralized finance. We are confident that this partnership will not only drive stablecoin utility in Japan but also set a new benchmark for the entire market.” While the MOU outlines intent rather than final commercial launch, the parties specify an initial timeline: SBI VC Trade “aims to make RLUSD available in Japan during the first quarter of 2026.” Beyond distribution, SBI VC Trade’s corporate profile underscores its role within the SBI Group’s crypto strategy. Operating under multiple licenses—including Crypto Asset Exchange Service Provider, Type 1 Financial Instruments Service Provider, and Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider—the firm highlights both retail and corporate-focused services and notes it was the first in Japan to begin handling USDC.

Despite strong communities, the sideways price action has left many asking why is crypto down in some areas while others are finding growth. Analysts are now pointing away from hype-driven tokens and toward protocols with actual lending and borrowing use cases. One name being highlighted again and again is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a presale project with a model designed to put capital to work instead of relying on internet jokes. Real Lending Mechanics Changing the Narrative Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in its presale Phase 6 at a price of $0.035. Over $14.74 million has already been raised, with 24% of this phase’s 170 million token supply sold and more than 15,550 holders onboarded. The project has also passed through a rigorous CertiK audit, securing a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78, building a layer of trust that meme coins rarely achieve. At the center of this protocol is its peer-to-contract (P2C) lending model. This system allows lenders to deposit blue-chip crypto coins directly into non-custodial liquidity pools and start generating income. Imagine a user allocating $20,000 worth of SOL into the pool. In return, they earn a 14% annual yield, which translates into $2,800 of passive income every year. Because the P2C system automatically adjusts interest rates depending on pool usage, it constantly balances opportunity for lenders with liquidity for borrowers. This flexibility is what analysts believe sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart in a crowded market. Alongside this, the protocol’s peer-to-peer (P2P) model expands lending into more experimental territory. Instead of broad pools, isolated markets are created for higher-risk assets like PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE. This way, their volatility is ring-fenced without threatening the stability of the core platform. For example, a borrower might pledge $1,000 worth of PEPE as collateral, and a lender negotiates a 25% annualized interest for a six-month term. That means the lender walks away with $125 over half a year, compensated for the higher risk. By keeping these markets isolated, the platform creates a balanced environment where riskier meme assets can still generate opportunity without destabilizing the broader ecosystem. Why Analysts Are Calling It The Token Of Summer 2025 The attraction is not just the design but also the investment angle. Investors who entered at $0.01 in Phase 1 are already sitting on 250% paper gains with today’s Phase 6 price. Even new participants coming in at $0.035 are set for a 71% upside once the token lists at $0.06. Once Phase 6 closes, the price rises 15% to $0.040, meaning hesitation could already reduce margins. For those investing in crypto at this stage, it’s the textbook case of presale FOMO, where acting early locks in the maximum advantage. Momentum is further fueled by additional initiatives around the launch. A $50,000 bug bounty program ensures the code remains battle-tested, while a $100,000 giveaway for 10 winners keeps community engagement high. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already attracted more than 12,000 followers on Twitter, showcasing growing traction long before the product goes live. The real excitement comes from what happens when the presale ends. The beta launch is expected to go live at the same time as the token’s listing, giving users immediate access to the lending features. Layer-2 integration and the development of its own $1 stablecoin are also on the roadmap, which means the ecosystem will not only host lending but also power liquidity with a native stable asset. Add to that the buy-and-distribute mechanism, where a portion of revenue will be used to purchase MUTM from the open market and reward stakers of mtTokens, and the long-term demand picture becomes even clearer. With exchange listings anticipated on major platforms such as Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase, accessibility and trading liquidity are projected to accelerate growth beyond the $0.06 listing mark. For investors monitoring crypto prices today, this shift from hype to utility is why analysts are confident that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a better chance to deliver growth than meme tokens stuck in neutral.

This strategic move signals the companies’ commitment to cementing a foothold in Japan’s burgeoning digital currency ecosystem. Furthermore, SBI plans to roll out the RLUSD stablecoin in the first quarter of 2026. Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to traditional fiat, have surged in popularity due to their stability compared to volatile assets like Bitcoin or XRP. With the global market already at $300 billion, analysts project it could reach trillions, driven by rising demand for digital payments, cross-border transactions, and DeFi applications. RLUSD is being developed to meet Japan’s strict financial regulations, ensuring a secure and reliable digital currency for both retail and institutional users. By aligning with regulatory standards, Ripple and SBI position RLUSD as a trusted bridge between traditional finance and the growing digital asset ecosystem. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, noted , “The distribution of RLUSD in Japan with SBI VC Trade is a culmination of that work. RLUSD is designed to be a true industry standard, providing a reliable and efficient bridge between traditional and decentralized finance. We are confident that this partnership will not only drive stablecoin utility in Japan but also set a new benchmark for the entire market.” Notably, this partnership combines Ripple’s blockchain expertise in fast, low-cost cross-border payments with SBI Holdings’ deep ties to Japan’s financial sector and fintech innovation. Therefore, by leveraging SBI’s experience in crypto exchanges, digital asset platforms, and blockchain research, the two aim to launch a stablecoin that rivals USDT and USDC while catering specifically to Japan’s unique market. Industry experts suggest that RLUSD’s launch could bolster Ripple’s XRP adoption, enhancing credibility and adoption in regions with clear regulatory frameworks. The move underscores Japan’s rising influence in the global crypto market, where regulators are balancing innovation with consumer protection. Whale-to-Exchange Flows Spike 7x in Five Days, Signaling Potential Sell-Off Market analyst Steph Is Crypto sounded the alarm this week after on-chain trackers showed whale-to-exchange transfers for XRP spiking sevenfold in just five days, a move many traders read as fresh sell pressure. The analyst shared the alert on X, formerly Twitter, highlighting the speed and scale of the inflows and asking whether investors should be worried. On-chain data depict rising concern because whale inflows surged from 900 XRP to 6,293 XRP between August 16–21, 2025, a 7× jump as XRP continues to trade below the psychological price of $3. Why does this matter? Well, large, rapid transfers from whale wallets to centralized exchanges often signal selling or position rebalancing, increasing market supply and potentially pressuring prices. Analysts note that while not every inflow triggers a crash, persistent or concentrated flows near resistance levels heighten the risk of a correction. CryptoQuant and other experts warn that sudden whale-to-exchange movements are a key early warning indicator. Therefore, traders should monitor rising exchange inflows, clusters of large sell orders, increasing short open interest, and coordinated whale-to-exchange transfers. Crucially, on-chain signals must be interpreted alongside macro factors, market sentiment, regulatory news, and liquidity since whales often move funds for reasons beyond immediate selling. On the other hand, XRP might be eyeing a bullish surge from $2.90 as consolidation intensifies. Conclusion The call about a 7x jump in whale-to-exchange flows is a legitimate warning light, not a guaranteed prophecy. It raises the probability of near-term selling pressure for XRP, and prudent market participants will monitor confirmations across order books and on-chain metrics before making decisions. On the other hand, by entering the multi-billion-dollar stablecoin market with a compliant blockchain-based token, Ripple and SBI Holdings are positioning themselves at the forefront of digital finance. RLUSD could drive mainstream adoption in Japan and set a benchmark for regulated, reliable, and efficient stablecoin solutions globally.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ASIA|XRP|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 10:01:19

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Today marks the fourth day since Bitcoin tested its most important recent support, the same level around $111,000 that kickstarted August’s rally. It’s worth noting that this zone was the breakout point of the last major move (in July), and that former resistance has now flipped into a strong support. Although $BTC has slipped below the 50 EMA on the daily chart, zooming out to the weekly chart shows a more bullish picture. The token remains above all the key moving averages, including the short-term 20 EMA and 50 EMA, so it’s fair to say that momentum is still leaning to the upside. Even better? A strong technical setup is emerging on the weekly chart. If we plot Fibonacci retracements from the recent swing low, $BTC is now fast approaching the 50% retracement level, which is a critical zone worth watching for potential buy entries. If this pattern plays out, $BTC could hit new all-time highs in the weeks ahead. As Allianz Flips Bullish, Bitcoin Hyper Flips the Script August 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC In 2019, Allianz dismissed crypto as ‘speculative nonsense’. Now? They’re calling Bitcoin a ‘credible store of value’. This marks the first time the $2.5T asset manager has endorsed digital assets as a legitimate investment, noting that regulatory clarity improvements have eliminated major barriers to institutional participation. As institutions wake up, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is already hard at work prepping for the future. With over $11.2M raised in presale and climbing fast, $HYPER is redefining the possibilities for $BTC with a Layer 2 built for speed, scale, and smart contracts. Above genuine utility, $HYPER comes with Solana-grade speeds, zero tax trading and meme-powered hype, as seen on X and Telegram .

Bitcoin Hyper In. August 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC The US House just dropped a bombshell.

That’s a big win for crypto freedom, with lawmakers pushing back against surveillance-driven digital money and backing open, permissionless alternatives. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is building the permissionless future that the bill fights for. It’s Bitcoin, but faster, freer, and scaled for the Web3 generation.

In 2025, Dogecoin stands shoulder-to-shoulder next to Bitcoin. One is the first cryptocurrency, while our doggo friend is widely recognized as the first meme coin. Launched in 2013, $DOGE is up by over 38,000% today, looking at a price of over $0.21 and a trading volume in the billions of dollars. If anything, Dogecoin proves that ‘anything is possible’ in crypto, and even underdogs can become industry giants. With endorsements from industry moguls like Elon Musk and official investment vehicles like the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust, $DOGE seems to be going nowhere but up.

We may earn affiliate commissions at no extra cost to you. Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis Dogecoin has largely mirrored Bitcoin’s action over the past 3-4 days in that it’s also hovering around a major support level that could signal whale accumulation before the next leg up. This support comes from an upward sloping trendline that previously triggered $DOGE’s massive July rally, where the token gained more than 80% in just a couple of weeks. Even better, $DOGE’s current price on the daily chart is resting not only on that trendline but also around key moving averages – the 100, 200 EMAs – giving it multiple layers of support to potentially bounce from. Just like Bitcoin, Doge’s current weekly candle is sitting right at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, a strong signal in favor of buyers. All in all, the larger picture remains bullish. That said, in the short term (4H and 1H charts), momentum is still bearish. The ideal play now is patience. Wait for a big fat green daily candle that resets momentum and aligns the moving averages beneath price in the proper bullish sequence, potentially setting the stage for an explosive move. While Dogecoin Stalls, Maxi Doge Hits the Pre-Workout August 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Dogecoin’s stuck in a neutral zone, trading between $0.21 and $0.2221 . RSI and MACD are flat, the chart is forming a broadening triangle, and traders are sitting around waiting for a breakout. Despite bullish headlines like Wyoming’s stablecoin launch and Thumzup’s acquisition , $DOGE is not lifting. Meanwhile, newcomer, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , is tearing off its hoodie and heading straight for the squat rack. With zero-tax trading, high staking rewards (currently 214%), and a pumped-up presale, Maxi Doge channels the raw energy of motivational memes, protein-packed ambition, and laser-eyed conviction. Available now on presale for just $0.0002535, $MAXI is built for gains and glory. Find out how to buy Maxi Doge and watch $MAXI pump. Hyper Bit Mines $DOGE; $MAXI Mines Hype August 22, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Hyper Bit Technologies just locked in a deal to acquire Dogecoin Mining Technologies Corp. , securing up to 2,660 ElphaPex DG1 and DG2 miners. These rigs will be hosted at a renewable energy facility with access to 11 MW of power, giving Hyper Bit serious firepower in the $DOGE and Litecoin mining game. The move also positions Hyper Bit as one of the first publicly traded altcoin mining firms, signaling growing institutional interest in meme coin infrastructure. We view Dogecoin and Litecoin as uniquely compelling assets, offering robust mining economics and growing institutional adoption. — Mr. Dallas La Porta, President, CEO and Director of Hyper Bit But while Hyper Bit builds the backend, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is front-facing the future of meme coin culture. It’s not about mining, anymore, it’s about memeing with muscle. Maxi Doge blends Dogecoin’s charm with a gym-bro narrative: zero-tax trading, staking rewards, and a presale that’s all flex, no fluff.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending protocol has been rising stealthily against Shiba Inu (SHIB). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is worth $0.035 during stage 6 of presale. Investors in the project are on track for at least 400% in returns on investment when MUTM goes live in the market. Mutuum Finance has reached $14.7 million raised and more than 15500 buyers of tokens. Whereas Shiba Inu (SHIB) have gained cultural popularity and speculative interest, growing interest in Mutuum Finance is centered on its innovative method, sustainability, and capacity to change DeFi lending. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Trades Steady At $0.0000125 Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001254, exhibiting modest intraday action typical of ultra-liquid, Ethereum-pegged tokens. The token remains part of the overall crypto ecosystem, with ongoing ecosystem improvements, such as ShibaSwap, governance through its DAO infrastructure, and Layer-2 scaling via Shibarium, keeping the community engaged. For this reason, the ongoing discussion surrounding other Ethereum-based projects such as the Mutuum Finance $0.035 token puts SHIB at risk since MUTM have greater utility planned. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Stage 6 milestone Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale in 2025 has been a resounding success. Phase 6 sees the project now valued at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi future by bringing a platform with world real-use cases. Presale has been able to attract over 15500 token holders and over $14.7 million inflow. $100K Worth of Tokens to Be Won Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also offers a $100,000 giveaway . 10 individuals will be rewarded with a Mutuum Finance gift of $10,000 each. The giveaway is just one of the indications that the project really cares about having a lasting and a committed community. And one more step towards security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced an Official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. The project team is awarding the participants a maximum of $50,000 USDT to discover bugs in the project. The objective of the Bounty program is to identify possible vulnerabilities in the project. Four categories of vulnerabilities are employed in the program for segmentation based on their severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Dual Lending Model Mutuum Finance bases its operations on a two-lending system in which clients enjoy unprecedented flexibility as far as Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) are concerned. With the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) method, lending pools can make use of smart contracts, which have the power to determine whether to modify interest rates based on how the market scenario develops. Fixed incomes are issued by lenders, while borrowers are protected when borrowing. P2P model avoids middlemen to directly connect lending parties and borrowing parties. Any price-risky asset necessitates such purely decentralized model with maximum user autonomy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing that real-world utility can overcome meme-driven speculation. With over $14.7 million raised, 15,500+ investors, a CertiK audit, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 giveaway, the project is giving rise to both trust and growth.

Historical Q4 strength and Fed rate cut speculation support a bullish outlook. The analyst predicted a major rally ahead, but dismisses $1M Bitcoin this cycle. Anthony Pompliano has predicted that Bitcoin will begin rallying in September. Speaking on CNBC Thursday, he pointed to Bitcoin’s oversold state and historical trends showing stronger performance in autumn. Pompliano emphasized September and October timing in relation to Bitcoin’s April 2024 halving cycle and suggested the combination creates favorable conditions for price appreciation. He noted that market participants return from summer breaks and become more active during September, driving increased buying activity.

SBIグループとRipple（リップル）がRLUSDを日本で発行・流通させるための基本合意書を締結［SBIホールディングス, SBI VCトレード］ https://t.co/Bb4gusN01Y — 北尾吉孝 (@yoshitaka_kitao) August 22, 2025 In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm said the agreement formalized through a new memorandum of understanding (MOU), shows the companies’ long-standing collaboration in bringing digital assets into regulated financial ecosystems. SBI VC Trade, a licensed Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider, will lead the rollout of RLUSD in the Japanese market, further strengthening the country’s role as a hub for blockchain adoption. Stablecoin Market Poised for Growth The stablecoin sector valued at nearly $300 billion today, is projected to grow into the trillions in the coming years. As stablecoins evolve from niche tools to mainstream financial instruments, the focus is shifting from speculative use to real-world utility and institutional adoption. With this initiative, Ripple and SBI are positioning RLUSD to serve as a cornerstone for secure, transparent, and efficient digital payments. The move shows a broader trend in which global financial institutions are increasingly embracing blockchain-powered solutions to enhance liquidity, speed, and cross-border accessibility. RLUSD: Built for Compliance and Transparency RLUSD is designed as an enterprise-grade stablecoin, fully backed by high-quality reserves such as U.S. dollar deposits, short-term U.S. Treasuries, and cash equivalents. Ripple has also committed to monthly attestations by an independent accounting firm, ensuring transparency and trust for institutional and retail users alike. This emphasis on compliance distinguishes RLUSD from other stablecoins in the market, offering the kind of security and regulatory clarity that financial institutions demand. “The introduction of RLUSD will not just expand the option of stablecoins in the Japanese market, but is a major step forward in the reliability and convenience of stablecoins,” said SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo. A Milestone for Ripple and SBI’s Collaboration For Ripple and SBI, the distribution of RLUSD in Japan represents a continuation of a partnership rooted in trust and innovation. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, explains the rollout is about more than just technology—it’s about “building a trusted and compliant financial future.” The collaboration aims to establish RLUSD as a standard for bridging traditional and decentralized finance while setting new benchmarks for stablecoin utility worldwide. According to the companies, RLUSD will be made available to users in Japan during the first quarter of 2026, marking a significant step in the evolution of digital finance in the Asia-Pacific region. Ripple Backs Gemini’s IPO Filing, RLUSD Option Included Ripple has also emerged as a key backer of Gemini’s upcoming IPO, providing the exchange with a $75 million credit line that could expand to $150 million. The deal also introduces Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD, as a borrowing option once the initial facility is tapped, according to the exchange’s SEC filing . Gemini, which plans to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “GEMI”, disclosed the agreement as it filed for its long-anticipated public offering.

While Dogecoin’s golden cross points to short-term upside, Layer Brett is drawing attention for its real utility, Ethereum Layer 2 technology, and massive staking rewards. With strong momentum, analysts believe Layer Brett is primed for 50x success this quarter. Dogecoin price prediction: DOGE forms a golden cross Dogecoin (DOGE) is back in focus after establishing a bullish golden cross on its chart, with the token trading at $0.21, rallying 0.87% in the last day. This technical indicator signals a potential rally, and market analyst Omkar Godbole is predicting strong price movement in the coming weeks. The golden cross, formed by the crossover of the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), suggests that Dogecoin price prediction for 2025 will remain bullish and Dogecoin price could continue its upward trend, following a 7.5% gain over the past 14 days. Source Despite the bullish Dogecoin price prediction, Dogecoin remains volatile, with a market cap of $32.12 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.37 billion (up 17.66%). While Dogecoin’s golden cross points to short-term gains, experts suggest that looking toward meme coins with real-world utility, like Layer Brett, may offer stronger long-term investment opportunities for 2025. Layer Brett: The meme coin with real utility and growth potential Layer Brett is stepping up as more than just another meme coin. Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2, Layer Brett optimizes network efficiency while dramatically reducing fees, making it an attractive option for both meme enthusiasts and serious investors. With significant staking rewards, early participants are already seeing yields that ETH holders can only dream of. The presale has surpassed $700,000 in contributions, with 30% of the tokens allocated for presale and 25% dedicated to staking rewards. Key features of Layer Brett include: Faster transaction throughput via off-chain processing Reduced gas fees compared to Layer 1 Ethereum Enhanced staking rewards with lower operational overhead Support for MetaMask and Trust Wallet integrations On-chain purchase and staking interface directly through the official site Layer Brett’s approach blends meme coin popularity with practical DeFi utility, offering speed, simplicity, and community-driven incentives. As the presale continues, Layer Brett emerges as one of the best crypto investments for users seeking both fun and serious financial rewards. Layer Brett: The next 100x meme coin set to outperform Dogecoin While Dogecoin has earned its place as a foundational meme coin, the best crypto to invest in today isn’t Dogecoin; it’s Layer Brett . By combining meme culture with Ethereum Layer 2 technology, $LBRETT offers explosive growth potential and impressive rewards. Layer Brett has captured the attention of Dogecoin holders seeking greater upside in a project that pairs strong community energy with blockchain performance. As the 2025 crypto bull run approaches, Layer Brett is positioned for significant gains. Currently priced at $0.0044 during its presale, early stakers are already securing 6,000%+ rewards. Don’t sit on the sidelines, join the Layer Brett presale now and seize the chance to invest in the next 100x meme coin before it takes off.

According to their latest update, the project’s Risk Committee has launched an advanced Eligible Asset Framework to ensure broad asset inclusion. The new framework aims to expand the available assets that individuals can use as collateral backing the USDe stablecoin. The update has debuted with Binance Coin as the first eligible token. The team announced: As part of the new framework, BNB has been approved as the first new eligible asset backing USDe. Ethena Labs @ethena_labs · Follow The Ethena Risk Committee have established the Eligible Asset Framework, which represents a new approach to widening approved backing assets specifically for the perpetual futures portion of the collateral backing of USDe.As part of the new framework, BNB has been approved as 12:44 PM · Aug 22, 2025 118 Reply Copy link Read 9 replies That diversifies the currencies backing USDe, while highlighting Ethena’s commitment to building a flexible and resilient system for its synthetic dollar. USDe has seen remarkable performance in the past months, hitting key growth milestones. The stablecoin has elevated Ethena’s appeal as the network dominates the yield-bearing sector . Ethena’s new stablecoin framework Stablecoin has topped charts this year, especially after the friendly regulations in the United States. However, the segment is witnessing notable shifts. While giants like Tether and Circle’s USDC have dominated the stablecoin market in the past, yield-bearing options gain traction as individuals seek passive income from their idle tokens. Such shifts have contributed to Ethena’s steady growth in 2025. While stablecoins remain the cornerstone of the digital currency market, their stability often depends on the backing assets. The crypto space has seen multiple cases of stablecoins losing their pegs. Meanwhile, Ethena’s USDe promises unwavering stability through a distinct approach that relies massively on perpetual futures contracts. Ethena trusts this model would guarantee USDe’s peg in the volatile digital assets space. The new framework enriches the perpetual futures plan with greater flexibility. BNB will allow it to diversify exposure to perpetual futures, unlocking new hedging avenues while reducing systemic risks for a more balanced ecosystem. That’s a shift from the previous model, which had a somewhat narrow collateral structure that created notable risks and opportunities. The new Eligible Asset Framework allows Ethena to unlock a wider pool of digital assets. That would enable it to adapt to market fluctuation, strengthen the USDe backing. Also, it will eliminate concentration risks. The framework represents Ethena’s long-term strategy to make its stablecoin sustainable and reliable. Binance Coin in the spotlight BNB led large-cap rallies as it skyrocketed to all-time highs of around $880, fueled by institutional demand . Ethena disclosed that its Risk Committee team selected Binance Coin as the initial approved asset. The digital token boasts a market cap of over $117 billion, making its addition key. BNB is among the tokens with stable utility, powering the largest crypto exchange, Binance. Its integration bolsters USDe’s credibility and liquidity. Further, the decision reflects Ethena’s dedication to incorporating established and proven crypto assets. The community will watch which other token Ethena chooses next, after XRP and HYPE.

No, there are no new $1,390 stimulus checks coming this summer. Not for low-income earners. Not for middle-class families. Not for anyone. For about a week, some posts online have been going around, claiming that the government had greenlit another round of payments. It didn’t take long for TikTok, Reddit, and random Twitter accounts to start spinning it as confirmed fact. But sadly, there is no legislation in place right now that would allow the Treasury Department to send out fresh checks. The IRS doesn’t hand out free money unless Congress passes a bill that tells them to. And right now, no bill has passed. Not even close. IRS confirms there are no new payments An official from the IRS confirmed that “taxpayers will not receive new stimulus checks of any amount this summer.” The statement shut down the claim that $1,390 was on the way. These types of payments, known officially as economic impact payments, require federal laws, and right now there’s no such law. What triggered the rumor? Missouri’s Republican Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill in July. It’s called the American Worker Rebate Act. The bill proposes that money collected from Trump’s tariffs should be paid back to the American people as tax rebates. According to the text, the plan is to give at least $600 per person, and more if they have kids. It even suggests the rebate amount could go up if the tariff money is higher than expected. But again, that bill is just sitting there. It hasn’t been passed by the Senate or the House of Representatives. Here’s how the numbers break down. People who make under $75,000 a year would qualify for the full amount. Those earning more would get less. As of Friday, the only thing that happened with this bill is it got read twice in the Senate on July 28. Then it went straight to the Committee on Finance, where it still sits. Hawley says this is all about giving taxpayers what they’re owed. “Like President Trump proposed,” he wrote in a press release, “my legislation would allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country.” He also said, “Americans deserve a tax rebate.” IRS explains what money has actually gone out Now, to clear things up: the only actual payments the IRS has been involved in this year are tied to 2021 tax returns. Earlier in the year, the agency announced it would send out about $2.4 billion in total to people who didn’t claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. This was a refundable credit meant for folks who missed out on one or more of the COVID-19 stimulus checks. That payment maxed out at $1,400 per person. But even that’s over. To be eligible, you had to file your 2021 tax return by April 15 of this year. If you didn’t, you’re out of luck. And no, there isn’t a new credit to claim. The IRS was very clear about that. The money they distributed wasn’t new stimulus, it was just leftover credit from an older program that was already passed by Congress years ago. Let’s talk history. The IRS only sends out these types of payments when Congress tells them to. The checks that went out during the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t magically appear. They were approved through three separate bills: the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the COVID-related Tax Relief Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act. Each one spelled out how much was going out and who was getting it. Same thing happened back in 2008 during the Great Recession. The law back then was called the Economic Stimulus Act, and that’s what allowed checks to go out to people during that financial crisis. The Treasury Department is the one that actually delivers the money, and it does that through its branch, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. That team was formed in 2012 and helped with the massive payment rollout during COVID-19. But again, none of that machinery gets moving unless Congress gives the green light.

Kiyosaki: Bitcoin and Nvidia charts signal ‘big crash’,https://finbold.com/us-economist-warns-r-kiyosaki-bitcoin-and-nvidia-charts-signal-big-crash/,"The dollar is weakening, inflation pressures are mounting, and U.S. markets are approaching what some analysts warn could be the largest reset in modern history. Speaking on Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich Dad channel on August 20, veteran economist and author Harry Dent issued one of his starkest warnings yet, arguing that three of the most important charts in finance, Bitcoin ( BTC ), the Nasdaq 100, and Nvidia , are all flashing signs of a looming downturn. Dent, known for his long-term cycles research, said the recent acceleration across tech, crypto , and AI-related assets has reached the point in the industry lifecycle where a shakeout is almost inevitable. “I’ve got three charts on my desk: the Nasdaq 100, Bitcoin, and Nvidia. All three are accelerating, but in a declining channel. That tells me we’re very close to a peak — and when that happens, history shows the shakeout can be brutal,” he explained. While Nvidia has led the AI trade with explosive gains in 2024 and 2025, Dent believes its trajectory is unsustainable. “Nvidia is the only one that hasn’t quite peaked, maybe it’s got another one or two percent left, but then the same forces apply. We’ve had massive stimulation, these new technologies have emerged strongly, and now the cycle points to a correction,” he said. Dent reveals crypto won’t escape the next crash Cryptocurrency is also firmly in Dent’s crosshairs. Despite Bitcoin holding above $115,000 in mid-August and Ethereum near $4,300, Dent warned that crypto remains vulnerable to capital flight if broader risk assets falter. “Crypto is about decentralizing and automating finance. It’s revolutionary, no question, but it’s still in its infancy. That means volatility. Bitcoin may change the world, but it won’t escape the next crash,” he added. Dent emphasized that while he remains optimistic on the long-term transformative power of AI and blockchain, the timing is critical. “As much as I love these industries, all three of these charts tell me the same thing: a big crash is likely in the next couple of years. That shakeout will clear the excess and set the stage for the real growth phase.” Kiyosaki, author of the bestselling Rich Dad Poor Dad , echoed the caution, saying investors must prepare for what he described as “the biggest crash in history.” He urged viewers to reduce exposure to “fake money” like the U.S. dollar and rotate into hard assets such as gold and silver. Both metals have staged strong rallies this year, with gold up 28% year-to-date and silver climbing 29% to trade just shy of $40 an ounce. The post US Economist warns R.

However, this was short-lived, as macro data from the US led to a decline in Bitcoin and altcoins. However, analysts state that the correction is normal and they expect the rise to continue. At this point, while predictions for $150,000 and above for BTC are increasing, SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald was also among those expecting a further rise. Speaking to CNBC, SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald said she believes Bitcoin could see a sharp rise by the end of 2025. Wald, who thinks that Bitcoin could rise to $175,000, stated that this prediction is conservative compared to the predictions of other analysts. Wald stated that increasing institutional participation further strengthens the rise of Bitcoin, and that Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2030. Stating that Bitcoin predictions are no longer limited to speculation, Wald pointed out the robustness of the predictions of giant names such as Cathie Wood and Larry Fink. “Leading investors around the world, such as Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood and BlackRock Chairman Larry Fink, are setting astronomically high targets for Bitcoin’s potential. Moreover, their predictions are supported by very solid reasons based on their own models.” The famous CEO finally added that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are no longer speculative assets, but have the potential to transform global finance and that blockchain could be the foundation of markets in the future. *This is not investment advice.

The statement comes as a White House advisor indicated the Trump administration intends to proceed with a planned hike of tariffs on Indian goods over New Delhi’s oil trade with Moscow. India taken aback by U.S. U-turn on Russian oil purchases For years, the United States has been encouraging India to buy Russian oil to stabilize global energy markets, and the Asian nation is a bit taken aback by the recent U.S. U-turn on the matter, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was quoted as stating by the TASS news agency. Speaking at a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, he elaborated: “We are a country where actually the Americans said for the last few years that we should do everything to stabilize the oil energy market, including buying oil from Russia.” Jaishankar emphasized that India is not the largest buyer of Russian oil or liquefied natural gas ( LNG ), lagging behind China and Europe in that respect. He also noted his country is buying increasing amounts of oil from the U.S. “So, quite honestly, we are very perplexed by the logic of the [U.S.] arguments,” India’s top diplomat concluded, addressing journalists after a meeting of the Russian-Indian intergovernmental commission in Moscow, which he co-chaired. Earlier in August, Washington announced it will raise duties on Indian products, by 25 percentage points to a total of 50%, to pressure New Delhi over its purchases of oil and petroleum products from Russia. The new levies are set to enter into force before the end of the month. However, following talks with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, U.S. President Donald Trump hinted Washington might refrain from imposing the higher tariffs on Russia’s trading partners. China, which was also threatened with the same, has been spared for now. On Wednesday, as reported by Cryptopolitan, First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Denis Manturov made it clear that the Russian Federation is still shipping oil to India and signaled Moscow’s interest in delivering LNG as well. In an interview with TASS, India’s Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri also insisted that bilateral cooperation remains at a high level and is developing despite global instability. Trump aide calls India ‘laundromat for the Kremlin’ Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made his statements when asked to comment on recent accusations by White House Senior Advisor for Trade and Manufacturing, Peter Navarro, including that India’s purchases of Russian oil are fueling the conflict in Ukraine. The United States still plans to increase tariffs on Indian imports by 25%, President Trump’s aide indicated this week. “I see that taking place,” TASS quoted him as stating, with the punitive levies scheduled to become effective on August 27. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Navarro accused the government in New Delhi of acting as a “laundromat for the Kremlin” by buying its oil at discounted rates, refining it and then selling the products at premium prices around the world, including Europe. #WATCH | US | White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro says, ""In India, 25% tariffs were put in place because they cheat us on trade. Then 25% because of the Russian oil… In many ways, the road to peace runs through New Delhi…"" He said, ""Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine… pic.twitter.com/DxT7oUrpPV — ANI (@ANI) August 21, 2025 “Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India bought virtually no Russian oil… The argument now, when this percentage has gone up to 30-35%, that somehow they need Russian oil, is nonsense,” he elaborated. Indian refineries are profiteering from the arrangement while Moscow is using the money to build more arms, the U.S. trade advisor alleged. Claiming India’s actions are in fact perpetuating the war in Ukraine, Navarro insisted that “in many ways, the road to peace runs through New Delhi.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The 4 AIs’ Answers Surprised Us,https://cryptopotato.com/when-will-ripples-xrp-hit-a-new-all-time-high-the-4-ai-answers-surprised-us/,"TL;DR Ripple’s native token did what many thought was impossible this year by breaking its previous all-time high set over seven years ago. However, the asset has retraced by double digits since then, and the question now is when (or if) it can do it again. Here’s what some of the most popular AI solutions think about that. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Will There Be New ATH? The third-largest cryptocurrency had a strong end of 2024 when it surged from under $0.6 to roughly $3. It kept climbing in January, only to match its 2018 all-time high of $3.4, but failed to break above it. After several months of painful corrections and sideways trading, the bulls finally stepped on the gas pedal in July and did what many didn’t believe could be achieved, posting a new record of $3.65. What followed was a wave of profit-taking, and XRP quickly slipped by around 10%. The selling pressure intensified in the past few weeks, and Ripple’s token is now over 20% away from its all-time high, struggling to remain above $2.8. It has lost a crucial support ($3.00), which has now turned into resistance as all eyes are focused on tonight’s speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Looking at a broader scale, we decide to ask ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini, and Perplexity when XRP will be able to repeat its July 2025 rally and surge to a new all-time high. Disclaimer – this doesn’t have to be during the current cycle, as XRP’s top might already be in . Well, Perplexity doesn’t believe the peak for 2025 has been reached. In fact, it noted that “XRP is poised to break its all-time high again within 2025, especially in the second half of the year, which has historically gone better for its performance.” It laid out targets of around $4.50 to $5.50. Actually, two of the other three AIs tend to agree with Perplexity’s verdict. After admitting that making predictions about a crypto asset’s future price performance is anyone’s guess, ChatGPT said XRP has substantial chances of charting another record this year if “momentum and catalysts align.” Grok indicated that Ripple’s token could benefit further from some of the positive developments within the company behind it, such as recent big purchases, partnerships , and adoption, and might indeed break above $4 by the end of the year. Not All Agree While all four AI solutions believe a potential XRP ETF approval in the United States will ultimately benefit the underlying asset, Gemini provided a more controversial take. It said that Ripple’s token could mimic Ethereum’s path instead of bitcoin’s. Recall that ETH struggled for almost a year to pick up the pace in terms of institutional adoption and has only recently benefited from the financial vehicles. As such, Gemini warned that a spot XRP ETF would serve as a catalyst for price gains, but it could be long-term and not this year. As such, it added that XRP’s path to a new all-time high “is not guaranteed.” It is influenced by several factors, many of which are external, such as overall market conditions, the global economy, and regulatory clarity.

The move comes through a strategic partnership with Japanese financial conglomerate SBI Holdings and its licensed crypto exchange unit, SBI VC Trade. The rollout is expected during the first quarter of 2026 under a newly signed memorandum of understanding between the two companies. With Japan set to approve its first officially sanctioned stablecoin, Ripple’s entry marks a significant step in shaping competition in the local digital assets sector. RLUSD to be distributed in Japan through SBI VC Trade Ripple announced today that SBI VC Trade will handle the distribution of RLUSD in Japan. This partnership leverages SBI Holdings’ strong domestic presence in financial services and its established digital assets business. The initiative aims to broaden stablecoin availability in the country at a time when Japanese regulators are finalising rules for the introduction of local stablecoins. The deal signals Ripple’s deeper integration into Japan’s crypto market, where regulatory clarity and institutional backing are expected to encourage stablecoin adoption. The collaboration is also designed to strengthen Ripple’s ties with traditional finance while bridging them with decentralised systems. RLUSD’s current market position with $666 million capitalisation RLUSD, first launched in December 2024, is fully backed by US dollar deposits, short-term Treasury securities, and other liquid cash equivalents. Its reserves are independently attested every month, providing transparency for users and institutions. As of August, RLUSD’s market capitalisation stood at $666 million, making it the eighth-largest stablecoin globally by value. This places it just behind PayPal USD in CoinMarketCap’s rankings. Ripple’s planned rollout in Japan will add to this position, further expanding its share of the global stablecoin market. Expansion follows approval in Dubai earlier this year The Japanese launch comes on the heels of Ripple’s approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority in June 2025. That authorisation allowed RLUSD to integrate into the region’s regulated payments ecosystem, expanding its reach across the Middle East. The move into Japan represents Ripple’s continued effort to grow RLUSD beyond its current markets and align with regions pushing forward with stablecoin regulations. By working with licensed exchanges and financial conglomerates, Ripple positions RLUSD as a compliant product ready to integrate into cross-border payments and retail use cases. Japan preparing for first government-approved stablecoin Ripple’s entry also aligns with Japan’s progress towards introducing its first officially sanctioned stablecoin. By linking RLUSD with SBI VC Trade, the stablecoin could play a role in shaping how Japanese consumers and institutions adopt digital money under the new framework. The Japanese rollout represents not only a geographic expansion but also a test of stablecoin adoption under one of the most regulated financial markets in Asia. With $666 million already in circulation, RLUSD’s presence in Japan could set a benchmark for its adoption in other regions pursuing stablecoin regulation.

BTC traded just below $114,000 on Thursday but struggled to build momentum and push higher. Sellers ultimately overwhelmed buyers and pushed it down to a low of $111,998 before it recovered and moved to its current level. BTC is down over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $112,600. Cooling demand indicates the flagship cryptocurrency could see a further decline. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to push higher as well, with the price down nearly 1%, trading around $4,278. Ripple (XRP) is down over 2%, while Solana (SOL) is down 2.04%, trading around $183. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down nearly 3% and Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.854, down 2.50%. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines over the past 24 hours. Coinbase Lists USD1 Stablecoin Coinbase has listed World Liberty Financial’s dollar-pegged stablecoin USD1. Coinbase users can now buy, sell, convert, send, and store the USD1 stablecoin using the platform’s website or app. “World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) is now live on Coinbase and in the Coinbase iOS & Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive, or store these assets.” Coinbase stated that the USD1 stablecoin will initially be supported on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, with transfers available on Coinbase and the Coinbase Exchange in approved regions. However, local regulations may restrict availability, reflecting Coinbase’s jurisdiction-based approach to regulated stablecoins. The listing drew interest from Eric Trump, who revealed a $205 million mint of USD1 for World Liberty Financial’s treasury. US House Adds CBDC Ban To Defense Policy Bill The US House has added a provision banning the Federal Reserve from issuing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) in the country’s defense policy for the 2026 fiscal year. The House Rules Committee shared a revision of HR 3838, the House’s version of a bill that implements the National Defense Authorization Act. The revision included sweeping language banning the Fed from studying or implementing digital currency. The House had earlier passed a similar Republican-backed bill, the Anti CBDC Surveillance State Act, in July. The bill passed with a narrow 219-210 majority and now faces an uncertain future in the Senate. House Republicans had promised to include a CBDC ban in the must-pass military spending bill as part of a deal with conservative hardliners. Hardline Republicans had refused to move forward with crucial crypto bills unless a CBDC ban was guaranteed to pass, stalling a bill up for debate on the floor of the House for over nine hours. The debate eventually got underway after House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that the CBDC ban would be added to the National Defense Authorization Act. The provision bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital currency. It also prohibits the central bank from offering financial services or products directly to individuals. The bill states, “The central bank may not test, study, develop, create, or implement” a digital currency or asset.” However, it allows a carve-out for stablecoins, stating that the bill does not prohibit “any dollar-denominated currency that is open, permissionless, and private.” State Street Joins JPMorgan’s Tokenized Debt Platform State Street, one of the world’s largest asset managers, has become the first custodian to join JPMorgan’s tokenized debt platform. The partnership allows the asset manager to hold blockchain-based securities, indicating growing mainstream adoption of digital assets. The new platform, called Digital Debt Service, enables clients to trade and settle tokenized government and corporate bonds on a blockchain. State Street purchased $100 million in tokenized commercial debt from the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation as part of the launch. Institutional adoption of blockchain technology has jumped in 2025, thanks to favorable US regulations and the approval of the GENIUS Act. Gemini Secures MiCA License In Malta The Gemini cryptocurrency exchange has secured a MiCA license from the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA). The license allows the exchange to expand into Europe and offer its products in over 30 European countries and jurisdictions. Gemini released a statement announcing the news, “Receiving this approval marks a critical milestone in our regulated European expansion, as it will allow us to expand our secure and reliable crypto products for customers in over 30 European countries and jurisdictions.” The announcement comes after Gemini filed to list its Class A Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the GEMI ticker. Gemini highlighted the importance of MiCA in crypto adoption, stating, “Today’s announcement cements Gemini’s long-standing dedication to upholding the highest standards of regulatory compliance as we scale in the region. We believe that clear regulation of the industry is the foundation of global crypto adoption, and MiCA’s implementation has proven that Europe is one of the most innovative and forward-thinking regions regarding this.” Pennsylvania Proposes Ban On Public Officials Trading Crypto Ben Waxman, a Democrat representing District 182 in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives, has introduced legislation to prohibit elected officials from profiting from crypto while they hold office. The lawmaker introduced HB1812 on Wednesday, supported by eight co-sponsors, in response to what he refers to as “corruption” perpetuated at the federal level by President Donald Trump. “In Pennsylvania, no public official should be allowed to use their office to enrich themselves through cryptocurrency schemes. That’s why I’m introducing legislation to prohibit elected officials from profiting off cryptocurrency while in office. This includes launching, promoting, or trading in coins where they hold a personal financial interest.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) investors are hoping to enter the weekend on a positive note, with the price marginally up during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to build momentum as demand cools. BTC started the week in the red and dropped to nearly 3% on Tuesday, settling at $112,586. Wednesday saw a recovery, but price action was back in the red on Thursday as BTC fell below $112,000, dropping to an intraday low of $111,964 before rebounding. BTC is barely clinging to the $113,000 mark, with investor sentiment weakening and demand cooling. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to make a decisive push upwards and is down nearly 8% over the past week, indicating that bears hold sway over the market. The downturn puts BTC around 8.5% lower than its all-time high, with analysts questioning the asset’s short-term direction. Data from Coinglass shows a dip in open interest as well. Open interest cooled 0.36% over the past 24 hours, falling to $37.9 billion. 24-hour trading volume also dropped nearly 8% over the past 24 hours. BTC’s recent weakness comes amid a broader trend of falling demand and profit-taking. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin accumulation by the market has registered a sharp drop, falling from 174,000 BTC in July to 59,000 BTC. Institutional interest has also cooled, with Bitcoin ETFs scooping up a modest 11,000 BTC, the lowest since April. Corporate accumulation has also declined, with Strategy accumulating only 27,000 BTC over the past 30 days, compared to 171,000 BTC in November 2024. “Bitcoin demand is fading. Apparent demand dropped from 174K BTC in July to just 59K today. ETF buying also hit a 4-month low, while MSTR slowed sharply. Weak demand growth points to more consolidation ahead.” According to CryptoQuant, BTC could enter a period of consolidation as demand weakens. BTC holders are also locking in their profits, realizing $74 billion in profits since July 4, and another $2 billion by whale investors. This has also added to substantial downward pressure on BTC. According to CryptoQuant’s Bull Score, the market has moved from “Extra Bullish” to “Bullish Cooldown.” However, analysts believe downside risk is limited for now. BTC started the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 1% and settling at $116,683. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline to $116,492. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising 2.42% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,309. BTC reached an intraday high of $122,319 on Monday as bullish sentiment intensified. Despite the positive start, it lost momentum and settled at $118,701, ultimately dropping 0.51%. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.19% to cross $120,000 and settle at $120,113.

Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has rebounded during the ongoing session, up over 1% and trading around $4,350. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency held a crucial support level despite selling pressure and is eying a potential recovery. Traders are also bracing for potential volatility ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium. ETH reached a yearly high on August 14. However, it failed to continue its upward trajectory, quickly dropping below $4,500. The price fell to $4,076 on Tuesday before rebounding and moving to its current level. Sluggish price action has not stopped institutional interest in the asset, with ETH up almost 15% over the past month. Billionaire Peter Thiel has thrown his weight behind the asset, betting that the underlying blockchain could become Wall Street’s preferred choice to launch new financial products. ETH started the previous week in positive territory, rising 2.52% on Friday (August 8) to cross $4,000. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose over 6% and settled at $4,262. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, registering a marginal drop. Selling pressure persisted on Monday as ETH fell 0.59% to $4,226. Bullish sentiment returned on Tuesday as the price rallied, rising almost 9% to cross $4,500 and settle at $4,589. ETH continued to push upwards on Wednesday, rising 3.40% to cross $4,700 and settle at $4,745. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Thursday, dropping over 4% to $4,551.

Despite ending the weekend positively, ETH was back in the red on Monday, dropping 3.58% to a low of $4,229 before settling at $4,316. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as the price fell 5.54% to $4,076. ETH made a strong recovery on Wednesday, rising over 6% to reclaim $4,300 and settle at $4,338. Despite the positive sentiment, ETH was back in the red on Thursday, dropping nearly 3% to $4,225. The price is back in positive territory during the ongoing session, up over 2%, trading around $4,321. ETH could extend its recovery if it holds on to its daily support level. However, a break below this level could drag the price towards $4,000. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) has dropped sharply during the ongoing session as volatility continues to dictate price action. The altcoin lost momentum after pushing above $200 last Thursday, when it reached an intraday high of $209. The price quickly fell to a low of $183 and reached a low of $175 by the middle of the current week. SOL led gains over the past 24 hours, but with volatility persisting, it finds itself back in the red, down over 1%. Weak data has boosted rate cut expectations. However, with tariff-driven inflation still higher than acceptable levels, risk asset holders could expect disappointment. Nick Rug, Director at LVRG Research, stated, “The Fed faces a difficult balancing act — cut too soon and risk reigniting inflation, wait too long and growth risks deepen.” SOL ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.52% to $182. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping over 4%, slipping below $180 to $174. Bullish sentiment returned on Tuesday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 10% to cross $190 and settle at $191. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price continued pushing higher, rising over 5% to cross $200 and settle at $201. SOL reached an intraday high of $209 on Thursday as bullish sentiment intensified. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell by over 4% to $192.

The company's AAVE borrowing strategy remains profitable, even with rising borrowing costs and lower ETH staking yields. Dilution and high short interest are key risks, but the current valuation more than compensates for these concerns. Given the net ETH metric and discounted share price, I now rate BTCS as a 'buy' for ETH Treasury exposure. I initiated coverage of BTCS Inc. ( BTCS ) for Seeking Alpha a little over a month ago, given the company's pivot to a digital asset treasury business. At that time, I rated the stock a 'hold' and specifically mentioned dilution as a concern because of some of the language in the ATM prospectus. Most notably, BTCS wouldn't provide specifics regarding how much capital from the ATM would be utilized for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) purchases. Since then, we have a Q2 earnings report to assess as well as clearer data regarding ETH acquisitions. In this update, we'll look at that data, and I'll explain why I think an upgrade is warranted despite the risks. Q2 Earnings Data by YCharts For the quarter ended June, BTCS reported $2.8 million in top-line revenue, all from blockchain infrastructure operations. The company separates its blockchain ops revenue into two different buckets: NodeOps and Builder+. NodeOps derives revenue from natively staking assets on-chain as well as through delegation. Builder+ works a bit differently, as BTCS is purchasing block space and then bundling mempool transactions that it then proposes to validators. This is how the company explains the process for Ethereum in the 10-Q: Revenue recognition for these activities, conducted through Builder+, entails the recognition of gas fees (or ""transaction fees"") and priority fees (or ""tips"") earned in exchange for successfully constructing blocks of bundled transactions and having these blocks selected and proposed by a validator to the Ethereum network for validation and successfully finalized on the network. The breakout between NodeOps and Builder+ for both the quarter ended and six months ended June looks like this: Revenue by Segment (BTCS Inc 10-Q) At 86% of blockchain ops revenue so far this year, Builder+ is by far the biggest driver of BTCS's top line. NodeOps generates income from multiple different smart contract chains, including Ethereum, Cosmos ( ATOM-USD ), Solana ( SOL-USD ), NEAR Protocol ( NEAR-USD), and Axie Infinity ( AXS-USD ). Builder+ generated revenue primarily from ETH, with $3.5 million of the $3.9 million Builder+ revenue this year coming from Ethereum; the remainder came from BNB Chain ( BNB-USD ). While Builder+ drives top-line, the margins for these businesses are quite different according to the 10-Q: Revenue H1 2025 H1 2024 NodeOps $602,263 $903,692 Builder+ $3,858,870 $108,886 Cost of Rev H1 2025 H1 2024 NodeOps $60,021 $99,367 Builder+ $4,361,771 $230,106 Margin H1 2025 H1 2024 NodeOps 90.03% 89.00% Builder+ -13.03% -111.33% Source: BTCS, 10-Q The margins for NodeOps are fantastic. Margins for Builder+, while much better in 2025, indicate that the segment actually loses money. The company says that the cost of revenues for Builder+ includes node maintenance employee salaries as well as infrastructure hosting. In any case, it looks as though BTCS Inc. would be better off doing nothing at all and sitting on its ETH rather than consolidating transactions - at least in a low-fee environment. As I understand the model, the company purchases block space through 'a fixed, non-negotiable' fee paid to network validators. This could theoretically make transaction bundling profitable for BTCS in a higher-fee environment. But we'll have to see how that plays out should Ethereum ever return to a fee-growth network. ETH Treasury and AAVE Strategy Subsequent to earnings, BTCS has disclosed owning over 70k ETH. At current Ethereum prices, the company's ETH holdings have a market value of just under $300 million: BTCS ETH Holdings (StrategicETHreserve.xyz) Yet, the market cap of just $208.5 million seemingly presents an arbitrage. With most of the other 'ETH Treasury' companies in the equity market trading at premiums to NAV, BTCS trades at a 30% discount to ETH holdings. Screaming buy? It's a bit more complicated than that. Subsequent to the company's earnings report and ETH purchases, BTCS borrowed an additional $47 million from lending protocol Aave ( AAVE-USD ): As of August 12, 2025, the Company had approximately $51,702,000 in outstanding borrowings, inclusive of accrued interest, collateralized by approximately 38,400 ETH with a fair market value of approximately $176,062,000, based on the ETH closing price of $4,584 on that date. It would be straightforward arbitrage to buy BTCS at a 30% discount to holdings if the ETH was natively staked and earning passive yield. However, I think the discount for BTCS is likely due to concerns about the company's AAVE borrowings, even though BTCS's AAVE loan is overcollateralized. Admittedly, AAVE yields have moved against BTCS since it took out its latest loans: USDT Borrow Rates through AAVE (DeFi Lllama) At present, borrowing Tether ( USDT-USD ) through AAVE has an APY of 6.5% percent. During the time period that BTCS took out the loans, AAVE USDT APYs were closer to 5.5%. Meaning, BTCS has already seen its borrowing cost increase in less than two weeks. The reason for this spike in borrowing cost is that the amount of USDT available to borrow through AAVE has fallen from $1.4 billion on August 1st to just $442 million as of article submission. But as yields from borrowing increase, so too does the yield from providing liquidity. Thus, I expect AAVE's USDT borrow rates may actually come back down as more liquidity chases dollar-denominated yields that exceed the rate of t-bills. Even though BTCS is staking the ETH to generate yield, staking rewards from the Ethereum blockchain have fallen below 3%. So on the surface, the company is borrowing at 6.5% to stake (or lend, if that helps) at 3% while the value of the asset being staked may have peaked temporarily. But even still, I think the discount for BTCS shares is too extreme given what the company has actually been doing. The table below is my rough estimate of what the company would generate in earnings given current borrow cost, supply cost, and staking yield: ETH Strategy ETH $ Value Rate Annual Pledged ETH 38,400 $163,776,000 2.30% $3,766,848 Purchased with Borrowed USDT 16,100 $68,666,500 2.92% $2,005,062 Borrowed USDT -$52,000,000 6.50% -$3,380,000 Net Earnings From ETH Strategy $2,391,910 Source: BTCS, Analyst's estimates at $4,265 ETH price Even at sub-3% staking yields, 6.5% USDT borrow cost, and 2.3% from collaraterlized ETH, this strategy is well in the black by my math. In fact, even if ETH fell to $3,500 and USDT borrow costs through AAVE rose to 9%, this strategy would still be slightly profitable. So what is BTCS worth? I think the right way to look at BTCS valuation is 'net ETH' rather than the market cap to Treasury holdings metrics that we generally see with these kinds of companies. BTCS 'net ETH' Calculation Total ETH 70,140 Loan $ Value $52,000,000 Loan in ETH 12,381 Net ETH 57,759 $ Value at $4,200 $242,588,000 Shares outstanding 48,000,000 Net ETH Per Share $5.05 True Discount 14.72% Source: BTCS Inc., Analyst's estimates The math in the table above shows a hypothetical situation in which BTCS sells $52 million in ETH to pay off its AAVE loan. This would require 12,381 ETH at current prices, leaving almost 58k ETH and a gain of nearly 4k ETH on the loan. It also indicates that at an ETH price of $4,200 per coin, BTCS has a 'net ETH' value slightly above $5 per share. Key Risks As I mentioned in my first piece covering BTCS shares, dilution remains a major concern for BTCS shareholders. We've already seen shares outstanding explode since the end of Q2: Data by YCharts Furthermore, the company had a small fraction of the ETH it currently has when I last covered the company in July, yet the share price is essentially flat. Data by YCharts Something else to consider is that short interest in this stock is getting aggressive, with nearly 14% of shares outstanding currently sold short. This is a larger level of short interest currently than what we see in other ETH Treasury companies like SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) or Bitmine Immersion ( BMNR ). From where I sit, it's hard to blame the bears for this level of conviction given BTCS's history of operating losses. Closing Thoughts This may come as a surprise to some of my readers, but I'm actually much less pessimistic about BTCS at this point in time. That change in sentiment is mainly due to the equity valuation relative to the ETH held in reserve. Sure, some of this has been pledged as collateral. But given the company's collateralization ratio, ETH would likely have to fall below $2,000 per coin before any loan liquidation fears would manifest. I don't think that's a concern short of an economic calamity akin to COVID. If we observe the company's valuation through the net ETH metric, BTCS shares are trading at a discount and should likely be closer to $5. I've changed my mind on BTCS. I actually think it's an interesting ETH Treasury spec on its AAVE strategy alone. Factor in that it's trading at a discount to net ETH value, and I think it's one of the better ways to play ETH treasuries in the market right now. To be sure, the negative margins from Builder+ are a concern. But those losses are more than made up for by the spread from the company's AAVE protocol usage. Short interest is high and growing. I don't mind being contrarian here. In my view, BTCS is a 'Buy.'",ETH-USD|BTCS,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|AAVE|BUSINESS|USDT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-22 12:00:00

In 2028, the DOT price can reach a maximum of $17.62 and a minimum of $14.82. The price of Polkadot is predicted to reach a maximum value of $55.70 in 2031. Polkadot (DOT) has shown impressive growth and resilience in a volatile cryptocurrency market, supported by its strong multichain protocol architecture and investor confidence. A major contributor to this success is the Sinai Upgrade on its Acala Network, enhancing functionality and security. With over 32 million transactions validated in October 2024 by the Polkadot Relay Chain, the network demonstrates significant activity and utility. A notable increase in unique wallets further signals growing user adoption and engagement, strengthening Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Will DOT reach new heights soon? Let’s get into the Polkadot price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polkadot Token DOT Price $3.81 Market Cap $5.83B Trading Volume $224.61M Circulating Supply 1.6B DOT All-time High $55.00 Nov 4, 2021 All-time Low $2.69 Aug 19, 2020 24-hour High $3.87 24-hour Low $3.78 Polkadot price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 7.93% 50-Day SMA $ 3.80 14-Day RSI 45.36 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 60(Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $ 4.13 Polkadot price analysis: DOT bearish pressure holds as price tests key levels Price is consolidating between $3.78 support and $3.87 resistance, signaling market indecision and a potential breakout setup. Repeated rejections below $3.87 show that selling pressure remains strong, capping any upside attempts. On the 4-hour chart, lower highs point to weakening bullish efforts, increasing the risk of a drop below $3.78. Polkadot (DOT) on August 22, 2025, is trading at $3.81, reflecting a 0.21% intraday decline, according to CoinMarketCap data. The price action shows a minor downward pressure as traders assess near-term resistance and support levels. DOT has maintained a relatively tight range within the last 24 hours, fluctuating between a low of $3.78 and a high of $3.87. These levels currently serve as short-term support at $3.78 and resistance at $3.87, with price consolidating in a narrow band amid light trading volumes. Polkadot daily price chart: DOT key compression between $3.78 and $3.87 On the 1-day chart, Polkadot (DOT) is trading in a consolidation phase, locked between the $3.78 support and $3.87 resistance. The current structure shows a lack of strong directional conviction. Sellers have capped upside momentum just below the resistance, while buyers have repeatedly stepped in around $3.78 to defend the downside. This is creating a tight channel, commonly associated with indecision or preparation for a breakout. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily timeframe hovers around the 50 mark, confirming the neutral bias. Volume levels are low, and no significant bullish divergence is present. If bears push below the $3.78 support, a further decline toward $3.70 becomes likely. However, if bulls can breach the $3.87 level with volume, the next key target would be $4.00, which also acts as a psychological resistance level. The current setup demands patience as DOT compresses within this narrow range. Polkadot 4-hour price chart: DOT lower highs signal short-term bearish control On the 4-hour chart, DOT shows a sequence of lower highs, indicating short-term bearish control. The price has failed to establish any momentum beyond the $3.84 minor resistance, with each rally attempt being sold off quickly. This microstructure suggests a weak bullish effort and a lack of follow-through buying interest. DOT/USDT Chart: TradingView Support continues to sit at $3.78, which remains a key level for intraday bulls to defend. A break below this level on the 4-hour timeframe would indicate increasing downward pressure and may lead to a short-term selloff. With momentum indicators also tilting slightly bearish, traders are watching for a clean rejection or breakout signal to guide near-term positioning. Polkadot technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 3.72 SELL SMA 5 $ 3.79 SELL SMA 10 $ 3.90 SELL SMA 21 $ 4.13 SELL SMA 50 $ 3.80 SELL SMA 100 $ 4.11 SELL SMA 200 $ 4.13 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 3.89 SELL EMA 5 $ 3.90 SELL EMA 10 $ 3.94 SELL EMA 21 $ 4.02 SELL EMA 50 $ 4.30 SELL EMA 100 $ 4.80 SELL EMA 200 $ 5.29 SELL What to Expect Next for Polkadot (DOT)? With DOT trading in a narrow consolidation zone, a breakout in either direction appears increasingly likely. If price breaks above the $3.87 resistance, the next logical target is $4.00, a level that carries both technical and psychological significance. A sustained move above this level could trigger fresh buying interest. On the downside, a failure to hold the $3.78 support would likely confirm bearish continuation, opening the door toward $3.70 and possibly lower. The presence of lower highs on intraday charts suggests sellers are still in control in the short term. Traders are closely watching for a decisive move outside this range to set the tone for DOT’s next direction. Is Polkadot a good investment? Polkadot offers strong long-term potential due to its interoperability-focused architecture and growing ecosystem. However, its price remains under pressure and well below previous highs. Short-term risks remain due to market volatility and weak technical momentum. As with any crypto asset, investment decisions should be based on personal risk tolerance and research. Why is Polkadot Down today? Polkadot (DOT) is down 0.21% today, trading at $3.81, as it faces continued resistance at $3.87 and struggles to hold above key support at $3.78. The decline reflects weak intraday momentum and ongoing market indecision within a tight trading range. Broader altcoin sentiment remains muted, with no major bullish catalysts driving price action. Technical pressure from lower highs on lower timeframes also points to a lack of strong buying interest, contributing to today’s slight pullback. Will Polkadot recover? Polkadot (DOT) shows signs of recovery with a recent upward trend. If favorable market conditions continue, we could see a bullish trend, and Polkadot has the potential to recover. Will Polkadot reach $10? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $10 by 2027. Will Polkadot reach $50? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, Polkadot is projected to reach up to $50 by 2031. Will Polkadot reach $100? Reaching $100 for Polkadot (DOT) is highly ambitious and unlikely in the near term. Does Polkadot have a promising long-term future? Based on Polkadot’s ongoing buying demand and positive community support, the DOT price is set to make new highs in the coming years. However, you are advised to do your research before investing in the volatile market. Polkadot price prediction August 2025 Here are the current Polkadot price movements in August 2025.

In 2022, Polkadot price steadily declined, starting the year around $30 and dropping below $10 by mid-year. By the end of 2022, the price stabilized near $5 as bearish market conditions dominated the cryptocurrency space. The price of DOT hovered between $5 and $7 for most of 2023, reflecting a period of consolidation and limited market excitement. In January 2024, Polkadot’s price remained relatively stable, trading around the $5–$6 range. By July 2024, Polkadot showed slight signs of recovery, with its price rising to around $7–$8. This modest uptick was likely driven by increasing market interest. In December 2024, Polkadot showed signs of recovery, with its price climbing to around $10.4. In January 2025, Polkadot peaked at $7.98 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $4.64 – $5.28 in February. In March, 2025, Polkadot (DOT) traded at approximately $4.30. In April 2025, Polkadot (DOT) experienced a gradual downtrend, with its price hovering slightly below the $4 mark amid ongoing market volatility. In May, Polkadot (DOT) began trading at around $4.1 and showed moderate fluctuations. As of the latest update, the price has declined slightly and is hovering near $3.9, reflecting a mild bearish trend so far. Polkadot (DOT) declined from a high of around $4.20 to approximately $3.30 in June, with a consistent downtrend and brief rebounds near $3.60 in July.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,DOT|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|ASTR|BUSINESS|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-22 12:00:00

On-Chain Models Hint At A Massive Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-explode-on-chain-models-massive-rally/,"An emerging set of on-chain and market structure signals suggests Dogecoin could be coiling for a fresh advance, according to analytics platform Alphractal, which published a new chart pack and methodology notes on X on August 21. The firm argues that miner resilience, a stable “Network Stress Index,” and model-derived bands such as Alpha Price and CVDD have lined up in a way that historically preceded major DOGE trend accelerations. $1 Dogecoin Back In Play? “Dogecoin’s miners remain incredibly resilient, with hash rate activity pushing toward record highs,” Alphractal wrote, before posing the core question animating its latest study: “Could trading around True Market Mean Price and models like Alpha Price and CVDD pave the way for a potential new all-time high in DOGE?” At the foundation of the call is a composite gauge the firm calls the Network Stress Index. It blends three dimensions of chain health and pressure—“Fee Stress (fees / market cap – 40% weight), Hash Stress (30-day hash rate volatility – 30% weight), [and] Supply Stress (7-day active supply volatility – 30% weight).” Related Reading: Dogecoin Targets $1.25, But This 170% Move Is The Start As Alphractal summarizes the read-through: “Higher values suggest potential instability or major transitions. Lower values reflect a balanced network across economic, security, and activity dimensions.” In the current regime, the firm says the indicator “signals stability — showing no warning signs of network risk.” Beyond raw network conditions, Alphractal overlays two valuation and cycle tools it says have been reliable for UTXO chains such as DOGE, Bitcoin and Litecoin. “Our Alpha Price model works like a magnetic force for sentiment,” the firm noted, describing a behavioral anchor that price tends to respect over time. It pairs that with an adjusted version of Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD), a metric that tracks the age-weighted value of coins moving on-chain. “Our advanced CVDD adjustment has proven to be one of the most accurate tools for identifying tops and bottoms in UTXO blockchains like DOGE, BTC, and LTC,” Alphractal wrote. Where those models sit today is central to the thesis. “Currently, the CVDD Top sits at $0.54, but it can climb higher as dormant Dogecoins move — potentially pushing targets above $1,” the post states. The implication is explicitly conditional: if a rally entices long-inactive supply to circulate, the top band would ratchet upward, turning $0.54 from a ceiling into what Alphractal calls “just the starting floor, with euphoric network activity driving further upside.” The firm frames miner posture as a reinforcing pillar. With hash rate activity “pushing toward record highs,” the view is that security spend and miner participation leave the network well positioned “for a surge in global demand.” That strength, together with price action clustering near what Alphractal labels True Market Mean Price, is presented as the setup phase that has preceded prior Dogecoin expansions on the attached Network Stress, Alpha Price, and CVDD charts dated August 21. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Don’t Bet Against This Chart, Says Analyst Even so, the message is not unqualifiedly bullish. Alphractal closes with a risk caveat tailored to crypto’s current market microstructure: “This opportunity may be sustainable… Still, with leverage building across crypto markets, traders must remain cautious of sudden traps and mass liquidations as DOGE gains momentum.” In other words, while the model complex sketches a constructive backdrop, positioning and derivatives dynamics could inject sharp downside shocks along the path. Taken together, Alphractal’s work posits a simple, testable roadmap: a stable network, resilient miners, and price hewing to historically meaningful on-chain bands create room for upside, with the CVDD “Top” currently marked at $0.54 and mechanically capable of rising toward and “above $1” if dormant supply awakens. Whether Dogecoin converts that setup into a full breakout will hinge on the interplay between organic spot demand and a leveraged market prone to abrupt squeezes in both directions. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.218.

50490617,562984,1755864038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50490617.jpeg,Cornell Professor Claims Bitcoin Was An NSA Creation—Expert Pushes Back,https://bitcoinist.com/cornell-professor-bitcoin-nsa-creation/,"A fresh round of speculation about Bitcoin’s origins erupted this week after Cornell professor Dave Collum told Tucker Carlson that “the first paper on crypto was written by three NSA guys,” advancing a theory that US intelligence seeded BTC to acclimate the public to a future of central bank digital currencies. “I’d release the crypto. I’d have guys pumping it… let them debug the networks… and then I’d say, ‘Okay, it was fun. We’ll take it from here,’” Collum argued , suggesting that elites would never permit an uncontrolled monetary network to survive. Was Bitcoin Created By The NSA? Swan Bitcoin’s daily program No Second Best devoted its August 21 episode to the claim—and to the broader idea that Bitcoin, stablecoins, and US public debt are entangled in ways that conspiracy narratives miss. Host Hurley framed the NSA-origin story as a persistent myth that “just won’t die,” then pivoted to a different “Trojan horse” dynamic: dollar stablecoins absorbing short-term Treasury issuance and, in some issuers’ cases, directing part of the resulting income toward Bitcoin. “While Tucker and Collum are busy chasing CIA shadows,” Hurley said, “there is a real Trojan horse at play. But it’s not Bitcoin being used by governments. It’s stablecoins and US debt quietly paving the way for Bitcoin’s rise.”At the core of Collum’s argument is a real historical artifact: “How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash,” a 1996–97 paper credited to three researchers in the National Security Agency’s Cryptology Division. Its survey of e-cash concepts predates Bitcoin by more than a decade, and it has long fueled speculation about official-sector interest in digital cash architectures. But existence is not authorship. The paper does not propose Bitcoin’s design, and nothing in the public record links the NSA to the creation of the Bitcoin protocol released by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008–09. Collum, however, insisted that elite families and institutions would never allow a truly free monetary protocol to dethrone them. “Do you think the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds are going to hand it over to Max Keiser and Michael Saylor? I don’t think so.” For him, Bitcoin is not an escape route but a setup. “If I were smart and I were going to bring in central bank digital currency, which is an authoritarian nightmare, I would do it the way they did. I’d release the crypto. I’d have guys pumping it. I’d have guys supporting it. I’d let them debug the networks and the kinks and acclimate people to it. And then I’d say, ‘Okay, it was fun. We’ll take it from here.’” Hurley countered that logic head-on. “Here’s the thing, it already is happening. The protocol doesn’t ask permission. It doesn’t need approval from the Rockefellers or the Rothschilds or any US administration. For one thing, there’s absolutely no evidence that the CIA or the NSA or any other three-letter agency created Bitcoin.”He also dismissed linguistic conspiracy arguments outright: “If this was the NSA’s super-secret project, why would they hide the clue in plain sight inside a Google-translatable Japanese name? To twist Satoshi Nakamoto into CIA code is peak conspiracy brain.” The name-as-clue trope—often summarized as “Satoshi = intelligence, Nakamoto = central origin, therefore ‘central intelligence’”— collapses under scrutiny. Satoshi is a common Japanese given name meaning “intelligent,” “wise,” or similar, while Nakamoto is a routine surname typically glossed as “central origin” or “one who lives in the middle.” That is linguistics, not cryptography, and it doesn’t imply an intelligence-agency signature. More importantly, even if a government employee had once explored ideas adjacent to e-cash, BTC’s governance and code availability undercut the “trapdoor” thesis. Bitcoin Core is open-source software published under the permissive MIT license; the codebase, development process, and consensus rules are public, auditable, and forkable. No hidden “off switch” has ever been demonstrated in 16 years of global adversarial testing—an empirical record that matters more than origin mythology. Is Bitcoin A Trojan Horse? Where the Swan episode shifted the conversation was in connecting stablecoin market structure to US debt issuance—an institutional story rather than a clandestine one. Hurley highlighted the irony: “The real theft of liberty is happening through fiat itself. Your savings diluted by 7, 10, or 15 percent a year—that’s state-sanctioned financial slavery. Cash might give you short-term transactional privacy, but Bitcoin gives you long-term sovereignty.” In July, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act , the first US federal stablecoin law, which requires 1:1 reserves in cash and short-term Treasuries (among other disclosures and licensing provisions). That legal architecture explicitly channels payment-stablecoin collateral into highly liquid dollar assets. That pipeline already exists in practice. Tether —by far the largest dollar stablecoin—reported in its latest attestation that it has become one of the largest holders of US Treasury bills, with a triple-digit-billion exposure, and it also holds Bitcoin directly on its balance sheet. Company disclosures suggest Bitcoin remains a single-digit percentage of reserves, but a disproportionately large driver of profits during rising markets. Those facts support, without proving, the show’s thesis that the dollar-stablecoin complex can act as a conduit from Treasury coupons to Bitcoin accumulation. Preston Pysh pushed the point on stage at the Baltic Honeybadger conference two weeks ago, arguing that short-duration Treasury issuance has found a “natural buyer” in stablecoin issuers who prefer minimal duration risk—and that some issuers then “sweep” income into Bitcoin, reinforcing the asset’s monetization over time. Whether this represents a “Trojan horse” for Bitcoin or simply rational treasury management by private firms is debatable, but the mechanism he sketched is plainly visible in public filings and market behavior. Hurley concluded: “Bitcoin is the Trojan horse, but for freedom. The endgame is Bitcoin itself.” At press time, BTC traded at $113,045.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|Bitcoin NSA Theory|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Dave Collum|NSA,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 12:00:38

He predicted that XRP would be worth $73,000 in the future, drawing a broad range of comments from the community. The statement rests on a familiar bullish premise that if global payment flows increasingly settle through networks that use XRP as a bridge asset , expanding utility, liquidity, and regulated market access could reprice the token far beyond conventional forecasts. However, many believe this target is too ambitious. XRP will be worth 73,000* a token in the future. — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) August 20, 2025 Community Responses Some users showed interest, suggesting they were watching for more context and a clearer timeframe for such an outcome. Others immediately questioned the prediction, as Jay wrote the price target as “73,000*”, ignoring the dollar sign and suggesting that his target may be referencing a different target. However, most community members interpreted this target as $73,000. One commenter praised the conviction behind the call, another focused on mechanics, asking how a move of that magnitude would unfold, whether this large spike would hold, or if the asset would lose support and experience a significant decline. One long-term holder wanted practical details, including a date and the reasoning behind the confidence. She noted that she has held XRP for years and would like to see some massive gains and use the money. Another commenter responded with humor, asking for a ride on Time Traveler’s time machine so they could both find out next week’s lottery numbers and purchase more crypto with the winnings. Some community members also pushed back against the prediction, with one commenter stating that the asset can’t hit that target, and another suggesting that Time Traveler refrain from dismissing predictions without analysis.

Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for digital assets have widened access for traditional investors. If an XRP-linked product were approved in major markets, it could route new demand to the asset and trigger a notable price increase. Institutional readiness has also improved as custody and compliance tools have matured. On the utility side, Ripple’s enterprise solutions target cross-border payments , and on-demand liquidity could also play a role. Time Traveler’s target is extreme, but real-world utility could play a major role in helping the asset reach similar high targets.

Whales have accumulated roughly 680 million DOGE through August, reflecting continued confidence despite potential risks around Qubic’s 51% concerns. Yet, while Dogecoin maintains strong technical support, many investors are eyeing Remittix as a high-growth alternative for the coming years. Dogecoin Price Dynamics Remain Bullish but Range-Bound Dogecoin has been holding its pivotal level at $0.21 on the charts and it tested this level mid-session before being sold off heavily. There has been resistance at the 0.22 mark, making a trading range of 0.01 the intraday volatility. Although the narrow band, larger buyers are also on the move hinting at a possible way to hit the dollar mark in case this bullish trend has continued. High-volume turnover of 6.8 million per minute in the final hour reinforces the view that institutional players are influencing price action. Analysts note that as long as the support holds, Dogecoin could maintain its upward trajectory, though it faces hurdles in scaling beyond the current resistance levels without sustained buying pressure. Why This $0.09 Altcoin Is Gaining Whale Attention While Dogecoin charts suggest a potential rally, Remittix (RTX) has captured the focus of large investors due to its cross-border payment utility and strong adoption momentum. Currently priced at $0.0969, Remittix has raised over $20.6 million and sold 612 million tokens, positioning itself as a serious contender for those looking beyond speculative gains. With a second CEX listing at $22M, Remittix continues to expand accessibility, making it an attractive vehicle for high-growth exposure in 2026 and beyond.

The update comes after the tool accurately flagged XRP’s prior local top before its recent pullback. As of report time, XRP trades near $2.86, leaving traders closely watching to see if this signal can spark a rebound. Why the TD Sequential Matters The TD Sequential is a widely used technical indicator designed to spot trend exhaustion and possible reversal points. It counts a series of candlestick closes to determine when selling or buying momentum is overextended. A completed “buy” setup often appears after sustained declines, signaling that a price recovery may be near. Ali emphasized that XRP has now printed such a buy signal—just after the same indicator previously marked the exact local top. This combination of accuracy at the high and now at the potential low has made the market take the development seriously. After perfectly calling the top, TD Sequential flips to buy on $XRP ! pic.twitter.com/f69FXPJPWR — Ali (@ali_charts) August 22, 2025 XRP’s Market Context XRP has been under pressure since peaking above $3.00, pulling back into the $2.80 range over the past week. Intraday levels on August 22 show the token fluctuating between $2.83 and $2.92, with the price stabilizing after a 10–16% correction from its recent highs. This consolidation phase reflects uncertainty, as traders await confirmation that the TD buy signal marks a genuine shift in momentum rather than a temporary pause. Why Traders Are Paying Attention The signal has also gained traction in crypto media circles, where analysts note the TD Sequential’s alignment with other signs of bottoming activity. Reports point to possible whale accumulation and improving risk-reward conditions if XRP can reclaim the low-$3 zone. While projections vary, the consensus is that the setup reflects fading downside momentum and the potential for a reversal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Could Confirm or Invalidate the Signal A TD buy signal is not a guarantee—it is a setup. Confirmation requires strong follow-through, particularly with XRP reclaiming resistance around $3.10 to $3.30. A push above these levels with increased trading volume would strengthen the bullish case. On the other hand, failure to hold the $2.80s or a swift rejection near $3 could weaken the signal and suggest further downside. Outlook Ali’s declaration that the TD Sequential has flipped to buy on XRP has captured attention across the market, especially given the tool’s track record of correctly flagging the recent top. For XRP holders, the signal offers cautious optimism: it highlights the possibility of a trend reversal, but confirmation still depends on the token’s ability to sustain momentum above the $3 threshold. For now, XRP sits at a crossroads. If the buy signal proves accurate, this could mark the beginning of a new upward leg . If not, it may turn out to be only a pause in the ongoing correction.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) crossed the $11M milestone in its viral presale on Thursday, as investors back its mission to make Bitcoin programmable. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper plans to build a Layer-2 ecosystem that brings fast transactions, smart contracts, and cross-chain features to Bitcoin without compromising its security. Bitcoin’s Stuck in First Gear Bitcoin has held the top spot in crypto for more than a decade. It is the most secure, recognized, and institutionally adopted digital asset. But the undisputed crypto giant has failed to keep pace with changing market demands. Bitcoin crawls along, capable of a maximum theoretical amount of just seven transactions per second (compared to Solana’s 65K ), with confirmation times stretching into minutes. When the network clogs up, fees can shoot into double digits, turning everyday payments into a luxury. That’s a problem for a currency that was supposed to be global money. Bitcoin struggles with day-to-day use, never mind powering apps or financial platforms for the masses. And unlike Ethereum or Solana, Bitcoin doesn’t have reliable support for smart contracts, NFTs, DeFi, or gaming. Most developers take their projects to other blockchains to avoid piecing together clunky fixes. As a result, Bitcoin has mainly remained a store of value, or ‘digital gold,’ while the rest of Web3 has evolved around it. Locked into its original framework, Bitcoin has lagged behind the boom in DeFi, meme coins, and institutional-scale systems. Yet, the Bitcoin Backdrop Has Never Looked Stronger Institutional buyers continue to treat every crypto dip as an entry point, with industry experts calling the market structure extremely bullish. High-profile voices, from Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong to Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood and Block Inc’s Jack Dorsey , openly project Bitcoin could hit $1M or more by 2030. The regulatory tide is also shifting. At the Wyoming Blockchain Summit this week, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said most digital assets should not be considered securities, signaling a regulatory climate far friendlier to crypto than in years past. Speaking at the same event, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman suggested regulators should be less wary of new financial products. ‘We must choose whether to embrace the change and help shape a framework that will be reliable and durable – ensuring safety and soundness and incorporating the benefits of both efficiency and speed – or to stand still and allow new technology to bypass the traditional banking system altogether. From a regulator’s perspective, the choice is clear.’ — Michelle Bowman, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision And with figures like the Winklevoss twins donating 188 $BTC (~$21M) to a pro-crypto PAC , the political muscle behind Bitcoin is only getting stronger. Bitcoin enjoys unmatched demand and support in 2025, and even with the usual pullbacks, signs point to another parabolic run ahead. Yet, its technical foundation remains outdated. Bitcoin risks being left behind as a passive asset, while blockchain innovation flows elsewhere if it doesn’t upgrade. That Tension is Exactly Where Bitcoin Hyper Steps in Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) plans to fix the mismatch between Bitcoin’s growing popularity and archaic tech with a Layer-2 ecosystem. At the core of the solution is the Canonical Bridge. Users deposit $BTC, which is then minted into wrapped $BTC on the Layer-2. Once there, Bitcoin becomes fast and cheap, and developers can finally launch DeFi apps, NFT markets, meme tokens, and other dApps directly on Bitcoin’s security layer. Users will be able to use their wrapped $BTC across the entire ecosystem and withdraw back to Bitcoin’s Layer-1 at any time. And as Hyper’s Layer-2 integrates the SVM, execution runs with sub-second finality and throughput on par with Solana itself. Developers building on Solana can deploy similar applications on the Layer-2 with little adaptation, opening Bitcoin to ecosystems that were previously out of reach. The project uses a Proof-of-Stake sequencer to efficiently process transactions with lower energy than Proof-of-Work. In other words, Bitcoin Hyper keeps Bitcoin’s strength but adds the speed and flexibility modern Web3 needs. $11M+ Raised: Investor Confidence Builds Around Bitcoin Hyper While the broader market has been volatile, Bitcoin Hyper’s token presale has moved in the opposite direction, smashing through $11.2M. Strategic investors have been taking positions, hinting at growing confidence in both the Layer-2 model and the explosive potential of the $HYPER token. Crypto whales are also circling the presale, including $151K on August 12, and $110.9K on August 7. The $HYPER presale is structured in stages, with token prices increasing incrementally as each round sells out. It started at just $0.0115 and will close at $0.012975, locking in an early-buyer advantage of 12% even ahead of listings. Currently at $0.012775, the price still remains attractive, but the next surge is only a day away. And if all goes well, as per the Bitcoin Hyper whitepaper and roadmap, $HYPER has the potential to explode, possibly making it one of the best long-term crypto investments of the year. Take a look at our $HYPER price prediction for more insights on what the future could hold for this exciting new meme coin. To join the $HYPER presale, head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website , choose how much $HYPER to purchase, and confirm the transaction. For step-by-step instructions, check out our guide to buying $HYPER tokens. The presale supports purchases using both cryptocurrencies and fiat cards. A ‘Buy and Stake’ option is available on the website for those who want to start earning rewards immediately. The dynamic staking APYs were around 98% at the time of writing. The mechanism adapts as the pool grows, rewarding those who joined early with higher APYs. And 534M+ $HYPER tokens are already locked in the pool. The project’s smart contracts have undergone full audits by Coinsult and Spywolf . Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale today. Latest Dev Updates: SVM Programs Running Natively Bitcoin Hyper’s live devnet and visible tech progress put it ahead of new cryptocurrencies that are still just promises. Earlier this month, the team confirmed support for native Solana program execution through its custom SVM runtime. Developers can already use standard Solana command line interface tools, including program deploy, call, logs, and config. It allows builders to launch dApps directly on Bitcoin without bridges or federated multisigs, while still benefiting from speedy execution. The next milestones focus on refining the developer experience, adding more advanced Solana instructions, and improving error visibility. Clearly, Bitcoin Hyper is not just a theoretical upgrade, unlike many Layer-2 promises that came before. Step by step, the project will turn Bitcoin from a static store of value into a programmable platform. From Digital Gold to Web3: Bitcoin’s New Era Has Begun Bitcoin is holding firm in a bullish structure, with institutions scooping up every dip and analysts eyeing even bigger gains ahead. Against that backdrop, the pace of the $HYPER presale suggests investors are eager to diversify into low-cap tokens that stand to benefit from Bitcoin’s growth more than $BTC itself. With the devnet live, SVM programs already running natively, and $11.2M+ raised in its presale, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is moving beyond ideas into execution. And that makes it one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy this year. But as always, do your own research before investing in crypto.

The crypto market is showing signs of life after a brief downturn, with Dogecoin (DOGE) climbing nearly 4% alongside Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL). This recovery comes as Bitcoin ended a two-day slump, sparking optimism across the board. Why Is Dogecoin Rising Now? Dogecoin’s rally isn’t just random volatility. In recent days, whale activity has intensified, with major holders reportedly accumulating hundreds of millions worth of DOGE. This surge in large-scale buying often signals strong institutional confidence. Historically, such behavior has preceded significant price movements. For instance, in early 2021, Dogecoin’s price skyrocketed by over 500% following similar accumulation trends, amplified by social media buzz and celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk’s tweets. Crypto Market’s Wider Comeback: A Positive Sign? This latest rally wasn’t isolated to Dogecoin. BNB and SOL also saw gains, suggesting a broader market recovery rather than a coin-specific pump. Analysts point to easing investor fears ahead of Federal Reserve updates and positive sentiment around Bitcoin as catalysts. Did You Know? During the last major bull run, synchronized moves among top altcoins often marked the start of extended rallies. If history repeats, this could be more than just a short-lived bounce. What’s Next for Dogecoin? If momentum holds, analysts believe Dogecoin could test the $0.25 resistance level soon. A decisive break above that mark might pave the way toward $0.30, a psychological level that often attracts retail interest. However, traders should watch for macroeconomic signals. Upcoming statements from the Federal Reserve and inflation reports could inject volatility into crypto markets once again. Dogecoin’s strong comeback hints at renewed risk appetite among crypto traders. Paired with increasing whale activity, this could indicate early stages of a trend reversal.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 12:10:14

While the US national Bitcoin reserve is being discussed, Ben Waxman has introduced Bill 1812, which aims to ban public officials from profiting from cryptocurrencies while in office. Citing corruption concerns linked to US President Donald Trump's crypto activities, Ben Waxman has introduced a bill that would prohibit officials from profiting from cryptocurrencies while in office. The Pennsylvania lawmaker accused Trump of financially benefiting from crypto projects like memecoin and stated that the law was a measure to prevent corruption spearheaded by Trump. “President Donald Trump has directly profited from virtual asset projects like his own 'Official Trump (TRUMP)' memecoin. At the same time, it has loosened federal regulations to help such ventures evade oversight. But in Pennsylvania, no public official should be allowed to enrich themselves through cryptocurrencies. “Also, issuing, promoting or trading coins for personal gain should be strictly prohibited.” If Waxman's bill passes, public officials and their immediate family members would be prohibited from possessing, trading, or promoting cryptocurrencies worth more than $1,000 during their term and for one year after leaving office. The bill also mandates the disposal of existing assets within 90 days of the law's enactment. Violations are subject to fines of up to $50,000 and, for some serious offenses, up to five years in prison. *This is not investment advice.

Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported the movement of an astonishing 200,000,093 USDT from the HTX exchange to the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Aave. This transaction, valued at approximately $200 million, represents a substantial shift of stablecoin liquidity within the digital asset ecosystem. Such large movements often signal important strategic decisions by major market participants, known as ‘whales’, and can have various implications for both the platforms involved and the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Was This Crucial USDT Transfer? On [Insert Date of Transaction if known, otherwise omit or use ‘recently’], a colossal 200,000,093 Tether (USDT) was moved. This particular USDT transfer originated from HTX, a well-known centralized cryptocurrency exchange, and concluded on Aave, a leading decentralized lending and borrowing platform. To put it simply, someone moved a significant portion of their digital stablecoins from a traditional exchange environment to a DeFi protocol. Understanding the entities involved helps contextualize this move: HTX (formerly Huobi): A major global cryptocurrency exchange offering various trading services. It serves as a gateway for many users into the crypto market. Aave: A non-custodial decentralized liquidity protocol where users can lend out their crypto to earn interest or borrow by providing collateral. It operates entirely on blockchain technology, removing intermediaries. This movement highlights the increasing interplay between centralized and decentralized finance, demonstrating that even massive capital flows are navigating both worlds. Why Do Such Large USDT Transfers Matter? Significant USDT transfers , especially those involving hundreds of millions of dollars, are always noteworthy. They can indicate a variety of underlying motivations and potential market impacts. For instance, large transfers from exchanges often suggest that a whale might be preparing to deploy capital in DeFi, secure assets in a self-custodied wallet, or participate in yield-generating opportunities. Here’s why this particular stablecoin movement is important: Whale Activity Insight: Such transactions provide a glimpse into the strategies of large investors, whose moves can sometimes precede broader market trends or shifts in sentiment. Liquidity Dynamics: Moving USDT from an exchange to a DeFi protocol like Aave directly impacts the available liquidity on both platforms. HTX might see a reduction in its stablecoin reserves, while Aave’s lending pools gain a significant boost. Yield Seeking: Investors often move stablecoins to DeFi protocols to earn higher yields through lending, staking, or providing liquidity, which might not be available on centralized exchanges. Therefore, this transaction isn’t just a simple transfer; it’s a potential indicator of a strategic financial play within the crypto space. Understanding the Impact on HTX and Aave The implications of this considerable USDT transfer are multifaceted for both HTX and Aave. For HTX, while a $200 million outflow is substantial, it’s unlikely to significantly impact the overall operational stability of a major exchange. However, it does represent a reduction in the stablecoin liquidity available for trading or withdrawals on its platform. Exchanges regularly see large inflows and outflows as users manage their portfolios. Conversely, for Aave, this inflow is a clear positive. More USDT in its lending pools means: Increased Lending Capacity: Aave can facilitate more loans, potentially attracting more borrowers. Enhanced Stability: Larger liquidity pools generally contribute to the protocol’s overall stability and efficiency. User Confidence: Such a significant deposit from a major player can signal confidence in Aave’s security and yield-generating capabilities, potentially attracting other users. This event underscores the growing maturity and trustworthiness of leading DeFi protocols as viable destinations for substantial capital. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? This significant USDT transfer also offers insights into broader market trends. It reinforces the critical role of stablecoins like USDT as the backbone of liquidity in both centralized and decentralized finance. Furthermore, it highlights the continued robust growth and adoption of DeFi platforms. Despite market volatility, large capital holders are actively engaging with decentralized applications, leveraging them for various financial strategies. The continuous flow of capital between CEXs (Centralized Exchanges) and DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) and DeFi protocols indicates a dynamic and interconnected ecosystem. It suggests that participants are becoming increasingly sophisticated in how they manage their digital assets, constantly seeking optimal returns and risk profiles across different platforms. This particular transaction serves as a compelling example of this evolving landscape. In conclusion, the movement of over 200 million USDT from HTX to Aave is more than just a large transaction; it’s a testament to the dynamic nature of the crypto economy. It highlights the strategic decisions made by major investors, the growing importance of DeFi, and the continuous evolution of how digital assets are managed and utilized across the globe. Keep an eye on such movements, as they often provide valuable clues about the direction of the crypto market. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What was the recent significant USDT transfer? A massive 200,000,093 USDT, valued at approximately $200 million, was transferred from the HTX cryptocurrency exchange to the Aave decentralized finance protocol, as reported by Whale Alert. 2. What is HTX? HTX, formerly known as Huobi, is a prominent centralized cryptocurrency exchange that facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of various digital assets for users globally. 3.

Both daily and lower timeframes suggest that the next decisive move hinges on whether buyers can maintain key support zones or whether bears will drive the market into deeper retracements. ETH Price Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily chart, Ethereum has been retracing after its parabolic advance stalled at the $4.8K ATH. The price recently found support around the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement ($4,070), a zone that aligns with the ascending channel’s midline and prior demand levels. If this support weakens, the next major demand sits within the 0.618–0.786 Fibonacci retracement range ($3,900–$3,660), a region that could act as an accumulation zone if bearish momentum persists. Meanwhile, the RSI has cooled to neutral near 57, indicating that overbought conditions have been reset, but a clear directional bias has yet to form. Holding above $4,070 would preserve the broader bullish structure, while a decisive breakdown risks extending the correction toward the $3,600–$3,800 range. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH recently rebounded from the $4.2K support, which overlaps with the ascending trendline. This confluence makes the $4.2K zone a crucial battleground for buyers. The price action has since developed a short-term consolidation range between $4,200 and $4,400, resembling an inverted head and shoulders pattern. This reflects market indecision: buyers are actively defending support, yet struggle to reclaim resistance. A confirmed breakout above $4.4K would validate the inverted H&S formation, opening the path for a renewed push toward the ATH region. Conversely, failure to hold the $4.2K support and trendline would expose ETH to deeper retracements, potentially targeting the 0.702–0.786 Fibonacci zone. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum continues to trade with sharp swings after its rejection from the all-time high, with the liquidation heatmap highlighting where leveraged positions are clustered. These zones often act as magnets for price, as liquidity hunts dominate short-term movements. During the rally into the $4,800–$4,900 range, ETH triggered a cascade of short liquidations before reversing sharply. This trap left late buyers caught at the top while creating a liquidity vacuum to the downside. Following the rejection, ETH swept lower into $4,100–$4,200, tapping a dense cluster of long liquidations and fueling the aggressive sell-off observed in mid-August. At present, the heatmap highlights two critical liquidity zones: $4,500–$4,700: A dense cluster of short liquidations that could attract prices higher if buyers regain control. $3,800–$3,900: A heavy concentration of long liquidations, still untested, which could serve as a downside magnet if current support fails. With ETH consolidating between $4,200 and $4,500, the market remains range-bound and liquidity-driven. Until a decisive breakout occurs, price is likely to continue gravitating between these clusters, with volatility fueled by liquidation cascades on both sides.

According to reports , the currency exchange assisted a group of scammers in converting the stolen funds into virtual currency. This activity took place over the course of one year. Within this time frame, the total amount laundered added up to NT$2.3 billion, approximately $75 million, impacting over a thousand individuals. The Shilin District Prosecutor’s Office announced the indictments today, charging the suspects with fraud, money laundering, operating unlicensed virtual asset services, and organizing a criminal enterprise. Chief Prosecutor Luo Weiyuan, who led the investigation, revealed that ringleader Shi Qiren, his wife Ms. Lin, and business director Yang operated a sprawling network of over 40 franchise stores under the names “CoinW” and “BiXiang Technology Co., Ltd.” Taiwan uncovers fraud scheme responsible for significant losses In April, Taiwan prosecutors and the police force conducted a thorough search operation on financial crimes . During this operation, they apprehended 14 people, including their leader, Shi. They also seized NT$60.49 million ($1.97 million) in cash and USDT tokens amounting to 640,000. Additionally, they confiscated Bitcoin , TRX, luxury vehicles, and bank deposits valued at over NT$100 million ($3.25 million). Today, August 22, the Shilin District Prosecutor’s Office has finalized its investigation and decided to press charges against the 14 individuals for fraud, money laundering activities, and organized crime. Prosecutors have requested to take hold of NT$1.275 billion ($41.4 million) raised from these illegal activities. In the meantime, Shi and the other two suspects were presented in the Shilin District Court for trial. Regarding the fraud case, prosecutors highlighted that Shi and others illegally offered virtual asset services through CoinW, an international cryptocurrency exchange, and its franchise branches. The Financial Supervisory Commission admitted that it had not approved this operation. Moreover, it was against money laundering prevention regulations. The tactic to lure investors to invest in the platform included a deceptive investment opportunity offer, a real way for the fraud group to generate income for their personal interest. Furthermore, it was discovered that the fraud operation began in 2024, whereby Shi Qiren, his wife Ms. Lin, business director Yang, and others in the team collaborated by dividing tasks. In their fraud operations, they opened up more than 40 stores in Taiwan using the names “CoinW” and “BiXiang Technology Co., Ltd.” Taiwan brings down the hammer on individuals linked to fraud scheme Following this fraud crime, t he individuals were charged with allegations of offering investors virtual asset services without acquiring proper registration under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, money laundering, and operating a criminal organization under the Organized Crime Prevention Act. Adding a twist to the case, prosecutors said Shi was deceived by a man named Gu, who allegedly promised to help Bixiang pass anti-money laundering registration requirements but instead pocketed NT$3 million ($97,800) in fees. Gu has also been indicted for fraud. When presented in front of the court, the prosecution reported that Shi expressed a negative attitude and did not admit to being guilty of his crimes. They asked the court to take serious action against him by increasing his punishment to 25 years’ imprisonment. With this, the Taiwan authorities intend to prevent such activities from taking place in the future and also restore investors’ confidence in the market.

Market observers suggest that if XRP sustains above this threshold, bullish momentum could accelerate, setting the stage for a rally toward $3.41 and potentially higher. The $2.88 level, often referred to as a “golden retracement,” is rooted in Fibonacci analysis, a widely used tool among traders to identify support and resistance levels. In this case, $2.88 represents a confluence of technical strength, acting as both a consolidation zone and a springboard for renewed upward momentum. Analysts note that such retracements often precede decisive breakouts when accompanied by strong market sentiment and liquidity inflows. Momentum indicators also paint a favorable picture. Trading volumes have remained steady, with liquidity deepening on major exchanges. This consistency signals that market participants are not only holding positions but also preparing for potential upside. Should XRP convincingly reclaim $3.00 and push toward $3.41, it would mark a significant recovery milestone and strengthen investor confidence in its long-term trajectory. At the time of this writing, XRP was hovering at the $2.79 zone, according to CoinGecko data . CME XRP Futures Hit Record $12 Million Open Interest with 6K+ Contracts According to CME Group, a leading derivatives marketplace, XRP futures have reached a new milestone, signaling growing institutional and retail interest in the digital asset. On August 18, CME XRP futures open interest surged to an all-time high of over $12 million, with more than 6,000 contracts in play. This record comes as CME prepares to mark the anniversary of its XRP futures launch, underscoring the contract’s increasing role in the evolving crypto derivatives market. Open interest, the total value of active contracts, is a key gauge of market activity and investor confidence. The $12M peak signals surging enthusiasm for XRP, fueled by macroeconomic trends and its expanding role in cross-border payments. Analysts highlight that sustained growth in derivatives often precedes stronger spot market momentum, suggesting XRP may be entering a new phase of liquidity and price discovery with data recently showing that 93% of holders were still in profit. Since launch, CME XRP futures have steadily attracted institutional demand, offering regulated exposure with transparent pricing and robust risk-management tools. By enabling traders to hedge or speculate without directly holding XRP, the contracts expand CME’s crypto footprint beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. The latest record underscores CME’s growing role as a premier venue for digital asset derivatives. Analysts link XRP’s surge to growing regulatory clarity, renewed investor confidence, and rising adoption in global payments. Its ISO 20022 alignment enhances utility in cross-border finance, while market optimism has driven strong derivatives demand—cementing XRP’s status as one of 2025’s most closely watched altcoins. This milestone also reflects a broader trend, entailing the maturation of crypto markets. As institutions seek diversified exposure beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, alternative assets like XRP are gaining prominence in derivative markets. For CME, the achievement demonstrates not only the viability of XRP futures but also the growing appetite for regulated, exchange-traded products that meet institutional standards. Conclusion CME’s record-setting XRP futures highlight a pivotal shift in the digital asset landscape, where institutional-grade products are driving deeper liquidity and market confidence. The $12 million open interest not only validates XRP’s growing importance in global finance but also signals broader acceptance of crypto derivatives as mainstream investment tools. On the other hand, the $2.88 level stands as a pivotal psychological and technical threshold for XRP, signaling resilience and setting the stage for a potential breakout. A decisive move higher could draw fresh institutional inflows, ignite retail momentum, and cement XRP as a standout in the current cycle. With $3.41 within reach and further upside on the horizon, this trajectory highlights the critical role of technical markers in shaping market expectations.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 13:24:10

(Nasdaq: SBET), a gaming technology firm and one of the world’s largest corporate holders of Ether (ETH), announced that its Board of Directors has approved a stock buyback program of up to $1.5 billion. NEW: SharpLink’s board of directors authorizes $1.5B stock buyback program https://t.co/ANtveVdIMD — SharpLink (SBET) (@SharpLinkGaming) August 22, 2025 A buyback (also called a share repurchase) is when a company uses its own cash to buy back its shares from the stock market. This latest move is aimed at strengthening shareholder value by repurchasing the company’s common stock when market conditions warrant. The move comes as SharpLink positions itself not only as a gaming and technology company, but also as a vocal advocate for Ethereum adoption. Strategy Anchored in Ethereum Treasury SharpLink’s capital strategy is deeply tied to its Ethereum reserves. The company is among the few publicly traded firms to hold ETH as its primary treasury reserve asset. Co-CEO Joseph Chalom explains the rationale: if SharpLink’s stock trades below the net asset value (NAV) of its ETH holdings, issuing new equity could dilute ETH per share value. In such cases, buying back shares may be a more accretive and shareholder-friendly move. The program reflects SharpLink’s intent to use its ETH-backed balance sheet as leverage in maintaining financial discipline. Flexible Market Execution The repurchase program allows SharpLink to act decisively when opportunities arise. Shares may be repurchased through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other methods permissible under securities law. Sharplink Gaming stressed that the timing and scale of repurchases will depend on share price, trading activity, and broader market conditions. Importantly, SharpLink is not obligated to buy back a set number of shares, giving management flexibility to suspend or discontinue the program at any time. This structure positions SharpLink to be opportunistic while maintaining prudent oversight of its capital reserves. Reinforcing Long-Term Shareholder Value By combining an ETH reserve strategy with one of the gaming industry’s most ambitious stock buyback authorizations, SharpLink aims to show its commitment to long-term value creation. The program shows confidence in both the company’s fundamentals and Ethereum’s role as a core digital asset. Based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, SharpLink continues to bridge the gap between traditional capital markets and blockchain-based finance. Its decision to allocate up to $1.5 billion toward repurchases not only supports its stock in the near term but also highlights its vision of aligning shareholder returns with the growth of Ethereum as a global financial infrastructure.

The move is now one of the latest in a series of longstanding issues for Binance in the country, including previous investigations by ASIC, a canceled derivatives license, and banking partners cutting ties. Meanwhile, in Taiwan, prosecutors indicted 14 people in what they described as the nation’s largest-ever crypto money laundering case, involving more than $70 million and over 1,500 victims. The alleged ringleader, Shi Qiren, faces up to 25 years in prison for orchestrating the scheme. Binance Faces Audit in Australia Australia’s financial intelligence agency, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), ordered Binance’s local unit to appoint an external auditor due to concerns over its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) systems. The regulator announced on Friday that it took this step “after identifying serious concerns” with Binance’s compliance measures. Matt Poblocki, Binance’s general manager for Australia and New Zealand, confirmed that the company acknowledged AUSTRAC’s decision, and explained that the review is a supervisory measure rather than an enforcement action. Nevertheless, the move proved that there is mounting unease about digital asset platforms and their vulnerability to criminal misuse. Announcement from AUSTRAC AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas pointed to the regulator’s risk assessment last year, which shed some light on the growing risks associated with digital currencies, and insisted that firms like Binance must ensure strong customer identification procedures, robust due diligence, and effective monitoring of transactions. The regulator is also concerned about Binance’s internal operations, and pointed to high staff turnover, a shortage of local resources, and insufficient senior management oversight as issues that may have compromised its governance and compliance controls. This is now yet another chapter in Binance’s troubled relationship with Australian regulators. The exchange has been under the spotlight since 2023, when the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) searched its offices as part of an investigation into its now-defunct derivatives business. ASIC ultimately canceled Binance Australia Derivatives’ license after concluding that the company misclassified certain users as “wholesale clients,” which allowed them to bypass key consumer protections. ASIC also launched legal action in 2024 over alleged failures tied to the company’s derivatives operations. Adding to its regulatory woes, Binance faced big banking challenges in Australia. In 2023, its local payment services provider Zepto abruptly stopped supporting the exchange, which forced it to suspend Australian dollar services . Binance later revealed it received less than a day’s notice before being cut off from the banking system, leaving users unable to directly deposit or withdraw AUD. Since then, customers have been advised to either convert their balances to the USDT stablecoin for transfers or use Binance’s peer-to-peer platform. For now, the “Bank Transfer” option on the exchange is still suspended . Taiwan Indicts 14 in Crypto Laundering Scheme Taiwanese prosecutors also recently indicted 14 people in what is being described as the country’s largest-ever cryptocurrency money laundering case, involving more than 1,500 victims and over $70 million in illicit funds. According to reports from local outlet UDN , the Shilin District Prosecutor’s Office brought charges of fraud, money laundering, and organized crime, while seeking to confiscate assets worth nearly $40 million, including $39.8 million in local currency allegedly obtained through fraudulent schemes. Authorities also moved to seize an additional 640,000 USDT, undisclosed amounts of Bitcoin and Tron, more than $1.8 million in cash, two luxury vehicles, and $3.13 million in bank deposits. Investigators allege the group laundered almost $72 million that was collected from unsuspecting victims. It was then converted into foreign currency and transferred overseas before being used to buy USDT through a Taiwanese exchange, BiXiang Technology. Flow chart of the scheme: Source: UDN Prosecutors released a flow chart of the scheme as part of the indictment to point out the complex operations that were employed to disguise the source of the funds. The investigation dates back to April when all 14 suspects, including alleged ringleader Shi Qiren, were arrested. It is believed that Qiren was central to the scheme, and may face a prison sentence of up to 25 years after refusing to plead guilty. Authorities claim that since 2024, Qiren, his wife, and a manager surnamed Yang operated a fraudulent business model by opening 40 stores across Taiwan under the names CoinW and CoinThink Technology Co., Ltd. They allegedly posed as the sole firm authorized by the country’s Financial Supervisory Commission and collected millions in franchise fees, as well as cash from deposit machines, ultimately defrauding 1,539 people. In an unexpected twist, prosecutors mentioned that Qiren himself was defrauded during the scheme by another suspect, who tricked him into paying $93,000 with the false promise of securing anti-money laundering registration.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|ASIA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 13:30:00

The latest example is Allianz, a $2.5T asset manager, whose new report titled ‘Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency: The Future of Finance’ dubs Bitcoin a credible store of value. What makes this even more striking is that back in 2019, Allianz explicitly advised against holding any crypto investments, citing regulatory uncertainty and volatility concerns. Keep reading to discover not only the reasons Allianz now cites for Bitcoin’s impressive run so far, but also the factors fueling its explosive future. We’ll also discuss how you can make the most of this brewing rally by loading up on the best cryptos to buy now . Top Reasons Behind Allianz’s Bitcoin U-Turn One of the biggest reasons behind Allianz now recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate financial vehicle is the massive surge in institutional adoption. The report notes how corporate treasuries (think Strategy , Metaplanet , and the like) have actually outpaced ETFs in Bitcoin purchases over the past few quarters. In fact, public companies alone have scooped up over 240K $BTC since April . Additionally, Allianz highlighted the following key factors fueling Bitcoin’s rise: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledging Bitcoin as a digital counterpart to gold. The growth of regulated exchanges like Coinbase, institutional custodians such as Fidelity Digital Assets, and government-approved Bitcoin ETFs that have bridged the gap between TradFi and crypto. Bitcoin’s 0.12 correlation with the S&P 500 and (-0.04) correlation with gold, which positions it as a strong diversification asset in traditional portfolios. Allianz also pointed out that the growing trend of real-world asset tokenization and increasing DeFi adoption will ‘substantially expand crypto’s total addressable market.’ And as a final word of confidence, Allianz noted that ‘barring any unforeseen calamity or global collapse due to technological flaws,’ Bitcoin is on track to become a permanent pillar of the global financial system. All in all, with big money players now openly legitimizing Bitcoin, this is the perfect time to fuel up your portfolio – not just with $BTC, but also with low-cap altcoins. And tokens that could not only ride alongside Bitcoin, but even outperform it in terms of raw gains. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin Layer-2 Bringing Web3 Compatibility to the Network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one of the best altcoins to buy now not only because it’s tied to Bitcoin, but because of its potentially revolutionary mission: to turbocharge the Bitcoin ecosystem with Solana-like performance. $HYPER is building a next-gen Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), delivering lightning-fast speeds, ultra-low fees, and full Web3 compatibility to an otherwise slow and non-programmable Bitcoin blockchain. To put it in perspective, Bitcoin currently processes just seven transactions per second (TPS). This is significantly slower than the likes of Solana and Ethereum , which have a maximum theoretical TPS of 65K and 119.1 TPS respectively. Even worse, Bitcoin developers cannot natively build smart contracts or decentralized applications on the network. $HYPER plans to change all that. Its SVM-integrated Web3 environment will make Bitcoin’s biggest pain points a thing of the past. Through its decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge, holders will be able to convert their Layer-1 $BTC into minted and wrapped Layer 2 $BTC – tokens fully compatible with $HYPER’s Web3 ecosystem. This opens the door to a wide range of use cases, including DeFi trading, NFT platforms, blockchain gaming, lending, staking, DAOs, and governance.

Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Powering a Secure and Easy-to-Use Crypto Wallet Bitcoin and altcoin growth have also sparked massive surges in related sectors, including the crypto wallet market, which is expanding at a whopping 31.9% CAGR . If you’re looking to ride this growth, one smart move could be allocating a portion of your portfolio to Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . It’s a new cryptocurrency powering Best Wallet , a free-to-download crypto wallet that combine top-tier security with never-before-seen convenience. For starters, it’s a non-custodial crypto wallet , meaning only you hold the private keys, keeping your funds safe from unauthorized access. On top of that, Best Wallet integrates cutting-edge multi-factor authentication options (including biometric login), phishing and hack protection, and rock-solid encryption technology.

Solana ($SOL) – A Major Crypto That Could Outperform Bitcoin in the Next Rally As mentioned earlier, a Bitcoin rally often spills over into other mainstream cryptos like Solana ($SOL) , which can actually deliver even better returns than Bitcoin itself. And this isn’t just hearsay; the numbers back it up. Since the beginning of April, Solana has gained over 80% to 90%, while Bitcoin managed only around 50%. That’s clear evidence that in a strong uptrend, $SOL can outpace $BTC. Adding to the momentum is the high likelihood of a Solana ETF approval in 2025. According to Polymarket, one of the most widely used prediction platforms, the odds of the SEC greenlighting a Solana ETF this year stand at 99%+ . An ETF would be hugely positive for Solana’s price, as it would open the doors to greater institutional participation, boost liquidity, and cement its legitimacy alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. On the charts, Solana looks just as solid: Its current rally is bouncing from a major support zone, the same one that fueled its 170% surge in August 2024. At the same time, the token continues to respect a strong upward-sloping trendline (highlighted in blue in the chart above). This powerful confluence of support and momentum suggests $SOL is well-positioned to target the magical $300 mark in the coming months. Wrapping Up Allianz’s latest U-turn on Bitcoin, now calling it a credible store of value, is a telling sign that the world’s largest hedge funds and institutional players are warming up to crypto like never before. If you want to ride this momentum, and potentially even outpace Bitcoin’s returns itself, consider loading up on low-cap, high-potential tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . And for those who’d like to keep things a little ‘safer,’ adding a bit of Solana ($SOL) to your portfolio could strike the perfect balance. That said, please keep in mind that none of the above is financial advice. The crypto market remains highly unpredictable, so kindly do your own research before investing.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|TRADING|ALTCOIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 13:30:29

Built on Ethereum’s Layer 2, $LBRETT is capturing attention with its low gas fees, high staking rewards, and unique blend of meme culture and real utility. With a potential 120x growth, many traders believe Layer Brett could soon challenge Solana’s dominance, making it one of the best altcoins to watch in 2025. Solana price prediction: Will the token maintain its momentum in 2025? The Solana chart reveals a steady uptrend, marking a price increase of 3.46% on August 20, 2025, trading at $182.32. The bullish momentum is supported by the rising volume, which now stands at 5.2 billion, and the convergence of short-term and long-term moving averages at $161.85 and $88.33, signaling potential continued growth.

The use of third-country stops shows how far firms are going to keep shipments moving as tensions between Washington and Beijing disrupt normal routes. Scrap from the United States feeds China’s copper sector. Because Chinese smelters and refiners turn out about half of the world’s finished copper, any long pause in U.S. deliveries could send ripples through global markets. The scope of these detours is uncertain, but they point to efforts to trim costs created by new trade barriers and to place excess material from the U.S. The country is the biggest source of waste copper, recovered from car parts, wiring and electronics, yet only around 40% is used domestically, BMO Capital Markets estimates. “It’s not surprising that these companies come up with clever ways to move materials around,” said Xiaoyu Zhu, a trader at StoneX Financial Inc. “The 10% tariff has put the scrap companies at a disadvantage in terms of pricing, not to mention the financing pressure from high interest rates.” China’s tariffs shake up export routes China used to be the main outlet for U.S. scrap copper before the dispute escalated. As reported by Cryptopolitan in May, Beijing has added a 10% counter-tariff on all American imports, including copper scrap, upsetting long-standing flows. Customs figures underline the shift. China’s intake of U.S. copper scrap slid from 39,373 metric tons in January to under 600 tons in July, the lowest monthly level since records began in 2004. China’s total scrap copper imports held near 190,000 tons in July, little changed from early in the year, as other suppliers stepped in. Cargoes from Japan and Thailand have more than doubled since January, and arrivals from Canada rose 29%. U.S. export data points in the same direction. In the second quarter, Thailand, India and Canada were the top destinations for American scrap copper. Bloomberg reported that people familiar with the practice say these spikes suggest some transshipment. The typical method is to load U.S. scrap into containers tagged with the owner’s name and send it first to a third country; at the stop, they switch the tag to a different name and origin, then move the box on to China. That tactic carries legal exposure . Emmanouil Xidias, managing director at ship-broker Ifchor North America LLC, said that reloading in transit and altering origin, or declaring a stopover nation as origin before re-export, amounts to fraud. The party that changes the origin and re-exports bears liability, he said. “Whether the buyer or the seller shoulders the risk depends on the contract terms,” Xidias said. For example, if terms cover cost of goods, insurance and freight, the risk is transferred to the buyer when goods are unloaded at their destination. “If it’s Free on Board, then the buyer takes the risk the moment the materials are loaded to the container.” China fined copper importers over transshipment in Trump’s first term China has moved against such activity before. Over the past decade, importers tied to illegal transshipping or origin fraud across various products have faced heavy fines and criminal cases. During President Donald Trump’s first term, when Beijing also levied tariffs on U.S. goods, some buyers of copper scrap were fined after customs uncovered attempts to procure rerouted cargoes. U.S. traders say they face a simple choice of keeping stock in yards or shipping abroad to raise cash. Some are opting to sell overseas, but the process is slow and secondary copper piles remain large. Prices reflect the strain. By late July, the discount for No. 2 copper, a recycled grade used as a cheaper stand-in for primary metal, versus futures widened to the biggest gap since 2015, Fastmarkets data show.

""One Bullish, the Other Bearish!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptoquant-analyst-shares-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-expectations-one-bullish-the-other-bearish/,"The downward trend that began last week in Bitcoin, Ethereum and altcoins continues ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole speech. While analysts noted that the tone of Powell's speech will be important for the course of Bitcoin and altcoins, analyst XWIN Research shared their expectations. Accordingly, the analyst said that BTC may face a short-term correction, while ETH is showing signs of an uptrend. CryptoQuant analyst XWIN Research Japan noted that Bitcoin is at risk of a short-term correction, while Ethereum, which has been attracting attention with its recent performance, reportedly continues its upward momentum. At this point, the analyst pointed out that despite recent price fluctuations, exchange reserves remained at approximately 2.53 million BTC. According to the analyst, this suggests that investors are not withdrawing BTC. Historically, declining reserves suggest that Bitcoin is leaving exchanges for the long term, reducing selling pressure. This time, reserves are holding steady, suggesting that some of the BTC supply remains liquid and potentially available for sale. The recent situation with exchange reserves, coupled with BTC's decline from $123,000 to $113,000, serves as a reminder to be wary of the risk of a short-term correction. In contrast, ETH volume leaving exchanges has been showing consistent net outflows, with multiple spikes exceeding 300,000 ETH, particularly in late July and mid-August. Exchange exits typically reflect the interest token being moved to cold storage, staking, or institutional custody, reducing the available supply on the open market, which has a positive impact on the price. “Data shows ETH’s declining exchange balances highlight increasing institutional demand and long-term positioning. As a result, BTC is signaling a risk of correction, while ETH is showing a strong bullish trend supported by shrinking liquid supply. Investors may consider approaching BTC as a dip buying opportunity while favoring ETH for medium-term growth. *This is not investment advice.

Recent reports suggest that Beijing might permit a yuan-pegged stablecoin. However, legal and policy experts widely agree this would likely be an offshore CNH token, rather than an onshore CNY coin. Understanding this distinction is crucial for anyone watching the evolution of digital currencies and China’s yuan stablecoin strategic financial moves. Why an Offshore China’s Yuan Stablecoin Makes Sense Why is an offshore approach favored for China’s yuan stablecoin ? The answer lies in China’s strict mainland capital controls. These controls are a cornerstone of Beijing’s financial policy, designed to manage currency flow and maintain economic stability. Introducing a domestic stablecoin, pegged directly to the onshore CNY, would complicate these existing mechanisms. Furthermore, China has already rolled out its central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, for domestic use. This digital yuan serves as the primary tool for digital transactions within the mainland, making a separate domestic stablecoin largely redundant and potentially conflicting. Therefore, an onshore China’s yuan stablecoin seems highly improbable given the current economic landscape. Hong Kong: The Ideal Testbed for a China’s Yuan Stablecoin ? Hong Kong emerges as a natural and compelling location for testing an offshore China’s yuan stablecoin . The city’s new regulatory framework for stablecoins, which became effective on August 1, provides a clear and structured environment for such an initiative. This move by Hong Kong creates a robust regulatory sandbox, ideal for exploring the functionalities and implications of a CNH-pegged token without disrupting mainland policies. The existing financial infrastructure and its status as a global financial hub further solidify Hong Kong’s position. By leveraging Hong Kong, China can cautiously experiment with extending the yuan’s digital reach internationally, observing its performance and adoption in a controlled, yet globally connected, setting. This strategic choice underscores a measured approach to digital currency innovation. Navigating the Global Stablecoin Market and CNH Liquidity Currently, dollar-backed stablecoins dominate the market, controlling approximately 98% of the total volume. This presents a significant challenge for any new entrant, including a China’s yuan stablecoin , seeking to gain global traction. The sheer scale and liquidity of USD-pegged tokens are immense, making it difficult for alternatives to quickly establish a comparable foothold. Moreover, the liquidity of offshore yuan (CNH) is relatively small. With around 0.88 trillion yuan in deposits, it pales in comparison to the mainland’s vast money supply of approximately 329.9 trillion yuan. This disparity suggests that while an offshore yuan stablecoin could offer strategic advantages, its initial global scale might be limited. Analysts believe any move would be carefully calculated, focusing on specific use cases rather than immediate widespread adoption. The Strategic Imperative: Extending Yuan’s Reach with Control So, what is the core motivation behind exploring a China’s yuan stablecoin ? Experts view this potential development as a strategic maneuver by Beijing. The primary goal is to extend the yuan’s influence and utility abroad, fostering its internationalization, without simultaneously loosening the tight capital controls maintained at home. This dual objective is crucial for China’s long-term financial strategy. By introducing an offshore CNH stablecoin, China can offer a digital asset that facilitates cross-border transactions and trade in yuan, potentially reducing reliance on the U.S. dollar in specific international contexts. This initiative represents a delicate balance: promoting the yuan’s global presence while safeguarding domestic financial stability and control. It’s a testament to China’s deliberate and incremental approach to global financial innovation. In conclusion, the prospect of a China’s yuan stablecoin is a fascinating development, signaling China’s calculated steps in the global digital currency landscape. It is clear that any such stablecoin would operate offshore, primarily within environments like Hong Kong, to serve strategic goals of yuan internationalization while preserving strict domestic financial controls. While the journey to challenge dollar dominance will be long, this move underscores China’s commitment to shaping the future of global finance, one strategic step at a time. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the difference between CNH and CNY? CNY refers to the onshore yuan, which operates under strict capital controls within mainland China. CNH refers to the offshore yuan, which trades freely outside mainland China, primarily in Hong Kong, and is subject to fewer restrictions. Why won’t China launch an onshore yuan stablecoin? China has strict capital controls on the mainland and has already launched its central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, for domestic use. An onshore stablecoin would complicate existing financial policies and potentially conflict with the e-CNY’s role. How does Hong Kong’s new stablecoin regulation help this initiative? Hong Kong’s new regulatory framework, effective August 1, provides a clear and structured environment for stablecoin operations. This makes it an ideal testbed for an offshore CNH token, allowing China to experiment with digital yuan internationalization in a controlled setting. What are the main challenges for a China’s yuan stablecoin in gaining global traction? The primary challenges include the overwhelming dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins (98% market share) and the relatively smaller liquidity of offshore yuan (CNH) compared to the vast mainland money supply. What is the strategic goal of an offshore yuan stablecoin for China? The main strategic goal is to extend the yuan’s global reach and utility in international transactions, fostering its internationalization, without loosening the strict capital controls maintained within mainland China.

Matthew J. Galeotti, acting assistant attorney general of the DOJ’s Criminal Division, declared that “merely writing code without ill intent is not a crime.” This could turn out to be a huge turning point for developers who have long feared prosecution for shipping blockchain code. Speaking at an event hosted by the American Innovation Project, Galeotti made it clear that the DOJ would not target developers simply for creating or publishing software. “The criminal division will, however, continue to prosecute those who knowingly commit crimes or who aid and abet the commission of crimes, including fraud, money laundering, and sanctions evasion,” he added. Katie Biber, CLO at Paradigm, in an X post, mentioned that Galeotti pointed out that “Criminal laws must give fair notice of what is illegal” and “innovating on ways to store/transmit value is not a crime.” However, if a developer merely contributes code but lacks the specific intent to facilitate a crime, he or she is not criminally liable. Official Remarks from the Department of Justice at AIP Summit https://t.co/j4FHHnfH7Z — American Innovation Project (@AIPLeads) August 21, 2025 DOJ shift could upend Tornado Cash case Just weeks ago, a jury in New York found Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm guilty of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business. The conviction has stunned many in the crypto industry. They argue that Storm had simply written and published code that ran in a decentralized way on Ethereum. Meanwhile, prosecutors have charged him under 18 U.S.C. 1960. Galeotti addressed this situation with his remarks. “Where the evidence shows that software is truly decentralized and solely automates peer-to-peer transactions, and where a third party does not have custody and control over user assets, new 1960(b)(1)(c) charges against a third party will not be approved,” he said. Jake Chervinsky, chief legal officer at Variant Fund, called it grounds to overturn Storm’s conviction. In a post, he stated that “Roman Storm was just convicted on this exact charge under this exact circumstance,” he posted on X. “Justice for Roman means dropping the case.” Jake Chervinsky on DOJ. Source: X This statement shows how top watchdogs are now analyzing the crypto industry under the Donald Trump administration. Earlier in the Biden era, the DOJ aggressively pursued crypto cases, often casting a wide net. However, the new line suggests prosecutors will take a narrower approach focused on intent and actual criminal conduct. A Trump-era DOJ memo, re-emphasized under Galeotti, stated that enforcement should not impose “regulatory frameworks on digital assets while President Trump’s actual regulators do this work outside the punitive criminal justice framework.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Regulation|DOJ|Tornado Cash,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-22 13:44:23

Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.3672 Market Cap $587.27M Trading Volume $11.97M Circulating Supply 1.60B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.3775 24-hour Low $0.3612 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.90% 50-Day SMA $0.3886 14-Day RSI 44.99 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.4270 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown The daily chart confirms a bearish trend with targets near $0.30-0.32. FLOW’s critical support is present at $0.348-0.360 with resistance at $0.373-0.379. Flow coin 1-day price analysis FLOW has decisively broken below critical support levels, currently trading at $0.362 after declining 3.21% on August 22, 2025. The token pierced through the $0.379 Bollinger Band middle line and is now testing the lower band at $0.348, indicating oversold conditions that could trigger further selling pressure. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The $0.379 price level has turned into dynamic resistance, capping any bounce attempts while the price action shows consistent lower highs and lower lows. Volume indicators through OBV reveal sustained selling pressure, while MACD has turned negative, confirming the bearish momentum shift. The breakdown from the $0.40+ consolidation zone represents a significant technical failure that opens the door to deeper retracements toward $0.30-0.32 levels. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour timeframe reveals an accelerating downtrend with FLOW breaking below the crucial $0.373 support level and continuing its descent toward $0.360. The 21-period moving average has crossed below longer-term averages, creating a bearish alignment that typically signals extended downside momentum. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The RSI has dropped to 35.48, approaching oversold territory. Overall, the recent price action shows that each bounce attempt has been met with renewed selling, indicating weak buyer interest and potential for further downside.

FLOW appears positioned for continued weakness with immediate support around $0.348-0.360. Any relief rallies will likely face strong resistance at the $0.373-0.379 zone, which has now flipped from support to resistance. The breakdown suggests potential retracement toward the $0.30-0.32 area unless buying interest emerges quickly. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

The financial giant said it will develop new platforms for tokenized trading with more stablecoin products, pending changes in Japan’s digital asset market regulations. SBI Holdings, a global financial services group with over 11 trillion yen ($75 billion) in assets under management, announced a joint venture with Singapore-based Startale Group. The deal, unveiled on Friday, will focus on building an on-chain trading platform for tokenized stocks and real-world assets. SBI serves more than 65 million customers worldwide, including 14 million securities account holders. SBI Venture announces tokenized equities and stablecoin integration plans Sota Watanabe, founder of Startale, said the partnership could help transform how investors trade equities. “The whole financial market is moving from an offchain environment to onchain. We believe that the tokenized stock revolution is the largest opportunity and onchain trading is the next frontier,” he remarked. Watanabe explained that the system will allow continuous, programmable trading of US and Japanese equities, with instantaneous settlements. “While traditional markets remain closed 70% of the time, our platform will enable continuous trading,” Watanabe added. He explained that the initiative is about creating new financial instruments that merge traditional equities with the flexibility of decentralized finance. Startale, best known for co-developing Sony’s layer-2 blockchain Soneium and Astar Network, did not specify what technology stack the venture will use. Watanabe told reporters that the technical architecture is not ready to be revealed. “What matters is the joint venture’s mission: to deliver an always-on, compliant trading platform for tokenized assets,” he surmised, adding that a timeline will be disclosed later. Ripple stablecoin RLUSD sets sights on Japan market Alongside the Startale deal, SBI also signed a memorandum of understanding with Ripple Labs to bring Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) to Japan. The stablecoin is expected to launch in the fiscal year ending March 2026. SBI’s crypto subsidiary, SBI VC Trade, will act as the distributor. It is licensed as an Electronic Payment Instruments Exchange Service Provider. “RLUSD is designed to be a true industry standard, providing a reliable and efficient bridge between traditional and decentralized finance,” said Jack McDonald, Ripple’s senior vice president of stablecoins. He added that the development could contribute to the digitalization of capital markets, including exchanges. In its joint statement, the companies said the new stablecoin can be used under Japan’s updated regulatory frameworks, which now provide guidelines for stablecoin issuance and distribution. Japan became one of the first countries to formally regulate digital assets in 2017, when it recognized cryptocurrencies as legal payment methods under the Payment Services Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The government is also in discussions of approving yen-backed stablecoins, Cryptopolitan reported last week. “Through our corporate ecosystem together with Startale’s blockchain technology, we have great expectations for creating a new decentralized platform,” the Japanese conglomerate noted. SBI also confirmed a separate venture with Circle, the issuer of USDC , to promote the adoption of the dollar-backed stablecoin in Japan. The joint initiative could expand USDC’s use in local Web3 applications and financial services. The firm said the collaboration is intended to create new use cases for USDC in Japan’s digital finance sector, including settlements and decentralized applications. Details of the Circle initiative have not been fully disclosed, but the financial entities promised it would promote compliant usage of stablecoins in Web3 platforms. Meanwhile, SBI Holdings appointed Shotaro Iwano as the managing director of SBI Ventures Europe, the company’s European investment arm, earlier this week. He will now take over the office in Berlin, where the Europe team is based.

50494610,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=192485,1755870911,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50494610.jpeg,U.S. Stock Rally Fuels Investor Optimism: What It Means for Crypto,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stock-rally-crypto/,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Rally Fuels Investor Optimism: What It Means for Crypto The financial world is buzzing today as the U.S. stock markets opened with significant gains, sparking a wave of investor optimism. This impressive U.S. stock rally isn’t just a headline for traditional finance; it often signals broader market sentiment that can have profound implications for the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. As the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all climbed, many in the crypto community are asking: what does this positive momentum mean for digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum? What’s Driving the Robust U.S. Stock Rally Today? Today’s positive opening saw major indices moving firmly into positive territory. The S&P 500 advanced by +0.36%, the NASDAQ gained +0.19%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed +0.48%. This broad-based ascent reflects a confluence of factors influencing market participants. Investors are currently weighing improving economic data, corporate earnings reports, and expectations around future monetary policy decisions. Several key elements contribute to this current U.S. stock rally : Strong Corporate Earnings: Many companies have reported better-than-expected quarterly results, reassuring investors about corporate health. Optimistic Economic Indicators: Data suggesting moderating inflation or robust job growth can boost confidence in a “soft landing” for the economy. Interest Rate Expectations: Hopes for a pause or even future rate cuts from the Federal Reserve often provide a tailwind for equities. Understanding these drivers helps us grasp the underlying sentiment permeating the broader financial landscape. The Ripple Effect: How the U.S. Stock Rally Influences Crypto While often seen as distinct, the traditional stock market and the cryptocurrency market share a surprising degree of interconnectedness. A strong U.S. stock rally typically signals an increase in investor risk appetite. When investors feel more confident about the economy and traditional assets, they often become more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. This correlation is particularly evident with growth stocks and tech-heavy indices like the NASDAQ. Cryptocurrencies, especially major ones like Bitcoin, often exhibit similar price movements to these sectors. Moreover, institutional adoption plays a crucial role. As more large financial institutions enter the crypto space, their investment decisions are often influenced by the overall health of the traditional markets they also manage. Navigating Market Momentum: Opportunities and Challenges for Crypto Investors A sustained U.S. stock rally presents both opportunities and potential challenges for those invested in or looking at the crypto market. It is important for investors to consider these dynamics carefully. Potential Opportunities: Increased Capital Inflow: Positive sentiment in traditional markets can encourage new capital to flow into cryptocurrencies. Altcoin Season Potential: A strong Bitcoin performance, often buoyed by general market optimism, can sometimes precede an “altcoin season” where smaller cryptocurrencies see significant gains. Institutional Confidence: A healthy stock market environment may encourage more institutional players to explore or expand their crypto holdings. Potential Challenges: Volatility Remains: Despite positive correlations, cryptocurrencies retain their inherent volatility and can react sharply to unexpected news. Regulatory Headwinds: The crypto market still faces evolving regulatory landscapes, which can introduce uncertainty regardless of stock market performance. Divergence Risk: While correlations exist, they are not absolute. Crypto markets can sometimes decouple from traditional markets due to unique sector-specific events. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider their own risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Optimism The current U.S. stock rally is undoubtedly a positive development for the broader financial markets, and its influence extends to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. This renewed investor optimism creates a fertile ground for potential growth in digital assets. However, prudent investors will remember that while traditional market strength can provide a tailwind, the crypto space operates with its own unique drivers and inherent risks. Staying informed and agile remains key to navigating these exciting, interconnected markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a “U.S. stock rally” mean for the average investor? A U.S. stock rally typically means that the value of shares in American companies is increasing across the board. For the average investor, this can lead to gains in their investment portfolios, especially if they hold broad market index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Q2: How quickly does the cryptocurrency market react to a U.S. stock rally? The reaction time can vary. Often, there’s a relatively quick correlation, especially with Bitcoin, which is sometimes seen as a bellwether for the broader crypto market. However, specific crypto-related news or developments can also influence prices independently. Q3: Is a strong U.S. stock rally always good for crypto? Generally, a strong U.S. stock rally signals increased investor confidence and risk appetite, which tends to be positive for crypto. However, it’s not a guaranteed correlation. Crypto markets can still experience downturns due to unique factors like regulatory news, technological issues, or major hacks, even when stocks are performing well. Q4: What should crypto investors watch for when the stock market is rallying? Crypto investors should observe the strength and breadth of the stock market rally, looking at which sectors are performing best. They should also monitor Bitcoin’s reaction, as its movement often sets the tone for altcoins. Furthermore, keeping an eye on on-chain data and overall crypto market sentiment remains crucial. Q5: Can a U.S. stock rally lead to an “altcoin season”? A strong U.S. stock rally can contribute to conditions that might lead to an “altcoin season.” When Bitcoin performs well due to broader market optimism, investors often then rotate some of those gains into smaller, more speculative altcoins, hoping for higher returns. However, many other factors specific to altcoins also play a role. Did this article help you understand the connection between the U.S. stock market and cryptocurrency?

Billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are best known as the founders of the Gemini crypto exchange, announced on Wednesday that they donated $21 million in Bitcoin to the group called the Digital Freedom Fund. Winklevoss Twins Back Trump With $21M Bitcoin Donation Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss said they made the donation because they believe Trump has already taken real steps to bring digital assets into the mainstream, and they want to help him keep that momentum. Tyler Winklevoss explained that the president has been able to move quickly on his agenda because of the support he receives from the Republican-controlled Congress, and he added that it is important to protect that support when voters head into the midterm elections in 2026. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gets $153.8 Million Boost With This Latest Acquisition The Digital Freedom Fund movement aims to preserve what it terms “America’s Golden Age”. For the twins, this means giving Trump the tools to finish his push for stronger crypto reforms. Although the PAC’s website has not yet updated its records to show the $21 million donation, the announcement is already being seen as one of the biggest signs yet that major crypto leaders are ready to get directly involved in politics to shape the rules that will govern the industry. PAC’s Agenda: Pro-Crypto Laws And CBDC Ban The Digital Freedom Fund has outlined a comprehensive plan that focuses on supporting senators and House members who will pass laws that make it easier for crypto companies and users to grow without excessive restrictions. The PAC has also promised to fight for a “Skinny Market Structure Bill” that would limit regulators’ power over crypto markets while protecting the rights of developers, publishers, and users to build and transact freely. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Takes Major Step With Community Governance Model — Details As part of this plan, the PAC wants to put forward a “crypto bill of rights” that would clearly state that Americans should always have the freedom to own Bitcoin and other digital currencies, to keep them safe in their wallets, and to use them in everyday transactions without the fear of being punished, which has been a primary concern in past cases such as those involving the Tornado Cash developers and the Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Although the House of Representatives passed a bill in July to block the Federal Reserve from moving forward with a CBDC, the bill is still waiting in the Senate, and the PAC says it will keep fighting until a full ban is in place. With Trump’s leadership and the new funding from the Winklevoss twins, the Digital Freedom Fund is preparing to utilize its resources to shape the 2026 midterm elections and maintain the U.S. on a pro-crypto path.

At the forefront of this move is Cardano , which is currently making efforts to bring this key concept to life, offering a safe and reliable framework. Worldwide Automated System For Seamless Compliance In a significant development, Charles Hoskinson, a popular figure in the crypto landscape and founder of Cardano , has outlined an ambitious vision for automated global compliance. The founder’s statement comes as constant steps are being taken to implement a clear regulatory framework, which is considered a crucial factor in the future of finance. Mintern shared an interview on X, where Charles Hoskinson underscored the company’s efforts to make this automated global system the norm within the sector. Such a move is likely to bridge the gap between blockchain innovation and legal obligations. Furthermore, this system could revolutionize how individuals, corporations, and governments comply with regulatory requirements by increasing transparency, cutting expenses, and eliminating human error. The founder’s proposal emphasizes how decentralized infrastructure and smart contracts can be used to build a lucid environment that could expedite financial monitoring globally. During the interview, Hoskinson stated that the company can make compliance a matter of code, libraries, best practices, and zero-knowledge proofs with selective disclosure and reasonable privacy. As a result, the founder is confident that the move would lead to a world of automated compliance and regulation. Furthermore, Hoskinson highlighted that the most important aspect of this system is that individuals and businesses can work with it. This implies that participants who desire to work with multiple jurisdictions can look towards numerous Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) such as the US regulation , German regulation, and Abu Dhabi regulation. “These are libraries like software, and the updating of those is a public-private partnership, with the regulated on one side,” the founder added. With this system, both individuals and multi-trillion-dollar corporations will follow the same regulatory path. He claims that this system is completely automated and is built into the structure of the transaction. As digital assets continue to gain widespread adoption, the project positions Cardano at the forefront of regulatory technology integration . It also emphasizes the increasing need for scalable solutions in the financial sector. Over 100 Million Transactions Of Dirt-Cheap Fees Cardano continues to solidify its position in the blockchain sector, reaching a new high in transactions with dirt-cheap fees. A report from Mintern shows that Cardano has officially processed over 112 million transactions, with an average price of less than $0.25. The milestone highlights the blockchain ‘s consistent development and rising usefulness in the ecosystem of digital assets. According to Mintern, this proves once again that affordability and scalability can coexist.",Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|APIs|Application Programming Interfaces|blockchain|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson|Mintern,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 14:00:47

ADA, SUI, SHIB, and XYZVerse (XYZ) are seeing big waves of buying. If a common pattern continues, these coins may surprise with strong moves ahead. What could happen next for their prices? The answer could reshape expectations and spark fresh interest among watchers. Cardano (ADA) Source: TradingView ADA drifted between 0.81 and 1.07 this week. It slipped 3.10% in 7 days and 1.46% in 1 month, yet it still holds a 14.81% gain over 6 months. The token now trades close to 0.88, right on its 10-day average and a notch under the 100-day line at 0.91. Momentum looks neutral. RSI at 49.63 and stochastic at 55.36 show neither overbought nor oversold pressure. MACD sits just above zero at 0.002622, hinting at a flat trend. The nearest ceiling sits at 1.17; cracking it opens a path to 1.42. A dip below 0.81 could send ADA toward the 0.66 floor or even 0.41 if selling snowballs. If buyers push through 1.17, ADA could add about 30% from current levels and test 1.42, matching the 6-month climb pace. Failing that, a slide to 0.66 would shave roughly 25%. Sideways trade between 0.81 and 1.07 remains the base case until volume picks up. With the long-term trend still positive and short-term signals mixed, the next breakout direction may set the tone for Q3. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality , the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price : $0.0001 Price Now : $0.005 Next Stage : $0.01 Final Presale Price : $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $15 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Sui (SUI) Source: TradingView Sui trades between 3.52 and 4.10 after a rough week. The token slipped 11.76 percent in 7 days and 10.91 percent in 1 month. Even with the pullback the 6 month chart still shows an 8.18 percent gain. Short term action swims near the 10 day average at 3.55 and just under the 100 day line at 3.61. Momentum tools sit in the middle with RSI at 50.19 and Stoch at 55.26. A tiny positive MACD print of 0.0102 hints that sellers are losing grip. If buyers step in above the nearest floor at 3.27 the price could test 4.42. That move would add about 15 percent from the mid band of the current range. A clean break could open a path toward 5 which implies near 30 percent upside. Failure to hold 3.27 may drag the chart to the deeper base at 2.70 which is roughly 25 percent below. For now the data point to a cautious rebound rather than a fresh slide. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Source: TradingView Over last seven days price dipped 9.56%. Over thirty days slide 18.73%. Over six months down 16.52%. Current range 0.00001229 to 0.00001398 shows small gap but trend still negative. Yet the slide has slowed in the past two sessions, hinting at a pause. The 10 day and 100 day moving lines sit close at 0.00001259 and 0.00001263. This tight spread shows the coin is at a decision spot. RSI at 56 and Stochastic at 72 point to mild buying power, not mania. First barrier waits at 0.00001493. A push through could aim for 0.00001662, a 28% jump from current mid range. If buyers fade the coin may test 0.00001155 and then 0.00000986, about 20% below now. Short term bias is neutral to slight upside. A close above 0.00001400 would tilt the scale toward bulls. Failure to hold 0.00001200 would hand control to sellers. Based on recent data, odds lean 60-40 for a mild climb toward the first barrier within the next two weeks, but gains beyond that need fresh volume. Shiba Inu long term price prediction models remain cautiously optimistic despite current technical consolidation. The zone between 0.00001250 and 0.00001260 is the pivot that traders will watch hour by hour. Conclusion ADA, SUI, SHIB show firm upside, yet XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin aiming for 20,000% gains through a sport-meme fusion and community-led roadmap.

Morgan recognizes Ripple as having the potential to disrupt the global cross-border payments industry. The statement further highlights Ripple as “the most appealing digital asset for financial institutions,” underscoring the growing acknowledgment of XRP’s utility in modern finance. Ripple’s Distinct Role in Payments Ripple was built with a clear mission—to solve the inefficiencies of cross-border payments. Traditional systems depend heavily on correspondent banking networks, which are slow, costly, and opaque. Transactions can take days and rack up significant fees, making them unfit for today’s fast-paced global economy. Ripple’s blockchain-based system addresses these shortcomings directly. By leveraging its native token, XRP, and on-demand liquidity solutions, Ripple enables transfers that settle in seconds, at a fraction of the cost of legacy networks. This utility-driven design sets Ripple apart from other cryptocurrencies that are often used primarily for speculation. JP Morgan: “Ripple has the potential to disrupt the global cross border payments industry. + Ripple is the MOST APPEAL digital asset for financial institutions.” This is documented. https://t.co/usPBSHaK4l pic.twitter.com/XcnK7hiO0a — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 21, 2025 Why This Matters J.P. Morgan is the largest bank in the United States and a dominant force in global finance. Its acknowledgment of Ripple’s disruptive potential carries real weight. Importantly, J.P. Morgan is not just observing blockchain innovation from the sidelines. The bank has already rolled out JPM Coin and is actively researching deposit tokens and central bank digital currency (CBDC) models to enhance settlement efficiency. By positioning Ripple as “the most appealing digital asset for financial institutions,” the statement shared by SMQKE suggests that, even within a competitive field of innovation, Ripple is considered uniquely capable of addressing institutional payment challenges at scale. Ripple’s Expanding Global Footprint Ripple’s momentum is further evidenced by its global partnerships. Across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, financial institutions are already integrating Ripple’s technology to power remittances and improve settlement systems. The company is also preparing to expand its ecosystem with RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, which will deepen liquidity and strengthen its role in institutional payments. Together, these developments reinforce Ripple’s position as more than a blockchain startup. It is emerging as a critical infrastructure provider for the future of cross-border settlement. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Bigger Picture Global payments, worth more than $250 trillion annually, are undergoing rapid transformation. Institutions are experimenting with multiple models—from tokenized deposits to new messaging standards—to reduce friction and costs. Ripple’s presence in this discussion confirms that XRP is seen as a serious settlement asset, bridging the gap between traditional banking and blockchain technology. The recognition highlighted by SMQKE captures a pivotal moment for Ripple. For years, the company has argued that blockchain is the answer to outdated, inefficient payment systems. J.P. Morgan’s acknowledgment that Ripple has the potential to disrupt this space—and its framing of XRP as “the most appealing digital asset for financial institutions ”—offers strong validation of Ripple’s long-term value. In an industry where trust, speed, and efficiency matter most, Ripple is no longer just another cryptocurrency project. It is positioned as a game-changer in the future of global finance.

DOJ Signals Shift in Approach Weeks after Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm was convicted on a money transmission charge, a senior Department of Justice official indicated that prosecutors would not pursue similar cases in the future. Speaking at the American Innovation Project (AIP) Summit in Jackson, Wyoming, acting assistant attorney general Matthew Galeotti said that software developers should not be criminally liable for the actions of users who misuse their code. Galeotti’s comments came as he addressed industry concerns about prosecutorial overreach against developers of decentralized tools. Concerns Over Developer Accountability Crypto advocacy groups have long argued that holding developers responsible for third-party misuse of open-source protocols threatens innovation. Amanda Tuminelli, executive director of the DeFi Education Fund, welcomed the DOJ’s remarks, saying the statement aligned with what the sector had been “advocating for years.” The remarks follow a DOJ memo issued in April, prior to Storm’s trial, which outlined that the department would no longer pursue cases targeting crypto mixers based solely on user behavior or unintentional regulatory violations. The Tornado Cash Case Roman Storm, co-founder of privacy protocol Tornado Cash, was convicted in New York earlier this month of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He faced additional charges of money laundering and sanctions evasion, but jurors failed to reach a verdict on those counts. Prosecutors may seek a retrial. The trial centered on 18 U.S.C. 1960, a federal statute covering unlicensed money transmission. Galeotti clarified that new charges under this law would not be approved where protocols are “truly decentralized” and operate without custody or control of user assets. However, he emphasized that cases involving clear criminal intent would still be subject to prosecution. Industry Fallout Storm’s conviction has raised alarm across the crypto industry, with critics arguing that the money transmission charge mischaracterizes Tornado Cash’s decentralized design. Supporters said the verdict could discourage developers from building privacy-preserving applications, despite their legitimate uses. Prosecutors countered that Storm maintained meaningful control over Tornado Cash, challenging claims of complete decentralization. The protocol, originally created to enhance privacy on Ethereum, became a tool for laundering over $500 million in stolen crypto in 2022, including funds linked to North Korean hackers. Looking Ahead It remains unclear whether Galeotti’s clarification would have shielded Storm from prosecution. His legal team has confirmed plans to appeal the conviction, while the industry continues to watch closely for precedent-setting implications. The DOJ’s revised stance signals a potential recalibration of its enforcement strategy. By distinguishing between intentional misconduct and the unintended misuse of open-source software, the department appears to be drawing new boundaries around developer liability in the crypto space.

China Renaissance, a prominent Hong Kong-listed investment bank, recently announced a significant BNB investment , committing a staggering $100 million to BNB through a strategic deal with Easylabs. This move is not just a financial transaction; it represents a historic moment for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. Unpacking This Landmark BNB Investment Deal The core of this exciting news lies in the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed between China Renaissance and Easylabs. Easylabs, formerly known as Binance Labs, is a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. According to reliable reports from Wu Blockchain on X, this agreement solidifies China Renaissance’s intent to make a substantial BNB investment . The Parties Involved: China Renaissance, a publicly traded Chinese investment bank based in Hong Kong, and Easylabs, an entity with deep roots in the Binance ecosystem. The Sum: A remarkable $100 million dedicated to acquiring BNB, Binance’s native cryptocurrency. The Significance: This marks the very first time a Hong Kong-listed company has officially added BNB to its digital asset portfolio, setting a powerful precedent for institutional engagement. This strategic alliance highlights a growing confidence among established financial institutions in the long-term value and utility of digital assets like BNB. Why This BNB Investment is a Game Changer for Hong Kong? The implications of China Renaissance’s BNB investment extend far beyond the immediate financial figures. This decision carries significant weight, especially within Hong Kong’s dynamic financial landscape. It signals a crucial shift in how traditional firms perceive and interact with the crypto market. For years, many traditional financial institutions viewed cryptocurrencies with skepticism. However, this landmark move by a major Hong Kong-listed entity could inspire a wave of similar adoptions. It demonstrates a practical pathway for integrating digital assets into conventional investment strategies. Moreover, it aligns perfectly with Hong Kong’s evolving regulatory framework, which has shown increasing openness to digital assets and blockchain technology. Boosting BNB Chain Adoption: The Real-World Asset Fund Beyond the direct BNB investment , China Renaissance is also spearheading a more expansive initiative. The firm plans to launch a multi-hundred-million-dollar real-world asset (RWA) fund. This fund’s primary objective is to actively encourage other Hong Kong-listed companies to leverage the BNB Chain for their RWA and stablecoin projects. Think about the potential: This fund could become a catalyst for mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. By facilitating the tokenization of real-world assets – from real estate to commodities – and promoting the use of stablecoins on a robust platform like BNB Chain, China Renaissance aims to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. This strategy not only enhances the utility of the BNB Chain but also positions it as a preferred platform for institutional-grade RWA initiatives. The Strategic Impact and Future Outlook of This BNB Investment This substantial BNB investment by China Renaissance offers several compelling benefits and also presents some considerations for the future: Benefits: Enhanced Legitimacy: Provides further validation for BNB and the broader crypto market in the eyes of traditional finance. Increased Liquidity: A significant capital injection can contribute to BNB’s market stability and liquidity. Accelerated Innovation: The RWA fund will likely spur development and adoption of BNB Chain-based solutions for real-world applications. Market Precedent: Opens doors for other institutional investors in Hong Kong and potentially globally to explore similar digital asset strategies. Considerations: Regulatory Landscape: The evolving regulatory environment in Hong Kong and China will continue to shape the pace and scope of such investments. Market Volatility: Like all digital assets, BNB remains subject to market fluctuations, which investors must consider. This move is a strong indicator of the growing convergence between traditional finance and the decentralized world, driven by institutions recognizing the inherent value and potential of blockchain technology. In conclusion, China Renaissance’s $100 million BNB investment through its deal with Easylabs marks a truly pivotal moment. It not only signifies a major financial commitment but also paves the way for wider institutional adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology, particularly within the influential Hong Kong financial sector. This development underscores the increasing maturity and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the global investment landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

Hayes, who has started investing in altcoins again, one of which is Ethereum, predicted $20,000 for ETH. I Prefer Ethereum, It Could Rise to $20,000! Arthur Hayes said in a recent interview that he is buying back Etheruem and altcoins after taking profits. As for the reason for their buyback, Hayes stated that the ETH chart is pointing upwards. “I bought back some of the ETH I sold. Because the chart shows it will go up. So I can't fight the market.” Arthur Hayes, who also compared Solana to Ethereum, admitted that both networks have strong ecosystems. However, Hayes stated that he still prefers Ethereum over Solana this cycle. The famous figure also shared his price prediction for ETH, stating that it could rise to between $10,000 and $20,000 by the end of this cycle. Hayes also considered US President Donald Trump's focus on economic success as a positive factor for the cryptocurrency market. “While it may be difficult to reach that level in the very short term, the asset-friendly policy orientation and capital inflows from digital asset treasury companies in this cycle and during the Trump administration will drive the upward trend. “Also, in the short term, Solana may offer higher returns, but in terms of market size and stability, Ethereum has a better risk-adjusted return profile.” In early August, Arthur Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would test $100,000 and ETH $3,000, stating that no major economy was currently generating credit fast enough to increase nominal GDP. However, Hayes appears to have backtracked on these bearish predictions in a recent interview. *This is not investment advice.

This level, which has emerged as both psychological and technical support, will likely determine whether bulls can regain momentum or if bears will extend their grip on the market. Over the past several sessions, XRP has struggled to break free from its downward channel, with a prior attempt to move higher dismissed as a “fake break.” That rejection has kept traders cautious, underscoring the importance of the $2.80 zone. Analysts suggest that this region holds significant liquidity, meaning large orders could trigger either a sharp rebound or an accelerated decline, depending on which side prevails. Lingrid added that If buyers successfully defend the $2.80 mark, the technical structure favors a push back toward $3.40, which aligns with the upper boundary of the descending channel. This would not only restore short-term optimism but also validate the strength of XRP’s broader market resilience. Similar sentiments were shared by market expert DeGram that XRP was rejected at the recent all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 and continues to slide within a descending channel and is now testing the $2.83 support zone, a level where buyers previously mounted strong defenses. Degram added , “A bounce here could trigger a breakout toward $3.20–$3.30, while losing $2.83 risks deeper downside into $2.60. The next move depends on whether bulls reclaim momentum from this demand zone.” At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.84, according to CoinGecko data . Spot XRP and Solana ETFs Poised for Approval Within Two Months, Analyst Says According to market analyst Xaif Crypto, industry veteran Nate Geraci believes the long-anticipated floodgates for Spot XRP and Solana ETFs could open within the next two months. This development, if realized, would mark a historic expansion of crypto’s presence in traditional finance, adding two major altcoins to the growing list of assets with ETF access. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store and a leading voice in the ETF space, believes XRP and Solana are the next logical candidates for spot ETFs. With Bitcoin and Ethereum products already approved, he argues that growing institutional demand and mounting regulatory momentum leave the SEC little choice but to expand access to structured, transparent crypto investment vehicles. XRP’s push toward resistance comes as legal clarity and ISO 20022 compliance strengthen its case for institutional adoption, particularly in cross-border payments. At the same time, Solana’s rapid rise, driven by high throughput, low fees, and accelerating traction in DeFi and NFTs, underscores its position as one of the fastest-growing blockchain ecosystems. Therefore, approval would give investors regulated, exchange-traded access to these altcoins without the burden of direct custody, easing concerns over security and accessibility. Analysts believe Solana and XRP ETFs could unleash major inflows from institutions and retail investors eager for simpler entry into the crypto market. Conclusion If approved, spot XRP and Solana ETFs would not only validate the growing maturity of digital assets but also reshape how traditional investors interact with crypto. By bridging Wall Street and blockchain, these products could accelerate mainstream adoption, deepen liquidity, and establish XRP and Solana as pillars of the next wave of financial innovation. For now, all eyes remain on the $2.80 level because a decisive hold could mark the beginning of a bullish reversal, paving the way for a climb toward $3.40 and beyond.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|SOL|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 14:14:17

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again captured global attention, soaring past the significant $116,000 mark. According to recent market monitoring, Bitcoin (BTC) is now trading impressively at approximately $116,044.51 on platforms like the Binance USDT market. This remarkable surge is not just a number; it represents a powerful wave of market confidence and renewed interest in the digital asset space. Investors and enthusiasts alike are closely watching, eager to understand the forces behind this upward trajectory and what it might signal for the future of the crypto market. Why is the Bitcoin Price Soaring? Several key factors are contributing to the current robust performance of the Bitcoin price . Understanding these elements helps paint a clearer picture of the market dynamics at play. It’s not often that we see such rapid movements without significant underlying catalysts. Institutional Adoption: More large institutions and corporations are investing in Bitcoin, recognizing its potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. This influx of capital from major players provides substantial buying pressure. Macroeconomic Landscape: Global economic uncertainties often push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Concerns over inflation and traditional market volatility make Bitcoin an attractive option for diversifying portfolios. Halving Event Impact: While not recent, the long-term effects of Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, continue to influence its scarcity and perceived value. This limited supply, coupled with increasing demand, naturally drives the Bitcoin price higher. Increased Retail Interest: Renewed interest from individual investors, often spurred by positive news and price movements, also plays a role. Social media trends and broader media coverage can ignite a fresh wave of retail buying. What Does This Bitcoin Price Milestone Mean for Investors? Reaching a new milestone like $116,000 for the Bitcoin price has several implications for both current holders and prospective investors. It signifies a strong bullish sentiment but also reminds us of the inherent volatility in the crypto market. Boosted Market Confidence: A rising price often generates positive feedback loops, encouraging more investment and reinforcing the belief in Bitcoin’s long-term viability. This can lead to further upward momentum. Potential for Further Growth: Many analysts see this as a sign that Bitcoin has more room to grow, potentially aiming for even higher valuations in the coming months. However, predicting exact future movements is always challenging. Heightened Volatility: While exciting, rapid price increases can also precede periods of correction. Investors should always be prepared for potential pullbacks, as market corrections are a natural part of any asset’s growth cycle. For those who have held onto their Bitcoin through various market cycles, this milestone is a rewarding moment, validating their long-term investment strategy. For newcomers, it highlights the potential for significant gains but also underscores the importance of careful research. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Price Movements Given the current exciting movements in the Bitcoin price , what are some practical steps investors can take? It is crucial to approach the market with a well-thought-out strategy, regardless of whether you are a seasoned trader or just starting your crypto journey. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Understand the technology, market trends, and potential risks associated with Bitcoin. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a large sum all at once, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can help mitigate the impact of market volatility and average out your purchase price over time, especially during periods of fluctuating Bitcoin price . Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a leading cryptocurrency, it is wise to diversify your investments across different assets, including other cryptocurrencies and traditional assets, to spread risk. Risk Management is Key: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear profit targets and stop-loss limits to protect your capital from unexpected market downturns. The crypto market can be unpredictable, and protecting your initial investment is paramount. Staying informed about global economic news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the crypto space will provide you with a significant edge. The market moves quickly, and knowledge is power. The surge of the Bitcoin price above $116,000 is a testament to its enduring appeal and growing acceptance in the global financial landscape. While the journey of any asset comes with its ups and downs, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate its resilience and potential for significant long-term value. This latest milestone serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency market. As Bitcoin continues to forge its path, it offers both thrilling opportunities and important lessons for investors worldwide. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What caused the recent surge in Bitcoin price? The recent surge in Bitcoin price is attributed to several factors, including increased institutional adoption, macroeconomic uncertainties pushing investors towards alternative assets, and the ongoing effects of Bitcoin’s halving events limiting supply. 2. Is $116,000 a new all-time high for Bitcoin? While $116,000 is a significant milestone, it is important to note that Bitcoin’s all-time high has been higher in the past. This current surge indicates strong recovery and renewed bullish momentum. 3. Should I invest in Bitcoin now that its price is high? Investing in Bitcoin, especially when the Bitcoin price is high, requires careful consideration. It is crucial to conduct your own research, understand the risks, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. 4. How does institutional adoption affect the Bitcoin price? Institutional adoption brings substantial capital into the market, increasing demand and often leading to higher prices. When major financial entities invest, it also lends credibility and stability to Bitcoin, encouraging broader acceptance. 5. What are the main risks associated with investing in Bitcoin? The main risks include high price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, potential security breaches, and market manipulation. It is essential to be aware of these factors and manage your risk accordingly. Did you find this analysis of the Bitcoin price surge insightful?

Prime Minister Mark Carney will make the announcement after a cabinet meeting this Friday, according to Bloomberg. The policy change means that any American products that comply with USMCA rules will enter Canada tariff-free, ending a chunk of the trade war that’s been dragging on since Donald Trump’s first term. But while consumer products are getting a pass, Canada isn’t touching the 25% import taxes on steel, aluminum, or U.S.-made vehicles. Those will stay. Trump had slapped duties on all of those sectors. Carney isn’t lifting a finger on them yet. The rollback is happening right before the USMCA is set to be reviewed, and officials say the change is about signaling the importance of that agreement. That’s the same deal Trump renegotiated years ago to replace NAFTA, and both countries are about to go back to the table. The latest move is a dramatic policy change for Canada, one of the few countries that didn’t hesitate to hit the U.S. back when Trump went protectionist. It also came one day after Carney and Trump finally got on the phone, something that hadn’t happened publicly in weeks. The White House has been irritated with the Canadian response to U.S. tariffs for years. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has especially been vocal, and this rollback shows Carney is done playing games on low-priority goods. Carney backs off tariffs Trudeau left behind This whole mess started with two rounds of countermeasures from Canada. The first wave came in March, when Trudeau’s government slapped a 25% tax on about C$30 billion, or roughly $21.7 billion, worth of American imports. The list included orange juice, wine, clothes, and even motorcycles. That was followed by a second round of tariffs after Trump went after foreign metals. Ottawa responded with fresh taxes on U.S. steel and aluminum, plus a mix of other consumer items. Those measures hit another C$30 billion of American products, and that happened just as Carney was moving into office. Carney didn’t waste time on the campaign trail. He ran on a trade war platform, promising “maximum pain” for the U.S. if Washington kept messing with Canada’s economy. When Trump put tariffs on Canadian-built cars, Carney answered by taxing American auto exports right back. But since becoming prime minister, Carney has taken a different approach from Trudeau. He’s not all about escalation anymore. In April, Carney’s finance minister gave businesses room to breathe. A bunch of goods got exempted from tariffs. Some automakers, including General Motors and Stellantis, were told they could apply for relief if they kept building and investing inside Canada. It was the first sign that Carney was shifting gears from campaign talk to government strategy. Then Trump doubled down. The White House raised tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%. Carney warned of retaliation but didn’t follow through. Later, on August 1, the U.S. bumped its so-called fentanyl tariff on Canadian products from 25% to 35%, and again, Ottawa made no change. Despite the pressure, Canada’s tariff playbook stayed exactly the same. Even with all these back-and-forth moves, the impact on everyday Canadians has been minimal. The retaliatory tariffs haven’t spiked prices. This week, Statistics Canada reported that the consumer price index only climbed 1.7% in July compared to the same time last year. That’s still under the Bank of Canada’s 2% inflation target. So, while Trump has ramped up the economic pressure, the damage hasn’t filtered into the average Canadian household. Trump’s side hasn’t completely shut off trade either. Thanks to an existing USMCA exemption, most Canadian exports to the U.S. are still flowing without extra taxes. Analysts at Bank of Nova Scotia estimate that the actual U.S. tariff rate on Canadian goods is under 7%. So while things look tense, the border hasn’t turned into a full-on economic warzone.

The primary factor driving this surge is recent commentary from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Speaking at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, Powell signaled that the balance of risks has shifted and that the central bank is prepared to cut rates as early as September. He noted that labor market conditions are softening and inflation trends are evolving, creating the possibility of a more accommodative policy stance. This shift has been viewed by markets as a clear indication that the era of high rates may be nearing an end, which has immediately supported risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. Transmission Into Crypto Markets The response to Powell’s remarks was immediate across the financial system, with equities, bonds, and digital assets moving higher. Bitcoin and Ethereum both recorded sharp gains, and XRP also rose significantly in the hours following the comments. In practical terms, lower expected interest rates reduce the cost of capital and weaken the U.S. dollar, both of which are conditions that typically favor digital assets. XRP has been a beneficiary of this environment, with liquidity flowing into the broader altcoin market following the initial move in Bitcoin. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Outlook for XRP Whether XRP sustains this momentum will depend largely on how incoming economic data influences market expectations for rate cuts. If the probability of a September cut remains elevated, the supportive backdrop for cryptocurrencies is likely to hold. For now, the catalyst behind XRP’s surge is clear. A dovish shift from the Federal Reserve has boosted appetite for risk, and XRP is advancing strongly as part of that wider move in digital assets.

By 2028, the price is projected to reach $9.84 By 2031, FIL may reach $27.90. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network designed to securely and efficiently store humanity’s most important information. Launched by Protocol Labs in October 2020, it utilizes blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer digital storage marketplace. Users can rent unused hard drive space to earn Filecoin tokens (FIL), the network’s native cryptocurrency. The system operates on a proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime consensus mechanism, ensuring that data is reliably stored over time and that storage providers hold the exact copies they claim. This approach incentivizes a robust and distributed network of storage providers, enhancing data retrieval speeds and security compared to traditional centralized servers. Filecoin aims to reduce the costs of storage services by leveraging the global surplus of storage capacity. As part of the broader Web3 ecosystem, it supports decentralized applications (dApps) and services requiring secure, decentralized data storage solutions, significantly advancing decentralized internet infrastructure.

The RSI at 41.84 signals weakening demand and sits close to oversold territory, suggesting buyers are hesitant to step in. The MACD remains negative, reinforcing downward pressure. Bollinger Bands indicate price is moving toward the lower band near $2.25, acting as immediate support, while resistance lies at $2.48 and $2.70. A breakdown below $2.25 could invite further selling toward $2.00. However, if bulls defend this zone, FIL may attempt a recovery toward $2.48, making the coming sessions pivotal.

Recently, a monumental effort by international law enforcement delivered a significant blow to cybercriminals operating across the African continent. Interpol’s latest initiative, Operation Serengeti 2.0, successfully busted a massive crypto scam , sending a powerful message against digital fraud and illicit financial activities globally. What Did Operation Serengeti 2.0 Achieve Against Crypto Scams? Interpol’s Operation Serengeti 2.0 stands as a powerful testament to the effectiveness of global cooperation in the relentless fight against cybercrime. This extensive initiative saw coordinated efforts across 18 African countries and the U.K., yielding truly remarkable results. The sheer scale of this operation vividly illustrates the escalating threat posed by increasingly sophisticated digital fraud and the urgent need for robust countermeasures. Over 1,200 Cybercriminals Arrested: This substantial number of arrests underscores the vast and intricate networks involved in these illicit activities, from masterminds to foot soldiers. Targeted 88,000 Victims: A staggering eighty-eight thousand individuals were directly impacted and defrauded by these criminal enterprises, highlighting the human cost of such scams. $97.4 Million Seized: Authorities successfully recovered a significant sum, approximately $97.4 million, effectively disrupting the financial lifeblood of these criminal groups and preventing further illicit gains. These decisive actions by Interpol and partner agencies demonstrate a proactive and determined approach to safeguarding digital assets and protecting vulnerable populations from falling prey to elaborate and deceptive schemes. It shows that even complex cross-border operations can be successfully countered. Unpacking the Colossal $300 Million Crypto Scam in Zambia Among the many significant successes of Operation Serengeti 2.0, the uncovering of a colossal crypto scam centered in Zambia truly stands out. This particular scheme was exceptionally sophisticated and far-reaching, serving as a stark example of the complex nature of modern digital fraud and the allure of quick, but fake, riches. Defrauded 65,000 People: This specific crypto scam targeted an immense number of individuals, often luring them with enticing but false promises of high returns on cryptocurrency investments, exploiting their trust and financial hopes. Estimated $300 Million Loss: This staggering figure represents the immense financial damage inflicted upon victims, impacting countless lives, livelihoods, and futures across the region. Dismantling Illegal Mining Sites: In a related effort in Angola, 25 illegal crypto mining sites were also dismantled. These sites often serve as hidden fronts or tools for broader criminal operations, consuming vast amounts of electricity and resources illegally, further funding illicit activities. The exposure of this particular crypto scam highlights the urgent need for increased public awareness, robust financial literacy, and unwavering vigilance among potential investors in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Always be skeptical of promises that seem too good to be true. Beyond Financial Fraud: The Broader Impact of Cybercrime Networks The insidious reach of these cybercrime networks extends far beyond mere financial fraud. Interpol’s extensive operation also shed crucial light on the darker, more disturbing aspects of these illicit activities, revealing how they often intertwine with other severe crimes, posing a threat to global security. Disrupted Human Trafficking: Disturbingly, the operation uncovered direct links to human trafficking, demonstrating the horrifyingly multifaceted nature of organized cybercrime. This connection underscores how criminal groups diversify their illicit activities, exploiting people for profit. Exposed Widespread Cross-Border Networks: The successful coordination across multiple countries emphatically highlights the absolute necessity of robust international collaboration to effectively combat criminals who operate seamlessly without regard for national borders or legal jurisdictions. Enhanced Global Security: By systematically dismantling these intricate networks, authorities not only protected individuals from devastating financial losses but also made a significant contribution to overall global security, making the digital space safer for everyone. Therefore, the ongoing fight against digital fraud and the specific challenge of the crypto scam is not solely about money; it is fundamentally about protecting human dignity, upholding justice, and ensuring a safer, more secure digital environment for every individual worldwide. It’s a battle for trust in the digital age. Conclusion: A Resounding Victory Against Digital Fraud Operation Serengeti 2.0 stands as a resounding victory in the ongoing, complex battle against cybercrime and digital fraud. The seizure of nearly $100 million, the arrests of over a thousand criminals, and the decisive disruption of a massive crypto scam send a clear and unequivocal message: international law enforcement agencies are rapidly adapting, strengthening their capabilities, and intensifying their efforts to protect the digital frontier. As the cryptocurrency space continues its rapid evolution, so too must our collective vigilance, public education, and collaborative strategies to ensure its integrity, security, and safety for all participants.

Investors trying to price it have been left stuck between rally talk and panic selling. The currency has jumped 7.2% against the U.S. dollar since January, but it’s also dropped 4.3% against the euro, a split that’s made it harder than ever to call. According to CNBC, the entire rally has grown messier as Britain’s economic backdrop keeps throwing curveballs. The U.K. became the first country to strike a trade agreement with Donald Trump’s White House under the president’s new “reciprocal” tariffs. The deal gave British goods an advantage that other nations didn’t get. That helped support the pound, but it didn’t fix the damage from weak labor numbers, public finance stress, and a government in disarray. At the same time, investors have been moving away from U.S. assets, which, of course, pushed the pound higher by default. Markets cut expectations as politics, inflation clash Growth came in stronger than expected earlier this year. Consumer spending looked up. Some businesses showed signs of life. For a minute, there was a flicker of optimism. But then inflation hit harder than markets had priced in. That forced traders to rethink their bets on the Bank of England’s next moves. After the data landed, most players pulled back from expecting more rate cuts this year. Instead, they began to price in a pause, possibly holding rates where they are through the rest of 2025. The impact on the pound was instant. Kamal Sharma, senior FX strategist at Bank of America, said over the phone that as the rate cut narrative faded, sterling spiked, then quickly reversed. “As you’d expect, as the market pared back rate cuts, sterling rallied, and then suddenly, out of nowhere, we saw quite a big move in the opposite direction,” he said. Sharma explained that most investors have been negative on the pound for months. He thinks they’ve gone too far. “The U.K.’s fiscal position remains quite perilous,” he said, but added that the pessimism may be “probably excessive.” Meanwhile, Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is boxed in. She can’t push through more spending with rising opposition inside her own party over welfare cuts. And borrowing more isn’t an option. That’s why talk of new taxes has become more common, even if no one’s saying it on the record. Analysts clash on direction as pound outlook splits Expectations for where the pound goes next are all over the place. A Reuters poll showed predictions ranging from $1.22 to $1.42 by January. Sharma’s own targets put the pound at $1.40 versus the dollar and 0.82 euros by year-end. The current level sits around $1.156 and 0.865 euros, giving traders little to trust. Sharma believes there will still be another rate cut in November, but said the bigger issue is how investors are thinking about “terminal rate pricing.” Sharma also pointed out that the euro is holding up because of larger changes in the European economy. Germany’s fiscal spending, higher defense budgets, and better capital market integration could all give the euro an edge. He told CNBC that traders are clearly taking a pessimistic view of the pound. “It does seem that the market is taking a very much a glass-half-empty rather than a glass-half-full approach,” he said. From a non-British view, that outlook makes sense. “It’s a compelling reason to be short sterling.” Still, Sharma noted that British goods are now subject to lower U.S. tariffs than any other country. That could eventually help the currency recover, assuming domestic growth improves. “What this all boils down to is we need more growth,” he said. “If we can deliver a bit more productivity in the next couple of months, that may encourage investors to dial back some of that pessimism.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Economy|EUR|GBP|USD,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-22 15:25:03

This synthetic dollar protocol recently made a significant announcement, marking a new era for its collateral strategy. It’s a development that crypto enthusiasts and investors are watching closely. Ethena USDe , a rapidly growing synthetic stablecoin, has taken a crucial step by officially adding Binance Coin (BNB) as a backing asset. This move signals a strategic expansion of its collateral base beyond the initial Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holdings. The protocol is not stopping there; it is also actively reviewing other prominent digital assets like XRP and HYPE for potential future inclusion. This strategic pivot aims to enhance the stability and diversification of Ethena USDe , reinforcing its position in the competitive stablecoin market. Why is Ethena USDe Diversifying Its Crucial Collateral? Ethena’s decision to broaden its asset backing stems from a newly introduced Eligible Asset Framework. This framework is a robust guide, setting clear quantitative and governance criteria for any new collateral. It ensures that only assets meeting strict standards can support the synthetic dollar. The goal is to build a more resilient and diversified backing for Ethena USDe . Diversification is vital for any financial product, especially in the volatile crypto space. By not relying solely on a few assets, Ethena aims to mitigate risks and enhance the long-term stability of its USDe token. This proactive approach helps secure the protocol’s future and strengthens investor confidence. BNB Joins Ethena USDe’s Backing: What Does This Mean? The inclusion of BNB is a landmark event. It represents the first new asset to be approved under Ethena’s stringent framework. This addition brings significant liquidity and a broader market presence to the collateral basket. BNB’s integration is a testament to its market standing and Ethena’s confidence in its stability. Key Benefits of BNB Integration: Increased Diversification: Reduces reliance on BTC and ETH, spreading risk across more assets. Enhanced Liquidity: BNB’s large market capitalization provides substantial liquidity to the collateral pool. Broader Ecosystem Integration: Strengthens ties with the Binance ecosystem, potentially opening new avenues for Ethena USDe . This strategic move reflects Ethena’s commitment to continuous improvement and adaptation within the dynamic digital asset landscape. What’s Next for Ethena USDe? Exploring XRP and HYPE Ethena’s risk committee is already looking ahead, with XRP and HYPE identified as potential next candidates. These assets have reportedly met the initial thresholds set by the Eligible Asset Framework. However, they are currently undergoing further rigorous review to ensure they meet all necessary criteria. Adding XRP could bring a massive community and substantial market cap, while HYPE might offer unique diversification benefits depending on its characteristics. Such careful consideration underscores Ethena’s methodical approach to asset expansion. The aim remains to bolster the robustness of Ethena USDe and its long-term viability. How Does Ethena USDe Maintain its Peg with Crucial Strategies? Maintaining a stable peg is paramount for any stablecoin. Ethena USDe achieves this through an innovative mechanism: delta-hedged perpetual futures. This sophisticated strategy involves simultaneously holding a long position in a crypto asset and a short position in its perpetual futures contract. This balances out price movements, ensuring stability. As The Block reported, this method effectively neutralizes price exposure, ensuring that the value of USDe remains consistently pegged to the US dollar. It’s a complex but effective way to provide stability in a volatile market, allowing Ethena USDe to grow as the third-largest stablecoin with an impressive $11.75 billion supply. This makes its expansion strategy even more crucial. Ethena’s strategic decision to expand its collateral base with BNB, and its plans for XRP and HYPE, marks a pivotal moment for Ethena USDe . This calculated approach, guided by a robust framework and supported by sophisticated hedging strategies, reinforces its commitment to stability and growth. As the synthetic dollar continues to evolve, its expanded backing promises a more resilient and diversified future in the ever-changing crypto ecosystem. This crucial development highlights Ethena’s proactive stance in the competitive stablecoin arena. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is Ethena USDe? Ethena USDe is a synthetic stablecoin designed to maintain a stable peg to the US dollar. It achieves this through delta-hedged perpetual futures strategies and a diversified basket of backing assets. 2. Why did Ethena add BNB as collateral?

With Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidating at new levels, attention has shifted toward cheaper tokens that still carry the potential for outsized returns. Among meme coins priced under $1, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Moonshot MAGAX (MAGAX) are emerging as the top contenders. While DOGE and SHIB remain household names in crypto, Moonshot MAGAX is attracting significant attention from early investors who see it as the next project capable of combining meme culture with real blockchain innovation. Analysts argue that MAGAX has the clearest path to exponential growth in 2025. Dogecoin's Staying Power as a Leading Meme Coin Dogecoin , often referred to as the “grandfather of meme coins,” remains a critical part of the crypto landscape. With a market cap exceeding $20 billion, DOGE has proven its resilience across multiple market cycles. Its simple, lighthearted branding continues to resonate with the online community, while support from high-profile figures like Elon Musk keeps it in the spotlight. However, Dogecoin’s lack of meaningful utility has kept its price relatively stagnant compared to other altcoins. Analysts suggest it may struggle to deliver the kind of explosive returns that new investors are hoping for in 2025. Shiba Inu's Evolution Beyond Meme Status Shiba Inu has worked to evolve beyond its meme coin origins. With the launch of Shibarium, its layer-2 scaling solution, and an expanding ecosystem of DeFi and NFT applications, SHIB has gained a reputation as the most ambitious of the meme projects. Trading at fractions of a cent, SHIB remains attractive to investors who see room for long-term adoption. However, critics point out that despite its strong community and technological advancements, its massive circulating supply continues to suppress price momentum. Moonshot MAGAX: The Next Big Meme Coin? Unlike DOGE and SHIB, Moonshot MAGAX is entering the meme coin arena with both fresh momentum and a strong utility model. At its core is the AI-powered Loomint system, which rewards content creators for generating memes and viral moments. This unique utility transforms meme culture from entertainment into a monetizable economy, giving MAGAX a powerful advantage. Early presale traction is another factor fueling optimism. With tokens priced at just $0.00027 during presale, investors see enormous upside potential if MAGAX follows a trajectory similar to early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu growth phases. A 5% limited-time presale bonus further incentivizes entry, while a successful Certik audit has reassured investors about the project’s security and long-term integrity. Can Moonshot MAGAX Deliver a 50x-100x ROI? Market analysts are already floating ambitious projections for MAGAX , with some suggesting that the token could achieve a 50x to 100x return once it lists on major exchanges. While such forecasts should be approached with caution, historical examples back up the optimism: Dogecoin’s early backers and Shiba Inu’s presale investors witnessed astronomical returns as community-driven hype combined with mainstream adoption. If MAGAX can capture even a fraction of that growth while sustaining its unique utility model, early investors stand to see life-changing gains. The Rise of Retail Crypto Favorites Meme coins continue to attract retail traders for one primary reason: accessibility. Their low price points make them appealing to new investors who want to hold millions of tokens for a relatively small cost. Combined with viral social media attention, these coins often benefit from sudden surges in demand that traditional cryptocurrencies rarely experience. Moonshot MAGAX taps directly into this narrative, but with a more structured approach that sets it apart. Its AI-backed ecosystem and transparent security measures suggest it may be one of the first meme coins to successfully balance entertainment with sustainable growth. Why Moonshot MAGAX Leads the Pack Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have already secured their places as leaders of the meme coin world. But as the market evolves, the door is wide open for a new entrant to capture attention and capital. Moonshot MAGAX , with its presale momentum, AI-driven utility, and strong community foundation, is emerging as that frontrunner. At under $1, MAGAX offers an affordable entry point with the kind of asymmetric upside that meme coin investors crave. With a Certik audit in place and presale bonuses still available, early adopters are positioning MAGAX as the meme coin most likely to deliver explosive growth in 2025.

This sudden downturn, which contributed to a staggering $420 million in liquidations over the past 24 hours across major exchanges, left many traders reeling. But what exactly drives such rapid market movements, and what does it mean for your crypto portfolio? What is a Crypto Futures Liquidation and Why Does It Happen? When you trade crypto futures, you are essentially betting on the future price of a cryptocurrency. Many traders use leverage, which means they borrow funds to amplify their potential gains. However, leverage also magnifies losses. A crypto futures liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. This happens when the market moves significantly against their prediction. Imagine you open a long position (betting on price increase) with 10x leverage. If the price drops by just 10%, your entire initial capital could be wiped out, triggering a liquidation. Exchanges execute these liquidations to prevent traders from incurring negative balances, protecting both the exchange and other market participants. The Immediate Impact of Sudden Crypto Futures Liquidation A large-scale crypto futures liquidation wave, like the one we just witnessed, has immediate and dramatic effects on the market. Primarily, it means significant losses for the traders whose positions were closed. Moreover, these forced sell-offs can create a cascading effect, pushing prices down further and triggering even more liquidations. This creates heightened volatility, making the market unpredictable. For instance, a sudden drop can lead to a ‘liquidation cascade,’ where one liquidation triggers another, creating a rapid downward spiral. This is precisely what often happens during periods of intense market uncertainty. What Triggers Such a Large-Scale Crypto Futures Liquidation Event? Several factors can contribute to a massive crypto futures liquidation . Often, a sudden, sharp price movement in the underlying asset is the primary catalyst. This can be due to: Macroeconomic News: Unexpected economic data or policy changes can impact investor sentiment across all markets, including crypto. Whale Movements: Large institutional or individual holders (whales) making significant trades can quickly shift market dynamics. Technical Breakdowns: When key support levels are breached, it can trigger automated selling and panic among traders. Regulatory Announcements: News about potential new regulations can create uncertainty and lead to sell-offs. In this recent event, a combination of these elements likely contributed to the rapid $118 million worth of futures liquidated, signaling a sudden shift in market momentum. Navigating Volatility: Strategies After a Crypto Futures Liquidation Wave While the market can be unpredictable, traders can adopt strategies to mitigate risks, especially after a period of intense crypto futures liquidation . Understanding leverage is crucial; using lower leverage can significantly reduce your liquidation risk. Additionally, implementing robust risk management practices is essential: Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automatically close your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting potential losses. Manage Position Sizes: Avoid putting too much capital into a single trade, especially when using leverage. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and sentiment to anticipate potential price movements. Diversify: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying your portfolio can help spread risk. These proactive measures can help protect your capital during volatile periods and make you a more resilient trader. In conclusion, the recent $118 million crypto futures liquidation serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with leveraged trading in the cryptocurrency market. While such events can be unsettling, they also underscore the importance of understanding market mechanisms, practicing stringent risk management, and staying informed. By learning from these rapid shifts, traders can better prepare themselves for future market fluctuations and navigate the dynamic world of crypto futures with greater confidence. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level, usually due to significant adverse price movements. How does leverage contribute to liquidations? Leverage allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. While it can amplify profits, it also magnifies losses, making positions more susceptible to liquidation with even small price movements against the trade. Can I avoid crypto futures liquidation? You can minimize the risk of liquidation by using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and carefully managing your position sizes. However, no strategy can guarantee complete avoidance in extremely volatile markets. What are common triggers for large liquidations? Large liquidations are often triggered by sudden, sharp price movements in the underlying cryptocurrency, which can be caused by significant news events, macroeconomic shifts, whale activity, or technical breakdowns in market structure. What is the difference between long and short liquidations? A long liquidation occurs when the price of an asset drops significantly, forcing the closure of positions betting on a price increase. A short liquidation happens when the price rises sharply, leading to the closure of positions betting on a price decrease. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Finally.” His message quickly reverberated through the XRP community, setting the stage for a surge in price and renewed optimism across the crypto market. Speaking at Jackson Hole, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that evolving economic conditions could justify rate cuts in the months ahead, particularly if labor-market softness continues. This subtle but significant shift in tone marked a departure from the Fed’s earlier cautious stance. Markets immediately interpreted his remarks as dovish, sparking rallies in equities, bonds, and risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. JUST IN: Powell suggests economic conditions may warrant rate cuts. Finally. — Dom | EasyA (@dom_kwok) August 22, 2025 XRP Price Action: From Low to Breakout The impact on XRP was swift. After dipping to an intraday low of $2.79, XRP rebounded sharply, climbing to around $3.03 at press time — an 8.6% gain from the day’s bottom. Data from CoinDesk showed an initial 3% spike in minutes following Powell’s comments, with momentum accelerating as short sellers were squeezed and buyers piled in. This decisive move highlighted how closely crypto markets remain tied to macroeconomic signals. Community Reaction and Sentiment Surge The XRP community erupted in response. Traders on X posted bullish charts, liquidity gap analyses, and calls for further upside. Social sentiment trackers reflected a surge in activity as Powell’s dovish signal collided with pent-up optimism around XRP.

What Comes Next for XRP While today’s rally underscores XRP’s sensitivity to interest-rate expectations , the sustainability of these gains will depend on upcoming economic data and the Fed’s follow-through in policy meetings. If the Fed moves toward easing, the improved liquidity environment could further support XRP’s long-term uptrend. For now, Powell’s words lit the spark, and Kwok’s amplification ensured that XRP holders seized the moment. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Analysts Call Layer Brett A Sleeping Giant Beside XRP,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-rally-incoming-analysts-call-layer-brett-a-sleeping-giant-beside-xrp/,"Fresh from a compelling victory over the SEC, XRP price predictions are quite bullish. Many expect a new all-time high, and going by the numerous signals that surround XRP, that might actually happen soon. However, experienced heads have their sights set on LayerBrett (LBRETT), a new sensational meme project. Analysts call this project a sleeping giant. Read on to find out why. Why analysts call LayerBrett a sleeping giant Visibility is quite important in the lifecycle of a crypto project. When prospective investors hear about a coin and the benefits it offers, they are more likely to purchase and add it to their crypto portfolios. LayerBrett is aware of this rule of nature, and it is well-positioned to leverage it to its advantage. Currently, Layer Brett (LBRETT) is moving rapidly through this critical “getting known” phase. On top of its meme coin appeal, Layer Brett distinguishes itself through its real-world functionality. As a layer-2 solution on Ethereum, it offers fast and inexpensive transactions. This sets it apart in an increasingly crowded meme market. But what draws most people to LBRETT is its staking rewards. The project boasts an unprecedented 25,000% APY yield, making it a source of steady passive income. Its affordable presale price, currently under a cent, means that even small entry amounts could balloon into massive earnings. With strong momentum already behind it and early adoption driving buzz, getting on the LBRETT train is a no-brainer. Analysts see it as one of the most explosive investment opportunities 2025 has to offer, and that’s why no one would want to miss out on it. XRP defeats SEC, expands network aggressively After a grueling and prolonged legal battle with the SEC, Ripple has finally emerged victorious. The project is now free from the shackles that stunted its growth over the years and gave it a bad reputation. This victory has cleared the path for institutional adoption of XRP tokens, which could well boost the XRP price. At the same time, Ripple has been expanding its network aggressively. The project recently launched network services in the UAE, and there are similar partnerships formed in South America. Each partnership serves as a vote of confidence in XRP’s utility as a fast, low-cost medium for global transactions. It boosts adoption, which is one of the most powerful forces that can fuel further price appreciation. XRP price prediction With legal hurdles cleared and adoption rising, XRP looks poised for a significant breakout. A close look at the XRP price chart shows a recent break above $2.84, and analysts have now identified this as a key support zone. Source: LeonardoCrypto on CoinMarketCap A bullish flag formation suggests that this momentum will be sustained. So, an XRP price prediction targeting $5 is not outlandish, given that the project is set for a potential explosive move. Conclusion XRP might be a decent investment option, given the bullish sentiments surrounding it. But for those who want life-changing profits, the coin of choice is LayerBrett. Available for $0.044 at the moment, LBRETT is set to be the next 100x meme token, and only early investors can enjoy its explosive ride to the moon. Layer Brett is in presale now, but it’s moving fast. Get in early, stake while rewards are high, and don’t miss your shot at the next 100x crypto!

STRK is heavily overcollateralized by Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings, making its risk quantifiable and hedgeable, unlike earnings-based dividend stocks. The market applies an excessive discount rate to STRK; actual risk is much lower, offering significant upside and an effective yield above 8%. The core thesis for why most dividend investors should seriously consider supplementing their REITs, MLPs, and dividend stock holdings with STRK is that STRK offers the same underlying features that dividend stocks offer but in a much better form with higher potential appreciation. Here are the features that dividend investors want: Steady income. Share price appreciation. As such, the following features make for a bad dividend investment (for the purposes of this article, I will just call distributions ""dividends,"" but of course they are different things): Income might ebb and flow with the economy. Share or unit price gets damaged by a high dividend or distribution outflow. Therefore, if we claim something is a viable alternative to dividend stocks, it must exemplify the first two features and have safeguards against the last two features. If I can show that Strategy Inc. 8.00% Series A perpetual Strike preferred ( STRK ) fits these criteria, then I would have shown why it is a superior alternative. STRK is the first preferred stock that Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) issued. It pays $8 per year, paid quarterly, on a $100 liquidation preference. The shares are also convertible to 0.1 shares of MSTR, Strategy's class A common stock. This gives us the simple equation for valuing STRK: STRK Valuation = $8 per year cash flow + 0.1 MSTR At the current price of $96 per share of STRK and $336 per share of MSTR, we can use the formula to determine that the $8 perpetuity is valued at 96 - 33.6 = 62.4. We can then use the present value of a perpetuity formula to determine that the market is discounting the cash flows at 8 / 62.4 = 12.8% per year. To show why STRK is undervalued, we must show that STRK deserves a lower discount rate (which means that the $8 perpetuity is undervalued) and/or that MSTR can go up (which means that the 0.1 MSTR component is undervalued). Why The 12.8% Discount Rate Should Be Much Lower STRK is overcollateralized 5.3x by Strategy's massive Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) holdings. This means that after deducting out the notional values for all the more senior instruments, the remaining BTC held by STRK must fall to less than a fifth of the current value because STRK investors cannot be paid back. That is an over 80% drop in the value of BTC. Strategy Credit (Strategy.com) Now, it is actually possible to get a pretty good estimate for the price the market pays for insuring damage beyond an 80% drawdown in BTC. You can look at the options market for BTC or IBIT puts whose strikes are 20% of the spot price. There's two important things to note at this point. The first is that Strategy's convertible bonds are mostly ITM. These will roll off the capital structure by converting into common equity. Michael Saylor has signaled in the Q2 2025 earnings call that the company will no longer issue convertible bonds. So the actual collateralization of STRK would be a lot higher since about $8.2 billion of instruments will be gone after they all mature, and most if not all bonds will equitize without a cash expense. This fact would mean that we can look at puts that are much further OTM than 20% of the spot price, since it implies that BTC would need to fall far more than 80% before STRK investors are threatened. Strategy Debt (Strategy.com) The second fact is that in an actual liquidation, the more senior instruments would not be paid off using the current BTC prices but at severely depressed prices. This means that we'd have to redo the collateralization ratio at that later point in time, meaning the 5.3x collateralization overstates the safety. This fact would mean that we need to look at puts much closer to the money. Both facts are true, and they impose opposite directional biases on our risk estimation. Thus, we have to see which force should dominate. I will just be more conservative, largely for the sake of argument, and look at hedges for a less than 80% drawdown. Let's assume a 50% drawdown is where STRK investors will start to suffer. IBIT currently trades at $64 and the 32 strike put option expiring in 848 days trades at $3.50. This means that to insure against a greater than 50% drawdown in BTC over the next 2.3 years, I only have to pay 3.5/32 = 10.9% of the value I'm insuring (again, this would be at the 50% drawdown point). IBIT options (TradingView) 10.9% paid over 2.3 years is an annualized yield of 4.7%. In other words, the cost to fully erase the BTC price risk for this 12.8% discount rate instrument is to pay 4.7%. Now please understand that a discount rate is applied to compensate for the risk of an instrument. So the market price of STRK is communicating a 12.8% discount rate. But the options market for BTC says that 4.7% is enough to erase all the price risk. The only other risks here would be execution risks. If Strategy somehow loses its BTC holdings due to technical errors, then this is an execution risk that the additional 8.1% excess to the BTC price risk is effectively compensating for. However, consider that Strategy uses extremely reputable custodians for its BTC, which is pretty much the same situation as IBIT (IBIT uses Coinbase). The other execution risk is Strategy somehow messes up its capital structure. Perhaps it issues a lot of more senior instruments over the next two years and therefore destroys the collateral ratio on STRK. This is possible. But I just don't see this justifying an 8.1% excess. Every investor has to do the math for themselves, but personally, I think 12.8% is much too high. The Case For MSTR Going Up I think we can safely assume that as long as BTC goes up over a longer time horizon, MSTR will go up too. The company is slightly leveraged by BTC because it has $14 billion of debt and preferred instruments against an asset base of $70 billion in BTC. The convertible bonds have an effective cost of capital of near 0% at this point, and the preferred equities have a cost of capital of around 12%. If you think BTC will have a long-term CAGR higher than these levels, then you'd expect the equity value of MSTR to increase over time since the equity holders would be earning the spread between the ROIC of BTC and the cost of capital to buy the BTC. Because STRK contains 0.1 MSTR, an increase in MSTR means that the second component of STRK in the aforementioned STRK valuation equation is going up. So will BTC go up? Many books have been written about this topic. The quick answer is a very likely yes. This is because BTC is a scarce and neutral asset. It is like gold in this sense. Yet, it is endlessly divisible and instantly transportable without the need for IOUs, like fiat currency. It also lacks the common risks that plague corporations, such as: natural disasters, management incompetency, bad jurisdictions or laws, competition, stagnation, etc. If these qualities are desirable to people, then BTC will very likely go up over time, and so will MSTR. Currently, MSTR trades at 1.55x its BTC holdings. It has already increased BTC per share by 25% since the start of 2025. To tie it back to the original statements of dividend investor preferences: The income consistency is safely addressed by the $8 perpetuity being overcollateralized and getting tagged with a demonstrably high discount rate The share price appreciation is addressed by the 0.1 MSTR component of STRK, which grows as the value of BTC increases To address the two features that dividend investors dislike: The income does not ebb and flow with the economy because the collateralization remains unless BTC collapses completely. BTC is a macro asset (historically it moves with liquidity and rates), and so the exact extent of overcollateralization may change, but it will not change the actual income being received. The income cuts into the share price, but there's an entirely unrelated component of the share price that is purely due to MSTR and BTC price appreciation. This carries the share price appreciation of STRK, even while the dividend is regularly paid. Is STRK Superior To Other Dividend Stocks? I believe STRK can be considered superior to other dividend stocks because the design is simple and so the risks are very visible and quantifiable. You cannot really say this for other dividend stocks. Idiosyncratic risks at the firm level are mitigated via broad baskets of equities. This is offered by ETFs like SCHD. But even so, that value is based on future earnings, which may or may not materialize. The difference with STRK is that its value is based on assets that Strategy currently owns. The asset is demonstrably 5.3x collateralized at this very moment in time. At any moment in time, we can know the exact collateralization and the exact price risk. Since it is all based on a single asset with a highly liquid derivatives market, we can also use hedges to perfectly remove the price risk altogether. A while ago, I wrote the following in a tweet explaining why over-collateralized fixed income is superior to earnings-based fixed income: You can calculate the exact risk at any moment. You know the senior obligations, the bitcoin price, the treasury size, and the capital stack. That means you can compute the exact price of bitcoin when your income gets threatened. You can get insurance at those exact points, and therefore very precisely hedge out the risk via derivatives. You obviously cannot do this with earnings-based fixed income. There are no direct ""earnings derivatives"". You might use the common stock's options, but these are a couple layers removed from your actual risk factor of earnings. Also, companies which issue preferred stock tend to have illiquid options, making the cost of hedging even higher. In short: All overcollateralized fixed income risk is contained within the collateral. And the collateral's risk is known and transferrable. In contrast, all earnings-based fixed income risk is contained within the earnings. And this risk is unknown and untransferable. The same logic applies to dividend stocks. The dividend from a normal dividend stock is ultimately derived from future earnings. This is an unquantifiable risk with unknown unknowns. While there is risk in BTC, the precise price risk in the case of STRK is quantifiable and, more importantly, transferable via liquid options markets. The ability to surgically isolate the price risk makes STRK very compelling and puts it at a different level from normal dividend stocks. Who Is STRK For? It's important to note that STRK is not for people who are bullish on BTC . If someone is truly bullish on BTC, then they should just buy BTC. At the current price, STRK is for income investors who simply think that BTC will stick around and steadily increase over time, even if it doesn't outperform equities like it used to. Specifically, as long as BTC can appreciate at an average of 8% per year, then the dividend is fully covered by the growth of Strategy's holdings and the collateralization ratio wouldn't change, assuming all else is held equal. 8% is a fairly low bar considering that this has been roughly the growth rate of the money supply over the last 10 years. The S&P 500 and gold have far outperformed 8% over the last few years. Even if BTC's growth rate lags these assets by a hundred or so basis points, the extent of the overcollateralization ensures that there is sufficient coverage for the dividend. Risk The risk of STRK is in BTC and in Strategy's execution. If BTC goes to 0, then there is no more yield. If you don't have at least a neutral outlook on BTC, then STRK will not be for you. If you think BTC will at least stick around for years to come, then STRK at current prices is worth serious investment consideration. If BTC falls 50%, then MSTR will probably have a much larger drawdown. Right now, exactly $34 of the total $96 STRK share price is attributable to MSTR. This means that a dip in MSTR can affect only about 35% of STRK's share price. Based on the overcollateralization, we've established that an 80% drop would be required to jeopardize STRK based on its notional value (and therefore dividends). And based on the market prices of IBIT puts, we've seen that it is trivial to hedge against such crashes in the BTC price for far less than what the dividends pay. Hence, you can think about the risk of a BTC crash to STRK by thinking about a buffered loss position. If BTC falls by just 50%, the $8 dividend remains extremely safe, but the price of STRK that comes from MSTR convertibility will fall, although this will lead to no more than a 35% drawdown (35% would be if MSTR went to 0, which is a very extreme scenario). If BTC falls by over 80%, then it is very likely that MSTR will shrink to a very small number while the dividend starts to become more jeopardized. Therefore, STRK is a buffered loss position where if BTC falls by a big number, then STRK won't suffer nearly as much and the dividend won't suffer at all. Yet, if BTC falls by a catastrophic number (let's say it goes down 99%), then STRK would go to 0 because the convertibility to MSTR would be worthless and the dividend would be gone too. This buffered loss risk profile is exactly why STRK is not for folks who think BTC is doomed but very viable for folks who think BTC will stick around. Strategy can also have execution mistakes. I think this is unlikely because they pay close attention to their risks and have clearly thought deeply about the implications of their credit instruments, going as far as to create a live dashboard quantifying the precise risks. The one risk I think is invalid which gets cited often is that Strategy is a Ponzi scheme because it must raise more capital to pay the dividends on its preferred shares. This is not true. Strategy only chooses to raise more capital by issuing common equity. It has every option to sell some BTC to pay the dividend because-as I've made abundantly clear-the preferred securities are heavily overcollateralized with assets! However, when the common stock trades at a premium to the underlying BTC, it just makes more sense to sell the common stock to capture that premium in the process. If the common stock traded at a discount to the underlying BTC, then it may make sense to sell BTC to pay dividends, but we'll likely see the company use other preferred instruments to do so, waiting for the common equity to recover to a premium. Either way, the fact that the company has the option to sell just some of its assets to fund all its liabilities many times over means that there is no situation where a continuous inflow of new investors is essential to the model. Thus, Strategy simply does not meet the definition of a Ponzi scheme. Conclusion I've laid out the risks of STRK and thoughts about why it is a great alternative for dividend investors. I believe that the market is applying a disproportionately high discount rate to the security. I also believe the market is yet to catch on to the real benefit of fixed-income instruments that are backed by present collateral rather than future earnings. Finally, I believe the convertibility into MSTR gives STRK a very compelling thesis for price appreciation. All of these things indicate that STRK is a highly undervalued asset. Priced with a better discount rate of 8% instead of the current 12.8%, we would get a present value of perpetuity of $100 ($8/8%=$100). The 0.1 MSTR convertibility means that a price target of $134 per share is reasonable at today's market conditions. Therefore, STRK at $96 is a Buy with almost 40% price appreciation upside and the opportunity to lock in an effective yield of over 8%.",MSTR|STRC|STRF|SCHD|STRK,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|STRK|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-22 15:32:32

Recently, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a significant speech at Jackson Hole, shedding light on pressing economic concerns. His remarks suggest a potential shift in Federal Reserve policy , driven by the visible impact of tariffs and growing economic risks. Understanding these developments is key for anyone following financial markets and the broader economy. What Did Powell Say About Tariffs and Prices? During his address, Chair Powell made it clear: the effects of tariffs on consumer prices are no longer theoretical. He stated that these impacts are “now clearly visible,” a direct acknowledgment of how trade policies are influencing everyday costs for Americans. This isn’t just about abstract economic models; it’s about tangible changes consumers experience. Visible Impact: Tariffs are directly contributing to higher prices for goods. Consumer Costs: These increased costs are being passed on to consumers. Inflation Expectations: Powell emphasized that stable inflation expectations “can’t be taken for granted” anymore, signaling a potential for more volatile price movements. This statement highlights a critical challenge for the Federal Reserve policy makers: how to manage inflation when external factors like tariffs are exerting upward pressure. How Might Rising Risks Influence Federal Reserve Policy? Beyond inflation, Powell also pointed to an increase in “downside risks to employment.” This means there’s a growing concern that economic conditions could worsen, potentially leading to job losses or slower job creation. When the job market faces headwinds, it often prompts central banks to consider adjustments to their monetary stance. The shifting balance of these risks — both to inflation and employment — suggests that the current Federal Reserve policy might need re-evaluation. Walter Bloomberg, reporting on X, highlighted Powell’s indication that these circumstances “may warrant adjusting policy.” This is a significant signal that the Fed is actively monitoring the situation and is prepared to act if necessary. What could “adjusting policy” entail? Interest Rate Changes: The Fed might consider altering interest rates to stimulate or cool down the economy. Quantitative Easing/Tightening: Changes to asset purchase programs could also be on the table. Forward Guidance: The Fed’s communication about future policy direction can itself influence market expectations. Navigating Economic Uncertainty: What Does This Mean for You? For businesses and individuals alike, these signals from the Federal Reserve are crucial. Higher tariffs mean increased costs for imported goods, which can then ripple through supply chains and affect final product prices. This can impact consumer purchasing power and corporate profitability. Understanding the potential trajectory of Federal Reserve policy helps in making informed financial decisions. Key Takeaways: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on economic data and Fed announcements. Budget Wisely: Be mindful of potential price increases due to tariffs and inflation. Assess Investments: Consider how changes in interest rates or economic outlook might affect your investment portfolio. The Fed’s dual mandate is to maintain maximum employment and price stability. When these two objectives are challenged by external forces like tariffs, the path forward becomes complex. Powell’s remarks underscore the delicate balancing act required to steer the U.S. economy through uncertain waters. In conclusion, Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech served as a vital update on the economic challenges facing the U.S. economy. His clear warning about the visible impact of tariffs on prices and the rising risks to employment signals that a proactive approach to Federal Reserve policy may be necessary. As the Fed considers its next moves, the focus remains on ensuring both price stability and a healthy job market amidst global trade tensions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are tariffs, and how do they affect prices? A1: Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. When tariffs are applied, they increase the cost of these goods for importers, who often pass these higher costs on to consumers through increased retail prices. Q2: Why is the Federal Reserve concerned about stable inflation expectations? A2: Stable inflation expectations are crucial because they help keep actual inflation predictable and moderate. If people expect prices to rise rapidly, they might demand higher wages or raise prices themselves, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of higher inflation. The Federal Reserve policy aims to anchor these expectations. Q3: What does “downside risks to employment” mean? A3: This phrase indicates a concern that factors in the economy could lead to a slowdown in job growth or even job losses. These risks could stem from various sources, including trade disputes, reduced consumer spending, or global economic instability. Q4: How does the Federal Reserve adjust its policy? A4: The Fed primarily adjusts its policy through changes to the federal funds rate, which influences other interest rates in the economy. It can also use tools like quantitative easing (buying bonds) or quantitative tightening (selling bonds) to manage the money supply and influence economic activity. Q5: What is the significance of the Jackson Hole symposium? A5: The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium is an annual conference attended by central bankers, finance ministers, academics, and financial market participants from around the world. Speeches delivered here, especially by the Fed Chair, are closely watched for insights into future monetary policy direction.

Arthur Hayes, the insightful founder of BitMEX, recently shared a remarkably optimistic outlook for Ether (ETH), suggesting it could reach unprecedented heights in this current market cycle. His forecast has certainly captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, igniting discussions about what the future holds for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Decoding Arthur Hayes’s Ether Price Prediction Arthur Hayes did not mince words when discussing his expectations for Ether. In a recent interview, he asserted that ETH has the potential to climb significantly, projecting a range of $10,000 to $20,000 before the current market cycle concludes. This is a substantial leap from its current trading levels, indicating strong confidence in Ether’s upward trajectory. He confidently stated, “The chart says it’s going higher. So I can’t fight the market. I think ETH goes $10,000- $20,000 before the end of the cycle.” This conviction stems from his analysis of market indicators and broader economic trends, suggesting a powerful underlying momentum for Ether. What Drives This Optimistic Ether Price Prediction? Hayes’s bullish Ether price prediction isn’t just a gut feeling; it is anchored in a macroeconomic perspective. He believes the market will be significantly buoyed by “massive monetary expansion,” particularly an “increased dollar supply in the U.S.” But how exactly does this impact the crypto market? Consider these key points: Increased Liquidity: When central banks expand the money supply, more capital becomes available in the financial system. This often seeks out higher-yielding assets, including cryptocurrencies like Ether. Inflation Hedge: Investors often view assets like Bitcoin and Ether as potential hedges against inflation, especially when traditional currencies lose purchasing power due due to increased supply. Risk-On Sentiment: A period of monetary expansion typically fosters a “risk-on” environment, where investors are more willing to allocate funds to growth assets, which benefits the overall crypto market and, by extension, the Ether price prediction . Navigating the Market: Opportunities and Challenges for Ether While an Ether price prediction of $20,000 is undoubtedly exciting, it is crucial for investors to approach such forecasts with a balanced perspective. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and various factors can influence price movements. Potential opportunities include Ether’s robust ecosystem, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the upcoming advancements like the Dencun upgrade, which enhance its utility. However, challenges such as regulatory changes, network congestion, or broader economic downturns could also impact its trajectory. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider market dynamics. The Road Ahead: Will Ether Hit $20,000? Arthur Hayes’s forecast provides a compelling outlook for Ether’s potential this cycle. His argument, rooted in global monetary expansion, offers a powerful rationale for a significant upward trend. While the exact timing and magnitude of such a move remain to be seen, his insights certainly underscore the immense potential within the Ethereum ecosystem. The journey to a $10,000 or even $20,000 Ether price prediction would mark a monumental achievement for the asset and solidify its position as a leading force in the digital economy. The crypto community will be watching closely to see if Hayes’s bold vision comes to fruition. In conclusion, Arthur Hayes’s stunning $20,000 Ether price prediction highlights the bullish sentiment many experts hold for the cryptocurrency. Driven by macro-economic factors and Ether’s foundational role in the decentralized web, the coming months could indeed be transformative for ETH holders. While no prediction is guaranteed, the factors he points to are certainly worth considering for anyone interested in the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

The big moves follow the rollout of its new stablecoin licensing framework. Industry leaders and advisers are now pressing the government to accelerate regulatory measures to channel the enthusiasm into sustainable growth. Mainland institutions pile into tokenized assets Until recently, most Chinese-funded institutions in Hong Kong had limited exposure to digital assets, focusing instead on traditional investment vehicles. That changed this summer after the city’s Stablecoins Ordinance, which took effect on August 1, established a licensing regime under the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ( HKMA ) requiring issuers to maintain high-quality reserves, guarantee convertibility, and comply with anti-money laundering controls. Since then, fund managers and insurers backed by mainland capital have been told by headquarters to trial tokenized products. “This is assigned homework,” one Hong Kong-based fund manager said, noting that institutions were experimenting with RWAs such as tokenized money market funds and rental income streams. Industry executives argue that blockchain-based products will ultimately make markets more efficient. “In the next five to ten years, all financial products will be on the blockchain,” one Hong Kong fund head told Tencent. But others caution against excessive hype. Zhou Chenggang, chief executive of Taikang Asset Management Hong Kong, warned the sector was experiencing a false fire and needed to cool off, adding that not all assets need to be on-chain. He said, “I oppose mythmaking about any new technology. Many people mistakenly believe that RWAs, which will be possible years in the future, are feasible today. This is a misconception and can mislead the market.” PwC calls for more market reforms The regulatory momentum around tokenization is also prompting calls for more capital-market reforms. At a press conference tied to the government’s consultation for the 2025 Policy Address, PwC urged the authorities to take decisive steps to strengthen Hong Kong’s role as a “super-connector” between China and global markets. Recommendations included expanding the scope of confidential listing applications to cover dual-primary and high-growth companies, giving issuers more flexibility to keep sensitive data private until approvals are secured. Regarding the Hong Kong government’s recently released “Hong Kong Digital Asset Development Policy Statement 2.0,” PwC recommends accelerating the implementation of digital asset-related strategies. The consulting firm believes that Hong Kong has the potential to become a digital-first asset and wealth management hub. According to PwC, the establishment of a blockchain-native asset registration system will help promote asset tokenization. Also, it pointed out that a registration mechanism for the issuance and transfer of digital assets such as land, intellectual property, and equity investments should be established to streamline processes and shorten transaction times. Hong Kong is balancing momentum and caution The city’s policymakers have made no secret of their ambitions. In June, the government unveiled its LEAP Framework (Legal streamlining, Expanding tokenized products, Advancing use cases, People) to institutionalize stablecoins, tokenized bonds, and RWAs in the financial system. The city has already issued tokenized green bonds and is seen as a testing ground for offshore yuan-backed stablecoins. But industry insiders warn that liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainties could stall progress. A senior crypto executive told Tencent that if an asset could already secure financing through traditional channels, tokenization added little value. Meanwhile, for lower-quality assets, blockchain would not solve liquidity concerns. Still, the mainland authorities remain cautious. Analysts note that while Hong Kong is advancing stablecoin and tokenization rules , Beijing remains wary of capital flight risks and will allow only a handful of licences in the near term.

The Microsoft-backed company said in a statement on Friday that it has incorporated in India and begun recruiting locally. The move is part of a broader expansion in a market it views as central to growth. The New Delhi site is slated for later this year, the company said. India ranks among ChatGPT’s biggest user bases, and this week, OpenAI rolled out its cheapest monthly option $4.60, aimed at the country’s nearly one billion internet users. The firm is also dealing with legal disputes in India. Several news publishers and book houses allege their material was used to train ChatGPT without permission. OpenAI has denied any wrongdoing. “Opening our first office and building a local team is an important first step in our commitment to make advanced AI more accessible across the country and to build AI for India, and with India,” CEO Sam Altman said in the statement to Reuters. Competition is intense . Google’s Gemini and startup Perplexity have unveiled offers that provide many people in India with free access to advanced features, adding pressure on OpenAI’s lineup. Fresh data shared on Friday shows India has ChatGPT’s largest student audience, and weekly active users in the country have risen fourfold over the past year. India gets ChatGPT’s most affordable plan yet On Tuesday, the company introduced ChatGPT Go, an India-only tier priced at 399 rupees ($4.57) per month, its lowest-cost plan so far . Global tech firms often set lower prices for India’s price-sensitive market, targeting the same vast online audience. With ChatGPT Go, subscribers can send up to ten times more messages and generate ten times more images than the free service, and responses arrive faster. Higher-priced tiers increase message allowances further. OpenAI says the plan is meant for people in India who want broader access to advanced tools at a lower price. In India, ChatGPT Pro is listed at 19,900 rupees per month, while ChatGPT Plus costs 1,999 rupees per month. Earlier this year, Altman met the country’s IT minister to explore creating a low-cost AI ecosystem as part of efforts to boost adoption. He has also said India is OpenAI’s second-largest market by users after the United States and could soon overtake it. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

World Liberty (WLFI), an entity associated with Donald Trump, recently made a substantial WLFI ETH purchase , injecting millions into the Ethereum ecosystem. This strategic move has certainly caught the attention of investors and market watchers alike, prompting discussions about its potential implications for the broader crypto landscape. This development is more than just a routine trade; it represents a noteworthy capital allocation by a high-profile organization. It highlights a continuing trend where established entities are increasingly exploring and engaging with the burgeoning world of digital currencies, signaling a potential shift in investment paradigms. What’s Behind WLFI’s Bold ETH Purchase? According to a recent and widely reported update from Lookonchain on X, World Liberty (WLFI) executed a massive financial transaction. The organization reportedly spent an impressive 5.025 million USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, to acquire a substantial amount of Ethereum. Specifically, this considerable sum was used to purchase 1,076 ETH, with the per-unit price settling at an impressive $4,670. This particular WLFI ETH purchase isn’t merely a speculative play. It signifies a growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition and its pivotal role within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 ecosystems. While the precise motivations behind WLFI’s timing and the specific amount remain subjects of market speculation, such large-scale movements often reflect a strategic belief in the asset’s future performance and utility. It’s important to understand that entities like WLFI often have sophisticated investment strategies. Their decision to commit significant capital to Ethereum could stem from a variety of factors, including portfolio diversification, a hedge against inflation, or a calculated bet on the future growth of the smart contract platform. How Does This WLFI ETH Purchase Influence Market Sentiment? Any major investment from an institutional or high-profile entity into the cryptocurrency market inevitably generates significant discussion and can ripple through investor sentiment. When an organization like World Liberty makes a substantial WLFI ETH purchase , it sends a powerful signal that resonates across the market. Many investors often interpret such high-profile moves as a bullish indicator, suggesting that traditional finance and influential figures are increasingly validating the cryptocurrency space as a legitimate asset class. Consider the potential impacts: Increased Legitimacy: Large investments from recognized entities, especially those with political ties, can significantly boost the perceived legitimacy of cryptocurrencies. This can help attract even more mainstream and institutional interest. Enhanced Market Confidence: Such purchases can instill greater confidence among both retail and institutional investors. This heightened confidence may lead to further capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market. Potential Price Dynamics: While a single purchase might not dramatically shift long-term price trends, it certainly contributes to overall demand. In some cases, it can even spark short-term rallies or help to solidify existing support levels for the asset. This transaction further underscores Ethereum’s established position as a leading smart contract platform and a preferred asset for significant, strategic investments. It reinforces the narrative that Ethereum is not just a speculative asset but a foundational technology with enduring value. Navigating Crypto Investments: Lessons from WLFI’s Strategy The recent WLFI ETH purchase offers several valuable takeaways for anyone interested in the crypto market, whether you’re a seasoned investor or just beginning your journey. It’s crucial to remember that while large, high-profile purchases can be exciting and newsworthy, they are typically part of a much broader, meticulously researched, and carefully executed investment strategy. What insights can we glean from this notable event? Strategic Asset Allocation: WLFI’s move demonstrates a clear commitment to integrating digital assets as a significant component of a larger, diversified financial strategy. This approach is becoming increasingly common among sophisticated investors. Market Timing Considerations: While we may not have all the details of WLFI’s complete strategy, large players often meticulously analyze market conditions to identify opportune moments to enter or expand their positions, aiming to maximize returns. The Role of Diversification: For many investors, adding assets like Ethereum provides crucial diversification away from traditional financial instruments, potentially mitigating risks and enhancing overall portfolio resilience. Ultimately, while observing the moves of prominent entities can be informative, it’s always wise to conduct your own thorough research (often abbreviated as DYOR) and fully understand the inherent risks involved before making any investment decisions. Relying solely on the actions of others, no matter how influential, is rarely a sound investment strategy. Conclusion: The substantial WLFI ETH purchase of 1,076 ETH for over $5 million USDC marks a truly noteworthy event in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape. It vividly signals continued institutional interest and profound confidence in Ethereum’s robust future. As more prominent entities like World Liberty strategically engage with digital assets, the bridge between traditional finance and the innovative crypto world continues to strengthen, paving the way for even greater adoption and groundbreaking innovation. This transaction is far more than just a simple purchase; it stands as a powerful testament to the evolving perception of digital currencies as legitimate, valuable, and strategically important assets in the global financial arena.

The price is now testing the $112,000 support level, a key zone for bulls to defend in order to avoid further bearish pressure. While the broader trend remains constructive in the long term, the short-term outlook has tilted toward weakness, with momentum indicators showing a leaning toward the downside. Related Reading: Whale Loads Up $300M Ethereum Onchain: Did He Just Catch The Bottom? Analysts highlight this moment as a potential inflection point for the market. A strong defense of current levels could reset sentiment and allow Bitcoin to consolidate before another breakout attempt. However, failure to hold above $112K may trigger a sharper correction, opening the path toward deeper support levels. Adding to the cautious tone, CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, shared new data showing that the CryptoQuant Bull Score Index has shifted into a neutral signal. This shift highlights that while selling pressure hasn’t fully taken over, the market is no longer in clear bullish territory. The coming days will be decisive in determining Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Bitcoin Indicator Signals Caution According to CryptoQuant’s head of research, Julio Moreno, Bitcoin’s Bull Score Index has shifted from a “Bullish Cooldown” phase to a “Neutral” phase. The index, which tracks overall market strength using a combination of trading flows, investor behavior, and derivatives data, declined from 70 to 50. This move signals that bullish momentum has weakened, leaving Bitcoin in a more balanced state between buyers and sellers. Moreno noted that “for risk management purposes, further softening in the index indicates price could go lower.” This means that while the neutral zone doesn’t yet imply a confirmed downtrend, any additional deterioration could increase the probability of deeper corrections. Traders are therefore closely watching upcoming sessions, as price action around the $112K–$115K support zone will be critical in shaping short-term direction. The broader context remains constructive. Bitcoin has been in a steady uptrend since 2023, a cycle that has already delivered massive gains and propelled the asset to new all-time highs above $124K earlier this month. Many analysts argue that the market is now in the final phase of this bull run, where volatility typically rises and investor sentiment becomes divided between expectations of continuation and warnings of exhaustion. As the month comes to an end, global macroeconomic factors—including interest rate policies, institutional inflows, and liquidity conditions—will play a decisive role. If Bitcoin holds its support and fundamentals remain strong, this neutral phase may simply represent a healthy pause before the next upward move. Conversely, if weakness persists, the market could be signaling the start of a deeper consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Transfers Collapse: Lowest Since Bull Market Peak In 2021 Price Action: Testing critical Support Level Bitcoin is currently trading around $112,837, after a sharp decline from its all-time high near $123,217. The daily chart shows that BTC has slipped below the 50-day SMA ($116,158) and is now testing the 100-day SMA ($111,224) as support. This level has become a crucial line of defense for bulls. The rejection from the $123K region highlights strong resistance overhead, which has led to several failed breakout attempts. The structure suggests that BTC has entered a consolidation phase, with the $111K–$116K zone serving as the immediate range. A decisive breakdown below $111K could open the way toward the 200-day SMA ($100,597), a level many analysts see as the final support for this cycle’s uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Treasury Boom Drives Demand: Can The Market Handle The Risks? Momentum indicators also align with weakening bullish pressure, as recent candles show lower highs and lower lows. However, holding above the 100-day moving average would strengthen the bull case, potentially setting up a rebound toward $118K and eventually retesting $123K.

This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a strategic enhancement designed to empower users, transforming how we interact with video content stored in the cloud. Unlocking Effortless Video Creation: The New Vids Shortcut in Google Drive Gone are the days of downloading video files, opening a separate editing application, and then re-uploading the finished product. Google’s new shortcut button for Vids, its AI-powered video creation tool, revolutionizes this process. Now, when you’re previewing a video within your Google Drive interface, you’ll immediately notice an ‘Open’ button prominently displayed in the top right corner. This isn’t just any ‘Open’ button; it’s your direct gateway to advanced editing with Vids. What does this mean for your workflow? It means instant access. A single click launches the video directly into the Vids application, eliminating cumbersome steps and saving valuable time. Imagine the scenario: you’re reviewing a team presentation video, a marketing clip, or even a personal project. You spot an area that needs refinement – perhaps a section to trim, a new music track to add, or some explanatory text overlays. With this new shortcut, the transition from viewing to editing is fluid and immediate. Vids automatically loads your selected file, ready for you to unleash its suite of AI-driven editing tools. Diving Deep into Vids: Google’s AI-Powered Video Creation Powerhouse At the heart of this integration is Vids, Google’s innovative AI-powered video creation tool. Launched last year, Vids was designed with the ambitious goal of democratizing video production, making it accessible even to those without professional editing experience.

Intelligent Clip Rearrangement: Vids can analyze your footage and suggest optimal arrangements of video clips, creating a compelling sequence without manual trial and error. Seamless Transitions and Effects: Adding professional-looking transitions and effects is no longer a painstaking process. Vids can intelligently insert these elements, enhancing the visual appeal of your video with minimal effort. Music and Text Integration: Easily incorporate background music, voiceovers, and dynamic text overlays to convey your message effectively and add a polished touch to your productions. This comprehensive toolkit ensures that anyone, from a small business owner creating promotional content to an educator developing engaging lessons, can produce high-quality videos with unprecedented ease. The integration with Google Drive simply brings these powerful capabilities closer to where your content already resides. Why This Matters: Enhanced Productivity for Google Workspace Users The introduction of the Vids shortcut button is more than just a convenience; it’s a strategic move by Google to deepen the integration of AI across its entire Google Workspace suite. This enhancement is particularly beneficial for: Teams and Collaborators: Projects often involve multiple stakeholders reviewing and providing feedback on video content. With instant editing access, iterations can happen faster, reducing project timelines and improving overall efficiency. Content Creators and Marketers: The demand for video content is insatiable. This shortcut drastically reduces the time and effort required to produce and refine marketing videos, social media clips, and internal communications. Educators and Students: Creating engaging educational content, from lecture summaries to project presentations, becomes significantly simpler, fostering creativity and better communication. Business Professionals: Whether it’s for internal training, pitch presentations, or client updates, the ability to quickly edit and perfect videos directly from Drive enhances professionalism and impact. This move follows other significant AI integrations within Workspace, such as the Gemini AI feature introduced in May, which allows users to summarize video files stored in Google Drive .

This empowers individuals and small teams to compete with larger entities in content creation. Accelerated Content Cycles: The speed at which content can be conceptualized, created, and published is dramatically increased, allowing businesses to be more agile and responsive to market trends. Reduced Resource Dependency: Less reliance on specialized software and extensive training means lower costs and fewer barriers to entry for effective video communication. However, as with any emerging technology, there are considerations. While AI can automate many tasks, human oversight remains crucial for ensuring the final output aligns with the creator’s vision and brand voice. Users may need to invest some time in understanding Vids’ capabilities and refining AI-generated content to achieve desired results. The initial learning curve, while minimal compared to traditional software, still exists. Furthermore, the ethical implications of AI-generated content, such as deepfakes or misinformation, are ongoing discussions that the industry must navigate responsibly.

Here’s how you can take advantage of the Vids shortcut for your next video creation project: Locate Your Video: Navigate to your Google Drive and find the video file you wish to edit. Preview the Video: Click on the video file to open its preview window. Initiate Editing: In the top right corner of the preview window, you will see the ‘Open’ button. Click on this button, and select ‘Open with Vids’ (or it might launch directly if Vids is the default). Edit in Vids: The video will automatically load into the Vids interface. Here, you can: Trim unwanted sections to refine your message. Add compelling background music from Vids’ library or your own. Insert text overlays for titles, captions, or important highlights. Experiment with AI-powered suggestions for transitions and clip arrangements. Utilize AI to generate scripts or enhance existing ones. Save and Share: Once your edits are complete, save your project. Vids will typically integrate seamlessly back into your Google Drive, allowing you to share your polished video with ease. This intuitive process ensures that even those new to video editing can quickly get started and produce professional-looking content without getting bogged down in complex software. The Transformative Impact on Digital Content Creation The integration of Vids into Google Drive represents a significant milestone in the evolution of digital content creation. It underscores a broader trend where AI is no longer just a futuristic concept but a practical tool embedded into our daily applications. This synergy between storage, collaboration, and intelligent editing capabilities empowers a new generation of creators and communicators. It means more compelling presentations, more engaging marketing campaigns, and more accessible information for everyone. As AI continues to advance, we can anticipate even more sophisticated features within Vids and other Google Workspace applications. The goal is clear: to remove technical barriers and allow users to focus on the creative aspect of their work, letting AI handle the heavy lifting.

Martinez summed up his view, stating, “Not a bad spot to start loading Solana $SOL before a breakout to $360.” Not a bad spot to start loading Solana $SOL before a breakout to $360. pic.twitter.com/N42zXpMzbT — Ali (@ali_charts) August 21, 2025 Price Context and Levels To Watch Solana currently trades at $182.32, down 2.3% on the day and 5.84% over the past week. However, Martinez’s chart offers a zoomed-out view, showing higher lows aligned along a diagonal base despite Solana’s struggles earlier in the year , and a key immediate horizontal resistance that sits at $205. The price currently hovers just above the 0.786 retracement around $176, where the rising line offers nearby support. The chart displays Fibonacci extensions that map a potential bullish route, with the resistance at $205.78, and subsequent resistance levels at $250.26 (Fib. 1.272), $277.18 (Fib. 1.414), $321.99 (Fib. 1.618), and $362.23 (Fib. 1.786). His outline proposes a brief consolidation near support, followed by a breakthrough of the immediate resistance level and continuation toward those extensions. Aiming at a New All-time High While some have counted out Solana , the $360 objective stands out. It implies a new all-time high and is almost two times the current price. Martinez presents it as the terminal extension of the formation rather than an immediate leap. The interim areas between $250 and $300 appear as checkpoints where momentum could pause before attempting the final leg. The framework gives readers a clear, rule-based plan grounded in the levels visible on the image. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Validation and Invalidation Rules The prediction relies on two conditions. First, bulls want a decisive break and close above the $205 area to confirm that supply at resistance has been absorbed. Second, the market needs to defend the ascending triangle that has guided the price for months. Failure to hold that line, especially alongside acceptance below the $176 zone, would undermine the setup and shift attention to deeper retracement supports near $156, $143, and $131. In that case, the triangle would lose integrity, and the extension targets would lose relevance. Despite negative short-term momentum, even Bitcoin maximalists are now recognizing Solana’s value , and with this favorable structure, it could reach a new peak soon.

Bitwise, a leading crypto asset manager, has successfully processed a Bitcoin ETF in-kind exchange for its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) shares. This significant development, announced by Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro on X, marks a pivotal shift in how these investment vehicles operate, opening up new avenues for efficiency and engagement. What is a Bitcoin ETF In-Kind Exchange, Exactly? Understanding an in-kind exchange is crucial to appreciating its impact. Traditionally, when investors wanted to create or redeem shares of a spot Bitcoin ETF, it often involved a “cash-create/redeem” model. This meant authorized participants (APs) would send cash to the ETF issuer, who would then buy Bitcoin on the open market, or vice versa for redemptions. This process could introduce complexities, including tax implications and potential market slippage. An in-kind Bitcoin exchange , however, allows APs to directly exchange actual Bitcoin for ETF shares, or vice versa. Instead of cash, the underlying asset—Bitcoin—is transferred. This streamlined approach offers several advantages, making the process more direct and potentially more cost-effective for all parties involved. Bitwise’s Revolutionary First in Bitcoin ETF Operations Bitwise’s recent announcement is not just a procedural update; it’s a historic milestone. Teddy Fusaro highlighted that this is a newly permitted capability by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to his knowledge, Bitwise is the very first spot Bitcoin ETF issuer to successfully process such an exchange. This achievement underscores Bitwise’s commitment to innovation and its proactive approach in navigating the evolving regulatory landscape. The ability to perform an in-kind Bitcoin exchange is a game-changer. It demonstrates a growing maturity in the crypto market infrastructure and a willingness from regulators to adapt to the unique nature of digital assets. For institutions, this means greater flexibility and potentially lower operational costs when managing their Bitcoin ETF positions. Unpacking the SEC’s Evolving Stance on Bitcoin ETFs The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious regarding Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those involving physical Bitcoin. Their initial approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a monumental step, but it came with specific operational guidelines. The recent permission for in-kind exchanges suggests a further evolution in the SEC’s understanding and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within regulated financial products. This regulatory flexibility is vital for the long-term health and growth of the Bitcoin ETF ecosystem. It builds trust and provides clearer pathways for traditional financial institutions to engage with digital assets, ensuring that operations are as efficient and robust as those for other commodity-backed ETFs. How Does This Impact Investors and the Broader Market? For investors, particularly large institutional players, the introduction of the Bitcoin ETF in-kind exchange capability offers significant benefits: Increased Efficiency: Direct exchange of Bitcoin for ETF shares reduces the number of steps and intermediaries, potentially speeding up transactions. Reduced Costs: Eliminating the need for cash conversions can lead to lower transaction fees and less market impact. Tax Advantages: Depending on jurisdiction, in-kind transfers can sometimes offer more favorable tax treatment compared to cash transactions, though investors should always consult with a tax professional. Market Stability: A more efficient creation/redemption mechanism can help keep the ETF’s price closely aligned with the underlying Bitcoin’s market value, reducing tracking error. This development also signals a broader trend towards greater institutional adoption and integration of Bitcoin into traditional finance. It paves the way for more sophisticated strategies and products, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a serious investment asset. In conclusion, Bitwise’s pioneering Bitcoin ETF in-kind exchange is a landmark event. It not only streamlines operations for authorized participants but also reflects a maturing regulatory environment and increasing sophistication in the crypto investment space. This move by Bitwise could set a new standard for the industry, driving greater efficiency, reducing costs, and ultimately enhancing the appeal of spot Bitcoin ETFs for a wider range of investors. It’s a clear indication that the financial world is continually adapting to embrace the future of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is an in-kind Bitcoin exchange? A1: An in-kind Bitcoin exchange allows authorized participants (APs) to directly swap actual Bitcoin for shares of a Bitcoin ETF, or vice versa, instead of using cash. This streamlines the creation and redemption process for ETF shares. Q2: Why is Bitwise’s in-kind exchange considered a first? A2: According to Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro, it is the first instance of a spot Bitcoin ETF issuer processing such an exchange, a capability newly permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Q3: How does this development benefit Bitcoin ETF investors? A3: It offers increased efficiency, potentially reduced transaction costs by avoiding cash conversions, and can help maintain a closer alignment between the ETF’s price and Bitcoin’s market value. For institutional investors, it provides greater flexibility. Q4: What was the previous method for Bitcoin ETF creation/redemption? A4: Most spot Bitcoin ETFs previously operated on a “cash-create/redeem” model, where authorized participants exchanged cash for ETF shares, and the issuer would then buy or sell Bitcoin on the open market. Q5: Will other Bitcoin ETF issuers follow suit with in-kind exchanges? A5: Given the potential benefits and the SEC’s new permission, it is highly probable that other spot Bitcoin ETF issuers will adopt in-kind exchange capabilities in the near future to enhance their operational efficiency and competitiveness.

The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin Price has achieved a remarkable milestone, surging past the $117,000 mark. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, this significant upward movement sees BTC now trading robustly at $117,124.16 on the Binance USDT market. This impressive rally has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting discussions about the underlying forces driving this momentum and what the future holds for the world’s leading digital asset. What’s Fueling the Incredible Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the factors behind this surge is crucial for anyone tracking the crypto landscape. Several key elements appear to be converging, creating a potent upward pressure on the Bitcoin Price . This isn’t just a random fluctuation; instead, it reflects a confluence of market dynamics and investor sentiment. Increased Institutional Interest: More large institutions are entering the crypto space, viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and a hedge against inflation. Positive Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic uncertainties often push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is seen by many as ""digital gold."" Supply Dynamics: The programmed scarcity of Bitcoin, particularly after events like the halving, inherently supports its value as demand increases. Growing Retail Adoption: Everyday investors continue to show interest, expanding the market base and liquidity. Therefore, this combination of factors provides a solid foundation for the recent gains. Is the $117,000 Bitcoin Price Sustainable? Reaching a new high is exhilarating, but the big question on everyone’s mind is whether this current Bitcoin Price level is sustainable. Market sustainability depends on various technical and fundamental indicators. While the immediate momentum is strong, careful observation is always warranted. Historically, Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by volatility. Periods of rapid ascent are often followed by corrections. However, the underlying infrastructure and growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies suggest a more mature market than in previous cycles. Analysts are closely watching trading volumes and market depth to gauge the strength of this rally. Moreover, global regulatory developments and ongoing technological advancements within the blockchain ecosystem will undoubtedly play a role in shaping future price trajectories. Hence, staying informed about these broader trends is vital. Expert Insights on Bitcoin Price Movements Seasoned market observers offer diverse perspectives on the recent Bitcoin Price action. Many believe that this rally signifies a renewed confidence in digital assets, especially Bitcoin, as a store of value. They point to the increasing integration of crypto into traditional financial systems as a key indicator of long-term growth potential.

The move comes despite a cautious backdrop from traditional markets, where traders continue to weigh the Federal Reserve’s rate outlook. The rally highlights crypto’s resilience and ability to attract capital flows even in moments of macro uncertainty. Powell’s Jackson Hole Message At Jackson Hole, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged progress in cooling inflation but avoided committing to an aggressive rate-cut path. He signaled that a 25 bps cut in September is “highly likely”, the clearest sign yet of near-term easing. However, Powell cautioned against expecting a rapid series of cuts. He stressed the Fed’s “data-dependent” stance, pointing to risks from tariff-driven inflation and keeping the door open to holding rates higher for longer if needed. Fed Chair Powell is indicating a 25bps September rate cut is **highly likely**. His Jackson Hole speech is about as clear cut as the Fed gets. But…he's also signaling don't bet on a bunch more rate cuts after that. Fed leaders will still be watching what happens with… pic.twitter.com/ygadFMgbms — Heather Long (@byHeatherLong) August 22, 2025 The mixed tone spilled into markets. U.S. equities trimmed early gains, and crypto mirrored the volatility, leaving traders caught between optimism over easing inflation and concern that liquidity could remain tight through year-end. FedWatch Tool Reaction The CME FedWatch Tool now shows an 87.3% probability of a cut to 400–425 bps at the September 17 meeting, with only 12.7% odds of holding steady at 425–450 bps. Markets largely took this as confirmation of easing, though Powell’s warning kept risk sentiment restrained. Source: FedWatch Tool Crypto Market Reaction Despite Powell’s restraint, major digital assets held ground. Bitcoin trades at $116,269, up 3.28% in the past 24 hours, with a market cap of $2.31 trillion. Ethereum gained 12.3% this week to $4,749, showing renewed momentum ahead of its network upgrades. XRP climbed to $3.04, while Solana surged 7.48% in the last day to $194.80, reflecting strong demand for high-performance chains. The resilience underscores how crypto is now tightly linked to global monetary policy shifts. Investors are weighing whether Powell’s hesitation delays fresh capital inflows, or whether slowing inflation creates room for a medium-term rally across digital assets. Bitcoin Technical Outlook Technically, Bitcoin faces a battle at the $116,500–$118,000 zone, where sellers capped recent rallies. A breakout above $118,500 could set the stage for a run toward $123,000 and eventually the psychological $130,000 barrier. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview On the downside, $112,000 is the key support level to watch. A close below this threshold risks deeper correction toward $108,000. 50-day SMA : trending upward, supporting bullish momentum. RSI (Daily) : sits near 54, leaving room for further gains. MACD : signals weakening bearish pressure, but volume confirmation is needed for a breakout. Broader Implications Crypto investors are increasingly aligning their strategies with Fed communication. While Powell’s speech didn’t commit to near-term cuts, the acknowledgment of cooling inflation gives Bitcoin and Ethereum room to consolidate above key support levels. If economic data in Q4 confirms slowing inflation and softer growth, crypto could benefit as capital seeks alternative hedges. For now, the market remains data-driven: stronger U.S. inflation readings would pressure Bitcoin below $112K, while softer prints may open the path back toward $130K. Summary : Powell’s cautious tone at Jackson Hole has tempered hopes of quick rate cuts, but crypto markets remain resilient. Bitcoin’s outlook hinges on defending $112K support and breaking past $118.5K resistance to confirm a push toward $130K.

The SEC Ripple dismissal has just taken a significant step forward, signaling a potential turning point for Ripple and the broader digital asset landscape. This news has captured the attention of investors, legal experts, and XRP holders alike, bringing a renewed sense of optimism to the market. What Does the Crucial SEC Ripple Dismissal Signify? Attorney James K. Filan, a prominent figure closely following the case, recently shared on X (formerly Twitter) that the Second Circuit Court has officially approved the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal in the long-running SEC v. Ripple case. This procedural approval is far more than just a formality; it represents a concrete move towards the resolution of a legal saga that has cast a considerable shadow over Ripple’s operations and the XRP token for nearly three years. For those new to the space, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated legal action against Ripple Labs in December 2020. The core allegation was that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering through its sales of XRP. This case has been a monumental benchmark, with its outcome widely anticipated to influence how regulatory bodies might approach other cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Why is This Approval So Significant for XRP’s Future? The approval of the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal is a substantial procedural victory for Ripple. While it doesn’t immediately conclude every single aspect of the case, it decisively paves the way for the ultimate resolution of the entire lawsuit. This development is particularly important for XRP, which has seen its price performance and market sentiment heavily influenced by the ongoing legal proceedings. Here’s why this SEC Ripple dismissal is a truly monumental event: Clarity for XRP: It moves the needle closer to a definitive legal status for XRP, significantly reducing the regulatory uncertainty that has plagued it. Boosted Market Confidence: Enhanced clarity often translates directly into improved investor confidence. This, in turn, can lead to positive price action and increased adoption for XRP. Ripple’s Strategic Focus: This development frees up Ripple to channel more energy into its core business expansion, forging new partnerships, and innovating without the immediate, burdensome pressure of active litigation. How Does the SEC Ripple Dismissal Impact the Broader Crypto Market? The outcome of the SEC v. Ripple case has always been perceived as a crucial bellwether for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Its implications extend especially to the critical question of how digital assets are classified. Many in the crypto community firmly believe that a favorable resolution for Ripple could establish a vital precedent, potentially influencing how other cryptocurrencies are regulated in the future, both domestically and internationally. This procedural step, therefore, sends a powerful and positive signal across the board: It suggests that regulatory bodies might be increasingly open to finding resolutions outside of prolonged, costly court battles. It could certainly encourage other blockchain projects facing similar regulatory scrutiny to pursue constructive dialogue and settlement. Crucially, it reinforces the growing understanding that not all digital assets automatically fall under the classification of securities. However, it is vital to remember that the legal landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is inherently complex and constantly evolving. While this is an undeniably positive sign, it does not mean an immediate end to all regulatory challenges for the broader crypto space. Continued vigilance and adaptation remain essential. What Are the Next Steps Following the SEC Ripple Dismissal? While the Second Circuit’s approval represents a significant milestone, it is, at its heart, a procedural step. The exact implications and the precise timeline for the full, final resolution of the case are still unfolding. Ripple and the SEC will continue to navigate the remaining legal processes, which could involve formal final agreements, additional court orders, or other administrative closures. The immediate focus now shifts to the specifics of the dismissal and what it definitively means for any lingering aspects of the litigation. This development undoubtedly fosters a more optimistic outlook for Ripple and its dedicated community. It profoundly underscores the critical importance of achieving legal clarity for the sustained growth, mainstream adoption, and overall maturation of digital assets. As the situation continues to develop, staying informed will be absolutely key to understanding the full and lasting impact of the SEC Ripple dismissal on the future of crypto. In conclusion, the Second Circuit’s approval of the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal in the SEC v. Ripple case is a truly momentous occasion for the cryptocurrency industry. It brings us considerably closer to much-needed clarity for XRP and offers a compelling glimpse into the potential future trajectory of crypto regulation. This crucial step not only provides a profound sense of relief for Ripple but also sets a precedent that could resonate powerfully across the entire digital asset ecosystem. The path ahead still holds specific details to be meticulously ironed out, but the current trajectory is undeniably positive, fueling widespread optimism for a more defined and predictable regulatory environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly does “Joint Stipulation of Dismissal” mean in this context? A Joint Stipulation of Dismissal means that both parties involved in the lawsuit, in this case, the SEC and Ripple, have agreed to dismiss certain claims or the entire case. The court then reviews and approves this agreement, making it legally binding. It’s a mutual agreement to end the legal proceedings. 2. Does this dismissal mean Ripple has won the entire case against the SEC? While a significant victory, this specific dismissal primarily concerns the claims against Ripple’s executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. It paves the way for the full resolution of the broader case against Ripple Labs itself, which has seen partial rulings in Ripple’s favor previously. It’s a major step towards finality but not necessarily the absolute end of all legal proceedings yet. 3. How might this impact the price of XRP? Historically, positive legal developments for Ripple have often led to an increase in XRP’s price due to reduced regulatory uncertainty and increased investor confidence. While market movements are complex, this procedural win is generally viewed as bullish for XRP. 4. Could this decision influence other crypto lawsuits? Absolutely. The SEC v. Ripple case has been a closely watched benchmark. A favorable outcome for Ripple, even procedurally, can set precedents or influence how regulatory bodies approach other digital assets, potentially leading to more clarity or encouraging settlements in similar cases. 5. What are the next steps for Ripple after this approval? Following this approval, Ripple and the SEC will work towards finalizing any remaining aspects of the litigation. This could involve formalizing settlement terms, withdrawing remaining claims, or other administrative closures to officially conclude the entire legal battle. Ripple will likely focus on leveraging this clarity for business expansion. This significant legal update impacts everyone in the crypto space.

The move is challenging the monetary authority’s longstanding position against providing ordinary Russians free access to cryptocurrencies. State Duma deputies suggest legalizing crypto exchange in Russia Several members of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, appealed to the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) to permit the launch of licensed offices for cryptocurrency exchange. Anton Tkachev, Yaroslav Samylin, and Georgy Arapov, representatives of the liberal “New People” party, have addressed their proposal to the head of the financial regulator, Elvira Nabiullina. In the document, seen by the RIA Novosti news agency, they suggest: “It seems appropriate to consider the possibility of creating a network of legal cryptocurrency exchanges with physical presence and clear requirements for their work.” The authors say a mandatory minimum requirement for the size of the authorized capital of such companies should be introduced in order to “ensure the financial stability of market participants.” They believe their initiative has the potential to significantly reduce the share of the illegal turnover of digital assets in the Russian Federation. The sponsors of the proposal, also quoted by the Gazeta.ru new portal, are convinced its implementation will “strengthen citizens’ trust in financial institutions” and provide the state with additional tools to monitor cash flows. The lawmakers are asking Governor Nabiullina to order relevant CBR departments to develop a mechanism for the licensing of cryptocurrency exchanges. They also point out that the establishment of authorized platforms will give Russians the opportunity to conduct safe and legal crypto transactions, while limiting the risk of fraud and involvement in criminal schemes. Russia is yet to make up its mind about crypto The future of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation remains unclear at this point in time. Key regulators, such as the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, remain opposed to legalizing their free circulation in the country’s economy. A special “experimental legal regime” (ELR) was established earlier this year to allow companies to buy, exchange, and spend digital coins for the purposes of carrying out foreign trade transactions under sanctions severely limiting their access to traditional financial channels. In May, the CBR authorized crypto investments through derivative products , but only for “ highly qualified ” investors meeting certain criteria regarding annual income, funds at their disposal, and previous investments in securities, for example. The same month, the finance ministry announced it’s planning to launch a cryptocurrency exchange, in collaboration with the monetary authority, again exclusively for qualified investors. Despite Russians already holding over $25 billion worth of crypto assets, as reported by Cryptopolitan, ordinary citizens have few options to acquire them legally. In June, the central bank cautioned citizens about the risks of using crypto exchanges, warning they may get involved in illegal payments, particularly through platforms offering peer-to-peer services. Multiple small transactions associated with such trades may result in the blocking of their bank accounts. In preparation for the launch of its own digital currency, the digital ruble , which is scheduled to be introduced in stages starting from Sept. 1, 2026, Russia has been adopting and amending a series of laws, allowing it to tighten the noose on crypto usage. These include the updated “National Payment System” law and anti-money laundering legislation, which can be employed to target cryptocurrency transactions, including payments and trading. Even the spreading of crypto exchange information has proved problematic in Russia. Access to the BestChange.ru website, a popular exchange aggregator in the Russian-speaking segment of the market, was restricted multiple times over the past few years, including earlier in 2025.

The popular South Korean exchange has announced a temporary Bithumb SEI suspension for both deposits and withdrawals, citing underlying blockchain issues. This crucial update is vital for anyone holding or planning to transact with SEI tokens on the platform. Such temporary halts, while inconvenient, are often a necessary measure taken by exchanges to protect user assets and maintain platform integrity. Understanding the reasons behind this suspension and what it means for your holdings is key. Why the Bithumb SEI Suspension ? Unpacking Blockchain Issues Bithumb’s official statement attributes this temporary pause to “blockchain issues.” But what exactly does this entail? Technical Glitches: Blockchain networks, like any complex technology, can experience unexpected technical problems. These might include network congestion, synchronization errors, or issues with transaction processing. Security Concerns: Sometimes, a suspension is initiated to investigate potential vulnerabilities or to implement necessary security upgrades. This proactive approach helps prevent larger issues or exploits. Maintenance and Upgrades: The underlying blockchain might be undergoing scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, requiring exchanges to temporarily halt related services to ensure compatibility and stability. The exchange is likely working closely with the SEI project development team to resolve these issues promptly. Furthermore, the goal of this temporary Bithumb SEI suspension is to ensure the safety and integrity of all user transactions once services resume. Immediate Impact: What Does the Bithumb SEI Suspension Mean for Users? For individuals with SEI tokens on Bithumb, or those looking to move them, the immediate implications are straightforward: Deposits Halted: You cannot currently send SEI tokens from an external wallet to your Bithumb account. Any attempts to do so might result in lost funds, so it is crucial to refrain. Withdrawals Frozen: Similarly, you are unable to move your SEI tokens from your Bithumb account to an external wallet or another exchange. Trading Status: While the announcement specifically mentions deposits and withdrawals, users should check the Bithumb platform directly to confirm if SEI trading pairs are also affected or remain operational during this period. It is important to emphasize that this is a temporary Bithumb SEI suspension . It does not indicate a permanent delisting of the SEI token from Bithumb or suggest any inherent flaw with the SEI blockchain itself. Instead, it is a protective measure designed to safeguard user interests. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Steps During the Suspension When an exchange implements a temporary halt, knowing how to react is essential for crypto users. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Updated: Regularly monitor Bithumb’s official website, notice board, and social media channels (like Twitter) for the latest announcements. Official sources are always the most reliable. Exercise Patience: Blockchain issues can take time to resolve. Rushing or attempting to bypass the suspension can lead to irreversible errors and potential loss of funds. Verify Information: Be wary of unofficial sources or rumors circulating on social media. Always cross-reference information with Bithumb’s official communications to avoid misinformation. Review Your Portfolio: Use this time to assess your overall crypto portfolio. Consider if your holdings are adequately diversified across different assets and platforms to mitigate risks. This situation underscores the importance of staying informed and adopting a cautious approach in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The Bithumb SEI suspension serves as a practical lesson in risk management for all participants. Broader Implications: Exchange Reliability and User Trust Temporary service suspensions, like this Bithumb SEI suspension , are not uncommon in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. They highlight several critical aspects of the industry: Security First: Reputable exchanges prioritize the security of user funds above all else. Halting operations for specific assets is often a necessary step to prevent potential vulnerabilities or to address technical faults before they escalate. Transparency Matters: How an exchange communicates during such events significantly impacts user trust. Clear, timely, and consistent updates are vital for maintaining confidence within the community. Technological Challenges: The underlying technology of blockchain is still maturing. Exchanges must constantly adapt and respond to new challenges, ensuring robust infrastructure and seamless user experience. Ultimately, these events reinforce the need for exchanges to maintain high operational standards and transparent communication channels with their user base. This fosters a healthier and more secure environment for everyone involved. Conclusion: A Temporary Pause for Enhanced Security The temporary Bithumb SEI suspension of deposits and withdrawals is a clear indicator of the exchange’s commitment to user security and platform stability. While inconvenient for traders and investors, it is a proactive step taken to address underlying blockchain issues and safeguard assets. Users are encouraged to remain patient, diligently follow Bithumb’s official updates, and avoid any unauthorized transactions during this period. Once the issues are resolved, services for SEI are expected to resume, ensuring a safer and more reliable trading environment for everyone. This pause is not an end, but a necessary step towards a more robust future for SEI transactions on Bithumb. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about the Bithumb SEI Suspension Q1: Why did Bithumb suspend SEI deposits and withdrawals? A1: Bithumb announced the temporary Bithumb SEI suspension due to “blockchain issues,” which can include technical glitches, security concerns, or maintenance requirements on the SEI network. Q2: Is this a permanent delisting of SEI from Bithumb? A2: No, the announcement explicitly states it is a temporary suspension. It is a measure to address current technical issues, not a permanent removal of the SEI token from the exchange. Q3: Can I still trade SEI on Bithumb during the suspension? A3: The announcement primarily focuses on deposits and withdrawals. Users should check the Bithumb platform directly for real-time information on the trading status of SEI pairs. Q4: What should I do with my SEI tokens on Bithumb right now? A4: It is best to wait for official updates from Bithumb. Do not attempt to deposit or withdraw SEI during the suspension, as this could lead to irreversible loss of funds. Monitor Bithumb’s official channels for when services resume. Q5: How long will the Bithumb SEI suspension last? A5: Bithumb has not specified an exact duration. The suspension will last until the underlying blockchain issues are fully resolved and the platform can ensure secure transactions. Stay tuned to official announcements for resumption notices. Q6: Does this affect other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb? A6: The announcement specifically refers to SEI.

The bill, filed during the Twentieth Congress’ first regular session, proposes the government acquire 10,000 BTC over five years to serve as a long-term strategic reserve asset. Proposed Law Would Lock Philippine Bitcoin Reserves for Two Decades House Bill No. 421, introduced by Representative Miguel Luis R. Villafuerte, proposes an annual acquisition of 2,000 BTC through the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). The purchased Bitcoin would be placed in cold storage facilities distributed across the country and held in trust for at least 20 years. A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill has been filed by Rep. Miguel Villafuerte in the House of Representatives. The Bill seeks to purchase 10,000 BTC over a 5-year period. pic.twitter.com/0coTMQrVvh — Dicki Devesa (@57twl57) August 22, 2025 According to the bill, the holdings could only be sold under strict conditions, such as retiring sovereign debt, and no more than 10% of the reserve may be liquidated in any two-year period after the minimum holding period expires. As of November 2024, the Philippines’ debt had risen to ₱16.09 trillion ($285 billion), with domestic obligations accounting for nearly 68% of the total. Supporters argue that diversifying national reserves beyond gold and the U.S. dollar is essential for financial stability, particularly as other countries accelerate their own Bitcoin strategies. Under the bill, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) would oversee the program, purchasing 2,000 BTC annually and placing them into cold storage facilities distributed across the country. The Bitcoin would be locked for at least 20 years, preventing sales or swaps except for limited use in retiring government debt. Under the proposed law, the BSP governor would oversee the reserve with support from the Department of Finance, Department of Defense, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The act mandates quarterly public “proof-of-reserve” audits verified by independent third parties, with reports published online to ensure transparency. The bill also explicitly protects private property rights, affirming that individuals and businesses remain free to buy, hold, and trade Bitcoin without government interference. The Philippines, the bill argues, cannot afford to be left behind. “It is vital that the country stockpile strategic assets such as Bitcoin to provide financial stability and safeguard our national interest,” the note reads. Proponents believe that other governments following suit could set off a global wave of Bitcoin buying, further constraining supply. With just 21 million BTC ever to be mined, and nearly 20 million already in circulation, advocates say early accumulation is critical. Global Governments Control 2.29% of Bitcoin Supply, Data Shows Governments worldwide are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, positioning it alongside gold and other critical resources. Villafuerte pointed to the growing global context driving the measure. Hong Kong legislator Johnny Ng has proposed that Bitcoin be used as an official financial reserve for the region. https://t.co/zk8EQQwRmA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2024 In Asia, Hong Kong lawmakers have called for official BTC reserves , Bhutan operates state-owned mining facilities, and China has long held seized Bitcoin . Russia, under sanctions, has leaned on Bitcoin for trade, with President Vladimir Putin calling it “unstoppable.” In the West, the United States and the United Kingdom are now among the largest sovereign holders through law enforcement seizures. Thailand, Malaysia, and several European countries are also exploring reserve frameworks. Data from CoinGecko shows that as of August 2025, 11 governments collectively control 480,196 BTC, worth about $55.6 billion, equal to 2.29% of Bitcoin’s supply. The U.S. leads with 198,022 BTC ($22.9B), followed by China with 190,000 BTC ($22B), mostly tied to confiscations. Source: CoinGecko The U.K. ranks third with 61,245 BTC ($7B). Smaller holders include North Korea (13,562 BTC), Bhutan (10,769 BTC), and El Salvador (6,268 BTC). El Salvador remains the flagship example of sovereign adoption after making Bitcoin legal tender in 2021. While retail usage has waned, the government continues to accumulate, recently adding 22 BTC to its holdings , now worth over $725 million. El Salvador has expanded its Bitcoin holdings once again, purchasing five additional BTC amid a market dip that saw the asset fall to $83,000. #ElSalvador #Bitcoin https://t.co/bVwm7Hs5s8 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 4, 2025 Argentina and Venezuela have also turned to Bitcoin and stablecoins to navigate inflation and dollar shortages. Momentum is spreading to South America. On August 20, Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies debated Bill 4501/24 , which would establish a $19 billion Bitcoin reserve known as RESBit. Philippines Ranks 7th Globally in Crypto Adoption Amid New Regulatory Push Notably, the Philippines are third in the region in both trading volume and adoption, ranking 7th worldwide in Chainalysis’ 2024 Geography of Crypto report . Source: CoinGecko The legislation arrives as the Philippines continues to refine its stance on digital assets. In April, the SEC launched its Strategic Sandbox (StratBox) program , a regulatory framework allowing crypto firms to test new products and services in a controlled environment. In December, the BSP completed Project Agila , a wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) trial aimed at improving interbank settlement efficiency using distributed ledger technology. These initiatives suggest the country is seeking a balance between innovation, regulation, and financial stability. At the same time, regulators have ramped up enforcement. Earlier this month, the SEC issued an advisory against 10 major international exchanges, including OKX, KuCoin, Kraken, and Bybit, for operating without proper authorization in the country. Officials warned that unlicensed platforms expose Filipino investors to “significant risk” and pledged to work with tech giants like Google, Apple, and Meta to restrict access.

With this increase, Ethereum's market capitalization increased by $65 billion to $581.75 billion. This is poised to go down as the second-largest daily price increase in Ethereum's history. ETH is trading just 2.05% below its all-time high of $4,891.70 hit in November 2021. Chart with minute candles showing the rise in ETH price. The increase was driven by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium. In his final Jackson Hole speech, Powell strongly hinted at a potential interest rate cut in September, but he made no firm commitment. His remarks were aimed at balancing the risks of a weakening labor market with inflationary pressures. Related News: Donald Trump May Have Cornered Fed Chairman Jerome Powell - He Appears to Be Forcing Another Member to Resign and Push for Interest Rate Cuts Expectations for a rate cut rose sharply following Powell's remarks. Before Powell's speech, investors had seen a 70% chance of a quarter-point rate cut in September, but after his speech, that probability rose to 89%. Expectations of interest rate cuts have led investors to shift to riskier assets. This development has created a strong bullish wave not only for Ethereum but also for the cryptocurrency market in general. *This is not investment advice.

At first, it may look shocking but experts say it may not be bad news for the market. Just like in earlier cycles, it seems the momentum drivers for Bitcoin may not necessarily be the whales but a different type of investors. As Ethereum adjusts to these changes, new opportunities are being noticed across the crypto space. Projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are seeing growth, as investors begin looking for new coins that could outperform the giants for great returns. The early enthusiasm for this emerging altcoin suggests the changes and developments could herald the next generation of crypto. Ethereum Whales Retreat, Sharks Step In According to on-chain strategist Joao Wedson, there is a decrease in number and supply share in Ethereum whale wallets. Despite the ETH price pump, large players linked to custodians or exchanges seem less active. However, this has allowed for new investors or “sharks” to come in – wallets with 10,000-100,000 ETH that have been accumulating since April, instead of dragging the market down. On the contrary, on-chain data shows that sharks have added approximately 4.4 million ETH in this time. New Opportunities in Focus As Ethereum whale and shark address balances shift, investors are also diversifying into new growth projects. One of the distinct specs MAGACOIN FINANCE has attracted attention from early participants who believe it will capture a lot of eyeballs before listing on major exchanges. Experts believe that an initial bet of $2,500 could have turned into more than $50,000. As demand continues to rise and allocations become increasingly difficult to obtain, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the cycle’s biggest bets worth watching. Why This Trend Benefits Ethereum Unlike whales who sit on inactive holdings, sharks are active traders and play a more important role and impact on prices. Their aggressive accumulation suggests that Ethereum’s growth story is still alive and well. If the current pace continues, however, it may well be the trigger for ETH’s next major upside. For investors, this represents a dual opportunity: Ethereum remains strong at its core, while newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer exposure to potentially outsized returns for those positioning early. Conclusion Ethereum whales abandoning their holdings should not be interpreted as weakness. Instead, transferring such coins to more active investors will help drive the market. Currently, new opportunities, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, are becoming one of the main focuses of capital flows as investors look for ways to take advantage of upward movements in the crypto world.

While Ripple’s XRP remains busy leaving its stamp on cross-border payments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ranks among the most searched altcoins of 2025. Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale is selling the token for $0.035 today. Investors who purchase the token today have a good chance of getting back their investment in a return of a minimum of 500% in a span of a few months to reach. Mutuum Finance presale has already raised more than $14.7 million in funds as well as onboarded over than 15500 token holders since initiation. The launch of Mutuum Finance is creating the greatest buzz among investors in the future. XRP Market Outlook XRP at $2.89 continues to demonstrate its established role in cross-border settlement solutions, with recent price action showing ranges between $2.86 and $3.02 in the past 24 hours. Even as regulatory changes, such as the SEC considerations for potential XRP-backed ETFs, add an element of doubt, institutional buying and whale action moving large volumes off the exchanges show long-term belief in the asset. In the broader scheme of widely trending cryptocurrencies, XRP remains a center of attention, consistently referred to alongside newer entries such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that are opening new ground in 2025. Presale Stage 6 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance has been able to register more than 15,500 investors whose total presale raise is currently above $14.7 million. The project is now in presale stage 6 for $0.035. Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. It is a four-layered reward i.e., critical, major, minor and low in which each level of risk is being rewarded. It is another feature which gives Mutuum the status of a trendsetter as far as trust generation is concerned both from the perspective of good infrastructure as well as good security. Mutuum Finance Giveaway: $100K Reward Mutuum Finance is carrying out a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be rewarded with $10,000 MUTM. It’s their live give-away for new project investors, as well as the project’s way to create a long-term and loyal community. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance takes a two-model approach towards achieving ultimate flexibility and efficiency with Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models of lending. Peer-to-Contract is implementing self-execute smart contracts that will lend without any form of human intervention. They have been set to operate according to changing market rates with an interest rate from then-existing demand and supply. Middleman does not exist for Peer-to-Peer model and the borrowers are directly talking to the lenders. Peer-to-Peer model is well-liked amongst meme coins. XRP still demonstrates its resilience as a cross-border payments leader, but the breakout momentum of 2025 is decidedly heading toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Already having raised over $14.7 million from over 15,500 investors, with a 95 trust score that has been audited by CertiK, and both a $50,000 bug bounty and $100,000 giveaway fueling its community-first growth, MUTM is teaching us that utility-based projects are where it’s at this year. As of the current Stage 6 presale price of $0.035, investors can secure tokens before the 14.29% jump to $0.04 in Stage 7. Early buyers will be able to take home projected 500%+ returns when the token launches, which makes this present time one of the most timely windows to invest. Whether you’re holding XRP and looking to diversify, or you’re simply searching for the best crypto to buy in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as the smarter play. Don’t miss the presale while prices remain low.

And it’s no surprise it’s for Dogecoin (DOGE), one of the oldest in the game. The SEC recently set a deadline for resolving ETF applications for various coins, including Dogecoin, by October. The excitment around approval is pretty high, especially since Bloomberg analysts have pegged the chances of it happening at 90%. Source: James Seyffart on X Traders on Polymarket are also feeling pretty optimistic about the Dogecoin ETF approval, with chances sitting at 68%. If the approval goes through, it would be a major step forward for both Dogecoin and memecoins as a whole. Doge Price Prediction: Double Bottom For Dogecoin? The markets got a big boost after Powell hinted that a rate cut might be on the table for September. His Jackson Hole speech quickly reversed the recent crypto and stock market dip, sparking fresh optimism that the Fed might step in to support growth. Source: DOGEUSD / TradingView Dogecoin (DOGE) price was no exception and saw an immediate 7% bounce in response, possibly forming a double bottom pattern, which is often a prediction of big potential gains. The RSI is backing up the bullish case, sitting at a neutral 51 level, this leaves room for more upside before looking at pullbacks. The MACD line also looks solid, crossing above the blue line. If DOGE can break through the previous resistance (the red trendline), it might lead the charge in a new rally for memecoins. The support level stays the same (0.20) and its important level for the price to stay above. Missed Dogecoin? Maxi Doge is Here To Replace it With 1000x Potential Maxi Doge might be the biggest winner from Dogecoin’s rise. Their new Dogecoin-inspired memecoin just dropped its presale and it’s already racked up over $1.4M. Maxi Doge appears to be “gym bro” version of Doge who’s hooked on high-leverage trading. It’s 100% meme vibes, no pretending it’s got some deep use case or anything serious. Even though it plays it cool on utility, if you look close, Maxi Doge’s got some fun community stuff like staking and user contests, which could keep it relevant for a long time. They’ve got 40% of the total tokens in the public presale, with no private sales or insider deals, so no need to stress about whales dumping once it hits the big exchanges. They’re also offering a staking program for MAXI holders, with presale buyers able to snag up to 212 % annual yield. Basically, you can lock up your MAXI and start earning rewards before the presale even wraps up. Early believers might cash in big and end up making the most of it. Head to the Maxi Doge website to follow smart investors and join the presale. You can make your purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, or even a credit card.

SEC Lawsuit Update,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-rockets-10-in-hours-after-this-vital-ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-update/,"TL;DR XRP has joined the overall market trend in the past few hours by posting a massive green candle that took it from under $2.8 to almost $3.1. Aside from the positive news on the US interest rate front, there’s a big update on the lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The Second Circuit has approved the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal. pic.twitter.com/v796dAtfiZ — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) August 22, 2025 It’s safe to say that this is a complicated case, and its conclusion has been announced several times in the past. It all started in mid-March when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said both parties had agreed to withdraw their respective appeals against each other and had decided to settle with a $50 million penalty. Although that sounded like a victory for Ripple, there were more complications along the way as Judge Torres denied their requests at first. However, both sides filed a joint dismissal of the appeals in early August, which was once again categorized as the lawsuit’s end. Yet, it still needed the approval of the Second Circuit, which was finally announced minutes ago by defense lawyer James K. Filan. XRP’s price, which has been significantly impacted in the past by the various developments within the case, went on a roll after the news went live. Admittedly, its surge coincided with the broader market’s revival after the US Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at possible rate cuts. Nevertheless, XRP is up by more than 10% since its multi-week low registered earlier today at just under $2.8. It currently trades close to $3.1, which could spell trouble for over-leveraged short traders, as explained earlier. XRPUSD.

The only substantial asset remains the hotel properties; other ventures like magazines and film are unimpressive and lack visibility. I doubt the crypto-for-stock program will boost share prices in New York, unlike similar moves in London due to market differences. My view: unless you believe in a renewed speculative frenzy, AMTD's fun is likely over—I'm not interested in participating. I suppose it could work Long term readers will know that I've not been a huge fan of the varied AMTD companies over the years. There's always seemed to be more of the sizzle and less of the steak than we might want in an investment to me. No doubt that's terribly unkind of me but opinions are opinions and should be plainly stated. AMTD Digital The big excitement, back when, was when the AMTD Group (the private group at the back of all of this) had spun out AMTD IDEA ( AMTD ) which then in turn spun off AMTD Digital ( HKD ). That last company was, for a few days at least, valued at more than Goldman Sachs. Values of both/all have slipped considerably since those heady days . As many of us were insisting they would do once the excitement passed. My last look at the group went through the latest plan. Which was that AMTD Digital should perform another spin off . The major asset that's being traded here is those hotel properties. Which in my opinion moved from AMTD Group through IDEA to Digital and are now going to go on into WME/BSII. Along the way there's been considerable fun with meme stock games and so on. The major valuation, for me, is our opinion of how much meme stock fun we're going to have with this next iteration of floating those hotel properties. Opinions on that will obviously differ. But that's what, I think, is the proposition. That's now all live as The Generation Essentials Group . There are a few Paris based magazines, something of a film business and, as far as I can see again, those hotels. Of those the one that might have a substantial value is those hotels. Back when this all started I did go through the exercise of - roughly - valuing them and they seemed reasonable in price per room given the markets they were in. The other assets, well, I'm not sure. My opinion - and yes, purely opinion - is that they're nothing very much. Certainly, outside press releases from parts of the varied AMTD companies I've not come across them. I don't claim they don't exist, only that they're not famous enough to have crossed my timeline. That I don't know about them isn't proof of anything either. I am not a great fan, you might say, as earlier pieces show . One oddity Whether The Generation Essentials Group is now live as a trade is a bit confusing. Nasdaq seems to think it is . The company itself seems to think it isn't . If it is live then $3 and change wasn't a successful IPO. And if it isn't then $3 and change for a SPAC nominally worth $10 isn't good either. But that's not the part of the game that I find interesting here. Crypto So the latest announcement is that all three listed companies - AMTD, HKG and TGE - are now to sell stock for crypto . AMTD IDEA Group (""AMTD IDEA Group"") (NYSE: AMTD; SGX: HKB), a NYSE and SGX-ST dual-listed company and a subsidiary of AMTD Group Inc., AMTD Digital Inc. (""AMTD Digital"") (NYSE: HKD), a controlled and consolidated subsidiary of AMTD IDEA Group, and The Generation Essentials Group (NYSE: TGE), a controlled and consolidated subsidiary of AMTD Digital, jointly announced their plans to initiate a program for the respective listed company to exchange newly issued ordinary shares (including in the form of American depositary shares) of such listed company for certain cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD), Ethereum (ETH-USD) , Tether (USDT-USD), BNB (BNB-USD), USD Coin (USDC-USD)) through transactions with interested cryptocurrency holders at mutually agreed pricing, based on prevailing market valuations and subject to applicable laws and regulations (each a ""AMTD cryptocurrency conversion program""). And, erm, why? All of those coins are readily transferrable into USD which can then be used to buy stock in the normal manner. Any of the companies can have an at the market issuance program. There's no particular value to selling stock for crypto rather than $ given that crypto is readily tradeable into $ these days. Except, of course, that some companies have been buying crypto for their treasury operations and driving their stock price up as a result : London-listed companies are turning to Bitcoin to boost their share prices, drawing Europe’s largest equity market into a growing global trend in which businesses are transforming themselves into proxies for the cryptocurrency. At least nine companies, from a web design business to a gold miner, have in the past week announced that they have either bought Bitcoin to add to their corporate treasuries or plan to do so. They are following the likes of Japan’s Metaplanet and Germany’s Bitcoin Group in seeking to emulate billionaire Michael Saylor’s Strategy. The US software group’s valuation has soared almost 400 per cent to more than $100bn since August 2020 when it announced that would start raising billions of dollars to fund Bitcoin purchases. London has had very few Bitcoin companies basically because the authorities don't like crypto. So, no ETFs and so on that allow the regular investor into crypto via the main markets. Those companies that have bought crypto and announced that they have done so have done very well: They also include Smarter Web Company, a Guildford-based website design business listed on Aquis that rocketed in value from £4mn to more than £1bn in just two months after unveiling its Bitcoin buying plan in April. Its shares have since slipped but its performance has encouraged others.Panther Metals, a natural resources business that reported a £2.2mn loss last year, revealed this week that it had bought a single Bitcoin, executing on a plan announced earlier in June. Its shares are up 81 per cent this month. Bitcoin has risen more than 74 per cent in the past 12 months. Ah, so we've what markets do so well, a speculative frenzy. Sometimes these work out well and sometimes they don't. So, AMTD and crypto Now, this is very much opinion and nothing else but my read is that the varied AMTDs have seen this happening and thought that perhaps it would be a good idea to take part. And, to the extent that it would increase stock prices it would be a good idea. I don't think it will increase stock prices, to be fair. They're all New York listed and there are Bitcoin ETFs, covered options on ether via ETF (certainly, in Canada there are) and all sorts of alternatives which simply aren't available in London. So it's not like the AMTD groups would be offering anything new to the NY markets. It's also not true that holding, in Treasury, coins like Tether and USDC is going to be an interesting speculation. The entire point of both of those is that they're worth $1 and that they'll keep that value no matter what. It is possible - possible - that this move into selling stock for crypto will respark the boom in one or possibly all three of these related stocks (don't forget, the third is a subsidary, even with its own quote, of the second which is in turn a subsidiary of the first again with its own quote and the first is a subsidiary of the unquoted holding company even with a quote of its own). I tend to think it's unlikely as they're doing it in New York where these sorts of workarounds to get into crypto via the stock market are not necessary - unlike London. But, you know, hope springs eternal and all that. I also think that - and this is pure opinion, unsupported by anything so trivial as a fact - that this is why they're doing it. To see if they can spark that speculative interest again. Whether we want to get involved should - I think - depend purely on whether we think that interest is indeed going to get sparked again. Not for me. Why I'm wrong It could be that there's some special business within this related group that I'm not seeing. If this is so then my general undervaluation will be wrong. It's also possible that this crypto announcement will lead to something. I doubt it but we can all be surprised - HKD being briefly worth more than Goldman Sachs wasn't something many were expecting after all. It rapidly ceasing to be was predictable. My opinion I've made it pretty clear over the years my general opinion of the varied companies here. There is a real business, proper value, here, in the form of those hotel properties. They were, initially, reasonably (in that the valuations were not obviously wrong) valued. The market valuations of tens and hundreds of billions of $ were obviously speculative frenzy. As I said at the time and as subsequent events have shown. We are now on that third iteration of a new company being spun out to hold those hotel assets. There's some dressing about the magazine business but that really doesn't seem all that impressive. Now we've this idea of selling stock for crypto. I think - my opinion is - that this is simply observing what's sparking speculative frenzy elsewhere and thinking that perhaps it can do so here again.

Filan shared an important update regarding the long-standing case between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. In a post on X, Filan confirmed that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has approved a joint stipulation of dismissal in the matter. The court issued its mandate on August 22, 2025, formally recognizing the stipulation filed by the parties to withdraw the appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42. The order, signed by Catherine O’Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court, states that the stipulation of dismissal is “So Ordered,” thereby concluding the appeal. The mandate was issued in cases docketed under numbers 24-2648 and 24-2705, covering the appeals brought forward by both the SEC and Ripple Labs. The document also lists Ripple executives Bradley Garlinghouse and Christian A. Larsen as defendants-appellees, with several intervenors including attorney John Deaton and others representing retail holders of XRP. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The Second Circuit has approved the Joint Stipulation of Dismissal. pic.twitter.com/v796dAtfiZ — James K. Filan (@FilanLaw) August 22, 2025 Conclusion of the Appeals Process The approval of the joint stipulation indicates that both sides have reached a final resolution in the appellate process, leaving no further action pending before the Second Circuit. The language of the order suggests that neither Judge Analisa Torres , who presided over the trial level of the case in the Southern District of New York, nor any other judicial authority needs to take additional steps at this stage. This development formally ends the appellate phase of a case that has been ongoing since December 2020, when the SEC first filed its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alleging that the company’s sales of XRP constituted unregistered securities offerings. Over time, the case became one of the most closely followed legal battles in the digital asset sector, given its implications for regulatory clarity in the industry. Community Reaction Filan’s update was met with immediate reaction from members of the XRP community. One user, MrCrypto, expressed enthusiasm, writing , “Finally!!! XRP community now we take over the world…” Another community member, DigiX, raised a question about whether any further judicial action was required, asking , “Now…is it done for good? Or does our esteemed judge Torres need to do anything else?” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In response, another participant in the discussion clarified that the case is over and that Judge Torres has no remaining role, stating , “Torres is done. Case is over. Ripple has to pay the settlement. I bet that would happen tomorrow.” Finality of the Case With the issuance of the mandate by the Second Circuit, the legal proceedings between the SEC and Ripple Labs appear to be fully concluded. The court’s formal approval of the joint stipulation of dismissal marks the official end of the appeals, bringing closure to nearly five years of litigation. For the XRP community and the broader digital asset industry, this outcome represents a decisive moment. While details of any settlement arrangements remain to be fully addressed, the dismissal eliminates the uncertainty of ongoing appellate review. The case is now considered legally finished, as confirmed by the mandate issued on August 22, 2025. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This recent uptrend has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling renewed confidence in the second-largest digital asset. According to real-time data from CoinGecko, Ether (ETH) is currently trading around $4,801.80, marking a pivotal moment in its recent market performance. This recovery highlights the dynamic nature of the crypto market and Ether’s enduring resilience. What’s Driving the Ether Price Recovery? Several factors contribute to the robust rebound in Ether price . Market sentiment often plays a crucial role, and recent positive news surrounding the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem has undoubtedly fueled optimism. Investors are closely watching developments within the Ethereum network, which continues to evolve with significant upgrades. These technological advancements aim to enhance scalability, security, and sustainability, making Ethereum a more attractive platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Growing Utility: Ethereum’s ecosystem supports a vast array of applications, from DeFi to NFTs, constantly increasing demand for ETH. Positive Market Sentiment: A general bullish trend in the wider crypto market often lifts major assets like Ether. Network Upgrades: Ongoing improvements to the Ethereum blockchain, such as the upcoming “Merge” and subsequent sharding, promise greater efficiency and lower transaction costs, which can positively impact Ether price . Understanding Ether’s Market Position Ether, as the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, holds a unique and vital position in the digital asset landscape. Its foundational role in enabling smart contracts and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols makes it indispensable for many innovative projects. The ability to execute complex, self-executing agreements without intermediaries has cemented Ethereum’s status as a leader in blockchain technology. This strong utility underpins its value and provides a solid basis for the current Ether price recovery. Furthermore, institutional interest in Ethereum has been steadily increasing, with more traditional financial entities exploring ways to integrate or invest in the network. This growing institutional adoption further validates Ethereum’s long-term potential and contributes to its overall market stability. Challenges and Opportunities for Ether Price While the recent recovery is encouraging, the cryptocurrency market remains subject to volatility. Ether price can be influenced by various external factors, including regulatory changes, macroeconomic trends, and competitor developments. For instance, increased regulatory scrutiny on the crypto space could introduce uncertainties. However, these challenges also present opportunities. The continuous innovation within the Ethereum network aims to address some of these inherent limitations, such as high gas fees during peak congestion, which can improve user experience. Challenges: Market volatility and global economic shifts. Regulatory uncertainties across different jurisdictions. Competition from other layer-1 blockchains. Opportunities: Continued growth of DeFi and NFT sectors. Successful implementation of network upgrades enhancing efficiency. Increased institutional investment and adoption. Actionable Insights for Investors For those looking at the current Ether price movements, it’s essential to approach the market with a well-informed strategy. Diversification remains a key principle in crypto investing. While Ether shows strong potential, balancing your portfolio across different assets can mitigate risks. Keeping an eye on technical analysis, market news, and network developments will provide valuable insights. Moreover, understanding your risk tolerance is crucial before making any investment decisions. Remember, the crypto market can be unpredictable; therefore, only invest what you can afford to lose. In conclusion, Ether price has made a remarkable stride by reclaiming the $4,800 level, reflecting a renewed sense of optimism and underlying strength within the Ethereum ecosystem. This recovery is a testament to its foundational utility, ongoing technological advancements, and growing market acceptance. While challenges persist, the opportunities for Ether remain significant, driven by innovation and increasing adoption. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Ether’s journey will undoubtedly remain a focal point for investors and enthusiasts worldwide.

50502196,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=192591,1755884713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50502196.jpeg,XRP ETF: 21Shares’ Momentous Delaware Registration Unlocks New Investment Horizons,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/xrp-etf-delaware-registration/,"BitcoinWorld XRP ETF: 21Shares’ Momentous Delaware Registration Unlocks New Investment Horizons The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a truly significant development: the official registration of an XRP ETF by 21Shares in Delaware, USA. This exciting news, initially reported by JinSe Finance, marks a pivotal moment for Ripple’s native digital asset, XRP, and its journey towards broader institutional acceptance. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this move signals a growing maturity in the digital asset landscape and potentially opens new avenues for mainstream investment. What Does the 21Shares XRP ETF Registration Mean? When a major player like 21Shares, a prominent issuer of crypto ETPs (Exchange Traded Products), registers an XRP ETF , it’s a big deal. Essentially, an ETF allows investors to gain exposure to an asset, in this case, XRP, without directly owning or managing the underlying cryptocurrency. This structure offers several advantages, particularly for traditional investors who might be hesitant about the complexities of direct crypto purchases and storage. Simplified Access: Investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through conventional brokerage accounts. Regulatory Comfort: ETFs operate within regulated frameworks, potentially easing concerns for institutional investors. Diversification Potential: Offers a straightforward way to add digital asset exposure to a diversified portfolio. The registration in Delaware, a state known for its business-friendly legal environment, is a crucial first step in the lengthy process of bringing such a product to market. It doesn’t mean the ETF is immediately available for trading, but it certainly indicates serious intent and progress. Why is this a Game-Changer for XRP Investment? The potential launch of an XRP ETF could dramatically alter the investment landscape for XRP. Currently, many institutional investors face hurdles due to regulatory uncertainties or the operational complexities of holding digital assets. An ETF provides a regulated, accessible, and familiar vehicle. Consider the impact Bitcoin ETFs had on BTC’s price and institutional adoption. While not a direct comparison due to XRP’s ongoing legal situation with the SEC, the principle remains: increased accessibility often leads to increased demand and liquidity. This registration could be a powerful catalyst for XRP, drawing in a new wave of capital from traditional finance. This development is particularly noteworthy given the ongoing legal battles surrounding XRP. The fact that 21Shares is moving forward suggests a degree of confidence in XRP’s future regulatory clarity, especially after recent court rulings provided some positive momentum for Ripple. Navigating the Path to a Live XRP ETF While the Delaware registration is a positive indicator, it is just one step. The journey to an actively traded XRP ETF involves several regulatory hurdles, most notably approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s stance on various cryptocurrencies, including XRP, has been a significant factor in the delay of many crypto-related investment products. However, the landscape is evolving. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year has set a precedent, potentially paving the way for other single-asset crypto ETFs. The crypto community will be closely watching for further announcements and filings, particularly with the SEC, to understand the timeline and likelihood of this XRP ETF becoming a reality. This initiative by 21Shares demonstrates a proactive approach, anticipating future market demands and regulatory clarity. It highlights the growing institutional interest in digital assets beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a broader acceptance of the asset class. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of an XRP ETF? An XRP ETF offers several compelling benefits: Increased Liquidity: A successful ETF can significantly boost XRP’s trading volume and market liquidity. Price Discovery: Enhanced institutional participation can lead to more efficient price discovery. Mainstream Adoption: Bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto, fostering wider acceptance. However, challenges remain: Regulatory Approval: The SEC’s final decision is paramount and can be unpredictable. Market Volatility: XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, is subject to high price volatility, which an ETF would also reflect. Competition: Other firms might also pursue similar products, leading to a competitive market. Despite these challenges, the registration of the 21Shares XRP ETF is undeniably a significant milestone, reflecting growing confidence in XRP’s potential as a viable investment asset. In conclusion, 21Shares’ registration of an XRP ETF in Delaware is a powerful statement about the future of digital asset investments. It represents a proactive move by a major financial institution to meet evolving investor demand and embrace the potential of cryptocurrencies. While the road to full regulatory approval is still ahead, this development injects renewed optimism into the XRP community and underscores the irreversible trend of digital assets integrating into mainstream finance. This is more than just a registration; it’s a glimpse into a future where accessing innovative digital assets like XRP becomes as straightforward as investing in traditional stocks.

An XRP ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of XRP without directly owning or managing the underlying cryptocurrency. It trades on traditional stock exchanges. 2. Does this registration mean the XRP ETF is available for trading? No, the Delaware registration is an initial legal step.

This registration signifies a formal intent by 21Shares to pursue the launch of an XRP ETF. 4. How might an XRP ETF impact XRP’s price? The potential launch of an XRP ETF could lead to increased institutional investment and broader market access, which historically has contributed to higher demand, liquidity, and potentially a positive impact on XRP’s price. 5.

Other challenges include market volatility and competition from other potential crypto investment products.

The recent passage of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin law in the US, was one of the key factors spurring the EU into action. The EU, the world's largest trading bloc, has accelerated its work on the digital euro to avoid being left behind in the stablecoin race. At this point, the European Central Bank (ECB) is considering the possibility of the Digital Euro's infrastructure being run on a public network rather than a private blockchain. Accordingly, the EU may opt for public networks such as Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL) rather than a private blockchain for the digital euro. According to sources, the use of public blockchains such as Etheruem and Solana has now become an option being seriously considered by EU authorities. While there are very few euro-backed stablecoins on the market, their market capitalization is quite small compared to dollar-backed stablecoins. This increases the importance of the digital euro for the EU. The US's rapid move into dollar-backed stablecoins is fueling concerns about Europe falling behind in the digital currency race. The US's move toward stablecoins has also spurred action from other global trading giants. China is preparing to legalize yuan-backed stablecoins after a 12-year ban, while Japan recently approved its first dollar-backed stablecoin. *This is not investment advice.

Pepe Coin (PEPE) is seeing surging volumes and eyeing one of its biggest breakouts. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has just cleared stubborn resistance and could be gearing up for its own rally. But while the headlines focus on these familiar giants, a sub-$0.003 challenger, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , is rapidly positioning itself as the more explosive play in 2025’s meme coin race. PEPE and SHIB Eye Breakouts, but $1 Still a Distant Dream Pepe Coin is edging toward one of its most anticipated breakouts of the year. Trading volumes have surged from $400 million to nearly $900 million recently, while a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern points to a possible 773% upside if PEPE clears resistance at $0.000016. The broader Ethereum rally above $4,700 adds fuel to the bullish case, as capital often rotates into ERC-20 meme plays during major ETH breakouts. Top Ranking Meme Coins | Source: CoinGecko Shiba Inu also shows signs of life, climbing 10% in the past week and breaking out of its symmetrical triangle at $0.00001359. The decline of nearly 1% in exchange balances over the past two weeks has alleviated sell pressure, enabling bulls to target key upside targets at $0.00001469 and $0.00001599. However, both tokens face familiar hurdles. For PEPE and SHIB, the road to $1 would require an astronomical market cap leap to 1000x from current levels, far beyond any previous meme coin run. Moreover, SHIB’s rising Spent Coins Age Bands hint that long-term holders could take profits soon, potentially capping momentum. Both tokens remain heavily dependent on market sentiment and macro crypto trends, leaving room for new contenders to make their mark. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Coin Built for 2025’s Bull Market Currently in Stage 11 of its presale, Little Pepe has raised over $20 million, sold 13.1 billion tokens, and doubled in price from its Stage 1 launch, now at $0.002. This isn’t just another meme coin; it’s the first Ethereum-built Layer 2 specifically designed to power meme token launches with fairness and speed. Key features setting LILPEPE apart: Sniper-bot-proof blockchain, the first of its kind, ensuring fair token launches. 0% buy/sell tax, built for high-volume trading without fee drag. Dedicated meme launchpad, nurturing the next wave of viral tokens. CertiK-audited smart contracts with a 3-month cliff and 5% monthly vesting, preventing early dumps. Confirmed listings on two top-tier exchanges post-launch, with plans in motion for the largest exchange in the world. With a launch price of $0.003 and a $300 million market cap target, Little Pepe is entering the market with the kind of structure, funding, and visibility that most meme projects can only dream of. Why Little Pepe Is the Real $1 Challenger While SHIB and PEPE fight symbolic $1 battles over massive market caps, Little Pepe is starting at a near-zero market cap post-listing, leaving huge room for exponential gains. Analysts are already projecting a 50,000% rally post-listing, with realistic targets in the $0.85 to $1 range if momentum mirrors the early runs of DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE. Little Pepe’s advantage isn’t just price entry; it’s the perfect mix of narrative and tech: Narrative: Meme coin culture meets cutting-edge blockchain design. Tech: A Layer 2 that fixes the two biggest meme coin launch issues, bot sniping and liquidity manipulation. Timing: Entering the market during Ethereum’s surge and the broader meme coin revival. For early investors, that combination could mean turning a modest $500 presale buy into six figures within the next market cycle, something that’s far harder to achieve with PEPE or SHIB at today’s valuations.

With miners driving hash rate levels toward record highs and long-term valuation models signaling room for growth, the popular meme coin appears to be building a solid base for its next potential move higher. Dogecoin Market Metrics To Spark Breakout In an X social media post on Thursday, Alphractal highlighted that Dogecoin’s underlying blockchain strength may set the stage for a potential breakout. Despite being one of the most volatile assets in the crypto market, Dogecoin’s mining network continues to showcase resilience, with hash rate activity trending toward record highs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Targets $1.25, But This 170% Move Is The Start The latest data shows that Dogecoin’s mean hash rate has steadily climbed since 2020, closely mirroring its price growth, and signaling that miner commitment has persisted and intensified even during long consolidations. This level of mining participation demonstrates miners’ continued confidence and reflects the DOGE network’s growing robustness. With hash rate trending near its highest historical levels, the meme coin’s security and transaction reliability remain well-supported, mitigating concerns over structural weakness. At the core of Alphractal’s analysis is its newly developed Network Stress Index, a metric designed to gauge blockchain health by combining multiple key stress indicators. Higher readings on the stress index typically point to turbulence or instability, while lower values reflect a balanced and secure network environment. Recent readings show that Dogecoin’s network is currently stable, with no immediate signs of systemic stress, opening the door for potential upward momentum. The resilience of Dogecoin’s network metrics may also play a key role as it continues trading around what Alphractal calls the True Market Mean Price. As DOGE consolidates within this range, a strong foundation is being built for a potential breakout that could drive the meme coin toward its next major price milestone. Alpha Price And CVDD Highlight DOGE’s Long-Term Upside Beyond network resilience and hash rates, Alphractal’s models, such as the Alpha Price and the Cumulative Value Days Destroyed (CVDD), provide deeper insights into Dogecoin’s valuation potential. The Alpha Price acts as a sentiment-driven gravitational model, capturing where the asset should trade relative to broader psychological and technical conditions. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Remains Above $3 Billion, Can Bulls Take Control? Historical alignment between Dogecoin’s market price and the Alpha Price suggests that this model often serves as a reliable compass during rallies and corrections. Meanwhile, the CVDD model has been one of the most accurate indicators for identifying long-term tops and bottoms in UTXO-based blockchains like Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Litecoin. According to Alphractal, current CVDD readings for Dogecoin highlight how the price is consolidating between the lower and upper bands, mirroring patterns seen ahead of previous major rallies. The analysis reports that the CVDD top currently sits at around $0.54, but this threshold could rise as dormant coins begin moving back into circulation. This dynamic is expected to drive the DOGE price to $1, particularly if heightened network activity sparks a new wave of speculative demand.

According to market expert Joao Wedson, it is showing signs of renewed interest, and the price could rise sharply. The coin is currently in an accumulation phase, and even with short-term market uncertainty, SHIB is likely to stand out when memecoins capture the market’s attention again. Accumulation Phase Signals Growing Speculative Interest SHIB’s current accumulation phase suggests that investors are quietly building positions in the coin. On-chain data shows this steady buying pattern, and metrics like Realized Cap Impulse indicate SHIB could experience a shift toward positive momentum soon. A potential growth in the coin’s price may attract more speculative investors and capital into the market, as traders and holders take notice of the developing trend and position themselves to benefit from a possible upward movement . However, not all investors are fully confident yet. NUPL data indicates that many holders are still at a loss, which makes some people hesitant to jump in. Cautious investors who are reluctant to take risks, combined with the steadily growing interest from new and existing buyers , could create the perfect conditions for potential price movement. Related Reading: Market Expert Shakes Off SEC’s Delay Of XRP ETFs, Gives Timeframe For Approval Once momentum begins to build and confidence increases, the market could see SHIB’s value rise more noticeably as more participants start actively trading and investing in the meme coin. Alpha Price Metric Points To 125% Upside Potential One of the most notable indicators for SHIB is Wedson’s proprietary “Alpha Price” metric. This tool rarely gets surpassed but acts like a strong magnet for price action. According to Wedson, the Alpha Price signals that SHIB could surge by at least 125% , suggesting a significant upside is possible. Rather than getting sidetracked by the constant noise from news headlines, social media chatter, or influenced by the short-term price swings , he advises investors to pay close attention to this key metric and use it as a guide for understanding SHIB’s long-term potential. Shiba Inu’s current position shows that it is quietly preparing for a bigger move. The accumulation phase , when viewed together with the insights from the Alpha Price indicator, paints a clear picture of a coin that has the potential to gain significant momentum. While some investors remain hesitant due to current losses, others like Wedson see the potential for substantial gains. As 2025 unfolds, Shiba Inu may prove that it is more than just a memecoin from the past. Its quiet accumulation and strong Alpha Price signal make it a coin to watch closely. For investors looking at memecoins, SHIB could be the one to stand out and potentially lead the next big move in the market. If memecoins do retake the spotlight , it could signal the peak of this crypto cycle.",Shiba Inu|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SHIB|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 18:00:40

This decision connects high-end retail with digital finance and shows the company’s response to the rising interest in using cryptocurrency for shopping in the luxury market. Shift In Crypto Luxury Market The Hong Kong investment firm’s move is part of its plan to include blockchain technology and digital assets in its business. AsiaStrategy executives say that accepting Bitcoin helps meet the needs of a new generation of tech-savvy shoppers. It also positions the brand as a leader in innovation within the luxury retail market. As more people in Asia and the Middle East start using cryptocurrency, AsiaStrategy is reaching wealthy clients who appreciate exclusivity and technology. Accepting Bitcoin for payments improves privacy, speeds up transactions, and makes it easier to buy luxury goods from different countries. Sora Ventures Strategic Enters Public Market In May, the digital investment company chose a different way to go public. Instead of going public alone, it decided to merge with TopWin International, a Hong Kong watch distributor now moving into blockchain and Bitcoin. As part of the deal, Sora’s founder, Jason Fang, will become co-CEO of the company alongside Tony Ngai. Together, they will lead the firm under a new name: AsiaStrategy. With guidance from Sora, TopWin is stepping into the world of digital assets. It wants to adopt a Bitcoin-based treasury strategy and hold the flagship cryptocurrency as a financial reserve asset. It is worth noting that TopWin will still keep its original watch business. Sora Ventures will guide the company’s investment in digital assets. It will also help manage a special fund that focuses on public companies in Asia that use Bitcoin as part of their treasury. Cryptocurrency Use is on the Rise Digital assets are no longer considered risky investments but a growing part of digital finance. Aside from AsiaStrategy, big American brands like Whole Foods, Starbucks, and Subway have also started accepting crypto payments . They use apps like Spedn, which change crypto into regular money at checkout. According to TheCoinRise’s report, Spar, the well-known international grocery store chain, now accepts BTC payments at one of its stores in Switzerland . This development is not only happening in grocery stores. Banks, crypto companies , and schools are also starting to accept Bitcin for payments . This shows that cryptocurrency is becoming more useful in daily life.

However, while many altcoins could likely fill this space, Polkadot, VeChain, and Remittix show potential to be more rewarding. Remittix’s demand as a next-gen payment solution is leading the pack with its 10x potential before December. Here is a breakdown of each of these alternatives to see how they could perform in the next 4 months. VeChain Renew Supply Chain Processes With Crypto Solution The VeChain VET coin is on the radar for a surge toward $0.05 by the end of August, as price change today sees it near the 30EMA. However, before delving into the technical details, it is essential to understand the fundamental factors driving VeChain lately. A good place to start is with the partnership with top brands that is helping the VeChain project bring a new face to the global supply chain. Some of the names on the VeChain project right now include BMW and the Chinese Walmart, using VeChain for Supply chain tracking. However, new fundamental factors like RWA tokenisation are a new direction pushing VeChain for a big breakout this year. Also, analysts predict the VeChain supply chain partnership could be adding new names this year as interest shifts to blockchain. Investors seeking an alternative to Solana are now turning to the VET coin, which offers a roadmap for a significant price surge. Hence, while Solana price remains in a bearish situation, analysis is projecting VeChain price for up to 4x gain to $0.1 by December. Why Polkadot Offer Better Appeal Than Solana Right Now The Polkadot ecosystem is on a growth spree lately, with a rally that could trigger a bull run up to $13 in the next 4 months. This is as institutional interest shifts toward the DOT token as Solana ETF plans continue to delay. Brands like VanEck and Grayscale have started looking into investment products for the Polkadot coin. Furthermore, the technical setup also reveals a potential for a 5x to 7x increase in the next few months this year. Polkadot cross-chain integration has seen a rise in use cases over the last few months, as the ecosystem reaches a new growth dimension. Also, although the price is currently trading at $3.8, analysts say a breakout above $4.01 could trigger a spike to $13. Remittix Outplaying Solana With 10x Outlook Remittix is poised for a 10x price growth over the next 4 months, following BitMart’s official listing announcement. However, there are several factors currently fueling this price growth, including: Market anticipation for a crypto-to-fiat payout to over 30 countries with the Remittix payment solution Real-time FX conversion with over crypto assets to 30+ fiat currencies Low gas fee and security audit fueling market interest and confidence The September 15 Remittix beta wallet launch is also driving rising interest as discussions about adoption continue to surge. These catalysts are now positioning Remittix for a 10x breakout before December, leaving behind the muted Solana price.

Whale Alert, the popular on-chain monitoring service, reported the movement, estimating its value at roughly $107.8 million at the time of transfer. Xaif’s amplification of the alert immediately drew intense scrutiny from the XRP community, sparking debate over Ripple’s intentions and the potential impact on the token’s price. The On-Chain Trail: What We Know According to Whale Alert, the transaction originated from a wallet long associated with Ripple’s holdings and moved to an untagged destination address. Analysts in the community pointed out similarities to previous “Ripple 50” wallet activity, which often indicates internal treasury management. Still, with the receiving wallet currently unidentified, speculation remains divided between whether the tokens are destined for custody, institutional settlement, or potential market sales. MASSIVE XRP MOVE Ripple just transferred 35,000,000 $XRP Unknown wallet pic.twitter.com/5IyJal9jyP — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) August 22, 2025 Market Reaction: XRP Price at the Time of the Post The transfer coincided with heightened volatility in XRP markets. At the time of Xaif’s post, aggregated exchange data recorded XRP trading at approximately $2.79, marking its intraday low. Selling pressure and uncertainty around the transaction weighed on sentiment, with traders bracing for potential sell-offs. In the hours that followed, XRP rebounded to around $3.03, representing an 8.6% recovery from the low. Market observers attributed the rebound to the recent fed chair’s statement , greenlighting the possibility for rate call. Nevertheless, the sharp reaction underscored how sensitive XRP’s price remains to large-scale wallet movements, particularly when Ripple is involved. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why It Matters: Liquidity and Market Psychology Ripple’s large transfers have historically signaled a range of outcomes. They have been linked to internal rebalancing of reserves, liquidity provisioning for exchanges, over-the-counter deals, or preparations for institutional products. When such transactions head to unidentified wallets, markets often assume the worst — that tokens may soon hit exchange order books — which amplifies volatility. This event also highlights a persistent tension within the XRP community: while Ripple has repeatedly stressed that it manages its holdings responsibly, many traders remain wary of large movements, fearing supply shocks that could suppress prices in the short term. Watching the Rails, Not Just the Headlines The sheer scale of the transfer of 35 million XRP makes it inherently market-moving. Yet the true significance depends on what happens next. If the tokens remain in custody or are allocated to institutional settlement channels, the long-term impact may prove negligible. But if the destination wallet is later linked to exchange deposits, renewed selling pressure could follow. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Management continues to focus on bitcoin as a payment tool, with no significant crypto expansion or innovation beyond bitcoin, disappointing given industry trends. Core businesses Square and Cash App delivered solid gross profit growth, but overall revenue quality is diluted by high transaction-related costs. The stock's current valuation already reflects its growth prospects, and without a major crypto catalyst, I remain Neutral and expect only market-like returns. Heading into the Q2 2025 earnings report, Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) shareholders wanted to hear how the fintech was expanding into the growing crypto world. Instead, bitcoin trading is still a negative and volatile distraction to the quarterly financials. My investment thesis remains Neutral on the stock due to the valuation equation and the lack of a big crypto catalyst. Source: Finviz Another Miss Block reported a huge disappointment for Q2 , with revenues missing analyst estimates by a wide $240 million, leading to an EPS miss as follows: Source: Seeking Alpha As highlighted before, Block is generally valued based on gross profit due to the issue with volatile bitcoin trading revenues. In this case, bitcoin trading revenue in Q2 2025 was down $468 million YoY to only $2.14 billion. Source: Block Q2'25 shareholder letter As usual, the prime issue with bitcoin revenues is the lack of profits from the trading. Block only produced an $81 million gross profit from the large level of trading. Even worse, Block outlined the growth path for Cash App as follows: A scaled P2P network that connects customers to their local communities A broad set of commerce tools that help customers manage their spending Deep banking functionality that supports customers saving, investing, borrowing, and more Simple tools that make it easy for customers to transact in bitcoin The management team only outlined a crypto priority around designing simple tools for customers completing transactions in bitcoin. The company doesn't mention any plans to expand beyond bitcoin, whether with payments, trading, investing, or even Treasury plans via stablecoins. On the Q2 2025 earnings call , Block didn't mention the term ""crypto"" at any point. The fintech recently issued a press release to officially release the bitcoin mining hardware called Proto. While the company has developed a lot of technology around bitcoin payments, CEO Jack Dorsey hasn't seemed very interested in actually profiting off bitcoin-related trading and payments. As highlighted in prior research, Coinbase ( COIN ) alone has regularly traded with a market cap double the valuation of Block, while the company appears to again be missing out on the opportunity to lead the industry in the move into stablecoins after the U.S. government approved the Genius Act to usher in the crypto revolution. Gross Profit Push Despite the crypto disappointment, Block reported solid metrics for the business. Square grew gross profits by 11% YoY to $1.02 billion, and Cash App boosted gross profits by 16% YoY to $1.5 billion. Source: Block Q2'25 presentation The company guided further gross profit gains in Q3 to reach $2.6 billion. Block is definitely seeing momentum in the Square and Cash App units after growth stalled in the last year. As noted above, Block reported total Q2 revenues of $6.1 billion, but this metric just isn't usable. On top of the bitcoin costs of $2.06 billion, the fintech had transaction-based costs of $1.07 billion, adding up to $3.13 billion in transaction-related costs, counting for nearly 50% of all revenues. The stock has a market cap of $45 billion, and the guidance now is for a 2025 gross profit of $10.2 billion. The company has solid 14% growth in this key metric, while adjusted operating income is hitting $2 billion with a 20% margin. Block trades at 28x the forward EPS targets while the valuation dips to just over 20x EPS estimates for 2026. The big key here is that the consensus estimates forecast a nearly 39% boost to EPS in 2026 to reach $3.63 per share, while revenues are only forecast to grow 11%, and the company just missed Q2 EPS targets by a wide $0.06. Data by YCharts The fintech not pushing more into the massive crypto opportunities is very disappointing. Especially considering CEO Jack Dorsey is speculated as Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, yet Block hasn't really innovated in this area in a way to benefit the company. Back on the Q2 2025 earnings call, Mr. Dorsey seemed to suggest a business plan around driving Bitcoin as a currency, not really driving the business into building a crypto platform far beyond just bitcoin: And right now, stablecoins are predominantly used in a remittance use case. If they do become more payments oriented, we'll be there. I don't think right now that it makes sense for us to offer our own because I just don't think there's a huge differentiator above and beyond what exists and in my view, above and beyond what Bitcoin provides. Bitcoin still stands alone in it being entirely net new, and it has properties that none of these stablecoins have, which make it a better form of currency than the rest of them. It's certainly proven the case over 16 years as a store value. But our intention is to make sure that Bitcoin becomes the native currency of the Internet and that's used as everyday money. And we think it can get there very quickly. The stock generally fully prices in the growth opportunities ahead without a crypto driver. Since Block is only pushing towards bitcoin as a payment tool to replace existing payment options, the driver of the business is the growth in Square and Cash App payment volumes, not really any new platform expansion of the TAM. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Block is fully valued for the growth targets of the maturing business. Investors should expect market-like returns over the short term.",XYZ,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-22 18:06:35

Overview Cryptocurrency Internet Computer Token ICP Price $5.50 Market Cap $2.95B Trading Volume $80.99M Circulating Supply 536.26 ICP All-time High $750.73 (May 10, 2021) All-time Low $2.86 (Sep 2023) 24-h High $5.52 24-h Low $4.95 Internet Computer Network technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day period) 4.18% 14-Day RSI 42.36 50-Day SMA $5.45 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $6.06 Internet Computer price analysis TL;DR Breakdown ICP demonstrates strong recovery with decisive break above recent resistance levels, targeting $5.70-$6.00. The $5.20-$5.30 zone now acts as solid support following the successful bounce from $4.90 lows. ICP 1-day price analysis ICP’s daily chart as of August 22 reveals a strong bullish recovery with the token currently trading at $5.469, up 7.34% on the day. The price has bounced decisively from the $4.90 low area and is now challenging the middle Bollinger Band around $5.40-$5.50, indicating a shift from oversold conditions back toward neutral territory. ICPUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD shows early signs of bullish divergence with the histogram beginning to compress from deeply negative levels, while the signal line appears to be forming a potential bottom formation. Volume analysis shows the recent green candle produced significant buying interest at 15.49M, suggesting accumulation during the recovery phase rather than mere short covering. ICP 4-hour price analysis The 4-hour chart shows ICP breaking above the descending trendline resistance and establishing higher lows throughout the recent session. The green candle that pushed the token from approximately $4.90 to $5.50 represents a 12%+ intraday move with substantial volume backing, indicating genuine buying interest rather. ICPUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView The Alligator indicator shows the lines beginning to converge and potentially flip bullish, while the RSI at 44.57 provides plenty of room for upward movement. The On-Balance Volume surge to -40.98M represents a significant improvement from more negative readings, suggesting the selling pressure diminishes while buying interest accelerates. ICP technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $5.01 BUY SMA 5 $5.24 BUY SMA 10 $5.46 SELL SMA 21 $5.43 BUY SMA 50 $5.45 SELL SMA 100 $5.40 BUY SMA 200 $6.06 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $5.38 BUY EMA 5 $5.36 BUY EMA 10 $5.29 BUY EMA 21 $5.29 BUY EMA 50 $5.71 SELL EMA 100 $6.65 SELL EMA 200 $7.73 SELL What to expect from ICP price analysis ICP appears positioned for continued upside toward the $5.70-$6.00 resistance zone over the next 24-48 hours. The combination of a strong bounce from support, improving MACD dynamics, and substantial volume backing suggests the recent low around $4.90 may have marked a significant bottom. The key will be maintaining momentum above $5.30 support while targeting a test of the upper Bollinger Band around $5.90, making this a potentially significant reversal point for medium-term bullish continuation.

While this marks a pivotal step in mainstream adoption, caution should be exerted, as centralization was not the original idea conceived in the whitepaper. History Being Made The on-chain analysis platform shared its latest report, highlighting a monumental feat achieved by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF. Launched in January of last year, the exchange-traded fund has amassed over 781,000 bitcoins, a staggering amount equivalent to more than $88 billion, considering the asset’s current price of around $113,000. According to CryptoQuant’s data, the ETF has been leading the accumulation charge since May 2025, when it surpassed the stash held on Coinbase. As August came around, the lead was solidified, making the fund the largest holder of Bitcoin, with only the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet holding more. Source: CryptoQuant The latest readings show a significant lead over Coinbase, and even Binance remains behind, with the exchanges owning over 703,000 and 558,000 units, respectively. The investment company’s fund has even surpassed the gargantuan Bitcoin treasury company Strategy, as according to the latest data from BitcoinTreasuries, it currently has 629,376 bitcoins , valued at around $71 billion, considering the prices at the time of writing. What makes BlackRock’s achievement even more impressive is that the behemoth managed to overthrow the Saylor-led company’s 5-year accumulation lead in just a year and a half, showcasing the rapidly accelerating institutional adoption of the leading crypto asset. What Does This All Mean? The unrelenting inflows into the ETF indicate a significant shift in the market. The main driver of demand is no longer limited to retail exchanges and seasoned investors, but is now shifting to regulated financial products tailored to organizations. The constant buying pressure from the IBIT fund is creating an ever-increasing supply shock, as the capital from the ETF is, for the most part, removed from circulation, compared to exchanges that use their reserves for trading. This provides strong support for the price, as the available supply drops. This signals a behavioral change for investors as well, as the santiment towards more traditional and compliant funds increases. As holdings in prominent exchanges decline, their usual role as a storehouse of assets makes room for institutional demand. While this marks a new chapter for the OG crypto, which has undergone a remarkable journey since it came to light in 2009, this corporational centralization goes against its ethos. It is unclear what effect this may have going forward, so continuous monitoring will be crucial in maintaining the balance.
