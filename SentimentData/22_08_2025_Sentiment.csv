While many investors remain cautious about the possibility of a prolonged correction, Fencer projects strong growth for several top tokens by the end of 2025, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin (BNB), and XRP. BNB Could Approach $3,300 In his latest forecast , Fencer stated that Binance Coin has the potential to rise to a range of $2,800 to $3,300 before the close of 2025. At the time of his analysis, BNB was trading near $833, reflecting a minor daily decline of 1.2% but a year-over-year increase of 46%. My Q4 2025 targets: $BTC : $215K – $230K $ETH : $9K – $12K $BNB : $2.8K – $3.3K $SOL : $800 – $900 $XRP : $8.5 – $9 $DOGE : $1 – $2.5 $LINK : $250 – $400 $ENA : $2 – $3 $PENGU : $0.7 – $1 #FARTCOIN : $4.5 – $6.5 If this looks crazy to you, You're a fool — Rekt Fencer (@rektfencer) August 19, 2025 Only days earlier, the asset had established a new all-time high of $848, joining a limited group of cryptocurrencies to achieve fresh records in the current market cycle. To reach the upper end of Fencer’s target, BNB would need to increase more than fourfold from its present price. Such a rally would lift its market capitalization to nearly $500 billion, a level that would place it among the world’s largest publicly traded companies, rivaling firms such as Mastercard and Netflix. XRP Outlook Between $8.50 and $9 Fencer also highlighted XRP, setting an end-of-year price target of $8.50 to $9 . The token is presently trading around $2.90 , reflecting a daily increase of 0.36%. Unlike BNB, XRP has not yet surpassed its historic peak but did record a multi-year high of $3.66 in July. Achieving Fencer’s projected range would mark a threefold increase from current levels and would push XRP’s market capitalization above $530 billion, approaching Ethereum’s highest historical valuations. While this estimate is bullish, it remains moderate compared to predictions from other analysts. For example, Alex Cobb has suggested that XRP could rise to $22 in December, while more extreme projections place its potential year-end value between $50 and $99. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bitcoin and Ethereum Price Targets Fencer’s broader market outlook includes significant gains for Bitcoin and Ethereum. He forecasts Bitcoin reaching between $215,000 and $230,000 by the fourth quarter of 2025. At present, Bitcoin trades near $113,138, below its recent peak of $124,400. For Ethereum, Fencer anticipates a price range of $9,000 to $12,000. This aligns with forecasts from other bullish commentators, including Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has suggested Ethereum could reach $15,000 by the end of the year. The asset currently trades at approximately $4,281 Predictions for Solana, Dogecoin, and Other Assets Fencer’s projections extend beyond the most widely followed cryptocurrencies. He expects Solana to trade between $800 and $900, representing a more than fourfold increase from current levels. For Dogecoin, he anticipates a price between $1 and $2.50, a milestone that would mark its highest valuation to date. Chainlink is also on his list, with a projected value of $250 to $400 compared to its current trading price of around $24. In addition, Fencer included smaller projects in his analysis, predicting ENA could climb to $2–$3, PENGU to $0.70–$1, and FARTCOIN to $4.50–$6.50. Fencer’s outlook reflects continued optimism among crypto analysts who believe that leading digital assets are positioned for significant growth despite short-term market fluctuations. While his projections for XRP, BNB, Bitcoin, and Ethereum suggest substantial upside, they also highlight the speculative nature of the market, where expectations can vary widely.

Hwang has admitted to using 4.3 billion won ($3.1 million) worth of funds belonging to her entertainment agency to buy cryptoassets in 2022. Hwang Jung-eum: Crypto Charges Prosecutors claim that the star also took out an 800 million won ($571,866) loan in July 2022 under the same company’s name.

(Source: MBC/Screenshot) They told a branch of the Jeju District Court that Hwang then sent most of these funds to her personal bank account, and then used this money to buy crypto. Prosecutors presented evidence that she made over a dozen similar transactions in 2022, repeatedly using company money to buy coins. They also accused Hwang of using company funds to pay her bills, including property levies and local taxes. Her defence team asked the court for leniency, claiming that she had since sold her assets to pay the company back. The court is set to reconvene in late September for sentencing. Hwang shot to fame in the late 2000s when she appeared in the hit MBC sitcom High Kick Through The Roof . She has also appeared in more recent hit dramas, such as Kill Me, Heal Me (2015) and The Escape of the Seven (2023–2024).

Hwang apologized and said she had had “reflected” on her actions.” Hwang’s defense team also asked the court to consider the fact that the company is question was a one-person agency. A lawyer told the court: “The defendant created the company to manage her own entertainment industry activities. She owns 100% of the shares, and no other entertainers are affiliated with it.” The lawyer added that Hwang had shown “immaturity.” But the attorney said the actress was “deeply reflecting” on the nature of her wrongdoings.

Since its launch in September 2024, Coinbase’s innovative synthetic Bitcoin product, cbBTC , has achieved remarkable growth. This surge marks a pivotal moment, especially as its counterpart, wBTC, experiences a notable decline. What is cbBTC and Why is it Expanding Rapidly? cbBTC , a synthetic Bitcoin product offered by Coinbase, allows users to access Bitcoin’s value within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Launched in September 2024, its journey has been nothing short of impressive. According to data from The Block, cbBTC has grown from a modest 1,000 tokens to more than 30,500 tokens. This represents an astonishing increase of over 160% year to date. Several factors contribute to this rapid expansion: Institutional Backing: As a product from Coinbase, a regulated and trusted exchange, cbBTC likely benefits from institutional confidence and easier access for larger players. Ease of Access: Coinbase’s extensive user base and streamlined integration could be making it simpler for users to acquire and utilize cbBTC within supported DeFi protocols. Market Demand: There is a clear and growing demand for Bitcoin exposure within DeFi, and cbBTC is effectively capturing a significant portion of this market. Is wBTC Losing Its Dominance? The Shifting Landscape In stark contrast to cbBTC ’s ascent, Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC), which has long been the largest synthetic Bitcoin product on Ethereum, is facing a significant challenge. Since the debut of cbBTC , wBTC’s supply has fallen by 17%. Furthermore, its supply is down 4% so far this year. This decline signals a potential shift in the synthetic Bitcoin market dynamics. Why might wBTC be experiencing this downturn? Competition: The emergence of strong competitors like cbBTC naturally fragments the market. Market Sentiment: Broader market trends and user preferences may be influencing the choice between different synthetic Bitcoin options. Centralization Debates: While wBTC has its own centralized aspects, the discussion around centralization in general could be leading some users to explore newer alternatives or reconsider their holdings. Understanding the Centralization Concerns Around cbBTC Despite its impressive growth, cbBTC has not been without its critics. Concerns regarding its centralization and transparency have drawn considerable scrutiny. Prominent figures, including Tron founder Justin Sun, have voiced warnings that cbBTC could pose significant risks to the broader decentralized finance ecosystem. The core of these concerns revolves around: Single Point of Failure: As a product managed by a single entity (Coinbase), critics argue it introduces a centralized risk that goes against the ethos of decentralization. Transparency: Questions arise about the real-time auditing and collateralization mechanisms, which might not be as transparent as some fully decentralized alternatives. Regulatory Influence: A centralized issuer like Coinbase is subject to regulatory pressures, which could, in theory, impact the availability or functionality of cbBTC . These discussions highlight the ongoing tension between institutional involvement and the foundational principles of DeFi. What Does cbBTC’s Expansion Mean for Your Portfolio? The rapid expansion of cbBTC and the concurrent decline of wBTC signal a dynamic and evolving landscape for synthetic Bitcoin. For investors and DeFi participants, understanding these shifts is crucial. While cbBTC offers a new avenue for Bitcoin exposure within DeFi, it also brings a different risk profile compared to more decentralized options. Consider these actionable insights: Diversify: Do not put all your synthetic Bitcoin exposure into one product. Explore different options and understand their underlying mechanisms. Assess Risk: Evaluate the centralization risks associated with cbBTC and how they align with your personal risk tolerance. Stay Informed: The synthetic asset space is constantly changing. Keep abreast of new developments, regulatory changes, and community discussions surrounding these products. The rise of cbBTC is undeniably a major development, showcasing Coinbase’s growing influence in the DeFi space. The cryptocurrency market is always evolving, and the story of cbBTC versus wBTC is a compelling example of innovation meeting traditional structures. While cbBTC ’s impressive growth underscores a strong demand for institutionally-backed synthetic assets, the critical discussions around centralization are vital. As the DeFi ecosystem matures, the balance between accessibility, trust, and true decentralization will continue to shape the future of products like cbBTC . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a synthetic Bitcoin product like cbBTC? A1: A synthetic Bitcoin product is a token that represents the value of Bitcoin on another blockchain, typically Ethereum. It allows Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi activities without directly moving their native BTC, which operates on its own blockchain. Q2: How does cbBTC differ from wBTC? A2: Both are synthetic Bitcoin tokens, but cbBTC is issued and managed by Coinbase, a centralized exchange, while wBTC is a more community-driven initiative backed by a consortium of custodians and merchants. This difference often leads to varying levels of centralization and transparency. Q3: Why are there concerns about cbBTC’s centralization? A3: Critics argue that because Coinbase controls the issuance and redemption of cbBTC , it introduces a single point of control and potential failure. This goes against the decentralized nature of many DeFi protocols and could lead to censorship or asset freezing under certain circumstances. Q4: What are the benefits of using cbBTC in DeFi? A4: Benefits include leveraging Coinbase’s brand trust and regulatory compliance, potentially lower fees for Coinbase users, and seamless integration within Coinbase’s ecosystem. It offers a straightforward way for their users to get Bitcoin exposure in DeFi. Q5: Should I be worried about wBTC’s decline? A5: While wBTC’s supply has decreased, it remains a significant asset in DeFi. Its decline relative to cbBTC suggests a shift in market preference or new competition, rather than an inherent failure of wBTC itself. Users should always assess their own risk tolerance and diversification strategies. Q6: How does cbBTC impact the overall DeFi ecosystem? A6: cbBTC ‘s growth brings more institutional liquidity and users into DeFi, which can be beneficial. However, it also intensifies the debate around centralization and the role of large entities in a decentralized space, potentially influencing how future DeFi protocols are designed and adopted.

50466986,562109,1755820825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50466986.jpeg,"Bitcoin HODLers Have Already Realized More Profit Than Last Cycle, Report Reveals",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hodlers-realized-profit-last-cycle-report/,"A report from Glassnode suggests Bitcoin long-term holders have already realized more profit this cycle than in most of the previous ones. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Profit-Taking Could Hint At Late-Stage Bull Phase In its latest weekly report, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has discussed how the cumulative profit taken by the long-term holders (LTHs) has looked in the current cycle so far. The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days. Statistically, the longer a holder keeps their coins dormant, the less likely they are to move/sell them in the future. As such, the LTHs with their relatively long holding time are made up of the diamond hands of the market. Though while this cohort does tend to sit silent for long stretches, it doesn’t mean its members don’t participate in selling ever. Thanks to their patience, the LTHs rack up large gains over the course of a cycle, and eventually, there comes a point where the temptation of profit-taking is too much for even these resolute hands to ward off. Peaks in their profit realization have historically defined the extreme phase of the cycle. As such, it can be worth tracking how much profit these holders are taking. One way to do so is through the Realized Profit indicator. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the cumulative Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit starting from when BTC set a new all-time high (ATH) in each cycle, to the cycle’s final peak. The reason the analytics firm has picked the first ATH breakout as the start point is that these HODLers typically only ramp up their profit-taking around then. The bull run continues as long as enough demand is coming in to absorb their selling, and once inflows run out, the cycle hits its peak. From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin LTH Realized Profit has totaled 3.27 million BTC in the current cycle so far. This is more than all previous cycles, except for the 2017 bull run. The trend could be a potential hint that the cryptocurrency is in the late stage of its current cycle. Another metric that could point to a similar conclusion is the Percent Supply in Profit . As displayed in the chart, the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit has exceeded a value one standard deviation above its mean on 273 days in this cycle. This is the second-highest on record, with the 2016-2018 cycle once again being the only one with more. While both of these metrics support the idea of Bitcoin being in an extreme phase, there still remains the possibility that the current cycle will simply turn out to be different from the previous ones. As such, it only remains to be seen how things play out from here. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $113,400, down almost 4% over the past week.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin HODLers|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin Realized Profit|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 00:00:25

But the real engine that drives a blockchain’s success is often its ability to pull in and retain developers. BlockDAG is nailing this aspect, shaping a space where coders, builders, and innovators can thrive. The chain’s toolkit includes detailed documentation, strong SDKs and APIs, plus a generous grants initiative that empowers developers to create dApps, NFTs, and DeFi platforms with ease. Add to that a presale tally that has already surged past $379M, more than 25 billion coins sold, and an ROI of 2,660% from batch 1 to batch 29’s price of $0.0276, and the excitement is hard to ignore. BlockDAG Makes Coding Simple and Scalable At the center of BlockDAG’s expansion is its focus on giving developers the smoothest path possible. Its extensive documentation lays out everything from smart contract deployment to advanced DeFi structures. SDKs and APIs provide ready-made tools and plug-ins, letting coders skip repetitive work and instead highlight what makes their projects stand out. This streamlined support system is one reason BlockDAG is showing up in bullish crypto discussions everywhere. Developers can jump in and build without roadblocks, which means projects launch faster, adoption widens, and the overall ecosystem grows stronger. In blockchain, having an active builder base often pushes growth just as much as tokenomics or marketing, and BlockDAG is putting that belief into practice. By focusing on real usability rather than hype, it creates a cycle where each new project brings more users, and each wave of users fuels fresh opportunities for builders. Turning Ambition Into Reality with BlockDAG Rewards Tools make life easier, but incentives are what move ideas into reality. BlockDAG’s well-structured grants program is designed to back ambitious builders from day one. Whether the goal is a DeFi platform, a cross-chain NFT marketplace, or a new gaming project, the program helps fuel creation by providing essential support. These initiatives also open direct revenue channels for developers. Projects on BlockDAG can earn through transaction activity, project launches, and ecosystem rewards, making it worthwhile to keep building. This alignment between creators and the platform echoes what’s often seen in strong bullish crypto stories, where those who build early are positioned to benefit most from the network’s growth. On top of this, grants encourage experimentation, allowing devs to take risks on fresh concepts without the fear of limited resources, which often sparks breakthrough projects that capture attention across the crypto space. Why Devs Trust BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum Developer interest usually reflects community enthusiasm, and BlockDAG’s presale performance is proof of that. The project has already raised $379M, sold 25 billion coins, and reached batch 29 with a price of $0.0276. Since the very first batch, early buyers have already seen a gain of 2,660%, while the confirmed launch price sits at $0.05. For developers, these milestones signal three things: future liquidity is lined up, there’s a large holder base who could become users of their apps, and the project has deep financial resources to keep scaling its tech. That combination makes BlockDAG more than a blockchain startup, it’s a developer-driven hub with the backing to emerge as one of the standout bullish cryptos in the coming cycle. Strong presale momentum also sends a message of stability, showing that the platform has both the attention and support needed to sustain its ambitious roadmap. Looking Ahead The BlockDAG blueprint shows that the real key to becoming the next bullish crypto isn’t hype, it’s building the right framework. With high-quality dev tools, a grants program fueling creativity, and a record-breaking presale, the chain is laying down the pillars of lasting growth. Builders gain access to resources and monetization opportunities, coin holders see a growing ecosystem that drives real usage, and the entire network benefits from an expanding base of applications. Thanks to this developer-first approach, BlockDAG isn’t just gathering attention; it’s gearing up to lead the next era of blockchain adoption and long-term value creation.

The Cardano (ADA) market forecast has shifted bullish after Grayscale’s ETF filing, with potential for a 50–60% rally if technical resistance breaks. At the same time, the Pepe (PEPE) market trend shows a 4–5% dip, yet whales are quietly stacking tokens, a strong sign of confidence. Amid these moves, a different story is unfolding. Cold Wallet is gaining attention for its utility-first approach, offering investors a product with real-world value. In a market driven by memes and speculation, genuine usability may prove to be the best new crypto to buy . Cardano (ADA) Market Forecast: ETF Filing Fuels Breakout Hopes The Cardano (ADA) market forecast is drawing headlines after Grayscale filed for an ADA Trust ETF. The coin recently broke a textbook double bottom pattern, clearing $0.86 resistance. Now trading around $0.99 and holding above its 20- and 50-day moving averages, ADA is showing momentum that could take it to $1.21, with a further push toward $1.50 possible. Analysts highlight how ETF filings boosted Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past, suggesting ADA could see a similar lift. Institutional demand and stronger investor confidence may act as long-term support. Beyond price action, Cardano continues to expand its smart contract ecosystem and improve performance through upgrades. Its academic foundation and evolving DeFi layers give it substance beyond charts, making ADA a serious contender when considering the best new crypto to buy . Pepe (PEPE) Market Trend: Whales Buying as Prices Slide Despite a 4–5% correction, the Pepe (PEPE) market trend shows signs of accumulation. Blockchain data reveals whale wallets on Ethereum boosted their PEPE holdings by 3.2% recently, while exchange balances dropped, clear signals of long-term confidence. Currently, PEPE trades in a range near $0.0000118 to $0.000012, struggling to break overhead resistance. Trading volume has eased, but large-scale buying by whales often precedes fresh breakouts. While PEPE remains highly volatile, its mix of retail exits and whale entry creates opportunities. Still, as an option for the best new crypto to buy , it depends heavily on sentiment cycles and whether big holders keep accumulating. Cold Wallet: Utility-Focused Approach Gains Traction While ADA and PEPE dominate headlines, Cold Wallet is building value on usability. The project offers a mobile-first self-custody wallet that rewards users with transaction-based cashback. Instead of speculative hype, it delivers real-world functionality. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, Cold Wallet has already raised more than $6.35 million. Each presale stage increases token price, creating scarcity while rewarding early adopters. The sign-up process is frictionless, no KYC, no delays. Users can swap, transfer, or bridge crypto instantly, weaving the wallet into their daily use. Loyalty comes from convenience and trust, not memes or hype. Looking ahead, the team plans to integrate Layer 2 solutions for gas-free rewards, making transactions smoother. Cold Wallet’s utility-first design positions it as a crypto with staying power. For those seeking the best new crypto to buy , its structured and practical model is a compelling option. Outlook Ahead The Cardano (ADA) market forecast benefits from ETF buzz and technical breakouts, offering strong potential for disciplined investors. The Pepe (PEPE) market trend remains a high-risk play, but whale accumulation points to speculative upside. Cold Wallet, however, presents a distinct alternative, one rooted in daily usability, structured presale growth, and a clear product roadmap. For investors focused on long-term value, it may be the best new crypto to buy , delivering a mix of clarity, structure, and real utility in a market often dominated by fleeting hype.

50464905,https://timestabloid.com/?p=79608,1755820855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple’s Escrow Could Soon Be Emptied. Here’s When,https://timestabloid.com/heres-when-ripples-escrow-could-be-emptied/,"Ripple’s escrow system , which was introduced to manage the controlled release of XRP into circulation, is gradually moving toward eventual depletion. Current data indicates that 35.6 billion XRP remains locked in escrow, and based on existing release patterns, analysts suggest the reserves may last less than a decade if the current pace is maintained. Escrow Background and Current Status In December 2017, Ripple placed more than 54 billion XRP into escrow accounts to regulate supply and prevent sudden market flooding. Under this framework, 1 billion XRP is scheduled for release each month . However, Ripple routinely locks back a large share of the released tokens, effectively reducing the net amount that enters circulation. As of August 2025, approximately 35.6 billion XRP is still locked across Ripple-controlled escrow wallets, collectively valued at around $106.8 billion. This figure marks a substantial drawdown from the original allocation, underscoring the steady pace at which the reserves are being used. Release and Re-Lock Activity in 2025 Ripple’s transactions in 2025 show a relatively consistent trend. Between January and August, the company executed its standard release of 1 billion XRP each month. Of this amount, 700 million XRP was typically re-locked, leaving 300 million XRP available for use. The only deviation occurred in June, when 670 million XRP was returned to escrow, resulting in a slightly higher net usage of 330 million XRP for that month. This pattern suggests that Ripple is drawing down approximately 300 million XRP monthly, which provides a clear basis for projecting when the reserves might run out under different scenarios. Depletion Projections Analysis from the tracking account “XRP Liquidity,” which monitors Ripple’s escrow behavior, offers multiple timelines based on varying release patterns; if Ripple continues its current pace of utilizing about 300 million XRP per month, the escrow could be fully depleted in roughly 9 years and 8 months, placing the end date near 2035. After September’s re-locking, the balance will fall to approximately 35.3 billion XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 If monthly usage rises to 400 million XRP, the reserves would not last as long, with projections showing depletion in about 7.5 years, around 2033. Similarly, if Ripple halted all re-locking, the pace would accelerate significantly. In this scenario, 12 billion XRP would enter circulation annually, which would empty the escrow in only three years. These varying timelines highlight how changes in Ripple’s monthly decisions directly affect the long-term outlook for its controlled holdings. Ripple’s escrow mechanism remains a central focus for the XRP community, as it determines the pace at which new tokens are released into circulation. If the current release and re-lock pattern is maintained, the reserves could extend for nearly a decade. However, any increase in usage or a decision to retain more XRP in circulation would shorten the timeline considerably, with depletion possible in as little as three years. Given these dynamics, market participants continue to watch Ripple’s monthly escrow activity closely, viewing each release as an indicator of how long the company’s holdings will last and how supply conditions may evolve.

Related Reading: Panic Or Profit? Analyst Says XRP Below $3 Is A ‘Massive Blessing’ Leah Wald told members of the press she expects bitcoin to make a steep move before year end. Her baseline? The vaunted $175,000 mark – a price she called a conservative read compared to some loftier forecasts. The market has already surprised a lot of people — bitcoin hit about $124,000 recently — so big swings are not impossible. Institutional Interest Drives Momentum According to Wald, part of the push comes from big money moving in. She pointed to companies like BlackRock and high-profile investors such as Cathie Wood, and she referenced how comments from leaders like Larry Fink have shifted conversations. Those voices bring models and balance-sheet plans that, she said during a CNBC TV18 interview, support much higher price targets than people used to expect. The industry’s own scars are still visible. After the FTX collapse many firms were de-banked and trust took a hit. But Wald argues that the picture has changed: banks and asset managers are opening doors again, and that makes it easier for large managers to put serious capital into crypto. That doesn’t erase risk though, but it does change how big investors approach the market. Long-Term Bets Stay Very Ambitious Based on reports, some forecasts stretch far beyond this year. Wald mentioned projections showing bitcoin at $1 million by 2030, a level that would dwarf current prices. Those long-range calls are driven by assumptions about adoption, limited supply and the role bitcoin could play in institutional portfolios. Whether reality matches those models is another question. Shorter-term math matters too. If bitcoin were to reach $175,000 before year end, that would be a rapid climb from recent levels around $124,000. Traders and managers watching volatility know such moves can happen, but they also know the path is rarely straight. Expectations, flows, and news — all of it moves markets fast.

She sees a bigger change: mainstream finance is being rebuilt on blockchain tools, she said, and that shift is moving the conversation away from short-term trading toward how the system is built and run. Nation-states thinking about adoption and big asset managers planning custody services are part of that picture, she added, and those pieces matter for how prices form.

Wealthy families and their dedicated family offices are increasingly turning their attention to crypto investments . A recent Reuters report highlights this growing trend, signaling a new era for digital assets within traditional portfolios. This surge in interest isn’t random. It’s driven by evolving regulatory landscapes and a deeper understanding of the immense potential held by cryptocurrencies. This embrace suggests a move beyond mere speculation towards strategic portfolio diversification. Why Are Asian Family Offices Embracing Crypto Investments? Several factors are contributing to this notable pivot towards crypto investments . Regulatory developments, especially in the United States and Hong Kong, are playing a crucial role. Hong Kong’s new stablecoin law, for instance, provides a clearer framework, instilling confidence among institutional investors. This regulatory clarity helps demystify the asset class. It makes digital assets more accessible and less intimidating for traditional wealth managers. Consequently, more family offices feel secure enough to explore this new frontier. UBS, a leading global financial services firm, has observed this firsthand. They note that some overseas Chinese family offices are planning to allocate approximately 5% of their substantial portfolios to cryptocurrencies. This allocation, while seemingly modest, represents a significant vote of confidence given the sheer scale of wealth managed by these entities. It underscores a strategic move to diversify and capture growth opportunities in the digital realm. This isn’t just about chasing trends; it’s about long-term portfolio optimization. Evolving Strategies for Crypto Investments Initially, many of these wealthy investors approached the market cautiously. Industry observers point out that their journey into crypto investments often began with more regulated and familiar instruments, such as Bitcoin ETFs. These exchange-traded funds offered a convenient way to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. Investors could participate without directly holding the underlying asset, providing a lower-risk entry point. However, as comfort levels and understanding have grown, a noticeable shift is occurring. Many are now moving beyond ETFs towards direct token holdings. This transition suggests a deeper commitment and a desire for greater control and potential returns. Furthermore, some sophisticated family offices are adopting market-neutral strategies, like arbitrage. These strategies aim to profit from price discrepancies across different exchanges or markets. They minimize exposure to overall market volatility while still actively engaging with digital assets. The Impact of Increased Crypto Investments on Market Activity This surge in interest from Asian family offices coincides with a noticeable uptick in overall cryptocurrency trading activity across the region. The numbers speak volumes, showcasing robust market growth: Hong Kong’s HashKey Exchange: Recorded an impressive 85% year-on-year rise in users by August 2025, indicating robust growth in participation. South Korea’s Major Exchanges: Posted a substantial 17% gain in trading volumes , reflecting increased liquidity and investor engagement. Average Daily Trading: Across the board, average daily trading has seen more than 20% growth , showcasing a vibrant and active market. These figures demonstrate that the institutional embrace of crypto investments is not just theoretical. It’s translating into tangible market expansion and increased adoption. The growing user base and trading volumes create a more mature and liquid environment, which in turn attracts even more institutional capital. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investments? The increasing allocation of wealth from Asian family offices into crypto investments signals a pivotal moment for the digital asset space. It suggests a broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial portfolios. This trend could lead to several positive outcomes: Increased Stability: Larger capital inflows from long-term investors may help stabilize the often-volatile crypto market, reducing extreme price swings. Enhanced Legitimacy: The involvement of respected family offices adds significant credibility to the asset class, encouraging further institutional and retail adoption globally. Innovation and Development: More capital means more resources for blockchain innovation. This will lead to better infrastructure, enhanced security, and new, practical use cases for digital assets. This isn’t merely about a speculative gamble; it’s about strategic diversification. It’s also about recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. As regulations continue to evolve and understanding deepens, we can expect this trend to gain even more momentum, shaping the financial landscape for years to come. The strategic shift by Asian family offices towards significant crypto investments marks a powerful endorsement of digital assets. Driven by clearer regulations and a pursuit of diversification, this trend is reshaping how wealth is managed and grown across the region. Their cautious yet growing engagement, from initial Bitcoin ETFs to direct holdings and sophisticated arbitrage strategies, underscores a maturing market. This institutional embrace is not only boosting trading volumes but also solidifying the legitimacy and future potential of the cryptocurrency ecosystem globally. It’s clear: crypto is no longer a niche interest but a compelling, integral part of the modern investment portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How are Asian family offices investing in crypto? A1: They are starting with Bitcoin ETFs and moving towards direct token holdings.

Shares rose 4.5% in after-hours trading. The company said putting AI across its lineup and adding new services is supporting growth in its core meetings product while helping it move into new areas. Zoom, which saw a spike in users during COVID-19 lockdowns as meetings shifted online, raised guidance for the current fiscal year. Accordinf to Reuters , it now projects fiscal 2026 revenue of $4.83 billion to $4.84 billion, compared with a prior range of $4.80 billion to $4.81 billion. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of $5.81 to $5.84, up from $5.56 to $5.59. For the third quarter, Zoom forecast revenue of $1.21 billion to $1.22 billion, slightly ahead of the $1.21 billion average estimate from LSEG. For the second quarter ended July 31, revenue reached $1.22 billion versus expectations of $1.20 billion. Adjusted earnings were $1.53 a share, topping the $1.37 analysts had predicted. In June, Zoom introduced Virtual Agent 2.0, built on agentic AI, to handle tasks such as returns, account updates, and appointment booking without human help. In July, it rolled out more agentic AI features, including a Custom AI Companion add-on that lets small businesses use AI Companion with third-party video services like Google Meet. Zoom Virtual Agent for phone support can replace receptionists This week Zoom introduced Virtual Agent for Zoom Phone, a 24/7 AI concierge that can replace receptionists. The tool is meant to greet callers in natural language, fulfill requests, and trigger follow-up steps to cut missed calls and wait times. At launch, it supports English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, and Japanese, with more languages planned. Zoom said the Virtual Agent can route calls on its own so customers move toward a solution without a person answering. Zoom describes the Virtual Agent as an AI receptionist. “By combining AI that can listen, understand, and take action with the reach of Zoom Phone, our concierge virtual agent provides seamless and personalized support to all callers,” Chief Product Officer Smita Hashim said. The company said organizations can set it up without code by training the agent with existing documents or by pointing it to a website. “The result is a faster, more personalized, and more scalable experience for everyone,” Hashim added. Examples cited by Zoom include booking visits in healthcare, checking stock and answering product questions in retail, and sending updates in financial services.

It operates on a simple principle: when investors are too fearful, it could signal a buying opportunity. Conversely, when they are excessively greedy, it might indicate that a correction is imminent. This index ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 representing “extreme fear” and 100 indicating “extreme greed.” A score of 50, as we see currently, places the market squarely in the “Neutral” zone. This suggests a period where neither fear nor greed dominates investor decisions. It’s a moment of equilibrium, where market participants are perhaps taking a pause, waiting for clearer signals, or simply reacting to existing data without strong emotional bias. Understanding this balance is key to making informed decisions. Decoding a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index A neutral reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index can be interpreted in several ways. It’s not necessarily a call to action, but rather an indication of the current market psychology. Here’s what it could imply: Market Indecision: Investors might be unsure about the next major price movement, leading to sideways trading. Balanced Forces: Buying and selling pressures are relatively equal, preventing significant swings in either direction. Waiting for Catalysts: The market could be anticipating a major news event, regulatory update, or technological development that will break the deadlock. Reduced Volatility: A neutral stance often accompanies periods of lower volatility, which can be a relief after intense price fluctuations. For savvy investors, a neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a chance to re-evaluate portfolios and strategies without the emotional pressure of extreme market conditions. It’s an opportunity to conduct thorough research and plan for potential future shifts. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The methodology behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is robust, incorporating a blend of factors to provide a comprehensive view of market sentiment. Alternative, the platform behind the index, considers six distinct components, each weighted differently: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum with long-term averages. High buying volume in a strong market suggests greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the number of cryptocurrency-related hashtags and interactions on various social media platforms, along with the speed of these interactions. Increased positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: Surveys are currently paused, impacting this component’s contribution.) Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. A rising Bitcoin dominance often signals fear in altcoin markets as investors flock to the perceived safety of BTC. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in “Bitcoin price manipulation” searches, for example, might suggest fear. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to offer a holistic and objective measure of the market’s emotional temperature, helping to cut through the noise. Navigating Market Sentiment with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool, it’s essential to use it as part of a broader analytical framework. It provides insight into sentiment, but it does not predict future price movements with certainty. Investors should consider it alongside fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and macroeconomic factors. For example, during a neutral phase, you might choose to: Refine your Watchlist: Identify promising projects that are consolidating. Educate Yourself: Use this calmer period to deepen your understanding of blockchain technology and new crypto innovations. Dollar-Cost Average: Continue your regular investment schedule, taking advantage of potentially stable prices. Manage Risk: Re-evaluate your stop-loss orders and portfolio allocation. The index is a powerful indicator of human psychology in action, reminding us that emotions often drive market behavior. A neutral reading simply means that for now, the crowd is holding its breath. In Summary: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 50, in its neutral stance, offers a moment of calm in the often-turbulent crypto seas. It’s a period of equilibrium, reflecting balanced market sentiment rather than extreme fear or greed. While not a standalone investment guide, it serves as a crucial indicator, helping investors understand the collective psychology of the market. Use this insight to make rational, data-driven decisions, rather than being swayed by fleeting emotions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A1: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the prevailing emotional sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). Q2: How should I interpret a “Neutral” reading of 50 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A2: A “Neutral” reading of 50 indicates a balanced market where neither fear nor greed is dominant. It suggests indecision among investors and often precedes periods of consolidation or anticipation for new catalysts. Q3: What are the main factors used to calculate the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A3: The index considers six factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data. Q4: Can the Crypto Fear & Greed Index predict future price movements? A4: No, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a predictive tool. It reflects current market psychology but should be used in conjunction with other analytical methods for making investment decisions. Q5: Where can I find the latest Crypto Fear & Greed Index value? A5: The latest value of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is typically provided by platforms like Alternative.me and is often cited by cryptocurrency news outlets.

A massive Bitcoin options expiration is looming on August 22, involving a staggering $3.8 billion worth of BTC options. This isn’t just a number; it’s a market dynamic that could influence Bitcoin’s price action and broader crypto sentiment. Understanding these expiries is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset landscape. What’s Happening with Bitcoin Options Expiration? On August 22, precisely at 08:00 UTC, a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) options will reach their maturity. Data from Deribit, a leading crypto options exchange, highlights the scale of this event. Total Value: Nearly $3.8 billion in Bitcoin options are set to expire. Put/Call Ratio: This stands at 1.30. A ratio above 1 suggests more put options (bets on price going down) than call options (bets on price going up), indicating a potentially bearish sentiment among traders for this expiry. Max Pain Price: For Bitcoin, the max pain price is currently $118,000. This confluence of factors creates a fascinating scenario for market observers. However, Bitcoin isn’t the only asset in the spotlight. Ethereum’s Max Pain and Options Expiry Alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) also faces a considerable options expiry on the very same day. Approximately $930 million worth of ETH options will mature. Put/Call Ratio: Ethereum’s ratio is 0.83. Unlike Bitcoin, this ratio is below 1, indicating a slightly more bullish or balanced sentiment among ETH options traders for this specific expiry. Max Pain Price: The max pain price for Ethereum is $4,250. Understanding the “max pain price” is vital to grasp the potential implications of these expiries. Demystifying Max Pain Price in Crypto Options The term “max pain price” might sound intimidating, but its concept is quite straightforward. It refers to the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, causing the maximum financial loss for options holders. Conversely, this often translates to maximum profit for options writers (those who sold the options). Here’s a simpler way to look at it: For Buyers: If the price settles at max pain, most options buyers lose their premium. For Sellers (Writers): This is where options sellers make the most profit. Therefore, some analysts believe that market makers and large institutions, who often write options, might try to steer the price towards this point as expiration nears. However, it’s important to remember that max pain is a theoretical point and not a guaranteed outcome. What Could This Bitcoin Options Expiration Mean for the Market? The sheer volume of this Bitcoin options expiration suggests potential volatility. While the market doesn’t always gravitate precisely to the max pain price, it can act as a magnet, especially in less liquid markets or during periods of low trading volume. Consider these potential impacts: Increased Volatility: As traders adjust positions, close contracts, or hedge, price swings can occur. Price Convergence: There might be a tendency for prices to move closer to the max pain level in the hours leading up to expiry. Market Sentiment: A high put/call ratio, like Bitcoin’s 1.30, could signal underlying bearish sentiment, but it also reflects hedging strategies. It’s crucial for traders to monitor price action and volume around the expiry time. However, it’s equally important to avoid making rash decisions based solely on options expiry data. The upcoming Bitcoin options expiration on August 22, coupled with the significant Ethereum expiry, marks a key date for crypto market participants. While the max pain price provides an interesting data point, it is just one factor among many influencing cryptocurrency prices. Smart traders will combine this information with broader market analysis, technical indicators, and fundamental news to make informed decisions. Stay vigilant, and remember that the crypto market is always full of surprises! Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Bitcoin options expiration? A Bitcoin options expiration is the date and time when Bitcoin options contracts cease to be valid. At this point, holders must decide whether to exercise their options or let them expire worthless, which can influence market dynamics. 2. What is the “max pain price” in crypto options? The “max pain price” is the strike price at which the largest number of options contracts will expire worthless, resulting in the maximum financial loss for the majority of options buyers. 3. How does the put/call ratio indicate market sentiment? The put/call ratio compares the volume of put options (bets on price decline) to call options (bets on price increase). A ratio above 1 typically suggests bearish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 can indicate bullish or neutral sentiment. 4. Will the Bitcoin options expiration definitely cause a price drop? Not necessarily. While options expiries can increase volatility and sometimes draw prices towards the max pain point, they are just one factor among many influencing market prices. Broader market sentiment, news, and technical analysis also play significant roles. 5. What should traders do around an options expiration event? Traders should monitor price action, trading volume, and market sentiment closely. It’s advisable to combine options data with other forms of analysis and avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on expiry information. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Originally issued in April 2022, the order cited Anchorage’s failure to meet federal standards for anti-money-laundering (AML) controls and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), pointing to shortcomings in its compliance program. After three years of remediation, the OCC confirmed that Anchorage has addressed those deficiencies. The regulator concluded that the bank is now secure, well-managed, and fully compliant with federal requirements. Regulators verify Anchorage resolved AML fissures The OCC’s discontinuance order emphasized that the consent decree against Anchorage Digital is unnecessary. The regulator said the bank’s compliance program now “satisfies the high expectations” required of any federally chartered institution. This comprises AML, customer credit report, and suspicious activity reporting controls. Anchorage responded with sweeping changes. The firm has hired compliance professionals with experience in both banking and digital assets. It hired outside experts to develop stronger frameworks. Sophisticated surveillance systems were rolled out to spot suspicious trading patterns, and automation tools became faster and better at reporting to overseers. Anchorage also ramped up staff training to ensure compliance obligations were understood at every level. Anchorage CEO Nathan McCauley described the OCC’s decision as a landmark for the digital asset industry. He said the bank had exceeded requirements by using the challenge to strengthen its systems. He added that Anchorage had turned regulatory feedback into a compliance success and now positioned itself as the world’s most regulated digital asset bank. The outcome underscores the difference between Anchorage and other crypto firms. Although Anchorage embraced federal oversight and strived to meet stringent standards, many such firms have resisted or wound up in court fights with U.S. regulators. Others have gone so far as to flee the country. Anchorage CEO said the firm deliberately chose the tougher path of seeking a federal charter and enduring years of regulatory scrutiny. He explained that while this route was not the easiest, it was meant to build trust with governments, customers, investors, and international partners, creating a foundation of safety and reliability that the crypto industry needs. Anchorage cements its crypto-banking lead Anchorage Digital made history in January 2021 when the OCC granted it the first national trust bank charter to a crypto native firm. Under the charter, Anchorage is authorized to carry digital assets on behalf of institutions in a way that traditional banks have long done for traditional assets. Today, Anchorage is the only U.S. digital asset bank with a complete banking charter. That puts it in a unique position within the industry when regulators are closely watching the wild market for digital currencies. The South Dakota firm offers custody, staking, trading, and governance services. In April 2025, the asset manager BlackRock chose Anchorage to safeguard some of the Bitcoin and Ethereum the firm owns for its spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). That only strengthened Anchorage’s standing with overseas investors. The reversal of Anchorage’s policy has accompanied broader regulatory clarity. May 2025 saw the OCC provide more clarity for national banks to hold, purchase, and sell crypto-assets and facilitate customer market access. That ruling spurred other companies, including Circle, Ripple, and Paxos, to seek federal charters similar to Anchorage’s. Just a few weeks ago, Anchorage Digital rolled out a new stablecoin issuance platform, naming Ethena Labs as its inaugural partner, according to an earlier report from Cryptopolitan . Through the partnership, Anchorage will bring Ethena’s stablecoin, USDtb, onshore to the United States and issue it via its federally chartered crypto bank. This marked the first time USDtb will be issued in the U.S.—and, according to the firms, the first stablecoin to launch with a defined compliance pathway under the recently enacted GENIUS Act, which sets regulatory standards for stablecoin operations in America. The OCC’s decision to end the order is generally considered a sign of a change of direction in U.S. crypto policy. Regulators are likelier to permit a compliant company to operate under federal supervision than force it offshore. Anchorage is a story of what it takes to succeed here. The bank also had to increase the size of its compliance program and spend heavily on surveillance to convince regulators that it could do business on the same level as other banks.

Here are the top 5 best altcoins to buy now , featuring MAGACOIN FINANCE , Ethereum , TRX , and two other trending altcoins with strong fundamentals. MAGACOIN FINANCE Leading the list of the best altcoins to buy is MAGACOIN FINANCE —a fast-growing presale project gaining major traction across the crypto community.

Growing institutional interest is positioning ETH as “digital oil.” Despite already being a top crypto, Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins to buy for long-term portfolio stability and explosive growth during market expansions.

Essentially, it provides dApps with more efficient speeds and lower transaction costs, however, the security is still maintained by Ethereum. On the off-chance Ethereum wanted to scale, Arbitrum would still be around to back it up. This would highlight the significance of the ARB token as one of the best alternative cryptos to invest in if you are seeking exposure to next-generation infrastructure. Polygon (POL) Formerly known as MATIC, Polygon (POL) is preparing for a major upgrade with the POL token migration . It’s the leading Layer-2 for mainstream partnerships, including Nike, Disney, Reddit , and more.

The index looks strong on the surface, because that small group of tech giants (you know, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms) are pulling all the weight harder than they ever have before. But the problem is those megacaps have grown so big that they now account for around one-third of the total value of the S&P 500. That’s seven companies distorting the signal of 500. For years, the index was considered a leading economic indicator, even used by the Conference Board in its 10-part Leading Economic Index. But now, that predictive function looks damaged. The rest of the market, the so-called “S&P 495,” has become the real indicator of what’s actually happening. Seven tech stocks pull the entire index higher So far in 2025, the S&P 500 has gained over 8%. But that number is a lie if you care about the broader market. The seven largest stocks in the index have risen more than 14% on average, and the median jump among them is above 20%. The other 493 companies? They’ve only managed an average and median rise of just over 5%. That gap shows how top-heavy the index has become. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which gives every stock the same importance, has dropped 0.1% this week. In the same time, the standard market cap-weighted index has lost more than 1%. Without the tech names dragging everything around, the picture changes. Sectors like energy, real estate, and health care, which have been underperforming all year, are finally ahead this week. Meanwhile, the same tech names that led the rally are underperforming. And it’s not just the S&P 500 that’s being distorted. The small-cap Russell 2000 index, which had been stuck with a small 1.6% gain all year, has jumped 2.5% in August. That beats the S&P 500, which gained less than 1% in the same period. If macro conditions improve or if the Fed begins to cut rates, smaller, more debt-heavy firms could move faster. But because the S&P 500 is so tilted toward big tech, those changes might not register in the index, any broader economic recovery could be invisible in the benchmark. And right now, Wall Street isn’t immune. On Thursday, U.S. stock futures barely moved. Dow Jones futures went up by just 50 points. Futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 climbed about 0.1% each. That flatline followed five straight days of losses. The S&P 500 dropped 0.4%, Nasdaq slid 0.34%, and the Dow lost 152.81 points, or 0.34%. The trend is clear. The bull run is tired, and the megacap rally might be wearing thin. The signal is flashing, but it’s hard to tell if it’s a warning or just noise. Even individual stock stories are showing this instability. Mastercard’s stock pulled back to its 200-day moving average in June. Then it pushed back up. In recent weeks, it regained resistance and is now pushing against its all-time high around $595. It had already recovered all its Q1 losses by early May. After hitting a new record in early June, it once again dropped back down to the 200-day level. That’s where it stands now, testing the edge. Get seen where it counts.

The case targets a decision to set aside the local council’s ruling and allow a 90-megawatt facility on green belt land. Last year, Buckinghamshire Council refused permission for the project on green belt land. In UK planning, the green belt is open countryside where new buildings are tightly restricted to preserve space between towns. Developers wanted to put a large computing site there, but the authority said the scheme clashed with those rules. Data centers are vast buildings that hold banks of servers so companies can run cloud and other remote services. Demand for space has surged as firms race to build and train powerful new artificial intelligence systems, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Environmental groups are advocating against data centers in the UK Environmental groups warn that these facilities use huge amounts of electricity to operate around the clock. AI projects in particular have been criticized for heavy energy use, which can strain local grids and raise concerns over cooling water. The Buckinghamshire plan was twice rejected in earlier rounds. It returned under the Labour government, which says it wants the UK to become a leading global hub for artificial intelligence by boosting national computing capacity. In June 2024, the council again ruled the scheme would be “inappropriate” for the green belt and refused it. But last month, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner granted planning permission, reversing the local decision and clearing the way for construction. On Thursday, campaign groups Foxglove and Global Action Plan said they had filed a statutory planning review. They are asking a court to quash Rayner’s approval, saying the project would. The government has previously argued that strengthening data center infrastructure is vital if the UK is to compete globally in AI development. Thursday’s filing follows a January pledge by Prime Minister Keir Starmer to curb repeat legal challenges by so-called “Nimbys” against major infrastructure plans in England and Wales. Nimby is a term used for people who oppose works they see as unpleasant or risky in their area.

Understanding these cycles is crucial for any investor. Currently, the Altcoin Season Index , a key metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), indicates a clear shift, pointing towards what many call ‘Bitcoin Season’. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? On August 22, at 00:30 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a value of 42. This figure, reported by CoinMarketCap and previously noted by Bitcoin World, represents a slight dip from the previous day, signaling a strengthening Bitcoin dominance in the market. This index is a vital tool for understanding the broader market sentiment and asset performance. The Index’s Core Function: It assesses the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clearer picture of market dynamics. Defining Seasons: The index determines whether the market is in ‘Altcoin Season’ or ‘Bitcoin Season’ by comparing how these top coins have performed relative to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. How is Bitcoin Season Determined by the Altcoin Season Index? The methodology behind the Altcoin Season Index is straightforward yet powerful. It sets clear thresholds to define the prevailing market condition: Altcoin Season: This period is declared when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Think of it as a time when a wide array of alternative cryptocurrencies are seeing significant gains. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, we enter Bitcoin Season when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. The current index reading of 42 falls squarely into this category, confirming that Bitcoin is currently the dominant force. The index itself ranges from 1 to 100. A lower number suggests stronger Bitcoin dominance, while a higher number indicates altcoin outperformance. The current 42 clearly points to Bitcoin leading the pack. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: What Does it Mean for Investors? Understanding the implications of the current Bitcoin Season, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , is essential for informed decision-making. When Bitcoin dominates, it often means: Capital Flow: Investors may be consolidating their capital into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer or more stable asset during uncertain times, or anticipating a major Bitcoin price movement. Reduced Altcoin Volatility (Relative): While altcoins can still be volatile, their relative performance against Bitcoin tends to be weaker. They might not see the explosive growth characteristic of an Altcoin Season. Market Bellwether: Bitcoin’s price action often dictates the overall direction of the market. A strong Bitcoin run can sometimes precede a broader market recovery, eventually lifting altcoins. For those holding altcoins, this period might present challenges, as their portfolios may lag behind Bitcoin’s performance. However, it can also be an opportunity to reassess and strategize. Strategic Insights During Bitcoin Season When the Altcoin Season Index signals Bitcoin Season, investors can consider several approaches. This isn’t financial advice, but rather observations based on market trends: Focus on Bitcoin: Some investors may choose to increase their Bitcoin holdings, riding the wave of its dominance. Re-evaluate Altcoin Holdings: It might be a good time to review altcoin portfolios, perhaps divesting from weaker performers or projects with less fundamental strength. Research for Future Opportunities: Use this period to research promising altcoin projects that could thrive once the market sentiment shifts back towards altcoins. Strong fundamentals and innovative technology remain key. The market is cyclical, and understanding the signals from metrics like the Altcoin Season Index can provide a significant edge. While Bitcoin currently holds the reins, market conditions can change, and being prepared for future shifts is always wise. The Altcoin Season Index at 42 confirms that we are firmly in a Bitcoin Season. This means Bitcoin has been outperforming most of the top altcoins over the last 90 days. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, this metric offers a crucial snapshot of the market’s current state, guiding decisions and expectations. While the crypto landscape is ever-evolving, staying informed with reliable data from sources like CoinMarketCap allows participants to navigate these cycles with greater confidence and foresight. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric from CoinMarketCap that tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days to determine if the market is in ‘Altcoin Season’ or ‘Bitcoin Season’. Q2: How is Altcoin Season defined by the index? Altcoin Season occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Q3: What does an Altcoin Season Index of 42 signify? An index value of 42 indicates that 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days, meaning the market is currently in Bitcoin Season. Q4: What are the implications of a Bitcoin Season for altcoin holders? During Bitcoin Season, altcoins generally tend to underperform Bitcoin. This means altcoin portfolios might see less growth compared to Bitcoin, and capital may flow more towards Bitcoin as the dominant asset. Q5: How often does the Altcoin Season Index update? The Altcoin Season Index is updated regularly, providing a near real-time snapshot of market conditions, though the 90-day lookback period remains constant for its calculation.

Dogecoin has shown signs of stability, holding support near $0.19, and some traders believe this could mark the base for a bullish recovery. Its ability to maintain this level is being closely watched as momentum builds. Pi Network is also back in focus as its community looks for signs of revival. Efforts to strengthen the ecosystem are underway, but the project still faces questions about how quickly it can regain traction after a prolonged decline. In contrast, Cold Wallet ($CWT) is carving its place through real-world utility. It is not driven by short-term hype but by user engagement, turning everyday actions into value. With a model that prioritizes usability, Cold Wallet is positioning itself as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy right now, offering a vision of sustainability that could shape opportunity in 2025. Dogecoin Holds Support as Traders Watch for Breakout Dogecoin is sitting at a crucial level after dropping nearly 30% from its July highs. The $0.19 mark has become an important base, and how price reacts here could shape the coin’s next direction. Technical signals like RSI remain neutral, leaving room for a rebound if buyers step back in. A push above the $0.21 to $0.22 range would likely trigger momentum, especially if overall market sentiment turns positive. Still, Dogecoin’s long-term story continues to rely heavily on community enthusiasm and cultural relevance, leaving questions about whether it can build a stronger foundation beyond its meme coin identity. Pi Network Seeks Revival Through Ecosystem Upgrades Pi Network is working to rebuild momentum after an extended period of decline. Developers have announced upgrades aimed at strengthening infrastructure and re-engaging the community, sparking cautious optimism. Projections for PI’s value range from small rebounds under $0.10 to more ambitious calls near $0.60 if these updates gain traction and exchange listings arrive. Despite the potential, Pi remains in a speculative stage. Without mainnet functionality or reliable trading data, its current outlook depends as much on execution as on vision. For those searching for the best crypto to buy right now, Pi’s appeal lies in its promise, but uncertainty continues to weigh on long-term confidence. Cold Wallet Redefines Crypto With Real Utility Cold Wallet offers a very different story compared to DOGE and PI. Instead of relying on speculative cycles or development promises, it delivers real utility at the core of every interaction. The wallet rewards users for actions like swapping tokens, paying gas, or bridging assets, with each activity returning value in $CWT. This creates a system where engagement is consistently incentivized. What drives Cold Wallet forward is not only its cashback model but its dedication to practical use. Onboarding is immediate, with no KYC or email required, giving users full control of their keys the moment the app is downloaded. This focus on autonomy and simplicity fills a critical gap in an industry where complicated onboarding has often been a barrier to adoption. The mobile app also stands out for its design. Cold Wallet combines the sleek experience of modern mobile platforms with the security of self-custody. In a sector where most wallets feel outdated or overly technical, its clean interface provides accessibility without sacrificing functionality, making it appealing to both newcomers and experienced users. Backing this user-first model is a growing presale. Now in Stage 17 and priced at $0.00998, Cold Wallet has raised over $6.4 million while building a community around usability rather than hype. With a 150-stage structure that introduces scarcity, it creates strategic interest, yet its long-term appeal lies in everyday practicality. For those considering the best crypto to buy right now, Cold Wallet is positioning itself as more than a token. It is shaping up to be a tool for everyday financial routines. Market Takeaways Dogecoin continues to offer the quick upside potential of a meme coin, while Pi Network carries ambitious goals that depend heavily on execution and future milestones. Both have appeal for traders seeking speculative gains, but each comes with uncertainty tied to sentiment and delivery. Cold Wallet presents a different proposition. Its utility-first design turns every transaction into meaningful engagement, supported by a presale that is steadily gaining traction. By focusing on usability rather than hype, it positions itself as the best crypto to buy right now for those looking at long-term value.

Acting Chairman Caroline D. Pham announced an expanded “crypto sprint” to strengthen federal oversight of cryptocurrencies while safeguarding U.S. competitiveness in global finance. This move closely follows the commission’s prior action to allow the trading of listed digital-asset spot markets on registered futures exchanges. That decision, announced earlier this month, was seen as a turning point for the industry. Now the CFTC is expanding its lens beyond spot trading rules to the broader digital asset ecosystem. CFTC extends oversight to wider digital asset risks The agency’s focus, Pham said, is to ensure that crypto markets can function with the protections and integrity that undergird traditional financial markets. She said that trading of digital assets on the spot (cash) market is no longer a niche; it is the backbone of U.S. and international market activity. Pham said the new initiative was designed to ensure that the United States takes the lead in global digital finance. She explained that the CFTC’s broader oversight push represented what she described as the beginning of a “Golden Age of innovation.” According to her, this new phase would allow the crypto industry to grow under a clear and responsible regulation framework. She stressed that far from restricting progress, the commission’s approach was intended to create an environment where innovation could flourish while maintaining safeguards for market integrity and investor protection. CFTC’s plan follows the blueprint of the Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology, a report from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. The report lays out a plan to strike the right balance between innovation and sound supervision. It singles out potential sources of risk like leveraged, margin, and financed retail trading, which have the potential to leave investors with heavy losses if uncontrolled. In the increased sprint, the CFTC will now cover all of the advice provided in the report. That involves clarifying federal trading rules, beefing up compliance for exchanges, and working with other regulators to fill gaps in oversight. The SEC, the agency that oversees initial coin offerings and cryptocurrencies, is already collaborating with the CFTC through a campaign called “ Project Crypto .” Working in close coordination, the two agencies are trying to draw a line regarding the limits of their authority, even as they close ranks to influence how the United States governs the cryptocurrency industry. CFTC calls on the public to help shape rules There will be strong public involvement in designing the new regulatory regime. For the next 5 years, through October 20, 2025, the CFTC is soliciting comments from investors, industry experts, innovators, and the public via a formal comment period. Pham urged all stakeholders to work together, stressing that contributions from major financial institutions and smaller innovators would be vital in shaping fair and effective regulations. She emphasized that the commission was committed to listening carefully to feedback from across the sector. According to her, the CFTC’s goal was to develop a framework of rules to secure America’s leadership in digital markets while ensuring that consumer interests remained fully protected. The consultation period arrived as the White House, in the Trump administration, pushed for a big increase in U.S. leadership in digital finance. The administration has described crypto and blockchain technology as weapons of national competitiveness, evoking past eras of American dominance in internet and mobile technology. By launching the consultation, the CFTC says that industry views will shape the sector’s future. Such a step would also relieve crypto proponents’ concerns that heavy-handed regulation could stifle innovation.

Binance Coin (BNB) broke past $864 before cooling off, while Mantle (MNT) jumped 15% following whale accumulation and a Bybit staking rollout. But the real spotlight is on BlockDAG . Having already raised $379M, the project holds firm at its Batch 29 entry of $0.0276. Its Buyer Battles inject gamified competition, rewarding top daily buyers, while the upcoming BlockDAG Explorer provides on-chain clarity with real-time data visualization. With the $0.05 launch price confirmed, the presale continues to attract strong attention. The mix of transparent development, community features, and discounted entry is setting BlockDAG apart from both large-cap gains and short-term rallies. BNB Price Strength Supported by Macro Trends BNB has reignited enthusiasm across the crypto space. After Bitcoin surged past $124,000, Binance Coin touched a fresh peak at $864.50. Over the past week, it’s climbed 11.8%, with 26.2% growth this month and a 62.9% rise over the past year. These gains put BNB among the top-performing large caps. Its momentum has been fueled by easing macro conditions. Cooling inflation boosted expectations for rate cuts, which in turn supported higher-risk assets. Analysts at Hash Global now project BNB could eventually climb toward $2,039 if demand holds. Still, volatility lingers, particularly if Bitcoin faces September weakness, historically a tough month. While BNB’s outlook remains positive, its growth potential is limited to percentage gains. By contrast, presale opportunities such as BlockDAG, still priced at $0.0276, offer a more amplified path forward, making them a focal point for those seeking sharper moves. Bybit Partnership Fuels Mantle Price Rise Mantle has become a hot talking point after a 15% daily jump, lifting it to $1.36. The move was sparked by its partnership with Bybit, which introduced staking integration and new yield channels. On-chain data showed $9.78M in outflows from exchanges, reducing near-term selling pressure. Open Interest also rose 43% to $112M, reflecting a surge in leveraged speculation. Much of this momentum is linked to whale-led buying, which has built confidence but also creates the risk of sudden profit-taking. While analysts note strong near-term conditions, volatility remains a core factor in Mantle’s price action. Compared to BlockDAG’s structured presale, Mantle’s growth leans heavily on speculative trading rather than clear fundamentals. That makes BlockDAG’s approach, anchored by transparent features like the Explorer and competitive gamification, all the more attractive to those looking for projects with stronger utility foundations. Buyer Battles Keep BlockDAG Momentum High! BlockDAG’s presale has already crossed $379M, securing its spot among the largest early funding rounds of 2025. Batch 29 currently sits at $0.0276, while the confirmed launch price of $0.05 points to a near double for early participants before it even lists. Three pillars drive its momentum. First, price forecasts remain bullish, with some analysts suggesting long-term valuations between $1 and $20 if adoption follows through on its hybrid blockchain-DAG technology. The presale’s step-by-step structure provides urgency, building anticipation with each batch. Second, Buyer Battles have injected daily excitement into the presale. Each day, the largest single purchase earns the remaining allocation at no cost, creating a competitive atmosphere that keeps activity consistently high. This gamified feature has strengthened community engagement, turning participation into a strategy-driven event. Third, the BlockDAG Explorer is delivering transparency before launch. Users can monitor the DAG structure in real time, track transactions, see miner activity, and follow on-chain education credential issuance. This level of openness is unusual at the presale stage and has reinforced trust in the project’s technical backbone. Together, these elements place BlockDAG ahead of the pack; more than just a presale, it’s shaping into an ecosystem with competition, clarity, and a clear pricing roadmap. Final Thoughts BNB’s record-setting moves and Mantle’s whale-fueled rally highlight the market’s current energy. Still, both come with risks and limited upside at current prices. BlockDAG, meanwhile, continues to offer what many seek: early access at a discounted entry, combined with features that deliver transparency and daily engagement. With $379M raised, 25 billion coins already sold, and Buyer Battles creating constant activity, BlockDAG has moved beyond simply raising funds. It’s proving the strength of its technology and community before launch. The Explorer’s real-time view of its architecture further cements its credibility. At $0.0276, the opportunity remains open. Against Mantle’s speculative swings and BNB’s incremental rise, BlockDAG’s mix of gamified participation, strong presale numbers, and confirmed $0.05 launch price makes it a clear standout.

While Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, altcoins are where many traders see the highest upside. Forecasts now highlight three projects — XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Cardano (ADA) — as some of the most promising bets for those aiming for outsized returns. XRP: ETF Catalyst Could Unlock a Breakout After years of uncertainty, XRP has emerged from its long legal battle with U.S. regulators, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. A spot XRP ETF is widely expected to be approved later this year, which could mirror the explosive rally seen when Bitcoin’s ETF went live. Analysts suggest this catalyst could propel XRP well beyond its current range, potentially targeting the $8–$10 zone in a strong bull market. Some bolder predictions point to XRP hitting even $50 if spot ETFs get approved. With its compliance-ready design and growing role in cross-border payments, XRP is positioned to be one of 2025’s biggest winners. Investor Keep Their Eyes on This New Hidden Gem Among emerging presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is standing out as one of the most exciting opportunities of 2025 . Its model is built around audits, transparency, and a projected 55x ROI , factors that have created rapid demand during its funding rounds. Investor trust is growing, with early participants securing allocations before wider exchange exposure. Much like the early success stories of SHIB and DOGE, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building momentum that could reward early adopters in dramatic fashion. Cardano (ADA): Whale Accumulation and ETF Speculation Cardano has long been known for its research-driven approach and strong development community. In 2025, ADA is holding steady near $1, even as other altcoins swing wildly. Its previous all-time high around $3.10 has yet to be broken, but growing whale accumulation suggests large investors are quietly building positions. Adding to the excitement, talk of a potential Cardano ETF is gaining traction, which could open the floodgates for new institutional capital. If momentum continues, ADA could realistically revisit its old highs and possibly climb into the $5–$7 range during peak market euphoria. Some experts even say $12-15 is not out of the question in the next few months if momentum continues to build. Conclusion XRP, MAGACOIN FINANCE, and Cardano represent three very different paths to potential gains in 2025 — from regulatory clarity to presale growth to ecosystem expansion. For investors hunting for the next big returns, these projects stand out as top contenders, with MAGACOIN FINANCE especially drawing attention thanks to its 55x ROI forecasts backed by strong transparency measures.

50466988,562334,1755824435,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50466988.jpeg,Bitcoin Accumulator Addresses Demand Reaches Highest Levels Ever – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-accumulator-address-demand-reaches-highest/,"Bitcoin is entering a decisive phase after several days of consolidation and heightened volatility just below its all-time highs. The price has struggled to sustain momentum, raising concerns about weakening strength in the current trend. Bulls are now tasked with defending key support zones to prevent further bearish speculation and maintain the broader uptrend. Despite short-term uncertainty, the macro picture remains supportive. Institutional adoption continues to accelerate, with major corporations and funds adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a strategic reserve asset. At the same time, increasing legal clarity in key jurisdictions has provided a stronger framework for long-term adoption, encouraging new players to enter the market. These structural factors add resilience to Bitcoin’s price even as speculative activity cools. Adding to this outlook, fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals that demand from long-term holders has been steadily rising. This accumulation trend suggests that underlying conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory remains intact. Historically, strong holder demand has served as a reliable signal for market resilience during periods of heightened volatility. Bitcoin Accumulator Demand Hits Record High Bitcoin’s latest price dip has triggered a powerful response from one of the market’s most reliable cohorts: accumulator addresses. According to onchain data from CryptoQuant, demand from these addresses has reached a new all-time high in 2025, signaling a wave of conviction buying despite heightened volatility. Accumulator addresses are unique because they have no history of selling. These wallets only purchase and hold Bitcoin, steadily absorbing supply regardless of short-term price swings. Their growing demand is particularly striking now, as broader market sentiment remains cautious and price action consolidates below recent all-time highs. This surge in accumulation suggests that long-term investors see Bitcoin as a secure store of value, especially as macroeconomic conditions continue to weaken. Rising debt levels, persistent inflation risks, and global uncertainty are pushing allocators to seek assets outside the traditional financial system. For many, Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized structure make it the ultimate hedge. Historically, spikes in accumulator demand have preceded major rallies, as these investors gradually reduce liquid supply. With Bitcoin facing strong resistance but holding key structural support, this dynamic could provide the foundation for the next leg higher. Whether immediate continuation follows or consolidation stretches further, the conviction from accumulators highlights enduring trust in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Struggles to Hold Short-Term Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows price action under heavy pressure after losing the $117K–$118K region, where the 50 and 100 SMAs converged. BTC now trades around $113,326, consolidating just above the 200 SMA at $113,121, which is acting as a last line of defense for bulls. The rejection near the $123,200 resistance zone earlier this month triggered a sharp decline, bringing BTC back into its broader consolidation range. Momentum has clearly shifted toward the bears in the short term, with successive lower highs and lower lows forming over the past week. This breakdown highlights the importance of the 200 SMA: if BTC closes below it on the 4H timeframe, the next support levels lie at $111K and potentially $108K, opening room for deeper corrections. On the other hand, holding above the 200 SMA could provide a short-term base for recovery. A rebound would first need to reclaim the $115K–$116K area, followed by sustained strength above the 50 SMA at $117K to re-establish bullish momentum. Until then, market sentiment remains fragile, and traders are closely watching whether the 200 SMA can hold to prevent a slide into deeper losses.

Here’s What MVRV Data Suggests,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/has-bitcoin-bull-run-really-ended-heres-what-mvrv-data-suggests/,"Bitcoin continues to retrace from its record highs, with the asset trading below $115,000 at the time of writing. Current price levels place Bitcoin near $113,098, a decline of around 6.5% over the past week and close to 9% below its all-time peak. Despite the downturn, analysts monitoring on-chain data suggest the broader market cycle may still have room to extend upward. One such view comes from CryptoQuant’s QuickTake contributor, PelinayPA, who analyzed Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) ratio. The analyst noted that while recent corrections may weigh on short-term sentiment, historical patterns in MVRV indicate that Bitcoin has not yet reached conditions typically associated with market cycle tops. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Treasury Bubble Popping? Expert Answers Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Points to Neutral but Upward Potential The MVRV ratio is a widely tracked on-chain indicator that compares Bitcoin’s total market capitalization with its realized capitalization, which reflects the aggregated value of coins at the price they last moved on-chain. Historically, when the ratio climbs into the 3.5 to 4 range, it signals a potential overheating of the market. At these levels, most holders are in profit, selling activity rises, and price tops are often reached. Conversely, MVRV levels below 1 have historically marked accumulation phases and strong long-term entry points. Currently, Bitcoin’s MVRV ratio stands around 2.1. According to PelinayPA, this reading positions the market within a “neutral to bullish” zone, suggesting that while Bitcoin is no longer cheap, the conditions for an extended rally remain intact. The analyst noted that in previous cycles, the MVRV ratio advanced significantly higher before a peak, implying that Bitcoin’s price would need to move into the $140,000–$180,000 range for the indicator to reach historical top levels. However, the data also suggests that corrections along the way are plausible. “Since MVRV is already above 2, the market is not cheap anymore — short to mid-term corrections may occur along the way,” PelinayPA explained. The balance between potential upside and intermittent drawdowns reflects a phase of consolidation within a broader bull market structure. Exchange Flows Signal Mixed Market Behavior In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant contributor BorisD examined exchange netflow data, focusing on Binance, the world’s largest crypto trading platform. The report highlighted notable trends across several altcoins, showing how capital movements may inform future market conditions. According to the data, tokens such as ENJ (Enjin) and FET (Fetch.ai) recorded significant outflows from Binance. This pattern typically indicates that investors are moving assets to private wallets, which can be interpreted as a sign of longer-term holding behavior. In contrast, assets like ANKR and MATIC have seen strong inflows onto exchanges, raising the possibility of either upcoming selling pressure or speculative positioning ahead of market shifts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear Is Back: Traders Flip As Price Plunges To $113,000 BorisD suggested that monitoring which assets are attracting inflows versus outflows could help investors identify potential opportunities in the altcoin market. “Identifying which of these altcoins are currently near potential bottoms and positioning for their next rally seems to be the most rational strategy,” the analyst wrote.

Two people familiar with the deal asked not to be identified because the details are confidential The Information reported. The contract lasts six years. The move fits Google’s push for large cloud wins as it chases Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Earlier this year, Google also picked up work from OpenAI, which had leaned heavily on Microsoft’s Azure. As hightlighted by Cryptopolitan earlier, Alphabet’s Google Cloud generated $2.83 billion in operating income on $13.6 billion in second-quarter revenue . Revenue rose 32%, faster than the company’s total growth of 13.8%. AI infrastructure at the core of the Meta-Google deal One person said the deal is focused on artificial intelligence infrastructure. In its report last month, Meta forecast 2025 total expenses of $114 billion to $118 billion. It is pouring money into AI hardware and staff, upgrading its Llama models and putting AI into many of its apps. Even as the two compete in digital ads, Meta is trying to secure as much computing power as possible. It operates its own data centers and has agreements to use cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft. Meta Platforms is also seeking outside partners to help pay for the large data center needed for AI. A filing said the company plans to sell $2 billion of data center assets as part of that plan. The approach mirrors a wider change at big tech companies as the cost of building and running generative AI data centers climbs. “We’re exploring ways to work with financial partners to co-develop data centers,” Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday. Meta is shifting how it funds its tech expansion While Meta still expects to fund much of its capital spending internally, some projects could draw “significant external financing” and provide flexibility if needs change over time, she said. In its quarterly filing, Meta said that in June it approved a plan to dispose of some data center assets and reclassified $2.04 billion of land and construction-in-progress as “held-for-sale.” The assets are slated to be contributed to a third party within the next twelve months to co-develop data centers. Meta did not record a loss related to the reclassification, which measures the assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value minus costs to sell. As of June 30, total held-for-sale assets were $3.26 billion, the filing said. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has laid out plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into building AI data center “superclusters” to pursue superintelligence. “Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” he said. The company said ad sales topped expectations, helped by AI tools that improve targeting and content delivery, and said those gains are helping offset higher infrastructure costs from its long-term AI plans.

In a move that has sent ripples across the tech industry, OpenAI’s lawyers are now pulling Meta into the fray, demanding answers about its potential involvement in Musk’s audacious $97 billion takeover bid for the ChatGPT maker . This revelation hints at a complex web of alliances and rivalries at the very top of the AI pyramid, raising critical questions about the future of innovation and control in this rapidly evolving sector. Unpacking the OpenAI Lawsuit: Why is Meta Involved? The core of this unfolding saga lies in the OpenAI lawsuit filed by Elon Musk earlier this year. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, alleges that the company has strayed from its original non-profit, open-source mission to pursue profit-driven ventures, particularly with its close ties to Microsoft. OpenAI, in turn, has vehemently denied these claims, asserting that Musk himself attempted to gain control of the company and merge it with Tesla. It’s within this heated legal environment that OpenAI’s legal team has now cast a spotlight on Meta. In a recent brief, OpenAI’s lawyers publicly disclosed that they had subpoenaed Meta in June. The aim? To unearth any evidence related to coordination between Meta, Elon Musk, and his AI venture, xAI, concerning a potential acquisition or investment in OpenAI. This isn’t just a fishing expedition; OpenAI’s legal representatives claim to have uncovered communications between Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg regarding xAI’s bid to purchase the ChatGPT maker , including discussions about “potential financing arrangements or investments.” The very notion of two of the tech world’s most prominent figures, Musk and Zuckerberg, potentially collaborating on such a colossal deal adds a layer of intrigue to an already complex legal battle. Elon Musk OpenAI Ambitions and the $97 Billion Question Elon Musk’s relationship with OpenAI has been fraught with tension since his departure from the board in 2018. His recent $97 billion takeover bid in February, while unsolicited, underscores the immense value and strategic importance he places on the company he helped create. This aggressive move highlights Musk’s continued desire to influence the direction of cutting-edge AI, especially as his own company, xAI, emerges as a significant player with its Grok AI model. The question then becomes, why would Musk, with his own AI endeavors, seek to acquire OpenAI, and what role, if any, could Meta play in facilitating such a massive transaction? The subpoena suggests that OpenAI suspects more than just casual conversations. They are seeking to understand if Meta was a silent partner, a potential financier, or even a strategic advisor in Musk’s bid to acquire the company. Such an arrangement, if proven, could significantly alter the dynamics of the ongoing Elon Musk OpenAI lawsuit, potentially revealing a concerted effort to reshape the landscape of frontier AI. The sheer scale of the proposed $97 billion valuation itself speaks volumes about the perceived market dominance and future potential of OpenAI’s technology. Meta AI Development: A Parallel Universe of Ambition? While entangled in this legal crossfire, Meta has been aggressively pursuing its own ambitious Meta AI development strategy. Far from being a passive observer, Meta has made significant investments and strategic moves to position itself as a leader in the generative AI space. This includes pouring billions into infrastructure, acquiring vast amounts of computing power, and, notably, poaching top talent from rival AI labs, including OpenAI itself. One prominent example is Shengjia Zhao, a co-creator of ChatGPT, who now leads research efforts at Meta Superintelligence Labs – the company’s newest and highly strategic AI unit. This talent acquisition is not coincidental; it reflects Meta’s determination to build its own frontier AI models capable of competing with the likes of OpenAI’s GPT series and Google’s Gemini. Meta has also invested a reported $14 billion in Scale AI and has reportedly approached several other AI labs about potential acquisition deals, indicating a broader strategy of expansion and consolidation in the AI market. This aggressive posture raises questions about whether Meta’s alleged involvement in Musk’s bid for OpenAI was purely financial, or if it was part of a larger strategic play to gain insights, influence, or even a direct stake in a competitor’s future. The High Stakes of AI Acquisition in a Competitive Landscape The current legal skirmish underscores the feverish pace of AI acquisition and consolidation within the technology sector. As AI models become increasingly powerful and foundational to future technological advancements, control over these intellectual properties and the talent behind them becomes paramount. Companies like OpenAI, with their groundbreaking models like GPT-4, represent not just technological prowess but also immense market influence and potential future revenue streams. The prospect of a company like OpenAI being acquired, especially by a figure as controversial and ambitious as Elon Musk, or with the alleged backing of a tech giant like Meta, sends tremors through the entire industry. It raises concerns about market concentration, the availability of open-source alternatives, and the very direction of AI development – whether it will remain diversified or fall under the control of a few dominant players. Every major tech company, from Microsoft and Google to Amazon and Apple, is racing to secure its position in the AI arms race, making every potential acquisition or strategic partnership a matter of intense scrutiny. The legal battle surrounding OpenAI is not just about one company; it’s about setting precedents for how innovation, ownership, and competition will unfold in the age of advanced AI. What Does This Mean for the ChatGPT Future? At the heart of OpenAI’s success and public recognition lies ChatGPT , its revolutionary conversational AI. The ongoing legal battle, the intense scrutiny over its governance, and the potential for a hostile takeover or significant restructuring inevitably cast a shadow over the ChatGPT future . Users and developers alike are watching closely to see how these high-level corporate and legal maneuvers might impact the development roadmap, accessibility, and ethical guidelines governing this transformative technology. Will a change in ownership or a significant shift in strategic alliances lead to new features, different monetization models, or even a pivot in the underlying philosophy of OpenAI’s development? The uncertainty itself can create ripples, potentially affecting talent retention, investor confidence, and the pace of innovation. For a product as widely adopted and influential as ChatGPT, stability and clear direction are crucial for continued growth and widespread adoption. The outcome of this legal drama could determine whether ChatGPT continues its trajectory as a broadly accessible tool or if its future becomes more intertwined with the specific commercial interests of its ultimate controllers. Challenges and Legal Hurdles: Meta’s Objections and the Path Forward Meta, naturally, has not taken OpenAI’s subpoena lightly. Lawyers representing Meta have asked the court to reject OpenAI’s request for evidence, arguing that Elon Musk and xAI can themselves provide any relevant information. Furthermore, Meta contends that its internal discussions regarding OpenAI’s potential restructuring or recapitalization are not relevant to the case at hand. This legal maneuvering highlights the complexities of discovery in high-stakes corporate lawsuits, where parties often resist revealing internal communications or strategic plans.

50467269,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=789484,1755824773,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50467269.jpeg,Investors expect Powell to tee up September rate cut in Friday speech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bond-investors-powell-rate-cut-friday-speech/,"Bond traders are betting that Jerome Powell will send a clear message this Friday morning that interest rate cuts are coming next month. The Federal Reserve Chair is scheduled to speak at 10 a.m. in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, during the Fed’s yearly economic gathering. Powell typically uses this platform before to change expectations, so now investors want to know if he’ll challenge current bets on rate cuts or quietly go along. According to Bloomberg, the market currently shows a 70% chance of a 0.25% cut in September and 50 basis points of total easing in 2025. These expectations come even after interest-rate swaps pulled back slightly following hawkish remarks from other Fed officials and choppy economic reports. Traders prepare for either confirmation or chaos If Powell sounds hawkish, shorter-term bond yields could spike. And that would squeeze the massive bets made in the options market this month. Traders have placed large positions on a deep September rate cut and a total of 75 basis points of cuts before year-end. Jason Pride, head of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, said Powell “will not want to lock in a rate cut path for a decision in September.” Pride expects Powell to “fall a little bit on the side of suggesting that the economic data has weakened enough to support consideration of a rate cut.” Tom di Galoma, managing director at Mischler Financial Group, doesn’t expect a firm commitment. “There is a good chance of a hawkish presser and that the chair is not inclined to lower rates,” he said. Powell may want to keep things flexible. That means the decision for September likely hinges on the next employment and inflation reports coming out in early September. Until then, the bond market might stay stuck, with the two-year yield near 3.75% and the 10-year holding close to 4.30%. So far this month, shorter-dated yields have dropped 11 to 16 basis points across two- and five-year notes. That drop followed weak job numbers in July. But in early Asia trading Friday, Treasuries were barely moving. Everyone’s just waiting. Powell expected to signal caution as inflation risk rises In 2024, Powell used the same stage to open the door to rate cuts. That year, job numbers were weakening and two-year yields dropped hard after his speech. It gave traders the green light to bet on easier policy. Now, the labor market is once again showing cracks. But inflation is also back in the picture. The Fed’s July meeting minutes, released Wednesday, revealed that officials are still worried about rising prices as new tariffs take effect. High asset prices are also making some at the Fed think that easing isn’t necessary yet. That’s why Powell has held back this year. The Fed has kept rates steady and is waiting to see if inflation picks up even more before making a move. But many bond investors believe that labor weakness is stronger than inflation fears. Glenmede’s Pride believes the Fed will ultimately move in line with the market. “The Federal Reserve has a bias that when nothing looks like it’s falling apart, you tend to deliver what you have managed to build into market expectations at this point in time,” he said . That view gives weight to the idea that Powell may let the market lead the way, as long as the economy doesn’t fall apart. Still, not everyone is treating Powell’s words as gospel. Strategists at BMO Capital Markets laid out a plan depending on how the market reacts. If Powell leans dovish but doesn’t give clear confirmation, they plan to sell into any rally in the two-year note. If the market takes a slightly hawkish comment too seriously and thinks a cut is off the table, they’ll buy the dip. “We’d look to fade a rally in the two-year sector in the event that Powell is dovish, but doesn’t seal the deal on a September rate cut,” the strategists said. “Conversely, we’d be dip-buyers if the market misconstrues a hawkish comment as an indication that a September rate cut is not in the cards.” Get seen where it counts.

A prominent Bitcoin OG , a term for an early and significant investor in Bitcoin, has reportedly executed a monumental shift in their portfolio. This move involves divesting a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) and making a considerable investment into Ethereum (ETH), sparking widespread discussion and speculation. According to insights from blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X, this strategic rotation is not just a minor adjustment but a massive reallocation of capital. Such a significant move by a long-standing Bitcoin holder raises important questions about market sentiment and future trends in the digital asset space. What Sparked This Monumental Bitcoin OG Shift? Over the past two days, this influential investor made a series of calculated moves. They sold a staggering 2,970 BTC, which was valued at approximately $337 million at the time of the transaction. This sale alone is enough to turn heads, considering the investor’s historical ties to Bitcoin. However, the story doesn’t end with the sale. The funds were quickly redeployed into Ethereum. The Bitcoin OG opened significant ETH long positions, totaling 135,265 ETH, with a valuation of around $577 million. Furthermore, the investor directly purchased an additional 50,472 ETH on the spot market, amounting to roughly $215 million. This dual approach of selling BTC and then acquiring ETH through both long positions and spot purchases highlights a strong conviction in Ethereum’s potential. It suggests a deliberate strategy rather than a fleeting impulse. Understanding the Ethereum Play: Why ETH Now? Many are now asking: what makes Ethereum so appealing to a long-time Bitcoin enthusiast? While Bitcoin is often hailed as ‘digital gold’ due to its scarcity and store-of-value properties, Ethereum offers a different value proposition. It is the backbone of a vast decentralized ecosystem. Ethereum’s appeal lies in several key areas: Smart Contract Platform: It powers decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Staking Rewards: With the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), ETH holders can earn rewards by staking their tokens. Ecosystem Growth: The continuous development and innovation within the Ethereum network attract developers and users alike. Potential for Future Upgrades: Ongoing improvements aim to enhance scalability and efficiency, making ETH more robust. This Bitcoin OG likely sees the intrinsic value and growth potential within Ethereum’s utility and expanding network effects. It represents a strategic bet on the future of decentralized computing. Implications for the Crypto Market: Will Others Follow This Astute Bitcoin OG? A move of this magnitude by a respected early investor can certainly influence market sentiment. When ‘smart money’ shifts, others often pay close attention. It could signal a broader trend of capital flowing from established, store-of-value assets like Bitcoin into more growth-oriented, utility-driven assets like Ethereum. However, it’s crucial to remember that individual investment decisions, even by a seasoned Bitcoin OG , do not guarantee future market performance. The cryptocurrency market remains inherently volatile, and what works for one investor may not be suitable for another. Key Takeaways for Investors: Diversification: This event underscores the importance of a diversified portfolio in crypto. Research (DYOR): Always conduct your own thorough research before making investment decisions. Market Dynamics: Understand that market leadership and narratives can evolve over time. The actions of this particular investor highlight the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape. While Bitcoin continues to hold its ground as a foundational asset, Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to mature and attract significant capital. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for a Bitcoin OG and the Market The recent portfolio rotation by a prominent Bitcoin OG from BTC to ETH marks a truly significant event in the cryptocurrency world. This massive $337 million shift into Ethereum, coupled with substantial ETH long positions, suggests a strong belief in the smart contract platform’s long-term prospects. While Bitcoin remains a titan, this move underscores the growing maturity and diverse investment opportunities within the broader crypto market. It serves as a compelling reminder that even early pioneers are constantly evaluating and adapting their strategies in this rapidly evolving financial frontier. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‘Bitcoin OG’ mean? A1: ‘Bitcoin OG’ stands for ‘Bitcoin Original Gangster,’ referring to an early investor or adopter of Bitcoin who has held significant amounts of the cryptocurrency for a long period. Q2: How much Bitcoin did the investor sell? A2: The investor reportedly sold 2,970 BTC, valued at approximately $337 million at the time of the transactions. Q3: Why might an investor shift from BTC to ETH? A3: Reasons often include Ethereum’s role as a leading smart contract platform for DeFi and NFTs, its staking opportunities, and its potential for growth due to ongoing ecosystem development and upgrades. Q4: What is the significance of opening ‘long positions’ in ETH? A4: Opening a long position means the investor is betting that the price of ETH will increase in the future, allowing them to profit from the price appreciation. It indicates a strong bullish outlook. Q5: Does this mean Bitcoin is losing its value? A5: Not necessarily. Bitcoin continues to be a dominant force as ‘digital gold.’ This move reflects a strategic reallocation by one investor, not a universal abandonment of BTC. The crypto market is dynamic, with different assets serving different purposes. Q6: Should I follow this investor’s strategy? A6: Investment decisions should always be based on your own research, financial situation, and risk tolerance. While it’s interesting to observe the moves of large investors, their strategies may not align with your personal goals. Always Do Your Own Research (DYOR). Share This Insightful Analysis!

Over 15450 investors have already invested in the project presale, and over $14.7 million has been raised. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already at Stage 6 of Presale at $0.035. Phase 7 will be a 14.29% boost to $0.04. Although XRP is trending lower, MUTM is defying the overall sentiment of the market, gaining traction with traders seeking new momentum in decentralized lending and liquidity protocols Ripple (XRP) Holds Steady Amid Rebalancing of the Market Ripple’s XRP hovers at approximately $3.02 with little movement within the constricted intraday range of about $2.95 to $3.10. The token continues robust as a blue-chip asset, supported by its established cross-border payments use case and institutional pipes. While total sentiment remains cautious in response to regulatory uncertainty and market-wide volatility, stability of XRP reflects a period of consolidation and not directional conviction. Decentralized finance tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are instead attracting attention of late with their own energy. Mutuum Finance Progresses to Phase 6 of Its Presale Mutuum Finance recently concluded Phase 5 of its very successful presale and has progressed into Phase 6. In this phase, tokens are available at $0.035 per token, with early investors having a second opportunity to purchase MUTM at lower rates prior to public listing. The presale has already been very popular, with over $14.7 million in funds raised and over 15,450 holders worldwide. This rising rate of growth signals the tremendous belief that the community has in the project and its future prospects in the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena. With each round of presale, interest in tokens has continued to rise consistently, painting a picture of robust investor appetite and growing levels of adoption for Mutuum Finance. The transition to Phase 6 symbolizes not only community enthusiasm but also the master plan of strategic growth that the project has had. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Partners with CertiK to Carry out $50K Bug Bounty In its ongoing efforts towards attaining the greatest level of security and transparency, Mutuum Finance has also partnered with CertiK, a leading industry blockchain security and auditing firm.

These innovative companies are now making massive waves, significantly increasing their presence and investment in global athletics. This surge in crypto sports sponsorships marks a pivotal moment, transforming how digital assets connect with mainstream audiences. Why Are Crypto Sports Sponsorships Surging?

The S&P Global UK Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 53 in August from 51.5 in July. Readings above 50 points to expansion, and August marked a fourth straight month in that zone. The gain was led by stronger demand in business services, where firms reported a clearer rise in new work. The UK’s manufacturers also reported better sentiment, but services set the pace and carried the overall index higher compared with the previous month. On the public finance side, separate figures released on Thursday showed the central government borrowed £1.1 billion in July. That was smaller than the Office for Budget Responsibility’s expectation of a £2.1 billion deficit for the month. The gap was narrower than forecast, giving the Treasury slight relief as it deals with weaker-than-hoped revenues and a recovery that has not been even across sectors and regions. Budget choices remain tight. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is still widely expected to lift taxes in the Budget to pay for plans and to meet her rule to cover day-to-day spending from tax receipts by 2029-30. Officials are weighing different paths, including potential changes to property taxes, as ministers face a hole of at least £20 billion in the public accounts that will need to be closed. Growth has cooled. Headline GDP expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, down from 0.7% in the first three months of 2025. On the other hand, the US economy rebounded with 3% annualized GDP growth in Q2, as reported by Cryptopolitan recently. Companies have said that expected tax rises and a steep increase in the minimum wage are hurting confidence, pushing up costs and leading managers to hold back on recruitment. Hiring remained weak despite strong business activity Employment measures fell for an eleventh month in a row. Many companies are reporting reduced hiring and layoffs. At the same time, new vacancies have been unfilled, which suggests that companies are cautious when hiring new talent. The latest Office for National Statistics release also showed that July borrowing was the lowest for that month in three years. Borrowing typically dips in January and July because those months line up with key dates for income-tax payments. That seasonal pattern reflects the calendar of taxpayer deadlines and was visible again this year. July’s total was helped by a £2.7 billion rise in self-assessed income-tax receipts and by interest payments on government debt coming in lower than expected. Revenues also picked up after the decision in October to raise employer national insurance contributions; the OBR said those payments were almost 24% higher than in July last year, boosting the monthly intake. Even with the July undershoot, the broader picture is still fragile. From April to July, the first four months of the fiscal year, borrowing reached £60 billion. The running total is broadly in line with the OBR’s forecast published in March. The watchdog will issue fresh projections for growth and the public finances alongside the Budget. The Treasury is preparing for the risk that the OBR trims its productivity outlook, a change that would likely push borrowing higher. On the fiscal rule measure, the current budget deficit, excluding investment spending, stood at £42.8 billion for the year to date, £5.4 billion more than in the same four months of 2024 and £5.7 billion above the OBR’s profile for the period.

The new figures mark another month above target, stretching a streak that has challenged the view inside the bank that inflation would ease once temporary shocks faded. Investors think the pressure could last through year-end according to a Bloomberg report . Government numbers on Friday showed core consumer prices, excluding fresh food, were up 3.1% in July from a year earlier, after a 3.3% gain in June, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said. Economists expected 3%, thinking cheaper energy would pull the rate down after last year’s spike. These expectations align with earlier projections that the BOJ may be nearing another rate increase, as Cryptopolitan noted when inflation peaked earlier this year An index that removes both fresh food and energy rose 3.4%, unchanged from June and matching the consensus. Japan faces US criticism as inflation stays stubborn Japan’s policy path is also drawing international focus as central banks adapt to new global pressures, particularly in Tokyo. The data show price pressures are stubborn. They landed about a week after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent took the unusual step of criticizing the BOJ’s approach, telling Bloomberg TV that “they’re behind the curve.” Hike odds have risen in recent weeks, lifting bond yields. The slowdown in core CPI was broadly expected since energy costs spiked a year earlier when a government subsidy ended. Crude was roughly 10% cheaper than a year before. Rice prices, a major factor this year, climbed 90.7% from a year ago, down from the 100.2% jump in June. The surge in the staple has alarmed households nationwide. Officials see year-on-year gains easing in the months ahead because the run-up started last autumn, but record heat could hurt harvests and worsen shortages. Processed and shelf-stable food prices rose 8.3%, the quickest pace since September 2023. Service costs rose 1.5%, the same rate as in June. BOJ raises inflation view but may hold rates Strains on living costs contributed to a historic defeat for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s coalition in last month’s vote. Having lost control of both houses, Ishiba is facing resignation demands from parts of his party. Analysts are watching to see if he seeks support with fresh fiscal outlays aimed at easing household pain. At the July meeting, Governor Kazuo Ueda’s board raised this fiscal year’s inflation forecast by more than expected in its quarterly outlook, citing food. Most expect the BOJ to leave rates unchanged at the Sept. 19 decision. The chance of a rate increase by late October is about 51%, compared with around 42% last month. On Thursday, the 10-year JGB yield reached its highest since 2008, reflecting bets on further policy tightening.

Coinbase confirmed the listing on its blog and X posts. Eric Trump, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, also shared the news on X and promised more updates “very soon.” Coinbase adds USD1 and starts phased trading U.S users can now access and trade USD1 on Coinbase. The exchange has officially added it as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network. This is a big step for USD1’s biggest supporter and developer, World Liberty Financial, as it enters one of the largest and most regulated crypto exchanges worldwide. Coinbase said the rollout for USD1 depends on meeting liquidity requirements , so trading will start in phases. This measure will allow the exchange to monitor supply and demand, prevent sudden price swings, and make sure both buyers and sellers have a smooth experience. Investors will be confident about entering and exiting positions without facing losses because this approach aligns with the platform’s broader policy of maintaining orderly markets. Coinbase also warned users not to send USD1 over other networks that aren’t Ethereum because they risk huge losses. This caution will help new stablecoin users who don’t know the consequences of sending tokens across incompatible blockchains. It also shows how Coinbase is committed to transparency and user protection as it introduces high-profile assets like USD1 to its platform. U.S users can now trade three major stablecoins, USDC, Tether’s USDT, and USD1, on Coinbase. Adding the USD1, backed by the Trump family, gives users more trading options and raises competition for stablecoins. It also directs focus to the rapidly growing market for digital dollars because users avoid traditional banking restrictions. World Liberty Financial increases USD1 supply and plans a rewards program World Liberty Financial recently minted $205 million worth of USD1 stablecoins, as recently reported by Cryptopolitan . The issuance boosted USD1’s total supply to a record $2.4 billion , marking its biggest increase since late April. Launched earlier this year, the stablecoin now ranks as the world’s sixth-largest, with a market capitalization of $2.39 billion. USD1’s 205 million token minting aligned with remarks from Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman at the Wyoming Blockchain Symposium. Cryptopolitan reported that Wyoming became the first U.S. state to launch a stablecoin earlier this week. Most of USD1’s supply comes from strategic partnerships and large treasury holdings, including a $2 billion investment from Abu Dhabi-based MGX transacted using the token on Binance. World Liberty Financial is committed to developing a stable digital dollar that can compete with USDC and USDT. USD1 is fully backed on a 1:1 basis by U.S. dollars and U.S. Treasuries. This ensures the token represents a real, tangible asset, making it more reliable for its holders. World Liberty Financial has also disclosed the Ethereum contract address for USD1, so that anyone can verify the total supply, track transactions, and confirm that the backing reserves exist as stated. The company also announced its plans for a loyalty points program for USD1 users. It will reward people for trading, holding, staking, and participating in approved decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This program will incentivize engagement with USD1 and generate yield from financial activities that increase liquidity. World Liberty Financial’s Ethereum-based DeFi platform will launch publicly soon and integrate USD1 to offer users borrowing and lending services like other decentralized finance applications built on Ethereum. The project aims to create an ecosystem where users can easily deposit, borrow, lend, and earn rewards using USD1. People won’t rely on traditional banking rails anymore, and capital will move faster and more efficiently. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Recently, a stark reminder of these dangers emerged from South Korea, where a man faced severe consequences for engaging in a substantial crypto investment fraud . This case highlights the critical need for vigilance and informed decision-making in the volatile cryptocurrency market. Understanding the South Korean Crypto Investment Fraud Case In a recent development, a South Korean man in his thirties received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. His crime involved defrauding a former colleague of 440 million won, approximately $314,000 USD. Prosecutors revealed that the perpetrator lured his victim with false promises, guaranteeing extraordinary returns of 10 to 20 percent within a mere four months through cryptocurrency investments. This incident, as reported by Yonhap News, serves as a cautionary tale about the allure of quick profits in the crypto space. What Made This Crypto Investment Fraud So Deceptive? The fraudster exploited a pre-existing relationship, targeting a former colleague. This element of trust often makes such scams particularly insidious. The promise of high, guaranteed returns, especially within a short timeframe, is a classic red flag in any investment, and even more so in the highly volatile crypto market. Unfortunately, the victim fell prey to these exaggerated claims, leading to significant financial loss. This type of deception underscores a common tactic in crypto investment fraud : leveraging personal connections and making unrealistic promises. Investors must always approach such propositions with a healthy dose of skepticism, regardless of who is making the offer. How Can You Identify Potential Crypto Investment Fraud Schemes? Protecting yourself from scams requires awareness. Here are key indicators to watch out for: Unrealistic Returns: Be wary of promises guaranteeing exceptionally high returns with little to no risk. Legitimate investments always carry some level of risk. Pressure Tactics: Scammers often create a sense of urgency, pressuring you to invest quickly before “missing out” on a limited-time opportunity. Lack of Transparency: If details about the investment strategy, company, or team are vague or hard to verify, proceed with extreme caution. Complex Jargon: Some fraudsters use overly complex technical terms to confuse potential victims, making it difficult to understand what you’re actually investing in. Unsolicited Offers: Be suspicious of investment opportunities that come from unknown sources, especially through social media or unsolicited emails. Recognizing these warning signs is your first line of defense against falling victim to crypto investment fraud . Safeguarding Your Digital Assets: Essential Strategies Against Crypto Investment Fraud Taking proactive steps is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto market. Consider these strategies: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always thoroughly investigate any investment opportunity. Look into the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, and community. Verify Credentials: Confirm the legitimacy of individuals or companies offering investment services. Check for proper licensing and regulatory compliance. Start Small: If you’re new to crypto, begin with smaller, manageable investments in well-established assets. Secure Your Wallets: Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts and wallets. Consult Experts: Seek advice from reputable financial advisors who specialize in digital assets before making significant investment decisions. By adopting these practices, you significantly reduce your vulnerability to crypto investment fraud and enhance your overall security. The Serious Repercussions of Crypto Investment Fraud The South Korean case clearly demonstrates that law enforcement agencies are actively pursuing and prosecuting individuals involved in digital asset scams. Such convictions send a strong message: engaging in crypto investment fraud carries severe legal consequences, including lengthy prison sentences and significant financial penalties. This legal action not only punishes offenders but also aims to deter others from similar illicit activities, fostering a safer environment for legitimate crypto participants. Authorities worldwide are increasing their efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency space and combat financial crimes. This growing focus on accountability means that fraudsters face an ever-higher risk of being caught and brought to justice. In conclusion, while the cryptocurrency market offers exciting prospects, it is also a landscape where vigilance is paramount. The sentencing of the South Korean man for a significant crypto investment fraud serves as a powerful reminder that promises of guaranteed high returns are often too good to be true. Educate yourself, exercise caution, and always prioritize security to protect your hard-earned assets from deceptive schemes. Stay informed, stay safe. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

This significant change resulted from the individuals’ positive attitude towards the Bank of England’s interest rate cuts. This announcement came after GfK’s index, popularly known as the GfK Consumer Confidence Index, which measures consumers’ perception regarding their household finances, expressed a notable increase of 3 points from last month’s surge to 5. For the overall consumer confidence index, which focuses on consumers’ perception of the general economy, consumer sentiment rose to -17, reflecting a 2-point increase. This shocked analysts as they had earlier predicted that the overall consumer confidence index would remain constant. Additionally, it is the highest record score since December. UK consumers embrace the BoE’s efforts to lower borrowing costs in the country Analysts say the improvement shows that households are responding positively to lower borrowing costs, with overall sentiment now at its highest point since August of last year. This demonstrates that people have finally realized the essence of the Bank of England’s efforts to reduce borrowing costs, bringing about change for average citizens. This happened one year after the bank began lowering interest rates from 16-year highs. Another significant news for prospective buyers is that mortgage costs in the country have also started dropping. This report highlights the economy’s early stage of recovery from the damage caused by Labour’s £26bn, approximately $35 billion, hike in the cost of employing people. In addition, S&P’s business sentiment survey earlier this week showed the strongest growth in the private sector for a year. Savings intentions have fallen, undoing last month’s increase to their highest level since the financial crisis, GfK said. More people say they are ready to make expensive purchases, like cars and furniture. Despite all this, Neil Bellamy, a consumer insights director at GfK, warned that any positive sentiment around the economy could now be under threat. In a statement, Bellamy highlighted some significant challenges ahead, such as inflation, which, according to him, has been at its highest since January 2024, while unemployment is on the rise. Notably, UK inflation in July rose more than expected, with significant costs for households such as food and transport. This cautions that the squeeze on consumers could intensify if retailers raise prices to help cover higher payroll costs. The British Retail Consortium said four in ten shoppers expect to spend more on food shopping over the next three months. On the other hand, poorer households are disproportionately affected by recent rises in food prices because they spend a greater share of their income on basic goods. That creates a scenario where those struggling financially are not enjoying the benefits of appreciating real wages and lower borrowing costs. Raoul Ruparel highlights the economic effects of spending patterns Data from The Boston Consulting Group revealed that its gauge of the difference in spending patterns between those earning more than £48,000 a year and those earning less was four times higher since January. Their latest survey, released on Friday, August 22, showed that about 28% of participants plan to spend more on groceries, up from just 20 percent three months ago. In the meantime, the number of consumers with more disposable income who prefer premium brands is at the highest level observed since May. This suggests that, as the BCG report found, top earners are leading the recovery in demand. Raoul Ruparel, director of BCG’s Centre for Growth, weighed in on the situation. According to Ruparel, wealthier households are contributing factors in a scenario where spending is increasing. “Looking ahead, this ongoing divide will significantly influence how quickly and in what way consumer recovery happens,” he said.

In the last few months, a few names have surged ahead with strong presales, proven use cases, and signals that both retail players and larger holders are paying close attention. What matters now is which projects can turn this momentum into major gains after listings or big upgrades. This year, four standouts are leading the talk: BlockDAG, Cardano (ADA), Cronos (CRO), and Ethena (ENA). Each brings something unique, and together they paint a picture of what could shape the 2025 crypto race. Here’s why these names are making noise as the top trending crypto to buy. 1. BlockDAG: Breaking Records Before Day One BlockDAG is delivering numbers rarely seen in presale history. It blends Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) speed with Proof-of-Work security, building a system that is fast yet tough to break. On top of that, it is fully EVM-compatible, letting Ethereum-based apps and contracts run smoothly on the network. Even before its official launch, adoption is buzzing: the X1 mobile miner app already counts 2.5 million users, and more than 19,300 ASIC miners are in circulation. This mix of easy entry and pro-level mining gives BlockDAG a two-sided ecosystem. So far, more than $3 million has been raised, marking it as one of the largest presales in years. The coin sits in Batch 29 at $0.0276, and early buyers have seen paper gains of around 2,600%. Analysts speculate it could climb toward $1 after listings, which would be a 36x jump from today’s price. For anyone tracking the top trending crypto to buy, these figures highlight the kind of explosive upside people are chasing. Adding to the hype is BlockDAG’s 200 ETH prize pool, worth about $1 million, offered during presale. It’s designed to fuel more participation and reward active buyers. With hybrid tech, record-breaking fundraising, and heavy retail involvement, BlockDAG is not just in the conversation; it’s setting the pace whenever talk turns to the top trending crypto to buy . 2. Cardano (ADA): Eyeing the Next Big Jump In the past week, ADA surged more than 33%, touching $0.98 on August 14 before easing slightly to $0.90–$0.91. Daily volumes have been steady at $2–3 billion, with a market cap above $32 billion. Analysts note ADA has broken free from a long triangle pattern, and the next hurdles sit at $1.02 and $1.12. If momentum holds, targets as high as $1.50 are being discussed. A major buzz driver is speculation about a Cardano spot ETF. With Grayscale already filing, many expect fresh flows if approvals land in 2025. That possibility has fired up sentiment, putting ADA in the mix as one of the top trending crypto to buy for those wanting both steady fundamentals and sharp upside. Its ongoing upgrades and loyal community make the case even stronger. 3. Cronos (CRO): Exchange Power in Play Cronos, powering the Crypto.com ecosystem, has held steady despite broader pullbacks. Over the last three days, CRO traded between $0.149–$0.150 with a market cap near $4.85 billion and daily trading volume of around $35 million. It has dropped about 7–8% in the past week, but optimism remains tied to its DeFi, NFT, and staking role inside Crypto.com’s platform. Crypto.com has been pushing hard, adding more DeFi links and NFT features that boost CRO’s relevance. Analysts point out that even with a dip, the coin’s strong visibility and utility keep it poised for a rebound. That’s why it often shows up in talk about the top trending crypto to buy. For those looking at exchange-linked assets with payment, reward, and DeFi use, CRO continues to look steady in this cycle. 4. Ethena (ENA): Big Buyers Making Bold Moves Ethena has captured attention after strong whale activity. In the past week, one whale poured $2 million into ENA at $0.69, while Arthur Hayes grabbed 3.1 million ENA valued at $2.48 million. Even with S&P Global assigning a high-risk weighting of 1,250%, the market is signaling confidence in ENA’s ecosystem and its growth path. Currently trading at $0.70–$0.72 with a market cap near $4.7 billion and daily volumes of $800–950 million, ENA is slightly down in the last day but still up more than 130% year-over-year. This mix of whale buying, strong activity, and long-term growth chatter places ENA firmly in the spotlight for anyone hunting the top trending crypto to buy. Even with stablecoin regulatory pressure, ENA is proving its momentum is being backed into 2025. Key Takeaways When scanning the market for the top trending crypto to buy, adoption, price moves, and confidence stand out as the key signals. BlockDAG leads with its record presale, hybrid design, and strong user rewards. Cardano is breaking out with chart strength and ETF buzz that could invite new flows. Cronos gains from Crypto.com’s growth and real-world utility, while Ethena draws heavy backing despite regulatory hurdles. With more than $3 million raised and talk of hitting $1 after listing, BlockDAG is making its case as the headline name among the top trending cryptocurrencies to buy . For those ready to play bold in 2025, this list is where the action is.

While Bitcoin, Solana, and Avalanche dominate headlines, analysts are eyeing a new hidden gem altcoin poised for explosive growth: MAGACOIN FINANCE , which could deliver a staggering 8,500% ROI over the coming cycle. This week’s market snapshot shows that volatility remains high — but that’s exactly where the biggest opportunities emerge. Below, we’ll explore the 7 best altcoins to buy this week and why MAGACOIN FINANCE may be the breakout crypto you’ve never heard of (but definitely don’t want to miss). Bitcoin (BTC) — Still the King, But Facing Short-Term Turbulence Bitcoin recently hit a new all-time high of $124,000 on August 14, 2025. However, the market has since pulled back to the $113,000–$115,000 range. Volatility has shaken leveraged traders, but long-term bullish indicators remain intact. Key Bitcoin Takeaways: 7–9% Pullback from ATH due to profit-taking and Fed uncertainty $54.85 Billion ETF Inflows shows ongoing institutional trust 1 ZH/s Hashrate Milestone confirms strongest-ever network security University Allocations Rising : Institutions like Harvard are now investing Despite the short-term dip, Bitcoin remains one of the best altcoins to buy for institutional-grade exposure — especially if Fed rate cuts spark another bull wave. Solana (SOL) — Institutional Favorite With Major Tech Upgrades Solana is enjoying a rapid rise, both technically and institutionally. With network upgrades like Alpenglow , Firedancer , and Confidential Transfers , Solana is narrowing the gap with Ethereum while offering faster, cheaper infrastructure. Solana Highlights: 107,000+ TPS Capacity proves high-performance dominance 6M SOL Held by Public Companies $183M Staking ETF inflows ahead of spot ETF decisions TVL at $8.6B , making it DeFi’s #2 blockchain Solana’s combination of performance and adoption makes it one of the best altcoins to buy this week — especially ahead of the October ETF decision. Avalanche (AVAX) — DeFi, Real World Assets & FIFA Driving Growth While AVAX is trading modestly around $23.34 , the network is booming beneath the surface. Avalanche’s infrastructure, especially after the Octane Upgrade , is being widely adopted for real-world asset tokenization and enterprise use. Avalanche Highlights: FIFA Blockchain now runs on Avalanche $300M Hedge Fund Tokenization via SkyBridge Capital 493% Growth in C-Chain Transactions Validator Cost Reduction by 83% AVAX’s fundamentals make it a high-upside pick among the best altcoins to buy , even if its price hasn’t caught up yet. MAGACOIN FINANCE — Explosive Hidden Gem With 8,500% ROI Potential Among the best altcoins to buy right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most undervalued yet high-potential presale token of 2025. Tipped by analysts to potentially gain 8500% by 2025, this politically-themed altcoin is building a strong ecosystem backed by real utility, viral marketing, and community-first tokenomics. As altcoin markets recover, MAGACOIN FINANCE has all the ingredients of a generational wealth opportunity. It’s already gaining attention among presale analysts as one of the best altcoins to buy before going mainstream. Countdown is now live for MAGACOIN FINANCE , and the presale is almost completely sold out. Investors are rushing in as only a small portion of tokens remain available. With the next major price surge just around the corner, getting in now could mean huge gains once the pump phase officially begins. XRP — Lawsuit Over, ETF in Sight With the SEC case finally settled , XRP is now free to operate in the U.S. without regulatory overhang. ETF applications are advancing, with analysts predicting a 95% approval chance by October . XRP Bullish Drivers: $125M Settlement Finalized — no more legal cloud XRP ETF Approvals Expected RLUSD Stablecoin Gaining Traction Price near support ($2.84–$2.94) = strong entry XRP/USDT Chart: TradingView With legal clarity and product expansion, XRP is easily one of the best altcoins to buy for exposure to the payment and stablecoin sectors. Dogecoin (DOGE) — Community Giant With Institutional Momentum Often overlooked, Dogecoin is gaining steam again with institutional adoption , ETF proposals, and record-breaking wallet growth. Why DOGE Is Back: 8M+ Wallets — 1M added in 2025 alone $500M Treasury Allocation by Bit Origin ETF Decisions Pending with 80% approval odds Entry-level support near $0.22 DOGE’s large user base and renewed institutional interest make it one of the best altcoins to buy , especially as meme coins regain popularity. Cardano (ADA) — Undervalued Layer 1 With Major Upgrades Cardano keeps changing with formal verification improvements, ecosystem growth, and a focus on compatibility. ADA Insights: Stake Pool Refactor improving scalability CIP-112 adds smart contract security 2,005 Active Projects in the ecosystem Price around $0.85 offers solid value for long-term growth For investors looking for technical rigor and ecosystem strength, ADA remains one of the best altcoins to buy on a dip. Final Thoughts: Best Altcoins to Buy Right Now The altcoin market is filled with opportunities, but these 7 projects stand out for their fundamentals, market activity, and strong catalysts. Whether you’re investing for long-term value or short-term gains, these are the best altcoins to buy this week. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the top hidden gem of 2025 and could become a breakout star for early investors. With limited token supply, explosive branding, and analyst backing for a 8500% return, it’s undeniably one of the best altcoins to buy — before the rest of the market catches on.

50469276,562566,1755828018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50469276.jpeg,First Of Its Kind: Ripple Helps Build Real-Time Crypto Crime Response System,https://bitcoinist.com/first-of-its-kind-ripple-helps-build-real-time-crypto-crime-response-system/,"Ripple has signed on as a founding member of the Beacon network, a system built to spot and stop crypto theft as it happens. It’s a move that puts a big-name company behind a new, automated method for tracking stolen funds. Short answer: it tries to catch criminals before they cash out. Beacon Offers Real-Time Alerts According to TRM Labs, the Beacon network watches flagged addresses and follows funds as they move from wallet to wallet and across different blockchains. The system sends real-time alerts to exchanges and financial firms when suspicious coins approach points where they might be cashed out. That means transfers can be noticed 24/7, and alerts arrive before funds leave an exchange. It’s not just a fancy tracker; it is made to act as an early warning system for companies that can freeze assets quickly. Ripple is proud to be a founding member of @trmlabs ’ Beacon Network — a first-of-its-kind real-time crypto crime response network. Working with industry & law enforcement, Beacon helps stop illicit funds before they exit the blockchain. Learn more: https://t.co/6Yp7IpY6Dd https://t.co/EQ0b9yFkks — Ripple (@Ripple) August 20, 2025 Major Exchanges Join In Reports have disclosed that several major platforms are already on board. Ripple, the San Francisco-based payments firm, sits alongside OKX, Crypto.com, and Anchorage Digital as inaugural members. TRM Labs also secured cooperation from Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken to share the real-time status of flagged addresses. The more firms that share information, the harder it becomes for launderers to slip through the gaps. This kind of cooperation speeds up investigations and gives law enforcement a better shot at recovering stolen coins. Real-World Pressure Test: The Bybit Heist According to reports about the February hack on Bybit, a gang tied to North Korea’s Lazarus Group made off with about $1.5 billion. That case shows why Beacon’s approach matters. Hackers used cross-chain tactics and quick movement to wash funds. When time is on the side of the thieves, freezing assets later often comes too late. Beacon aims to change that by alerting exchanges while the trail is still fresh. Gaps Remain Around Stablecoins Not everyone is a participant yet. TRM Labs did not list stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle among the initial collaborators. That’s important because stablecoins move a lot of stolen value and can be the vehicle for quick exits. If major stablecoin issuers don’t link into the system, criminals may still find ways to route funds through liquidity pools and corners of the market that aren’t watching. This is a weakness Beacon will need to close if it wants real effectiveness.

Solana has blasted past the $200 mark, fueled by growing on-chain activity and institutional demand, with targets set between $250 and $260. Meanwhile, Ethereum is riding a wave of $3.71 billion in ETF inflows while supply on exchanges drops to a three-year low, creating bullish momentum toward $5,000. But Cold Wallet is shaking things up differently. Instead of chasing charts or headlines, it’s building a cashback model that pays users. With $6.3 million raised and 740 million tokens sold, it’s already proving that demand is real. Solana’s $200 Breakout Is Built on Real Activity Solana (SOL) has broken through the $200 mark, and this time it feels different. Instead of just being another quick pump, analysts are pointing to strong fundamentals driving the move. Daily active wallets have surged to almost 3 million, DeFi activity is at record highs, and institutional buyers are paying attention. On-chain data shows Solana’s throughput has tripled since July, making the network faster and more appealing to developers. Combine that with a weaker dollar and the possibility of rate cuts, and it’s easy to see why risk assets like SOL are gaining traction. If Solana holds $200 as support, the next key resistance lies between $219–$222, opening the door to $250–$260. Ethereum’s ETF Inflows Give It New Energy Ethereum (ETH) is also showing strength. After bouncing from its $4,490 support, ETH now trades near $4,650. Resistance sits at $4,780, and a breakout could quickly push the price toward $5,000. Still, if ETH fails to clear that level, it risks sliding back to its support zone. The real story lies in ETF activity. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $3.71 billion in inflows in just eight days. Meanwhile, exchange reserves have dropped to a three-year low, signalling supply is tightening. With strong institutional backing and less ETH available to trade, conditions are lining up for further bullish pressure. Ethereum is once again proving why it’s considered the backbone of crypto. Cold Wallet Pays Users Instead of Draining Them Here’s where things get really interesting. Cold Wallet isn’t playing the same game as Solana and Ethereum. While those projects depend on market moves and technical charts, Cold Wallet is focused on one thing: rewarding its users. Every swap, bridge, and gas fee generates cashback in CWT. Instead of losing money on fees, users actually earn from them. This approach isn’t a dream, it’s already live. With $6.3 million raised and 740 million tokens sold at Stage 17 pricing of $0.00998, Cold Wallet has serious traction. The confirmed launch price of $0.3517 means early participants could see a potential 3,423% ROI. And since the presale runs across 150 stages, waiting only means paying more for less upside. The scale is already there, too. Cold Wallet gained over 2 million active users through its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, giving it an instant community before launch. Cashback can cover up to 100% of gas fees, along with rebates on swaps and ramps, with no staking or lock-ins required. It’s direct, simple, and user-first. Cold Wallet doesn’t sell hype, it delivers utility. It turns every transaction into an opportunity, flipping the idea of wallets from storage tools into income sources. In a space crowded with speculation, it’s a model that makes sense for everyday crypto use. Why These Three Coins Are Worth Watching Closely Solana is proving its rally is more than a quick pump, supported by adoption and institutional interest. Ethereum’s ETF inflows and shrinking supply point to further upside if resistance breaks. Cold Wallet, though, is rewriting the rules by rewarding users instead of charging them. With millions raised, hundreds of millions of tokens sold, and 2 million active users already in place, it’s showing that crypto wallets can be profitable, not painful. Each of these projects has a different story to tell, but if the goal is combining utility with growth, Cold Wallet is the one rewriting the playbook.

This volatility has sparked widespread speculation about the current state of the bull market, the potential for an ongoing “alt season,” and whether Bitcoin has reached its peak. In light of the current price action, market expert Miles Deutscher has shared insights on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), suggesting that August may be viewed as a significant trap in the crypto market. Two Scenarios For Bitcoin First, Deutscher points out a significant change in market strength. Ethereum (ETH) seems to be outperforming Bitcoin in terms of both price and narrative. He claims that Bitcoin has been showing signs of structural weakness since early July. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm—Bitcoin Could Slide Toward $88K A key factor contributing to this downturn, according to the expert’s analysis, is the diminishing influence of Strategy’s (MicroStrategy) treasury purchases, which previously fueled the cryptocurrency’s last rally. Deutscher asserts that this decline in demand has resulted in stalling momentum for BTC, leading him to speculate that it may remain range-bound until further clarity emerges from upcoming interest rate decisions. In his analysis, Deutscher outlines two potential scenarios for the Bitcoin price trajectory. The first possibility involves a dip to the lows around $111,000, which could coincide with Ethereum’s critical support level of $4,000. The second scenario envisions a reclaiming of the mid-range price of $115,500, which could pave the way for renewed upward momentum. Conversely, the narrative surrounding Ethereum continues to significantly gain traction, bolstered by an estimated $27 billion in sidelined capital poised for investment in the decentralized asset token (DAT) ecosystem. What’s Next For Ethereum And Crypto Market? Interestingly, ETH has recently surpassed BTC in terms of trading volume for treasury companies. Deutscher notes that this trend suggests Ethereum still has considerable room for growth relative to Bitcoin, making it a less saturated trade. This relative strength is reflected in the performance of altcoins, which have shown resilience against Bitcoin. Unlike past corrections, where altcoins suffered significant losses, this time the altcoin market has maintained support and exhibited bullish signals. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holder Count Surges Toward New All-Time Highs — Here Are The Figures Amid the current market reaction, macroeconomic factors have played a crucial role in price action. Uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) policies, in light of the upcoming Jackson Hole speech, has led to a wave of de-risking among investors. The market’s response to hot Producer Price Index (PPI) data is also highlighted as it has altered expectations regarding interest rate cuts, heightening fears of a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve, contributing to the recent sell-off. Deutscher anticipates that this market behavior may lead to a “classic sell into the end of the month” pattern, particularly as September historically presents volatility for Bitcoin. However, the expert posits that once the uncertainty dissipates, particularly following the Jackson Hole event and the subsequent rate decision next month, the market may be well-positioned for another attempt at new highs. When writing, BTC trades at $113,000, attempting to consolidate 9% below its all-time high reached on August 14.

50469951,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=789537,1755828555,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/50469951.jpeg,Crypto handheld buyers hit with sudden import charges,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-handheld-buyers-hit-with-sudden-import-charges/,"Gamers who bought Mysten Labs’ new crypto handheld say they’re getting unexpected import charges, sometimes worth hundreds of dollars, as current U.S. trade rules take effect. Early SuiPlay0X1 customers point to President Donald Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs,” and the company has halted its next shipment while it addresses complaints and estimates likely costs. Mysten told Decrypt it is temporarily holding the next batch while it reviews customer feedback and tallies border charges. The SuiPlay0X1 is a portable PC in the mold of Valve’s Steam Deck, but it includes a built-in crypto wallet for Sui blockchain games. It can also run titles from Steam and the Epic Games Store, among other storefronts. The hardware was built with startup Playtron and runs its GameOS. Flat price, thin margins leave Mysten unable to absorb Fees The firm produced 10,000 units for early adopters at a single global sticker price of $599 in more than 100 countries, a figure it says sits close to the per-unit build cost. With such thin margin, the company emailed buyers on Thursday to say it can’t cover the surprise import charges for everyone. “At this small scale, it is not possible to absorb tariffs and duties which differ for every country,” the email read. “It’s important to note: Mysten Labs does not receive any portion of duty fees or taxes. These are set by local and international governments and apply to all cross-border purchases. Given the unpredictable macroeconomic climate, we could not forecast how these fees might change during shipping.” DHL notified this week that more than $138 in duty was due before delivery in Illinois. The parcel originated in Hong Kong . Goods from Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, are currently hit with a 20% tariff when entering the United States. A prior de minimis rule let items under $800 avoid those charges, but Trump ended that relief in April via executive order. Posts on social media and in the official Sui Discord show similar requests for some buyers, while others report far higher totals for one unit, some said DHL sought about $348. A Mysten representative confirmed the wide range of assessments and told customers facing “excessive” bills to email support. The message also suggested residents of certain U.S. states appear to be seeing higher amounts than others. “No customer should be charged duties equal to half their purchase price,” Mysten Labs wrote to buyers. More units delayed until late August When asked how it would assist customers with larger charges, the company did not offer specifics. “While federal duties are harmonized across the U.S., some additional state taxes can apply, as well as courier fees for administering the charge and managing payments,” the representative said. “At this time, we are unsure of the differences in duties and shipping fees between different regions of the U.S., though we are actively working to determine what these are.” With those questions unresolved, Mysten says it has paused further SuiPlay0X1 shipments. So far, 2,000 devices have been delivered; the next tranche of 3,000 is on hold. The company expects to restart deliveries by the end of August. The situation has also sparked jokes and memes. One X user said they “love seeing innovation on Sui” with the “new Tariff-Drop model.” But many customers say the surprise costs are frustrating. “If the outstanding duties of $138.11 stand, how do I get a refund?” one buyer asked in Discord. “I won’t want this product if the fees are this high—especially since I would feel purposely misled by the SuiPlay team about the total cost.” Get seen where it counts.

Top New Meme Coin to Invest in Now Revealed Among 4 Hot Picks,https://timestabloid.com/shocking-gains-ahead-top-new-meme-coin-to-invest-in-now/,"What if just one early presale buy turned a $4,000 punt into life-changing money? The crypto market has seen Dogecoin millionaires, Shiba Inu dreamers, and Solana fanatics pull insane gains. But the next question every trader asks is simple—which is the top new meme coin to invest in now? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) , Banana For Scale (BANANAS31), SLERF (SLERF), and Bonk (BONK) are the tokens investors can’t stop talking about. Out of all of them, Arctic Pablo Coin has stolen the spotlight with its mythical backstory, stage 37 presale, and a staggering 100% BONUS offer that doubles tokens instantly. Let’s dig into why APC is roaring ahead as the top new meme coin to invest in now, while also breaking down other meme projects worth watching. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC): The Bullish Presale With 1718% ROI Potential In the Arctic wilderness, it is said that an explorer named Pablo stumbled upon coins glowing with mystical energy—those coins are now known as the Arctic Pablo Coin. The project isn’t just about memes; it’s about building an ecosystem that combines staking, referrals, community competitions, and deflationary tokenomics. The Rewards That Set APC Apart Arctic Pablo Coin offers staking at a jaw-dropping 66% APY, referral rewards for inviting friends, and real USD prizes for community competitions. Beyond the memes, APC runs on Binance Smart Chain for speed, scalability, and low transaction costs. Its token burn mechanism ensures unsold tokens disappear forever, making supply tighter and value firmer over time. Stage 37 Presale Details: Why This Is the Moment The presale is currently at Stage 37 (Ice Ice Baby), more than 98% complete. Each APC is priced at $0.00088, and over $3.53 million has already been raised. Analysts project two ROI points: 809% ROI if APC hits the listing price of $0.008 11,263% ROI if APC climbs to the predicted moon target of $0.1 Now here’s where it gets wild: at Stage 37, early joiners are already sitting on gains of over 5,766% compared to Stage 1 buyers. Investment Math: Why People Are Going All In Let’s run a quick example. An investor drops $4,000 at the current presale price of $0.00088. That nets 4.54 million APC tokens. But with the BONUS100 offer, the tokens double instantly to 9.09 million APC. At listing ($0.008), those tokens are worth $72,727—a 1718% gain. If APC climbs to the forecasted $0.1, that same $4,000 turns into a life-changing $909,000. This bonus won’t last long. Once Stage 37 closes, the doubled token offer vanishes. Missing this could be one of those stories told like “remember when Shiba Inu was dirt cheap?” Why Arctic Pablo Coin Dominates This List Arctic Pablo Coin made it here as the top new meme coin to invest in now because of its unmatched meme coin presale structure, lucrative staking, and a presale bonus that could rewrite early investor stories in 2025. 2. Banana For Scale (BANANAS31): The Viral Meme Challenger Few coins embrace meme culture like Banana For Scale (BANANAS31). Known for its quirky branding and banana-themed community contests, this coin has managed to carve out a loyal fan base. Developers are adding gamified staking pools and a banana-swap DEX that could bring more attention to the ecosystem. Why this coin belongs to the top new meme coins to invest in now: BANANAS31 earned its spot thanks to strong meme energy, loyal backers, and new utility in DeFi that could sustain long-term growth. 3. SLERF (SLERF): A Token Born From Chaos SLERF’s claim to fame came from an infamous burn event where its entire presale funds were mistakenly sent to a dead wallet. Instead of dying, SLERF became a cult classic. Now, it’s proving resilience with community-driven marketing campaigns and surprise airdrops to loyal holders. Why SLERF is worth noting: The community has turned a blunder into a movement, making it one of the most resilient meme tokens in recent memory. 4. Bonk (BONK): Solana’s Meme Favorite As the first meme token on the Solana network, Bonk (BONK) became the “dog token” for Solana enthusiasts. Its airdrops to NFT holders kicked off one of the most viral runs on Solana in late 2023. Developers are working on integrations with Solana-based DeFi platforms, ensuring BONK remains relevant in 2025. Why Bonk deserves mention: BONK makes this list of the top new meme coins to invest in now because of its massive community and its position as the flagship meme coin of the Solana blockchain.

Kraken, a leading centralized exchange, has made a truly groundbreaking move by fully integrating SSV Network’s Decentralized Validator Technology (DVT) into its Ethereum staking services. This isn’t just a minor technical update; it’s a strategic leap forward for security, reliability, and the overall robustness of the staking ecosystem. This adoption positions Kraken at the forefront of innovation. What is Decentralized Validator Technology and Why Does it Matter? Let’s break down what Decentralized Validator Technology actually means for the average user. Essentially, DVT takes the critical task of running an Ethereum validator and intelligently splits its key responsibilities across several independent, non-trusting nodes. Think of it like a highly secure vault requiring multiple keys, each held by a different, trusted operator. If one operator faces an issue, the vault remains protected and accessible. This innovative approach drastically improves several key areas, making staking far more resilient: Enhanced Fault Tolerance: If one node experiences a temporary issue or goes offline, other nodes can seamlessly take over its duties. This prevents downtime and ensures continuous operation. Increased Uptime: Validators remain operational more consistently. Consequently, this maximizes the potential rewards earned by stakers and reduces the risk of penalties. Superior Security: Distributing the validator’s signing keys across multiple operators significantly reduces the risk of a single point of failure or a malicious attack. It creates a stronger, more distributed defense. Therefore, DVT makes Ethereum staking inherently more robust, secure, and resilient for all participants. Kraken’s Bold Move: Pioneering Decentralized Validator Technology Adoption Kraken’s decision to deploy Decentralized Validator Technology at scale is a truly significant development for the entire crypto industry. They are the first major centralized exchange to embrace this cutting-edge solution, effectively setting a new benchmark for how staking services should operate. This move clearly demonstrates Kraken’s unwavering commitment to offering the most secure and reliable staking options available to its vast user base. Historically, centralized exchanges managing large staking pools have faced inherent challenges related to potential single points of failure. By adopting DVT, Kraken is actively mitigating these risks, offering a more decentralized and resilient service even within its centralized framework. This proactive and forward-thinking step could inspire other major platforms to follow suit, leading to widespread adoption of DVT. How Does This Benefit Ethereum Stakers? For anyone currently staking Ethereum with Kraken, or considering it, this integration brings tangible and immediate advantages. You might be wondering, “What does this mean directly for my staked ETH and my rewards?” The impact is quite positive. Here’s how Kraken’s adoption of Decentralized Validator Technology directly benefits you as a staker: Greater Peace of Mind: Your staked assets are now protected by a more robust, fault-tolerant, and distributed infrastructure. This reduces concerns about validator performance. More Consistent Rewards: With reduced validator downtime and enhanced operational stability, your validator is far more likely to be online and earning rewards consistently. Future-Proof Staking: Kraken is investing in the long-term health and security of Ethereum staking. This ensures your participation remains sustainable and aligned with the network’s evolution. Ultimately, this means a safer, more efficient, and potentially more profitable staking experience for Kraken users, backed by advanced technology. The Future of Staking: Decentralized Validator Technology’s Transformative Potential Kraken’s full integration of Decentralized Validator Technology isn’t just about one exchange making a smart move; it’s a powerful signal for the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This adoption validates DVT as a critical and necessary component for building scalable, secure, and highly resilient staking operations. We are now likely to see an acceleration in institutional players and even individual stakers exploring and implementing DVT solutions across the board. This technology actively moves us closer to a truly decentralized and robust Ethereum network, where the risks associated with large, concentrated staking pools are significantly minimized. Moreover, it empowers a broader range of participants to operate validators with unprecedented levels of enhanced security and reliability. The future of Ethereum staking looks increasingly robust and decentralized, thanks to transformative innovations like DVT. Summary: Kraken’s full integration of SSV Network’s Decentralized Validator Technology marks a pivotal and revolutionary moment for Ethereum staking. By dramatically enhancing fault tolerance, uptime, and security through distributed key responsibilities, Kraken is not only improving its own services but also setting a formidable new industry standard. This bold step offers significant, tangible benefits to stakers and paves the way for a more resilient, efficient, and truly decentralized future for the entire Ethereum network. It’s a clear win for security, operational excellence, and the ongoing evolution of crypto staking. Frequently Asked Questions About Decentralized Validator Technology Q1: What exactly is Decentralized Validator Technology (DVT)? A1: Decentralized Validator Technology (DVT) is an innovative protocol that splits the operation of a single Ethereum validator across multiple independent nodes. This distribution of key responsibilities enhances security, fault tolerance, and uptime by eliminating single points of failure. Q2: How does Kraken’s adoption of DVT benefit Ethereum stakers? A2: For Ethereum stakers on Kraken, DVT means enhanced security, greater peace of mind, and more consistent staking rewards. The distributed nature of DVT reduces the risk of downtime and slashing penalties, leading to a more reliable and efficient staking experience. Q3: Is Decentralized Validator Technology only for centralized exchanges like Kraken? A3: No, while Kraken is the first major centralized exchange to adopt it at scale, Decentralized Validator Technology is a versatile technology. It can also be used by individual stakers, staking pools, and decentralized protocols to improve the resilience and security of their validator operations. Q4: What role does SSV Network play in this integration? A4: SSV Network provides the underlying Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) infrastructure that Kraken has integrated. SSV Network specializes in enabling this decentralized operation of Ethereum validators, offering the tools and protocols necessary for such advanced deployments. Q5: Does this integration make Ethereum more decentralized? A5: Yes, in essence, it does. By distributing validator operations, even within a centralized service like Kraken, the underlying infrastructure becomes more resilient and less prone to centralized points of failure. This moves the entire Ethereum ecosystem towards greater decentralization and robustness. Q6: Are there any risks associated with using Decentralized Validator Technology? A6: While DVT significantly reduces risks associated with single points of failure, no technology is entirely risk-free. However, DVT is designed to mitigate many common risks in staking, such as validator downtime and potential slashing events, by distributing responsibilities and enhancing fault tolerance.

Understanding why capital moves out of investment products like spot Bitcoin ETFs is crucial. Net outflows mean that more money was withdrawn from these ETFs than was invested on a particular day. This recent trend suggests a shift in investor sentiment, possibly driven by a combination of factors: Profit-Taking: After periods of price appreciation, some investors might choose to realize their gains, leading to sell-offs. Broader Market Sentiment: Macroeconomic concerns, interest rate changes, or general risk-off sentiment in traditional markets can influence crypto investments. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions or lack of clarity around crypto regulations can sometimes cause investors to pull back. While a single day’s data provides a snapshot, five consecutive days of outflows signal a more persistent pattern that warrants closer examination. Analyzing Key Players in Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflows The recent data from Trader T on X offers a detailed look at which specific spot Bitcoin ETFs contributed most to the overall net outflows. It wasn’t a uniform movement across all funds; some saw substantial withdrawals, while others managed to attract new capital. BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund led the outflows significantly, with $129.07 million exiting. As one of the largest and most popular ETFs, its movements often have a magnified impact. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Following IBIT, ARKB experienced $43.28 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s offering saw $31.77 million in withdrawals, adding to the cumulative outflow figure. Interestingly, not all funds were in the red. Franklin’s EZBC recorded inflows of $3.25 million, and Grayscale’s mini BTC saw $4.97 million in inflows. This divergence indicates that while a general trend of outflows exists, some specific products or investor preferences still find opportunities. Understanding the Market Impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Outflows When significant capital exits these investment vehicles, it can have ripple effects across the broader cryptocurrency market. While ETFs are designed to track Bitcoin’s price, large outflows can contribute to downward price pressure on Bitcoin itself. This happens as ETF providers might need to sell underlying Bitcoin to meet redemption requests. Moreover, sustained outflows can affect investor confidence. If institutional and retail investors perceive a lack of demand or a negative trend in these regulated investment products, it could lead to broader skepticism towards Bitcoin as an asset class. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market is highly dynamic, and sentiment can shift rapidly based on new information or developments. What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The recent outflow trend for spot Bitcoin ETFs is a crucial data point, but it does not necessarily dictate the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin or its investment vehicles. Investors and analysts will be closely monitoring several factors in the coming days and weeks. Future inflow/outflow data will be key, as will broader macroeconomic indicators and any new regulatory announcements concerning digital assets. The ability of these financial products to attract and retain capital is vital for their long-term success and for fostering broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin. While a challenging period, such movements are a natural part of a maturing market. The resilience of Bitcoin and the continued innovation within the crypto space remain compelling factors for many. The recent $195.9 million net outflows from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 21 mark a notable shift in market dynamics. While leading funds like BlackRock’s IBIT saw significant withdrawals, some smaller ETFs managed to attract capital. This period of consecutive outflows highlights the evolving sentiment in the crypto investment landscape, reminding us that vigilance and adaptability are essential in navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs? U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Bitcoin as their underlying asset. They allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency themselves, offering a regulated and accessible investment vehicle. Why did U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs experience net outflows on August 21? The net outflows on August 21, part of a five-day trend, likely stem from a combination of factors. These can include investors taking profits after price increases, broader negative sentiment in the financial markets, or concerns related to macroeconomic conditions that lead investors to reduce their risk exposure. Which specific spot Bitcoin ETFs saw the largest outflows? On August 21, BlackRock’s IBIT led with $129.07 million in outflows. It was followed by ARK Invest’s ARKB with $43.28 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $31.77 million. However, some funds like Franklin’s EZBC and Grayscale’s mini BTC actually recorded inflows. How do these outflows impact the broader Bitcoin market? Significant outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs can contribute to downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, as ETF providers may need to sell Bitcoin to meet redemption requests. It can also affect overall investor confidence in the digital asset space, although the crypto market is known for its rapid shifts in sentiment. Is this outflow trend expected to continue for spot Bitcoin ETFs? It is challenging to predict definitively. The continuation of this trend will depend on various factors, including future Bitcoin price movements, evolving macroeconomic conditions, and any new regulatory developments. Investors should closely monitor subsequent inflow/outflow data and broader market signals. Did you find this analysis of spot Bitcoin ETFs insightful?

Despite broader market consolidation in recent days, BNB’s performance marked a 2.6% increase in the past 24 hours. The development has drawn notable attention from traders and analysts, many of whom are now evaluating whether the momentum is sustainable. CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain shared insights on the rally, pointing to both technical signals and on-chain data as key factors behind the altcoin’s latest upward movement. According to his analysis, the decisive breakout above the $800–$810 resistance zone has turned that range into an important support level. He noted that maintaining this threshold could sustain bullish sentiment, with the $900 level emerging as the next psychological target. Related Reading: BNB Price Coiling for Breakout—Next Leg Higher in Sight Technical and On-Chain Analysis of BNB On the technical side, the altcoin’s entry into “price discovery” mode has raised questions about the sustainability of its rally. CryptoOnchain explained that breaking above historical resistance levels typically attracts new inflows and strengthens confidence in long-term holding. From an on-chain perspective, the analyst highlighted “Rolling Percentage Gains” across multiple timeframes. The data suggests that all major holder cohorts, from short-term to long-term investors, are currently in profit. This reduces potential sell pressure as investors are less motivated to exit positions. At the same time, accelerating short-term gains reflect fresh demand, while one-year rolling gains indicate that the rally is not merely speculative but backed by sustained accumulation. According to CryptoOnchain, the combination of these factors presents a case for continued strength as long as the altcoin holds above the $800 support zone. “The technical breakout is supported by confident, profitable holders,” he wrote. “As long as BNB holds the crucial $800 support level, the outlook for testing higher targets remains highly favorable.” Analysts See Potential for $1,000 Beyond technical and on-chain metrics, independent market observers are also weighing in on the altcoin’s trajectory. A crypto analyst known as BitBull on X noted that BNB’s new all-time high coincides with a structural shift in its price action. The token’s long-standing resistance has now flipped into support, creating what he described as conditions for further growth. “$BNB hit a new ATH of $880 today. It has now flipped its multi-year resistance level into support. With public-listed companies bidding BNB, $1K BNB is just a matter of time,” BitBull commented.

While some have struggled to maintain relevance, BNB has consistently grown in utility, supported by Binance’s ecosystem, which includes trading fee discounts, token launches, and blockchain infrastructure through the BNB Chain. This dynamic has helped position the token as one of the top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

The measures include actions against banks, exchanges, and individuals accused of facilitating a ruble-backed stablecoin network that processed billions of dollars in transactions. According to a statement from the UK government, the blacklisted entities are linked to a $9.3 billion stablecoin known as A7A5, which was designed to replicate the ruble on blockchain platforms. Officials claim the network was a direct attempt to mitigate the impact of sanctions imposed on Moscow following its invasion of Ukraine. The new measures build upon more than 2,700 existing UK sanctions on Russia and mirror steps taken by the United States earlier this month . Crypto Exchanges and Stablecoin Network Under Scrutiny Among those sanctioned was the Capital Bank of Central Asia and its director, Kantemir Chalbayev, who the UK says played a role in financing goods for Russia’s military. Two Kyrgyz-based crypto exchanges, Grinex and Meer, were also placed on the sanctions list. Authorities allege these platforms were central to transactions involving the A7A5 stablecoin, which moved $9.3 billion worth of value within four months. In addition, several entities and individuals tied to the network’s infrastructure were named, including Luxembourg-based Altair Holding, CJSC Tengricoin, Old Vector, and A7A5 director Leonid Shumakov. UK Sanctions Minister Stephen Doughty emphasized that the measures were aimed at stopping Moscow from turning to alternative financial systems: “If the Kremlin thinks they can hide their attempts to soften the blow of our sanctions by laundering transactions through crypto networks, they are mistaken.” Grinex, one of the sanctioned exchanges, has been widely described as a successor to Garantex, a Russian-linked exchange previously targeted by regulators. Earlier this year, Tether froze $27 million in USDT linked to Garantex after US authorities accused the platform of facilitating illicit transactions. Kyrgyzstan’s Response and Broader Implications The announcement drew an immediate response from Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov, who criticized the UK’s decision and warned against politicizing the country’s banking sector. Japarov stated that none of Kyrgyzstan’s 21 banks were engaged in helping Russia evade sanctions. To limit exposure, he explained that only the state-owned Keremet Bank is authorized to process transactions involving the Russian ruble. Keremet, however, was sanctioned by the US earlier this year for its role in handling Russian trade payments. Japarov also stressed Kyrgyzstan’s commitment to honoring international agreements, stating: “I will not allow the interests of our citizens and the trade and economic development of the country to be reduced to nothing.” The latest sanctions highlight the growing focus on crypto-financial networks as tools used to bypass restrictions. Western governments have increasingly scrutinized stablecoins and exchanges operating outside traditional banking channels , with both the US and UK arguing that such platforms could weaken the effectiveness of global sanctions regimes.

While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the bedrock of most portfolios, the real growth often comes from identifying early-stage projects before they explode . One name repeatedly featured as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025 for high-growth portfolios is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is drawing attention as investors look for ways to multiply small investments into significant returns. Building a Smarter Crypto Portfolio Many newcomers make the mistake of chasing hype without a plan. Instead, a strong portfolio starts with fundamentals. Doing your own research ( DYOR ) is essential – examining a project’s whitepaper, real-world use case, and the strength of its community. Equally important is knowing your own risk tolerance, as crypto’s volatility is not for the faint of heart. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification also plays a vital role. By spreading investments across different sectors such as DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 scaling solutions, investors reduce the risk of a single asset dragging down their entire portfolio. Strategies That Work Over Time One of the most reliable methods for long-term growth is dollar-cost averaging (DCA). By investing small amounts consistently, investors smooth out the market’s ups and downs. Another effective approach is the core-and-satellite model: keeping the bulk of capital in large-cap assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum while allocating a smaller percentage toward higher-growth altcoins. Regular portfolio rebalancing ensures that profits are locked in and reinvested wisely rather than letting gains become overexposed. New Altcoin With Huge Potential Within the high-growth altcoin category, MAGACOIN FINANCE has been singled out as a standout opportunity. Its presale rounds are selling out rapidly, and analysts are pointing to its potential for outsized gains in the upcoming cycle. With great return predictions , even a modest investment could multiply dramatically if the project continues to hit its milestones. This kind of asymmetric upside is exactly what savvy investors look for when building a portfolio designed to turn small amounts into big money. The project even hit a new record , reaching $12.5 million in funding. Security Cannot Be Overlooked No matter how strong the portfolio, none of it matters without proper security. Long-term holdings should be stored in a hardware wallet, while enabling two-factor authentication across all accounts is a must. Investors must also remain vigilant against scams, as guaranteed returns and suspicious offers remain common traps in the crypto space. Conclusion Growing wealth in crypto doesn’t require reckless risk-taking. By focusing on research, diversification, and proven strategies like DCA and rebalancing, investors can steadily build strong portfolios. For those willing to take calculated bets , opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the kind of upside that could turn small investments into significant profits in the coming years.

Stellar’s strong weekly surge and Tron’s climb toward new highs are examples of that momentum. But while both rely on charts and future signals, Cold Wallet is already proving its worth. The app is live, cashback rewards are working, and referrals are paying in USDT. All of this is happening before the project has even been listed. With more than $6.3M raised so far, Cold Wallet is no longer just a presale project. It’s a platform that is already functioning, already rewarding, and already shaping how people look at utility-driven crypto. Cold Wallet Is Delivering Before Its Launch What makes Cold Wallet so different is that it has already achieved what most projects only talk about after listing. The app is live, cashback rewards are active, and referrals are sending real USDT to users today. That kind of traction ahead of launch is rare, and it explains why momentum around the presale keeps growing. Stage 17 is currently open, with CWT priced at $0.00998. The confirmed listing price is $0.3517. That leaves a clear path for gains of 3423 percent for those entering now, while the earliest backers who joined in Stage 1 are already looking at a potential 4900 percent return. Unlike speculative projections, these numbers are locked in by the presale structure. The presale has raised over $6.3M, with more than 740 million tokens already sold. Growth accelerated after the $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet, which instantly added 2 million active users to the ecosystem. This gave Cold Wallet a head start that most projects can only hope for, putting it on a fast track to adoption. What sets it apart even further is its utility. Cold Wallet rewards users on gas fees, swaps, and transfers through cashback, creating ongoing benefits without staking or lockups. In a space where wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet often face complaints over costs and usability, Cold Wallet offers a friendlier design and a reward mechanism that turns everyday use into tangible gains. Every stage that closes raises the entry point, which is why the urgency is real. Cold Wallet is not just another presale; it’s already proving itself, and that is why many now see it as the top crypto to buy ahead of launch. Stellar Price Action Points to Bigger Moves Stellar has impressed with a 12.4 percent weekly gain, driving XLM to $0.4533. Trading volume has topped $706M, and the setup now puts $0.50 as the next critical resistance. Should that level break, Fibonacci extensions point to targets at $0.6083, $0.7194, and even $0.7733. On-chain signals support the move. Open interest has risen 13 percent to $431.87M, while funding rates remain in positive territory. Together, these indicators reflect growing demand and confidence from long-term holders. This is not just a short-term pump. Stellar’s latest breakout attempt shows strength backed by volume and positioning. Those waiting for perfect confirmation may find themselves late to the rally once the next resistance clears. Tron Eyes a Major Price Target Tron is also showing serious momentum. TRX trades around $0.3685, only a step below its all-time high of $0.44. Analysts now point to a 20 percent upside, setting a short-term price target near $0.44 if current strength continues. The technicals are aligned with this move. Support levels remain firm, and trading interest is increasing. At the same time, on-chain traction is undeniable. Tron now manages more than 80 percent of the USDT supply, making it one of the most important networks for stablecoin transfers. That usage gives credibility to the rally. Long-term holders are already sitting on gains of more than 150 percent, showing how consistent accumulation pays off. Price gaps do not stay open forever, and with both fundamentals and technicals pointing higher, Tron’s setup is one worth watching. Cold Wallet Proves Itself While Others Wait Stellar is rising, and Tron is preparing for its next move. Both may see impressive breakouts, but they remain tied to charts and projections. Cold Wallet, by contrast, is already rewarding its users with cashback and referral payouts in USDT before listing even begins. With over $6.3M raised in presale, a live product, and more than 740 million tokens sold at $0.00998 in Stage 17, Cold Wallet is showing that real delivery can outshine speculation. For those looking for the top crypto to buy right now, the decision becomes clear. While others talk about potential, Cold Wallet is already proving it.

Utility, transparency, and proven usability are quickly replacing hype as the deciding factors. That shift has made SpacePay and BlockDAG two of the most talked-about presales of 2025. SpacePay is positioning itself as a payments-first platform, aiming to make crypto spendable at physical retail locations. It’s a big promise with high potential, though execution remains uncertain. BlockDAG(BDAG) , on the other hand, is focusing on reshaping the presale itself. Its newly launched Dashboard V4 delivers real-time functionality typically reserved for post-launch ecosystems. With both names gaining momentum, the conversation is no longer about which project is more ambitious, but which one is already delivering. SpacePay’s Retail Vision Faces Real-World Challenges SpacePay has positioned itself as a solution for making crypto usable in everyday transactions. The idea is to enable seamless payments by linking digital wallets to existing retail point-of-sale systems. It’s a straightforward pitch, and the $SPY Token is being marketed as the key to unlocking this payment utility. However, the gap between concept and execution remains wide. Successful implementation will require large-scale merchant integration, regulatory clearance, and reliable infrastructure. At this stage, SpacePay has not announced any major partnerships or demonstrated active deployment of its system. The excitement around the $SPY Token price is largely speculative, riding on potential rather than progress. Adding to the pressure is competition from other platforms already testing similar solutions. Without a clear path to market, SpacePay risks losing momentum. Until there is proof of real-world traction, investor interest may be driven more by hope than fundamentals. Why BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 Is More Than Just a Presale Portal While SpacePay claims to be building real-world functionality, BlockDAG is transforming the presale experience itself. Its new Dashboard V4 doesn’t just show buyers their coins, it immerses them in a real-time crypto environment that feels like a post-launch exchange. This isn’t common in the presale world, where most dashboards offer little more than a purchase receipt. BlockDAG’s Dashboard V4 includes live BDAG charts, order books, wallet balance updates, and interactive tools for referrals, bonuses, and rankings. The entire platform feels like a working DeFi interface, offering immediate feedback and trading simulations. This creates not only engagement, but trust. Buyers aren’t left in the dark, they’re actively involved, watching their position shift in real time. But this isn’t just about user experience. It’s a strategic play. By familiarizing users with post-launch tools during the presale, BlockDAG lowers the barrier to trading adoption. The dashboard’s gamified features and daily rankings keep participants engaged long after their purchase. The interface even displays daily purchase activity and bonus tracking to help users gauge their standing and referrals. This kind of transparency boosts credibility and makes the experience feel more like an ecosystem than a presale. As of now, BlockDAG has raised $379 million, sold 25.3 billion coins. The $0.0276 price in batch 29 represents a 2660% ROI for early holders since batch 1, with that figure continuing to rise. By combining strategic design with presale innovation, BlockDAG is giving buyers a reason to stay long after their initial investment. Where Speculation Ends & Substance Begins Choosing between SpacePay and BlockDAG ultimately comes down to how much weight investors place on usability versus engagement. SpacePay presents a polished idea for bridging crypto with everyday commerce, and the $SPY Token price reflects growing optimism. But optimism alone won’t ensure adoption. Without merchant partnerships or working retail integrations, the real-world use case remains largely hypothetical. In contrast, BlockDAG is showing rather than telling. Its Dashboard V4 gives participants access to tools they’ll actually use post-launch, including live charts, instant balance updates, order books, and performance tracking. It isn’t just about buying a token. It’s about stepping into a platform that functions like a live product. For now, SpacePay sells a vision that still needs proving while BlockDAG delivers a working system that users can test, explore, and interact with in real time. As more investors gravitate toward presales with visible infrastructure, BlockDAG’s hands-on approach may offer a clearer path to sustained engagement and long-term confidence. In Conclusion SpacePay and BlockDAG are leading a shift toward real utility and user-centered design. With SpacePay focused on enabling global crypto payments and the $SPY Token price gaining momentum, it’s quickly earning a spot on top watchlists, but questions remain about adoption. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is redefining what it means to participate in a presale altogether. Dashboard V4 turns the passive buyer into an active participant, setting a new standard for crypto launches.

Over the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market witnessed significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation events, impacting major assets like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Solana (SOL). This breakdown offers a clear look at these liquidations, helping you grasp the underlying market sentiment and potential risks. What is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto perpetual futures liquidation means. When a trader opens a leveraged position (either long or short) in perpetual futures, they borrow funds to amplify their potential gains. However, if the market moves significantly against their position, their collateral might no longer cover the potential losses. At a certain point, the exchange automatically closes their position to prevent further losses, a process known as liquidation. This automated closure is designed to protect both the trader and the exchange. It’s a critical mechanism in highly leveraged trading, highlighting the inherent volatility and risk involved. Understanding liquidation helps traders assess market stability and sentiment. The Last 24 Hours: A Detailed Liquidation Breakdown The recent 24-hour period saw substantial liquidation volumes across key cryptocurrencies. This data provides a snapshot of where traders faced the most pressure and in which direction. Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $83.31 million in ETH positions were liquidated. Notably, 56.07% of these were ‘long’ positions, meaning traders betting on ETH’s price increase were caught off guard. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin experienced $45.72 million in liquidations. An even higher percentage, 73.82%, consisted of ‘long’ positions, indicating a strong downward pressure or unexpected price dip for BTC. Solana (SOL): Solana also saw significant activity with $11.63 million in liquidations. A dominant 76.42% of these were ‘long’ positions, reflecting similar market sentiment to BTC. These figures reveal a clear trend: a majority of liquidated positions were long, suggesting that the market experienced a downward price movement that caught bullish traders by surprise. This phenomenon underscores the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency markets. Why Do We See Such Significant Crypto Liquidation Events? Several factors contribute to large crypto perpetual futures liquidation volumes. Market volatility is the primary driver. Sudden price swings, often triggered by macroeconomic news, regulatory updates, or large institutional trades, can quickly push leveraged positions past their liquidation thresholds. The use of high leverage amplifies both potential profits and losses, making traders more susceptible to these rapid market movements. Moreover, cascading liquidations can occur. When one large position is liquidated, it can create selling pressure, which in turn triggers further liquidations, creating a domino effect. This chain reaction often leads to sharp, rapid price declines or increases, catching many off guard. Navigating the Risks: Actionable Insights for Traders For traders engaging in perpetual futures, understanding and managing risk is paramount. The recent crypto perpetual futures liquidation data serves as a powerful reminder of market volatility. Here are some actionable insights: Manage Leverage Wisely: Avoid excessively high leverage, as it drastically increases your liquidation risk. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to automatically close your position if the price moves against you beyond a predefined point, limiting potential losses. Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your capital into one highly leveraged position. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis to anticipate potential price movements. By adopting these practices, traders can better protect their capital and navigate the inherent risks of futures trading. The Broader Market Impact of Liquidations Significant liquidation events are not just individual misfortunes; they also offer insights into broader market sentiment. A high volume of long liquidations, as seen in the past 24 hours, often signals a bearish sentiment or a market correction. Conversely, high short liquidations could indicate a bullish reversal. These events can also impact spot market prices, as liquidated positions might involve forced selling of underlying assets. Monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data can therefore be a valuable tool for understanding the overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market, providing context beyond simple price charts. The past 24 hours have underscored the dynamic and often unforgiving nature of the crypto perpetual futures market. With millions in ETH, BTC, and SOL long positions liquidated, traders are reminded of the critical importance of risk management and staying informed. While futures trading offers exciting opportunities, it demands a disciplined approach to protect capital from sudden market shifts. Always trade responsibly and prioritize capital preservation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What exactly is crypto perpetual futures liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation is the automatic closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange when their collateral falls below a certain threshold, preventing further losses due to adverse market movements. Why is tracking liquidation data important for traders? Tracking liquidation data helps traders gauge market sentiment, identify potential support or resistance levels, and understand periods of high volatility, aiding in more informed trading decisions. What does ‘Long 73.82%’ for BTC liquidation mean? This means that out of the total liquidated Bitcoin positions, 73.82% were ‘long’ positions. These are traders who bet on the price of Bitcoin increasing, and their positions were closed because the price moved downwards. How can traders minimize their risk of liquidation? Traders can minimize liquidation risk by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and diversifying their portfolios to avoid overexposure to single assets. Which cryptocurrencies saw the highest volume of crypto perpetual futures liquidation recently? Over the last 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) saw the highest volume of crypto perpetual futures liquidation at $83.31 million, followed by Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL). Does liquidation only affect individual traders? While liquidation directly impacts individual traders, large-scale liquidation events can create cascading effects, leading to increased market volatility and influencing broader market prices and sentiment.

It’s claimed through timing, consistency, and showing up before the spotlight. XRP is grabbing attention with open interest blasting past $3 billion, while Stellar’s charts are flashing bearish signals that traders can’t ignore. Both highlight shifting sentiment, yet only one project is acknowledging early contribution before the hype sets in, giving recognition when it truly matters most. That is Cold Wallet , which flips the script by rewarding engagement during its foundation phase. Its Crystal Vault rank tracks referrals, on-chain moves, and active presence, marking who’s been shaping the project from the start. For those searching for the best long-term crypto, recognition of early participation makes all the difference, separating those who build from those who merely arrive later. Cold Wallet Rewards Active Builders With Crystal Vault! Crystal Vault isn’t a shiny badge; it’s live proof of influence inside Cold Wallet’s ecosystem, already active before listings arrive. While most projects reserve recognition for after launch, Cold Wallet is rewarding contributors now. Every app interaction, referral, and vault action counts toward climbing the ranks, providing measurable rewards before the market officially opens its doors. Cold Wallet describes Crystal Vault as “refined mastery and extensive vault influence.” This rank can’t be bought; it must be earned through consistent contribution and authentic engagement. During presale, the project is recording participation in real time, ensuring early actions have lasting weight and recognition that outlives short-term hype. With over $6.3M raised, more than 740M coins sold, and CWT priced at just $0.00998 in Stage 17, those engaging now are locking in both presence and recognition ahead of the confirmed $0.3517 launch price. That’s where Cold Wallet separates itself, rewarding builders, not just spectators, and ensuring its community grows with real recognition tied to their contributions at every stage. XRP Open Interest Crosses $3B Milestone XRP has surged back into the spotlight as open interest smashed through $3 billion after weeks of muted activity. This spike signals a fresh wave of conviction from market participants and sets the stage for a possible price rally. With leveraged positions on the rise, momentum could build quickly in either direction depending on sentiment shifts, adding urgency to the situation. For traders, this isn’t just a technical note; it’s a signal of renewed market engagement. The swelling open interest highlights belief in XRP’s near-term potential, but also warns of heightened volatility ahead. The market now watches closely to see whether this activity sparks a breakout or leads to sharp reversals, making XRP one of the most closely watched names right now. Stellar Charts Signal Bearish Pressure Ahead Stellar enters the scene with red flags flashing. A death cross has formed on shorter-term charts, while positive exchange inflows point to selling pressure rising. Together, these align into a bearish setup that suggests downside risk ahead for XLM, with every indicator flashing warning signs that demand serious attention from market watchers. Currently, Stellar is sliding toward key support zones around $0.29 to $0.26. Momentum indicators and market flows alike reinforce the caution, showing that sellers are firmly in control. Unless buying demand steps in with force, XLM could be preparing for deeper declines. For those watching the charts, these signals reflect mounting pressure that’s hard to overlook, creating a tense moment for anyone following the market. Closing Analysis Price swings make headlines, but long-term staying power is often tied to recognition. While XRP builds momentum and Stellar sends caution, neither offers a system that rewards active contribution during development, leaving builders without acknowledgment until much later. Cold Wallet does. Its Crystal Vault rank is already live, rewarding referrals, on-chain engagement, and early presence. That acknowledgment before exchange listings gives Cold Wallet a clear edge that resonates with those seeking real participation value. For those searching for the best long-term crypto, it isn’t only about market timing; it’s about being recognized for helping build what comes next and being part of something before it hits the mainstream.

Anonymous sources with insider knowledge said the deal could go through, ending the company’s sales drought in China, or crumble if ongoing trade talks between the two countries fail. The sources, who requested anonymity, disclosed that both sides were still ironing out the details of the complicated aircraft sale, including the volume and types of jet models and delivery schedules. Officials in China are already consulting with local airlines to determine their aircraft needs. The Boeing order could potentially end the long-running, contentious trade negotiations between the two nations. China has a similar deal with Airbus SE, but the details are yet to be publicized. The Cryptopolitan reported in April that Chinese officials retaliated against U.S. tariffs by stopping all Boeing orders and deliveries. China sent a $55M jet back to Boeing due to tariff pressures, threatening future sales to the country. The uncertainty over tariffs reportedly threatens to stall Boeing’s recovery efforts and hurt its supply chain. A leadership void in Boeing China also complicates things for the aerospace company. Carol Shen was appointed interim president after Alvin Liu left the company a few weeks ago. Boeing estimates that China will double its commercial fleet by 2045 The aerospace company estimated that the world’s second-largest aviation market could double its commercial fleet to 9755 jets over the next two decades. However, Boeing claimed that China’s airplane maker Comac could not cover the demand. China believes closing the deal will secure slots for aircraft deliveries, which are currently scarce since Boeing and Airbus are sold out into the 2030s. Sheila Kahyaoglu, an analyst at Jefferies, pointed out that Boeing had flexible deliveries to accommodate its most strategic customers. The National Development and Reform Commission, China’s economic planning agency, recently sought input from domestic airlines about the number of airplanes they wanted. Meanwhile, talks centered on the single-aisle 737 Max were a sign that the country was gearing up for a large aircraft order. The last major order from China was in 2017, when Boeing committed to delivering 300 single- and twin-aisle aircraft worth over $37 billion. “We certainly hope that there’s an opportunity for some additional orders in the next year with China.” – Kelly Ortberg , the CEO of Boeing However, Airbus has reportedly dominated airplane sales and deliveries to China since 2019, when two fatal accidents led the country’s regulators to ground the 737 Max. Boeing’s official website confirmed that the company has delivered only 30 orders to China since 2019. Ortberg believes long-running talks with China will eventually pay off. Tariffs threaten to kill U.S. planemaker’s business China’s recent near-total ban of rare earth mineral exports to the U.S. due to tariffs threatened to choke off Boeing’s business. A 737 Max meant for the Chinese Xiamen Airlines was also sent back to the aerospace company’s field in Seattle due to tariff-related issues. The aircraft was already awaiting completion at the Zhoushan center before it was flown back. China reportedly claimed that any business between its airlines and Boeing was likely to be crippled by tariffs. The IBA noted that tariffs made buying new airplanes from the U.S difficult for Chinese airlines, given that the 737 Max’s price increased to $55 million after all duties were levied. Some Chinese airline CEOs also said they would rather stop new aircraft orders than pay exorbitant tariff rates. The tariff wars and return of delivered airplanes reportedly came as Boeing recovered from dwindling business due to trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

LIBRA token skyrockets 393% in one day, fueled by asset release and renewed investor attention. Despite lawsuit uncertainty, traders push LIBRA higher, with volume rising and volatility returning to the token. Federal Judge Releases Frozen USDC A US federal judge has lifted a freeze on over $57 million in USDC connected to the Libra token lawsuit. The funds were held in two wallets tied to meme coin promoter Hayden Davis and Ben Chow, the former CEO of Meteora exchange. The assets were frozen in May as part of a class-action case brought by investors seeking over $100 million in damages related to the collapse of the Libra token. Judge Jennifer L. Rochon, presiding in the Southern District of New York, said she no longer saw a reason to keep the freeze in place. The court found that both Davis and Chow had complied with earlier restrictions and had made no attempt to move or conceal the funds. Meanwhile, the lawsuit remains ongoing. Although Judge Rochon removed the freeze, she did not dismiss the case. She noted the early stage of proceedings and said the plaintiffs had not demonstrated that keeping the funds frozen was necessary. During the hearing, Chow’s attorney, Samson Enzer of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP, referred to the claims as “untested” and said they plan to file a motion to dismiss. The court’s decision to release the funds gives the defendants access to capital as they prepare their defense. LIBRA Token Sees Sharp Price Reaction Following news of the asset release, the price of the LIBRA token jumped sharply. It rose over 393% in the last 24 hours and by more than 409% over the past week. At the time of writing, LIBRA is priced at $0.043 with a daily trading volume of just under $70,000. Source: Coingecko Remarkably, the surge comes months after LIBRA’s collapse in February. The token reached a peak market cap of $4.56 billion shortly after its launch, driven in part by a now-deleted social media post from Argentine President Javier Milei. The post led many to believe the project had government support, but the price dropped by more than 97% within 24 hours. Project Remains Under Scrutiny Davis became the public face of the project during its decline and later claimed he remained in control of the token’s assets. Chow resigned from Meteora after the fallout, with internal disputes over the decision to work with Davis. Although there have been unresolved legal issues, the recent court ruling has raised eyebrows over LIBRA. Demand is back on the rise; however, the future of the project remains uncertain in the long term.

Major financial conglomerate SBI Holdings, in a strategic joint venture with crypto infrastructure powerhouse Startale Group, has officially unveiled an on-chain tokenized stock trading platform . This exciting initiative promises to revolutionize how we perceive and interact with real-world assets (RWAs) and traditional equities. Unveiling the Future: SBI’s Revolutionary Tokenized Stock Trading Platform This new platform represents a significant leap forward for the digital asset space. SBI Holdings, a long-standing titan in the Japanese financial sector, brings its extensive network and regulatory expertise to the table. They are combining forces with Startale Group, a company renowned for its cutting-edge blockchain technology and infrastructure solutions. Together, they aim to create a seamless and efficient marketplace. The primary goal is to launch an on-chain trading platform specifically designed for tokenized stocks and other real-world assets. This collaboration, as reported by The Block, is set to bridge crucial gaps in the existing digital asset landscape. What Makes This Tokenized Stock Trading Platform a Game-Changer? The newly launched platform is not just another trading venue; it introduces several transformative features designed to enhance accessibility and efficiency in financial markets. These innovations directly address some of the long-standing limitations of traditional trading systems: 24/7 Trading: Unlike conventional markets with fixed hours, this platform will allow continuous trading, offering unprecedented flexibility to global investors. Quicker Cross-Border Settlements: Leveraging blockchain technology, transactions will settle significantly faster across international borders, reducing delays and operational costs. Fractional Ownership: Investors can purchase small portions of high-value assets, making investments more accessible and democratized. This is a key benefit of a robust tokenized stock trading platform . Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Linkages: The platform will integrate tokenized stocks with DeFi protocols, unlocking new opportunities for lending, borrowing, and other financial services using these digital assets. These features collectively aim to create a more liquid, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem. It’s a bold step towards integrating traditional finance with the innovative capabilities of blockchain. Bridging Gaps with the New Tokenized Stock Trading Platform Existing tokenized stock markets often face challenges related to liquidity, regulatory clarity, and interoperability. The joint venture between SBI and Startale is strategically positioned to tackle these issues head-on. By merging SBI’s robust financial network with Startale’s advanced blockchain infrastructure, the platform is designed to offer a comprehensive solution. This synergy is crucial for building trust and ensuring operational efficiency. It provides a secure and compliant environment for trading digital representations of traditional assets. The development of such a sophisticated tokenized stock trading platform signals a maturing market for digital assets, moving beyond just cryptocurrencies to include a broader range of financial instruments. The Broader Impact of Tokenized Stock Trading Platforms The implications of this platform extend far beyond just stocks. The ability to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) opens up vast possibilities for various sectors. Imagine owning a fraction of a commercial building, a piece of fine art, or even a share in a renewable energy project, all tradable on a blockchain. This could unlock trillions of dollars in illiquid assets, bringing them into the digital economy. While the benefits are clear, the journey for tokenized stock trading platform s also involves navigating complex regulatory landscapes and ensuring robust security measures. However, with established financial players like SBI Holdings entering the fray, confidence in the future of tokenized assets is growing rapidly. This platform is a powerful example of how traditional finance and blockchain can collaborate to build the next generation of financial markets. In essence, the collaboration between SBI Holdings and Startale Group is not merely about launching a new service; it’s about pioneering a new era of financial accessibility and efficiency. Their innovative tokenized stock trading platform is set to redefine asset ownership and trading, making markets more liquid, transparent, and available to a global audience around the clock. This development truly marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a tokenized stock trading platform?

Ripple, a leader in enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions, recently announced a groundbreaking partnership. This collaboration aims to introduce the RLUSD stablecoin to the Japanese market, marking a pivotal moment for digital currencies in the region. This strategic move, detailed on Ripple’s official website, involves a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Japan’s financial services giant SBI Holdings and its subsidiary, SBI VC Trade. Together, they are paving the way for a new era of digital payments and financial innovation in Japan. What is the RLUSD Stablecoin and Why Does it Matter? The RLUSD stablecoin is a digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar. Its primary purpose is to offer the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology without the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes stablecoins incredibly useful for various financial activities, including: International Remittances: Sending money across borders becomes faster and cheaper. Cross-Border Payments: Businesses can settle transactions more efficiently. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are a cornerstone of many DeFi applications. For Japan, the introduction of the RLUSD stablecoin signifies a commitment to embracing advanced digital financial tools. It offers a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy. How Will This Partnership Benefit Japan’s Digital Economy? The collaboration between Ripple and SBI Holdings is set to unlock numerous benefits for Japan. SBI Holdings, a major player in Japan’s financial sector, has a long-standing relationship with Ripple, making this expansion a natural progression. Key advantages for the Japanese market include: Enhanced Payment Efficiency: The RLUSD stablecoin facilitates near-instantaneous transactions, drastically reducing settlement times compared to traditional banking systems. Reduced Transaction Costs: Businesses and individuals can expect lower fees for both domestic and international transfers. Increased Financial Inclusion: Access to digital financial services can expand, benefiting a broader segment of the population. Innovation Catalyst: This initiative could spur further development in Japan’s blockchain and digital asset ecosystem. Moreover, the partnership leverages SBI’s extensive network and regulatory expertise, which is crucial for successful stablecoin adoption in a regulated market like Japan. Navigating the Path: Potential Challenges and Opportunities for RLUSD Stablecoin While the prospects are exciting, introducing a new digital asset like the RLUSD stablecoin into a mature market like Japan also presents its challenges. Regulatory clarity, consumer education, and fierce competition are all factors that need careful consideration. However, the opportunities far outweigh these hurdles. Japan has shown a progressive stance towards digital assets, with a robust regulatory framework already in place for cryptocurrencies. This provides a solid foundation for the RLUSD stablecoin to thrive. The partnership’s focus on compliance and security will be paramount in building trust among users and institutions. As a result, this move could set a precedent for other nations considering similar stablecoin integrations. What Does This Mean for the Future of Global Payments? Ripple’s strategy with the RLUSD stablecoin extends beyond Japan. This launch is part of a broader vision to establish a global network of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The goal is to facilitate seamless, efficient, and cost-effective cross-border payments worldwide. The success of this venture in Japan could serve as a powerful case study. It demonstrates how established financial institutions and blockchain innovators can collaborate to modernize payment infrastructures. Ultimately, this move positions Japan at the forefront of digital currency adoption, potentially influencing future global financial trends. In conclusion, the partnership between Ripple and SBI to bring the RLUSD stablecoin to Japan is a landmark event. It promises to revolutionize payments, foster innovation, and solidify Japan’s role as a leader in the evolving digital economy. This collaboration exemplifies a forward-thinking approach to integrating advanced blockchain technology into everyday financial services, setting a new benchmark for global digital finance.

Kanye West Memecoin Launch Leaves 60% Of Investors In The Red,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/another-celebrity-scam-kanye-west-memecoin-launch-leaves-60-of-investors-in-the-red/,"Amid the controversial launch of Kanye West’s official memecoin on Solana, the crypto community has sounded the alarm for another potential celebrity token scam, with insider trading allegations outshining Ye’s party. Related Reading: Chainlink Eyes Crucial Resistance After $25 Reclaim – Breakout Or Breakdown Next? The Rise And Fall Of YZY On Wednesday night, controversial Hip-Hop artist and public figure Ye, better known as Kanye West, launched his official memecoin, YZY, on the Solana blockchain. West announced the token in his X account, posting the contract address (CA) in a picture with the caption “YEEZY MONEY IS HERE. A NEW ECONOMY, BUILT ON CHAIN.” After the announcement, the memecoin skyrocketed to a market capitalization of $3.1 billion before quickly dropping 65% to the $1.1 billion mark in the following hours. Meanwhile, YZY’s price went from an all-time high (ATH) of $3.16 to hover between the $0.95-$1.30 price range. The crypto community reported multiple red flags, including allegations of insider trading and a lawsuit waiver. Notably, the official website has a controversial waiver that raised concerns among investors. In the “What Else Should I Know?” section, the website stated that by purchasing the token, investors agree they “will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy” that they may have against any of the “Covered Parties.” “if you’re buying this ur literally giving them permission to rug you without consequences,” a community member noted. Nonetheless, investors may opt out of the dispute resolution provision by “providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Website,” the page reads. Ye’s Memecoin Supply Owned By Insiders Conor Grogan, director at Coinbase, estimated that at least 94% of the supply was owned by insiders, with 87% of the token being held by a single multisig wallet before it was distributed to multiple wallets. According to the “YZYNOMICS”, 20% of the token’s distribution would be for public supply, 10% for liquidity, and 70% for Yeezy Investments LLC. On-chain analytics firm Bubblemaps affirmed that “the bubble map of YZY mostly MATCHES the distribution on Kanye’s website,” cautioning that “the 17% address ‘public supply’ is UNLOCKED and can sell at any time.” Lookonchain highlighted that only YZY had been added to the liquidity pool, with no USDC, warning that the “Dev may sell YZY by adding/removing liquidity, similar to LIBRA.” Additionally, they noted that multiple insider wallets had prepared funds in advance and bought the memecoin, with one address knowing the CA and attempting to purchase YZY yesterday. The on-chain wallet tracker also cautioned that West had added 30 million YZY, worth $34 million, to the liquidity pool with a price range of $3.17-$4.49, signaling that “once the price climbs above $3.1716, he’ll start earning fees while gradually selling YZY for USDC. If the price rises above $4.4929, all 30M YZY will be sold.” Investors See Red Numbers On-chain researcher Defioasis affirmed that the YZY launch was “more of the same,” revealing that, so far, most wallets holding West’s memecoin are in the red. According to their analysis, 56,050 addresses traded the token in the past 13 hours, with 25,166, or 44.9% of the wallets, engaging in one-sided transactions. Out of these addresses, 23,723 only bought the memecoin, while 1,443 only sold it. They suggested that “some of the former may be dust addresses aimed at increasing the number of addresses, while others are either holding onto their positions or stuck in losses,” adding, “The latter are primarily project teams/large holders using multiple addresses to sell, making it harder to track them directly.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Risks Drop Below $110,000 Despite Bounce – Is A 15% Pullback Coming? Meanwhile, 30,884 addresses had two-way transactions, with 38.07% of addresses registering realized profits. 30% of these wallets had a profit of up to $500, while only 1.31% of them had profits exceeding $10,000. Among this 1%, only 5 addresses had over $1 million in profits, with one of them being identified as an insider. On the contrary, over 60% of participants are still in a loss position, the report noted, with 28.2% of the addresses losing up to $500.

Cold Wallet Presale + Avalanche, Polygon & NEAR Are Top Picks",https://thecoinrise.com/buying-crypto-in-2025-cold-wallet-presale-avalanche-polygon-near-are-top-picks/,"Momentum defines success in the world of buying crypto. Some projects are pushing forward with bold initiatives, while others enter quieter phases that leave traders weighing risk versus reward. At present, four standout names are steering market conversations for different reasons. Cold Wallet (CWT) is racing through its presale with $6.40 million secured and a huge ROI gap before launch. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX) is in an unusual period of inactivity with no major developments. Polygon (MATIC to POL) is preparing for a major token migration and scheduled upgrade, while NEAR Protocol gears up for a hard fork that could shape its next growth phase. Together, these stories highlight the range of opportunities facing the buying crypto community, from explosive presales to technical overhauls. 1. Cold Wallet’s $6.40M Presale Frenzy: Buying Crypto Opportunity on a Countdown Cold Wallet (CWT) is reshaping what a crypto wallet can deliver, and the buying crypto crowd has noticed. In just weeks, the presale has raised $6.40 million, selling 755 million tokens as it moves through Stage 17. At the current $0.00998 price, buyers are targeting a 3,423% ROI by launch, when CWT lists at $0.3517. Instead of draining users through fees, Cold Wallet flips the script by rewarding transactions in CWT without staking or lockups. Its $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet also onboarded 2 million+ active users before launch, a level of adoption most projects struggle for years to achieve. As MetaMask and Trust Wallet face mounting user frustrations, Cold Wallet’s streamlined, reward-driven design offers a major shift for buying crypto strategies. But with each stage completed, entry costs rise, shrinking potential ROI. Stage 17 may be one of the final windows to capture this opportunity at its peak before adoption accelerates. 2. Polygon: Token Migration Draws Buying Crypto Attention Polygon is preparing for a landmark transition as MATIC migrates to POL on August 26, 2025. Major exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, have confirmed support, which should ease concerns about execution. Technically, MATIC’s RSI at 38 shows oversold conditions, hinting at a possible rebound. On August 27, the network will undergo planned maintenance to enable native deployment of USDT0 on Polygon PoS, an upgrade that boosts liquidity and utility, potentially shifting buying crypto sentiment. For traders, these back-to-back events may create volatility but also opportunities. The outcome will depend on how smoothly both migration and the upgrade unfold. 3. Avalanche: A Quiet Phase in the Buying Crypto Market Avalanche has entered an uncharacteristic quiet period, with no major announcements or partnerships in the last five days. While the network remains stable, AVAX price movement is being shaped more by overall buying crypto sentiment than by direct project news. This silence could signal a strategic build-up behind the scenes, or simply a stall in visible growth. For traders, it’s a reminder that not every asset comes with constant catalysts. Long-term signals, such as dApp traction, subnet growth, and cross-chain integrations, may offer clearer insights. In a space often dominated by fast news cycles, Avalanche’s pause is unusual and potentially calculated. 4. NEAR Protocol: Upgrade Momentum Fuels Buying Crypto Optimism NEAR Protocol is preparing for a major upgrade and hard fork scheduled for August 18, 2025. Binance will oversee technical handling, temporarily pausing deposits and withdrawals for one hour while leaving trading active. Market response has been bullish. NEAR’s price is up nearly 6% at $2.79, with trading volume doubling and growing institutional interest adding fuel. Chart signals suggest a breakout, though analysts caution that a pullback toward support could still occur if momentum slows. For the buying crypto community, the coming week is pivotal. Whether NEAR sustains this momentum post-upgrade or faces profit-taking will determine its trajectory. Best Cryptos to Watch Closely Across the buying crypto spectrum, opportunity looks very different for each project. Cold Wallet’s high-ROI presale window is narrowing fast, making timing essential. Avalanche’s silence may test patience but could precede new strategies. Polygon’s token migration and network upgrade create a rare short-term trade setup, while NEAR’s hard fork blends technical improvements with bullish sentiment. The takeaway? Markets reward those who distinguish hype from substance. Cold Wallet is winning attention with real utility and explosive growth, while the others offer measured plays that depend on execution and patience. The post Buying Crypto in 2025?

XRP, Cardano, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are all being discussed in the latest rankings, with forecasts pointing to potential 40x gains . Each coin has a different setup, but MAGACOIN is drawing extra attention for how quickly it’s stealing momentum in this market cycle. XRP Whales Shake the Market XRP price prediction has taken a sharp bearish turn. Ripple slipped under the $3 mark for the first time in weeks, now trading at $2.84. The drop represents a 5% decline in the past 24 hours and 17% over the past month. What’s more concerning—whales have dumped nearly 470 million XRP in just 10 days. Such a degree of selling pressure is seldom a positive indicator. Although 90% of wallets continue to display gains, the sentiment has quickly changed. Panic selling has become a genuine threat. The graphs also appear unpromising. RSI is at 42, while XRP is below its 10-day, 20-day, and 50-day moving averages. Experts caution that if $2.86 is breached, a steeper decline may occur Cardano Approaches an Inflection Point Cardano has been trying to hold steady after a volatile stretch. The token was priced at $0.8763 on Wednesday, rising modestly from previous lows but remaining far below the $1 threshold. After momentarily surpassing Tron and Dogecoin in market capitalization, ADA is currently engaged in a close competition with both. All three are above $30 billion, competing for the eighth position among leading cryptocurrencies. Traders are keeping a careful eye on Cardano since it is creating a triangular formation, which is typically a precursor to a major breakout. Support is around $0.88, and resistance is around $0.98. If it stays over $1, it could make a bullish push to $1.10 or higher. Adding fuel to the bullish case, ADA has just flashed a golden cross—a powerful signal that often kicks off longer uptrends. MAGACOIN FINANCE Becomes the Spotlight Pick MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects this season. As Q4 nears, analysts are watching the breakout moves of XRP and Cardano, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight with projections of a 1200% surge. The excitement surrounding the project has been difficult to overlook. In contrast to older tokens struggling with resistance points and whale sell-offs, MAGACOIN is drawing interest from traders seeking new opportunities before the markets become active. The narrative is simple: analysts see MAGACOIN positioned not just for steady growth, but for a potential run that could outpace most top-10 cryptos by year’s end. With the altcoin market shifting quickly, the project is increasingly being seen as the one to watch. Final Word The most recent rankings show three names that traders are still talking about the most. XRP is under negative pressure, Cardano is at a major turning point, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the clear winner with huge upside potential. If analysts are correct about the 40x forecast , these three tokens could define the next big wave of altcoin gains—with MAGACOIN holding the strongest spotlight heading into Q4.

After experiencing a four-day period of outflows, U.S. spot ETH ETFs witnessed a remarkable turnaround, recording an impressive $290.35 million in net inflows on August 21. This substantial influx signals renewed investor interest and a potential change in market sentiment for Ethereum-backed investment products. What Drove the U.S. Spot ETH ETFs Inflow Reversal? The data, meticulously tracked by “Trader T” on X, highlights a strong day for these investment vehicles. The $290.35 million net inflow effectively ended a recent streak where more money was leaving these funds than entering. This positive development suggests a fresh wave of confidence among institutional and retail investors alike. Several key players contributed to this significant daily total: BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge with a substantial $236.34 million. Fidelity’s FETH followed, attracting $28.53 million. Bitwise’s ETHW added $6.99 million. Grayscale’s mini ETH saw $6.36 million in inflows. VanEck’s ETHV contributed $6.21 million. Grayscale’s ETHE also recorded a positive $5.92 million. Interestingly, the remaining U.S. spot ETH ETFs reported no significant changes in their holdings for that specific day, indicating that the bulk of the new capital was concentrated in a few major funds. Understanding the Impact of Ethereum ETF Movements For those new to the crypto space, U.S. spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that directly hold Ethereum (ETH) and trade on traditional stock exchanges. They offer investors exposure to ETH price movements without requiring them to directly buy and store the cryptocurrency. Therefore, significant inflows into these ETFs often reflect growing institutional and broader market appetite for Ethereum. Such a strong day of inflows can act as a bullish signal, potentially influencing market perception and price action for Ethereum itself. It indicates that professional money managers and larger investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to this asset class. However, it is crucial to remember that the crypto market remains dynamic, and sentiment can shift rapidly. Key Players and Their Contributions to U.S. Spot ETH ETFs BlackRock’s dominant performance on August 21, with its ETHA fund alone accounting for over 80% of the day’s total inflows, is particularly noteworthy. This highlights the immense influence and trust that major financial institutions like BlackRock command in the investment world. Their active participation often legitimizes new asset classes for a wider audience. The consistent, albeit smaller, contributions from other reputable firms like Fidelity, Bitwise, Grayscale, and VanEck further underscore a diversified institutional interest in Ethereum. This broad participation suggests that the demand for regulated crypto investment products is not isolated to a single entity but is gaining traction across the financial sector. What’s Next for U.S. Spot ETH ETFs? The $290.35 million inflow marks a significant positive moment for U.S. spot ETH ETFs . While one day of strong performance doesn’t define a long-term trend, it certainly provides a fresh perspective after a period of outflows. Investors will be keenly watching whether this momentum continues or if it was a singular event. Looking ahead, continued inflows could provide a strong foundation for Ethereum’s market stability and growth. Conversely, a return to outflows might signal lingering caution. For investors, monitoring these ETF flows can offer valuable insights into institutional sentiment and potential future price action for Ethereum. Always consider market volatility and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. In conclusion, the substantial $290.35 million inflow into U.S. spot ETH ETFs on August 21 is a compelling development. It signals a notable shift in investor confidence, particularly after a period of withdrawals. This event underscores the growing role of regulated investment products in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem and highlights the increasing institutional embrace of Ethereum as a viable asset class. It’s an exciting time to watch how these trends unfold. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are U.S. spot ETH ETFs? U.S. spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that directly hold Ethereum (ETH) and trade on traditional stock exchanges, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency. Why are inflows important for U.S. spot ETH ETFs? Inflows signify that investors are putting more capital into these funds than they are withdrawing. This often indicates growing investor confidence, increased demand, and a potentially bullish sentiment for Ethereum and the broader crypto market. Which firm saw the largest inflow on August 21? BlackRock’s ETHA fund led with a significant $236.34 million in inflows on August 21, accounting for a large portion of the day’s total. Does this mean Ethereum’s price will go up? While strong inflows into U.S. spot ETH ETFs can be a positive indicator and may influence market sentiment, they do not guarantee an immediate or sustained increase in Ethereum’s price. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, and prices can remain volatile. What does the “four-day streak of outflows” mean? A “four-day streak of outflows” means that for four consecutive days prior to August 21, more money was withdrawn from U.S. spot ETH ETFs than was invested, indicating a period of decreased investor interest or profit-taking.

A $50 million Trump-linked acquisition of a DOGE mining firm, Wyoming’s launch of a state-backed stablecoin, and comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling a softer stance on digital assets all converged to trigger fresh institutional flows. News Background • Thumzup, a Trump-affiliated entity, acquired Dogehash for $50 million, creating what executives described as the largest DOGE mining operation. The deal signals deep-pocketed confidence in Dogecoin infrastructure. • Wyoming unveiled the Frontier Stable Token, the first government-backed state stablecoin, reinforcing the U.S. regulatory pivot toward digital assets. • Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman warned banks about competitive risks from delaying digital asset adoption, signaling a more crypto-accommodative posture. • SoFi Technologies integrated Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, targeting the $740 billion remittance market — another signal of traditional finance edging deeper into crypto rails. Price Action Summary • DOGE traded in a $0.01 band from $0.21 to $0.22 between Aug. 20 15:00 and Aug. 21 14:00, marking ~4–5% intraday volatility. • The token rallied 5% from $0.21 to $0.22 during the Aug. 20 evening session, establishing $0.22 as near-term resistance. • A late-session 60-minute window (Aug. 21 13:22–14:21) saw DOGE surge 1% from $0.22 to $0.22 with volume spikes above 61.8 million, confirming institutional activity. • Support consistently held in the $0.21–$0.22 zone with bounces on 320–380 million volume across key testing points. Technical Analysis • Support : $0.21–$0.22 established as reliable floor with repeated high-volume retests. • Resistance : $0.22 key pivot cleared, but bulls need follow-through toward $0.225 to confirm breakout. • Volume : Peak surges of 61.8 million and 378.6 million confirm institutional buying interest. • Pattern : Classic consolidation followed by impulsive breakout; upward trajectory if support base holds. • Futures OI : Stable around $3 billion, reflecting sustained leveraged interest despite macro volatility. What Traders Are Watching • Whether DOGE can sustain above the $0.22 pivot and push toward $0.225–$0.23 resistance. • The market’s reaction to Fed policy shifts and Wyoming’s stablecoin launch — potential sector-wide tailwind. • Whale accumulation patterns, already totaling 2 billion DOGE ($500M) this week. • Mining sector expansion via Thumzup’s acquisition and its impact on DOGE’s hashpower distribution.",Markets|Dogecoin|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MINING|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-08-22 05:17:12

Rick Rieder, CIO of BlackRock Global Fixed Income and head of the Global Allocation team, said on Fox Business that he expects the Fed to cut interest rates in September. “My guess is that the Fed will deliver a message about maintaining economic stability. However, the current data, particularly the slowdown in employment, creates a favorable environment for a rate cut,” Rieder said. Rieder stated that interest rates are currently higher than they should be, adding, “Personally, I think a faster and stronger cut is possible. Even a 50 basis point cut is possible.” Related News: Nasdaq Listed Company Announces $700 Million Purchase of Surprise Altcoin - But Price Remains Flat Drawing attention to the weakness in the labor market, Rieder emphasized that employment growth, excluding the healthcare sector, has been negative in the last three months, signaling a slowdown in the economy. Rieder, noting that inflation is still above the Fed's target but does not pose a serious threat, said, “Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has been at 2.8% on an annualized basis for the last three months. This is not a scary figure.” The program also addressed reports that Rieder could replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Responding to these claims, Rieder stated, “It's an honor to even be considered for such a role.

This move could signal a significant moment for the adoption and perception of digital assets, especially with a figure like Eric Trump at the forefront. His presence is expected to draw considerable media attention, shining a spotlight on the evolving landscape of blockchain and crypto technologies. Why is Eric Trump Advocating for Cryptocurrency in Japan? The decision by Eric Trump to specifically target Japan for his cryptocurrency promotion efforts is quite strategic. Japan has long been recognized as a leader in the cryptocurrency space, having established clear regulatory frameworks earlier than many other nations. This proactive approach has fostered an environment where digital assets can thrive, making it an ideal location for high-profile advocacy. Moreover, the Japanese market shows a strong interest in technological innovation. Eric Trump’s involvement could leverage this existing enthusiasm, potentially accelerating the mainstream acceptance of digital currencies. His visit aims to engage with key stakeholders, from investors to developers, to discuss the future and benefits of decentralized finance. Regulatory Clarity: Japan’s clear rules provide a stable ground for crypto discussions. Tech-Savvy Population: A receptive audience keen on new financial technologies. Market Potential: Opportunities for growth and investment in digital assets. Japan’s Dynamic Cryptocurrency Landscape Japan’s journey with cryptocurrency has been unique. It was one of the first countries to recognize Bitcoin as legal property, setting a precedent for global adoption. This forward-thinking stance has allowed its crypto market to mature, albeit with its share of challenges and triumphs. The country is home to several prominent crypto exchanges and a vibrant community of blockchain innovators. However, the market also faces continuous scrutiny regarding security and investor protection. Eric Trump cryptocurrency discussions could bring renewed focus to these areas, potentially encouraging further innovation while reinforcing the need for robust safeguards. The goal is to highlight the benefits while addressing inherent risks in the digital asset space, fostering a balanced understanding. What Impact Could Eric Trump’s Cryptocurrency Advocacy Have? An endorsement from a well-known public figure like Eric Trump can significantly boost the visibility and credibility of cryptocurrency. This increased exposure might encourage new investors to explore digital assets, leading to greater market liquidity and potentially driving innovation in the sector. His visit could act as a catalyst for discussions on how digital currencies can integrate more seamlessly into traditional financial systems. Conversely, such high-profile promotion also comes with challenges. It may attract heightened regulatory scrutiny and could polarize public opinion, especially given the political affiliations involved. It is crucial for the message to focus on the technological merits and economic benefits of cryptocurrency, rather than political endorsements, to ensure broad appeal and sustainable growth. Increased Awareness: Broader public understanding of digital assets. Investment Influx: Potential for new capital entering the crypto market. Regulatory Scrutiny: Could prompt further examination of crypto policies. Public Perception: Shaping how the general public views digital currencies. The Future of Digital Assets After This Visit The planned visit by Eric Trump to promote cryptocurrency in Japan is more than just a promotional tour; it signifies a growing trend of influential figures engaging with the digital asset world. This trend suggests that cryptocurrencies are moving beyond niche investment circles and into mainstream consciousness. Such endorsements can accelerate the adoption curve, making digital assets a more integral part of the global economy. For investors and enthusiasts, this development underscores the increasing legitimacy of the crypto space. It highlights the ongoing shift towards a decentralized financial future, where blockchain technology plays a pivotal role. The dialogue initiated by such visits can pave the way for more robust infrastructure and wider acceptance for Eric Trump cryptocurrency initiatives. In conclusion, Eric Trump’s upcoming visit to Japan to promote cryptocurrency represents a significant event for the digital asset industry. It brings a prominent voice to the discussion, highlighting Japan’s advanced regulatory environment and tech-savvy population. While the visit promises increased visibility and potential for market growth, it also underscores the ongoing need for clear communication, robust security, and balanced regulatory approaches.

In 2023, this meme coin based on frogs turned a small investment of $72 into more than $10,000, which shocked even the most experienced crypto fans. People who bought PEPE early made a lot of money, and now many people are asking: could another frog meme coin do the same thing? The answer is Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a new meme coin with a stronger technical base, meaning it could make even more money. Like its forerunner PEPE, LILPEPE is a meme coin based on the viral meme “Pepe the Frog.” However, LILPEPE is more than a mere novelty token; it is built on an Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain. This makes transactions faster, fees lower, and scalability better than regular meme coins. LILPEPE is an exciting investment opportunity for people who want to get in on the next big meme coin. The community is growing, the presale raised more than $20.2 million, and some experts think the price could go up by as much as 12,000% by 2025. Let’s examine how LILPEPE can outperform PEPE in the next few years. How Pepe Coin (PEPE) Made Huge Profits in 2023 Pepe Coin (PEPE) was one of the best things in 2023. The meme coin shocked everyone in a market with thousands of cryptocurrencies. The coin quickly gained popularity, starting at just a few cents. This was due to social media buzz, celebrity endorsements, and its viral link to the famous Pepe the Frog meme. Investors who got in early made a lot of money. For instance, a small investment of $72 grew to more than $10,000 as the price of PEPE rose by more than 10,000% in just a few months. The fast growth of Pepe Coin demonstrated the strength of meme coins and those related to cultural events in particular. It is a risky bet because the high price is driven by the effect of hype and the speculative nature of trading peculiar to most meme coins. The price of PEPE has experienced a setback following its massive spike, which has sparked speculation among many investors about whether another meme coin might blow up in the future. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is the answer. It has the same meme culture appeal, real use, and a technical edge. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Next Meme Coin With Growth Potential Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is quickly becoming popular in cryptocurrency because it offers more than just meme value. LILPEPE is built on a Layer-2 blockchain that works with Ethereum. It solves some of the most significant problems of traditional meme coins, such as high transaction fees and slow speeds. LILPEPE is a good choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, decentralized exchanges, and other blockchain uses because it has lower costs, faster transactions, and scalability. The presale for LILPEPE has already brought in more than $20.2 million, which shows significant interest in the token. Analysts believe that the LILPEPE has upside potential of more than 12,000 percent by the end of 2025, when PEPE also performed superlatively in 2023. Suppose LILPEPE will reach the price of $1.00 by 2025, and the investment of $1,000 may increase to $500,000. LILPEPE is in a great position to develop a lot because it combines meme culture, community support, and real usefulness. LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin that people are betting on; it’s built to last, which makes it stand out in a crowded market. The Edge in Competition: Why LILPEPE Might Do Better Than PEPE PEPE was popular because of the hype, and the Pepe meme went viral. LILPEPE, on the other hand, has several advantages that make it a better long-term investment. LILPEPE’s blockchain utility is the most significant difference. LILPEPE can grow faster than other meme coins because it uses Ethereum’s Layer-2 technology. Ethereum’s Layer-2 solutions enable faster and cheaper transactions, a big plus in the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Also, LILPEPE has already passed a Certik audit, which gives it more credibility and security than many other meme coins. Investors can be sure that LILPEPE has been thoroughly checked for security, which lowers the risk of problems like rug pulls. This gives LILPEPE an advantage over other meme coins with no factual technical basis and that only rely on hype. Since PEPE did so well in 2023, many investors are now looking for the next big meme coin to invest in. LILPEPE has the same appeal as memes but has the added benefits of being safe and sound on the blockchain. LILPEPE could make even more money if it follows the same path as PEPE. This is because it has a strong base and a growing community. The Future of LILPEPE: Predictions for Its Price and Growth Several things could affect LILPEPE’s chances of being as successful as or more successful than PEPE. As the meme coin market and DeFi grow, LILPEPE’s unique position as a meme coin with real value becomes even more valuable. LILPEPE is still in its early stages and priced at only $0.0020. This is a rare chance for early investors to buy in before the price increases. Analysts say that LILPEPE could go up to $1.00 by 2025, a 50,000% return on investment from its presale price. However, LILPEPE is also in a good position to grow as it becomes more popular in the crypto community. LILPEPE has a lot going for it: a unique value proposition, a low market cap, and a growing community of supporters. It could become the next big success story in the meme coin space. How to Buy LILPEPE Before Its Price Goes Up Here’s how to get in before the price goes up if you’re ready to take advantage of LILPEPE’s growth potential: Download MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Buy Ethereum (ETH) or Tether (USDT) from a trusted exchange and move it to your wallet. Visit littlepepe.com to see the official LILPEPE presale page. Connect your wallet and buy LILPEPE tokens for $0.0020 each. Conclusion: LILPEPE Is The Next Big Meme Coin. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) could grow quickly, just like Pepe Coin (PEPE) did in 2023. LILPEPE has a strong chance of long-term success in crypto because it is a meme with real-world uses. LILPEPE is a great candidate for massive price increases because the meme coin market is constantly changing, and the coin is growing in size and security. If you missed PEPE’s impressive gains, now is your chance to get in early on LILPEPE. LILPEPE could be the next meme coin to turn a small investment into a lot of money, with estimates saying it will increase by 12,000% by 2025. Don’t miss out!

His latest outlook emphasizes both the macro trend and shorter-term price levels that he views as critical for XRP’s market trajectory. In the zoomed-in chart, he identifies $3.65 as a decisive breakout point. According to his analysis , a confirmed close above this level, in conjunction with surpassing the green arch boundary, would trigger a phase of price discovery. He describes this threshold as the point at which XRP could begin a significant upward movement. At present, he highlights $2.90 as the midpoint of the linear log channel, which he views as essential support. He stresses the importance of maintaining price action above this level to preserve the bullish setup. #XRP – Linear Regression Analysis (Log Scale) and The Bent Fork (Zoomed-In Version): Take a close look at the chart below! As I zoom in, remember to keep track of the MACRO view to fully understand the significance of this analysis. Zoomed-In Insights: 1⃣ Closing above… pic.twitter.com/ESyUS62yUt — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 20, 2025 Defense Levels and Risk Zones Egrag outlines several defensive levels that he considers crucial to sustaining XRP’s bullish momentum. The first line of defense is at $2.65, where he suggests that while price wicks may occur, a daily close below this level would be problematic for the overall trend. The last line of defense, in his view, lies at $2.33, which aligns with the 21 EMA on the two-week timeframe. He regards this as a make-or-break level for the prospect of reaching new all-time highs. He further identifies $1.90 as the bear market line of defense. In his assessment, a close below this point would push XRP into bear market territory . An even deeper threshold exists at $1.62, which he marks as confirmation of a bearish trend if the price closes below the middle arch structure. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Macro Outlook and Cycle Projections In addition to the zoomed-in analysis, Egrag emphasizes the importance of zooming out to view the broader market cycles. His macro chart highlights three key cycles: 2013, 2018, and a projected cycle peak in 2025. He notes that the current setup aligns with the same structural movements seen in previous cycles, suggesting that XRP could be on track for another major market move. The upper boundary of the linear log channel, marked in blue, coincides with the projected “white arch,” which he points to as a long-term target zone. This alignment, according to his analysis, reinforces the case for a strong upside potential if XRP sustains key support levels in the near term. Egrag Crypto’s latest analysis presents a structured view of XRP’s technical positioning within both short-term and long-term contexts. With $3.65 as a decisive breakout level, $2.90 as the midpoint support, and several lines of defense at $2.65, $2.33, and $1.90, his framework highlights the importance of maintaining higher support levels to avoid slipping into bearish territory.

The move is part of the rising trend of corporate altcoin treasuries, with mixed outcomes across different industries. Some firms like VivoPower saw stock surges after adding crypto, while others, including Safety Shot and Windtree Therapeutics, suffered steep declines after more risky altcoin bets. VERB Tech Commits to Toncoin VERB Technology Company announced that it accumulated roughly $713 million worth of Toncoin (TON) alongside $67 million in cash reserves, bringing its total assets to more than $780 million . The company revealed that most of this capital came from a $558 million private placement that was completed in August, which sent its share price surging by over 200%. A majority of the funds raised were allocated to purchasing TON, and VERB plans to capture 5% of the token’s circulating supply — around 128 million coins — through a combination of corporate debt, equity issuance, and staking activities. Announcement from VERB Technologies The strategy forms part of the growing trend of corporations adopting altcoin treasury policies, which sparked some debate among investors. Supporters see these moves as opportunities for companies to outperform traditional crypto holdings, while skeptics warn that high levels of debt-backed crypto exposure could trigger cascading liquidations if markets turn downward, amplifying risks for both equities and digital assets. August saw several other firms expand into altcoin treasuries with mixed market reactions. Bitcoin mining firm Bit Mining announced its first Solana acquisition , joining a wave of companies increasing their exposure to the network. Energy company VivoPower boosted its XRP holdings , which coincided with a 32% surge in its share price. Meanwhile, ALT5 Sigma Corporation raised $1.5 billion to back World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi governance token linked to members of US President Donald Trump’s family. Not all corporate treasury bets paid off. Safety Shot, a beverage company, faced a sharp backlash after revealing plans to add the BONK meme coin to its reserves, with shares collapsing more than 50%.

Recently, the crypto community observed two substantial movements that saw over $169.59 million in Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) withdrawn from Binance, hinting at crucial developments behind the scenes. These large-scale transactions often spark curiosity and speculation among investors, making it essential to understand their potential implications. What Exactly Are Crypto Whale Withdrawals? In the vast ocean of digital assets, “whales” are individuals or entities holding enormous amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements, especially large withdrawals from exchanges, are known as crypto whale withdrawals . These aren’t just minor transactions; they involve millions, sometimes billions, of dollars. When a whale moves such a substantial sum, it can signal various intentions, from securing assets in cold storage to preparing for over-the-counter (OTC) deals, or even anticipating future market shifts. Therefore, tracking these powerful players offers a glimpse into potential market trends. Just recently, the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain reported intriguing activity on X. Two brand-new wallets initiated significant crypto whale withdrawals from Binance. One wallet transferred a staggering 11,950 ETH, valued at approximately $51.32 million, just moments ago. Shortly after, another fresh wallet withdrew 1,046 BTC, an impressive sum worth around $118.27 million. These back-to-back, large-scale movements underscore the considerable capital at play in the crypto ecosystem. Why Do These Crypto Whale Withdrawals Matter? The motivations behind such large crypto whale withdrawals are diverse and can significantly impact market sentiment. Here are some common reasons: Cold Storage Security: Whales often move assets to hardware wallets for enhanced security, reducing exposure to exchange-related risks. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large blocks of crypto are sometimes sold directly to institutional buyers or other whales without affecting exchange order books. Accumulation and Holding: Some whales withdraw assets to hold them long-term, signaling a belief in future price appreciation. Market Manipulation: While less common and and often illegal, large movements can sometimes precede attempts to influence market prices. Preparing for Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Assets might be moved to participate in staking, lending, or other DeFi protocols. Understanding these potential reasons helps in interpreting the broader market implications. What Could Be the Impact of These Whale Movements? The immediate impact of crypto whale withdrawals can vary. When whales move assets off exchanges, it often reduces the available supply on trading platforms. This reduction can, in theory, create upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Conversely, if these withdrawals are precursors to OTC sales, the market might not see an immediate price dip, but the underlying supply pressure could still be significant. Investors frequently monitor these moves as a leading indicator of potential market direction. Staying Ahead: Actionable Insights for Investors For everyday investors, tracking crypto whale withdrawals can provide valuable insights. While it is not a definitive predictor, it offers a piece of the puzzle. Monitor On-Chain Data: Platforms like Lookonchain provide real-time updates on large transactions. Look for Patterns: Are withdrawals happening consistently across multiple assets or exchanges? Consider Market Context: Evaluate whale moves alongside broader market news, economic indicators, and technical analysis. Avoid Panic: Do not make impulsive decisions based solely on whale movements. Always conduct your own research. These actions empower you to make more informed decisions rather than reacting purely to market noise. The recent crypto whale withdrawals of $169.59 million in ETH and BTC from Binance serve as a powerful reminder of the influential role large holders play in the digital asset landscape. These significant movements are more than just numbers; they are potential signals of strategic positioning, market sentiment, and future trends. By closely observing these patterns and understanding their underlying implications, investors can better navigate the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. The actions of these powerful whales continue to shape the narrative, and staying informed is key to success. Frequently Asked Questions About Crypto Whale Withdrawals Q1: What is a crypto whale? A1: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Q2: Why are crypto whale withdrawals significant? A2: They are significant because large withdrawals from exchanges can reduce the available supply, potentially leading to price increases, or they might signal a whale’s intention to hold long-term, engage in OTC deals, or use assets in DeFi protocols. Q3: How can I track crypto whale activity? A3: You can track crypto whale activity using on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or Etherscan, which monitor and report large transactions on various blockchain networks. Q4: Do crypto whale withdrawals always lead to price increases? A4: Not necessarily. While withdrawals can reduce exchange supply, the ultimate impact depends on the whale’s intentions (e.g., cold storage vs. OTC sale) and overall market demand. It’s one of many factors influencing price. Q5: What is the difference between a withdrawal and a deposit by a whale? A5: A withdrawal means a whale is moving crypto off an exchange, often for holding or private deals. A deposit means they are moving crypto onto an exchange, typically to sell or trade, which can increase selling pressure. Did you find these insights into crypto whale withdrawals helpful?

Popular tokens that once led the charge in speculative rallies are now struggling to recapture past momentum. Yet, in the midst of the carnage, one project shines with promise—LayerBrett (LBRETT). More than just another meme token, LayerBrett combines internet culture appeal with serious blockchain utility, positioning itself as the best meme coin to buy now. For traders seeking growth and potential rewards, it might represent a once-in-a-cycle opportunity. LayerBrett soars as other memes tank LayerBrett is not your average run-of-the-mill meme token. Apart from imbibing meme culture, it also doubles up as a layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum. This gives LBRETT a unique mix of practical blockchain utility and community-driven energy. This strong foundation has sparked significant interest, and that’s why its presale is roaring on. Launched only recently, the LBRETT presale has raised more than half a million dollars, with hundreds of thousands of tokens sold. Investors are not just drawn to its meme appeal but they are also drawn to the genuine growth potential surrounding its ecosystem. But that’s not all. LBRETT also offers an eye-watering 25,000% staking yield. This reward system greatly incentivizes early holders with streams of passive income, effectively rewarding first movers. Traders are piling in, positioning themselves before demand overwhelms supply. Beyond yield, analysts predict LBRETT could be the next 100x meme token. This proclamation is fueled by growing hype, blockchain integration, and a strong presale momentum. While the broader meme market struggles, LBRETT continues to soar, reminding investors that innovation fused with fun drives real value in crypto. PENGU takes flight with meme lovers PENGU is one of the more lovable faces in the meme coin landscape. Inspired by the internet’s fascination with cute penguins, it has quickly caught on, creating a tight-knit community around itself. Due to this playful narrative, PENGU is appealing to investors that thrive in meme-drive hype cycles. As a result, PENGU is starting to make a name for itself in the meme scene. Instead of chaotic marketing gimmicks, PENGU emphasizes inclusivity and consistent engagement, which gives it staying power in the highly competitive meme market. Unfortunately, PENGU remains a speculative investment option. Like most meme tokens, PENGU is affected by market conditions, and the current bears have sent PENGU prospects on a downward spiral. Floki Inu struggles to keep investors interested Floki Inu rode to stardom on the wings of being affiliated with Elon Musk. Inspired by Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, FLOKI leans heavily on Norse mythology for branding. This quickly garnered attention, which is why FLOKI enjoyed several highs in years past. However, Floki’s performance in recent months suggests that the excitement around it is fading. The FLOKI price has all but stagnated, weighed down by market saturation and a lack of real utility. With limited upside and waning hype, many traders now believe Floki Inu has lost its edge. The days of enormous gains are seemingly over, which is why some of them are jumping ship for better alternatives. BONK battles to stay relevant in meme wars BONK entered the market with playful branding and a mission to tap into Solana’s thriving ecosystem. Its narrative focused on being the Solana-native meme token, separating it from ETH-based competitors and earning BONK sizable community excitement. What’s peculiar about BONK is its aggressive distribution strategy, which initially gave tokens away, ensuring fast adoption. It helped BONK become a household name among meme enthusiasts, though the effect has waned in recent times. As for the future, a price rebound is possible given renewed activity on Solana. If ecosystem growth continues, BONK could benefit as the go-to Solana meme, though its long-term trajectory remains uncertain compared with newer entrants like LBRETT. Can PEPE maintain its cult status? PEPE stands apart for being one of the most recognized meme tokens in the world. It draws from the internet’s long-running love affair with Pepe the Frog memes. That’s why its cultural resonance is unrivaled, giving PEPE immediate recognition among crypto investors. From a price standpoint, PEPE has swung through intense volatility but remains higher on trader watchlists than most competitors. With meme-driven hype cycles expected to return, PEPE’s legacy and liquidity could position it as a decent investment option. Though maybe not the explosive rocket it once was, Pepe Coin still offers speculative opportunities to traders banking on meme revival. Conclusion Few tokens bring both utility and hype together quite like LayerBrett. While giants like PEPE, FLOKI and BONK rely on recognition, and smaller projects like PENGU ride on novelty, LBRETT has substance embedded into its DNA as a Layer 2 solution. As a result, it is immune to FUD, and this paves the way to a rocketing rally. Pepe is still available in presale for just $0.0044. Riding on a 100x potential, it is set to usher in life-changing profits for those who take a stab at it. That’s why it is the best meme coin to buy today.

50478150,https://invezz.com/?p=2846886,1755841015,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,‘Serious concerns’: Why Australia’s financial watchdog is investigating Binance,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/22/serious-concerns-why-australias-financial-watchdog-is-investigating-binance/,"The long shadow of Binance’s past has reached the shores of Australia, as the nation’s financial crimes agency brought down the hammer on Friday, ordering the crypto giant’s local arm to submit to an external audit. Citing “serious concerns” with the exchange’s defenses against money laundering and terrorism financing, the move signals a new chapter in the global regulatory reckoning for the world’s largest digital asset platform. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, known as Austrac, declared that its alarm bells were triggered by a cascade of troubling issues. The agency was particularly unimpressed with Binance Australia’s latest independent review, which it scathingly described as “limited in scope relative to its size, business offerings and risks.” The clock is now ticking, with Austrac giving the company just 28 days to put forward a list of potential auditors, from which the agency itself will make the final selection. A pattern of lapses: from global failures to local flaws This is not a sudden development, but the culmination of mounting worries. Austrac detailed a litany of internal failures at the local unit, raising red flags about high staff turnover, a lack of local resourcing, and a concerning absence of senior management oversight. The findings paint a picture of a global behemoth potentially failing to meet its fundamental obligations on Australian soil. Brendan Thomas, the chief executive officer of Austrac, delivered a pointed and public warning, aimed not just at Binance but at all global players operating in the country. “Big global operators may appear well resourced and positioned to meet complex regulatory requirements,” he said in a statement. “But if they don’t understand local money laundering and terrorism financing risks, they are failing to meet” their obligations. Echoes of a $4.3 billion fine This regulatory crackdown does not exist in a vacuum. It comes less than a year after Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty to sweeping anti-money laundering and sanctions violations in the United States, a landmark case that resulted in a staggering $4.3 billion settlement. The parallels are impossible to ignore, suggesting a potential pattern of compliance issues that stretches across jurisdictions. Thomas hammered this point home, emphasizing the critical importance of localized expertise. “Understanding specific risks of criminality in the Australian context is crucial to ensure they’re meeting their reporting obligations here,” he said. The audit order is the latest salvo in Austrac’s broader war on the illicit activities that have plagued the crypto world. In June, the agency imposed a A$5,000 limit on cash transactions at crypto ATMs, warning that the machines had become magnets for fraudsters and scammers. For Binance, which as of Friday had not responded to a request for comment, this forced audit represents a serious and unwelcome escalation in a market it cannot afford to lose.

Meanwhile, Japanese shares had a mixed day. This came after new data showed consumer inflation in Japan remained well above the Bank of Japan's annual target. On the global front, all eyes are now on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium later today for further clues on the US policy outlook. Silver held firm above $38 per ounce on Friday after two consecutive sessions of gains. Gold extended its recent losses to around $3,330 per ounce on Friday. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.10% to below 42,600 on Friday while the Topix added 0.4% to 3,095, with Japanese equities lacking clear direction. The Japanese yen weakened to around 145.5 per dollar on Friday, its lowest level in three weeks, as traders digested the latest inflation data. Japan's core consumer price index rose by 3.1% in July , a slight decrease from June's 3.3% but still higher than the expected 3%. Food prices in Japan rose 7.6% year-on-year in July 2025, accelerating from 7.2% in June and marking the fastest pace since February. Separately, Japan’s Ministry of Finance is preparing to raise its assumed interest rate for long-term government bonds to 2.6% in its fiscal 2026/27 budget requests, marking the highest level in 17 years, Reuters reported, citing the Yomiuri Shimbun on Friday. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.66% to above 3,780 on Friday, while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.6% to 11,990, with the former touching a fresh decade high as strong fund rotations and retail buying extended the market rally. Sentiment also improved on hopes of fresh stimulus from Beijing after China’s economy slowed in July. Starting in September, the Chinese government will launch a one-year consumer loan subsidy, covering 90% of interest costs, with local authorities funding the rest. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.25% to 25,191 in early trade on Friday, supported by gains across most sectors. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.61% to 81,630 in morning trade on Friday, as traders remained cautious ahead of US Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. The BSE Sensex halted a six-day winning streak that had been supported by optimism over Goods and Services Tax reforms. The Indian rupee held its recent decline to around 87.26 per USD on Friday. India's exports to China surged 20.0% year-on-year to USD 5.8 billion in the first four months of FY 2025-26 (April-July), rebounding sharply from a 4.5% decline during the same period in FY 2024-25. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.37% to slip back below the key 9,000 mark, a record high crossed for the first time in the previous session. The Australian dollar was little changed to around $0.642 on Friday, pausing its four-session losing streak, but on track for a 1.3% drop for the week, its second weekly decline. Australia's private sector activity expanded at the fastest pace since April 2022, with the composite PMI rising to 54.9 in August (vs 53.8 in July), driven by robust growth in both manufacturing (52.9 vs. 51.3) and services (55.1 vs. 54.1) sectors. In the U.S. on Thursday, all three major indexes ended lower , the S&P 500 closed 0.4% lower on Thursday, marking its fifth consecutive decline as investors looked ahead to Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. U.S. stock futures ticked up Friday as investors awaited Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at Jackson Hole for signals on the path of interest rates: Dow +0.02% ; S&P 500 +0.01% ; Nasdaq -0.08% .

The digital asset market is a dynamic place, and right now, two of its giants – Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) – appear to be charting different courses. Recent insights from CryptoQuant analyst XWIN Research Japan highlight a potential short-term correction for BTC, while Ethereum seems poised for an exciting uptrend. What does this mean for your portfolio? Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Short-Term Correction? The crypto world is buzzing with talk about Bitcoin’s immediate future. According to XWIN Research Japan’s insightful Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis on CryptoQuant, BTC might be heading for a short-term correction. Despite the recent price fluctuations, Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have remained remarkably stable, hovering around 2.53 million BTC. Typically, when investors move their BTC off exchanges, it reduces the available supply for selling, easing downward pressure. However, the current stability in reserves suggests a significant portion of Bitcoin supply remains liquid. This liquidity could potentially be a source for selling, especially as BTC recently slipped from $123,000 to $113,000. This price action, combined with stable reserves, raises concerns among market watchers. Ethereum’s Ascending Path: What’s Driving the Bullish Momentum? In stark contrast to Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) is flashing strong signals of an impending uptrend. Our Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis reveals a compelling narrative for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Data indicates a steady increase in the volume of ETH leaving exchanges. This trend became particularly pronounced in late July and mid-August, with outflows exceeding 300,000 ETH on multiple occasions. When Ethereum leaves exchanges, it reduces the circulating supply, creating a ‘supply shock’ scenario. This reinforces a bullish outlook, as less ETH available for sale often translates to higher prices if demand remains strong or increases. It’s a key factor driving optimism around ETH’s price action. Navigating Divergent Paths: What Should Investors Consider? Understanding these diverging trends is crucial for any crypto investor. This Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis highlights that while Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory might present challenges, Ethereum’s outlook appears increasingly positive. Investors should carefully monitor exchange reserve data for both assets. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin: Watch for further movements in exchange reserves. A sustained decrease could signal reduced selling pressure, while continued stability might keep correction risks elevated. Ethereum: The ongoing exchange outflows are a strong bullish indicator. Continued demand coupled with shrinking supply could fuel significant price appreciation. Diversification: Consider how these individual asset movements impact your overall portfolio strategy. Do these trends suggest rebalancing or a shift in focus? The crypto market continues its fascinating evolution, presenting both hurdles and opportunities. While Bitcoin faces potential headwinds from liquid supply, Ethereum is building a compelling case for an upward surge driven by strong demand and diminishing exchange supply. Staying informed with detailed Bitcoin Ethereum Analysis is paramount for making sound investment decisions in this ever-changing landscape. The coming weeks will be critical in confirming these emerging trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “short-term correction” for Bitcoin? A short-term correction refers to a temporary decline in an asset’s price after a period of upward movement. It’s often a healthy market adjustment, allowing prices to consolidate before potentially resuming an uptrend. Q2: Why are Bitcoin exchange reserves important? Bitcoin exchange reserves indicate the amount of BTC held on centralized exchanges. High reserves can suggest potential selling pressure, as more coins are readily available for trading. Conversely, decreasing reserves often signal investors are moving BTC to cold storage, reducing immediate selling supply. Q3: What does increasing ETH outflow signify? Increasing Ethereum outflows from exchanges suggest that investors are moving their ETH into personal wallets, likely for long-term holding, staking, or use in decentralized finance (DeFi). This reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges, which can create a supply shock and potentially drive prices higher if demand remains strong. Q4: Should I sell my BTC based on this analysis? This analysis provides insights into potential market trends. It is not financial advice. Investment decisions should always be based on your personal financial situation, risk tolerance, and thorough research. Consider consulting a financial advisor. Q5: How can I stay informed about these trends? To stay updated, regularly follow reputable crypto news sources, market analysis platforms like CryptoQuant, and consider subscribing to newsletters from expert analysts.

Powered by Stripe’s Bridge and M0 protocol, the launch is expected in late 2025. Real-world spending via MetaMask Card will make crypto usable almost everywhere. MetaMask Unveils mUSD Stablecoin MetaMask, the leading Web3 wallet, has announced the launch of its own stablecoin, MetaMask USD (mUSD) , marking a major step toward mainstream crypto adoption. The stablecoin will be deeply integrated into the MetaMask ecosystem, designed to simplify on-chain transactions and bring crypto spending closer to everyday life. Issued by Stripe-Owned Bridge, Powered by M0 According to the announcement, mUSD will be issued by Bridge , a stablecoin platform owned by Stripe. Technical support will be provided by M0 , a decentralized protocol focused on liquidity and interoperability of digital dollars. This collaboration ensures both stability and cross-network compatibility—two key requirements for practical crypto payments. Two Main Use Cases for mUSD MetaMask revealed that users will initially get two primary ways to use the stablecoin: In the Wallet (at launch) : Users can fund wallets, make swaps, and transfer assets across Ethereum and Linea networks. In Real Life (expected in 2025) : Payments through MetaMask Card , allowing users to spend mUSD almost anywhere cards are accepted. This dual approach is designed to blend the benefits of decentralized finance (DeFi) with real-world usability. Launch Timeline and Network Availability The official launch of mUSD is scheduled for the second half of 2025 , starting on the Ethereum and Linea networks. These are two of the most widely used chains in the Web3 space, ensuring immediate utility for millions of existing MetaMask users. Why This Matters: Stripe’s Growing Crypto Role Stripe’s involvement in this project isn’t a coincidence. The payment giant re-entered the crypto scene in 2023, rolling out support for stablecoin payments like USDC. By powering MetaMask’s mUSD issuance through Bridge, Stripe signals its commitment to bridging traditional finance and Web3. This also follows the broader trend of stablecoin adoption, as major players like PayPal introduced its own stablecoin (PYUSD) in 2023 to facilitate global payments. MetaMask’s move adds a powerful wallet-driven option to this rapidly growing ecosystem. Gal Eldar, Product Manager at MetaMask, stated: “MetaMask USD is a critical step in the mass adoption of Web3. It removes barriers, reduces costs, and allows users to deposit funds into a self-custody wallet, spend them almost anywhere, and use them the way money was meant to be used.” Why It Could Be a Game-Changer If successful, mUSD could become a cornerstone for decentralized commerce , giving millions of MetaMask users the ability to move seamlessly between DeFi , NFTs , and real-world payments . It may also accelerate regulatory discussions , as governments watch the growing role of wallet-issued digital dollars in global finance. This could further reshape the payment landscape , offering businesses an alternative to traditional banking systems and driving financial inclusion for unbanked populations. With Stripe backing the issuance and MetaMask ensuring seamless wallet integration, mUSD has the potential to make Web3 truly usable in everyday life. The second half of 2025 could mark a turning point for crypto adoption.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|BUSINESS|PYUSD,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-22 05:44:50

Its supply has surged by over 160% year-to-date. The synthetic BTC landscape has significantly shifted since Coinbase first launched cbBTC in September 2024, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. At the time of publication, the digital asset’s supply has increased from 1,000 worth of synthetic Bitcoins to over 30,500 cbBTC. Coinbase delists wBTC cbBTC is onchain. cbBTC is an ERC20 token that is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin (BTC) held by Coinbase. This means millions of BTC holders can now securely access DeFi apps on @base and Ethereum ecosystems—with more chains coming soon. Here’s what you need to know ↓ pic.twitter.com/nF8mF3JGms — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) September 12, 2024 Despite cbBTC’s growth, the largest synthetic BTC token on Ethereum, wBTC, has seen a 17% drop in its supply since the launch of cbBTC. At the time of writing, wBTC has also declined by 4% year-to-date. On-chain data also shows that the total supply of synthetic BTC on Ethereum has only increased by roughly 3% since cbBTC launched in mid-September 2024. The difference in growth of other synthetic BTCs compared to cbBTC’s growth over the past year suggests that there’s been a market share shift inside the total synthetic-BTC space. The shift from the synthetic BTC product on Ethereum notably began in August 2024 after issuer BitGo announced a Justin Sun-related affiliate would be taking a greater role in managing wBTC. BitGo CEO Mike Belshe acknowledged Sun’s involvement in the joint venture, stressing the company’s continued commitment to security. Sun maintained that his involvement in wBTC is entirely strategic. He also acknowledged that he does not control the private keys to the wBTC reserves and cannot move any BTC reserves. Coinbase later delisted the synthetic BTC product on Ethereum on December 19, 2024. The crypto exchange argued that it regularly monitors the assets on its platform to ensure they meet its listing standards. Coinbase revealed that it moved its wBTC order books to limit-only mode, meaning that users could place and cancel limit orders of the token on the platform. It also allowed users to move their wBTC tokens off the exchange even after its delisting. The delisting of wBTC resulted in a legal challenge from BiT Global, a firm backed by Sun. The company later dropped the lawsuit against Coinbase with prejudice, meaning it can’t be brought again. Since its inception, the substitution and migrational flows from wBTC to cbBTC have driven a large portion of the token’s growth on Ethereum. cbBTC’s growth can also be attributed to Coinbase’s ability to funnel BTC holders directly into cbBTC through its existing custody, prime brokerage, and exchange rails. The initiative has reduced the hops and operational friction compared to third-party exchanges, making cbBTC easily accessible to institutions and treasuries that already clear through Coinbase. cbBTC’s growth can also be linked to its integration into Persistence DEX V2 on June 25. The initiative enables cross-chain swaps between Base and BNB Chain via an unaudited mainnet in closed beta. Cross-chain swaps of cbBTC require users to have a minimum of $10 in cbBTC and roughly $0.005 ETH for gas fees to participate. The initiative for Coinbase’s Wrapped Bitcoin expands its use case beyond the exchange’s ecosystem into decentralized cross-chain liquidity. cbBTC’s unaudited status and gated access also limit its immediate adoption, but increased demand could follow if Persistence scales its BTCFi sector. cbBTC-backed loans surpass $1B in collateral Coinbase also revealed on July 15 that its cbBTC-backed loans surpassed $1 billion in collateral, facilitated by Morpho Labs on Base. The token has become the exchange’s collateral option due to its role in Coinbase’s on-chain ecosystem. The increase in cbBTC collateral suggests a surge in its utility, signaling institutional and retail demand for holding Coinbase’s wrapped BTC variant. The token’s reliance on centralized custody, through Coinbase, limits its growth among decentralized exchanges. Coinbase also plans to introduce proof of reserves for cbBTC’s BTC collateral. The platform announced the initiative during the token’s initial launch, which would verify the 1:1 backing of cbBTC with Bitcoin held in the exchange’s custody. Coinbase also plans to expand cbBTC’s cross-chain Bitcoin utility beyond Ethereum and Base to chains like Solana to leverage its high-speed infrastructure for low-cost swaps and lending use cases.

His commentary centers on the market risks for XRP holders , particularly about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Hilton said while there are always concerns about potential downturns in digital assets, the current state of the market suggests that XRP is not facing a severe downside scenario in the near term. Bitcoin’s Role in XRP Market Movements Hilton emphasized that Bitcoin holds the dominant position in the cryptocurrency market, representing nearly 60% of total market capitalization. He stated that where Bitcoin goes, the broader market, including XRP, tends to follow. In his analysis, the consensus across research and market evaluations indicates that Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $100,000 through the end of 2025. With Bitcoin currently trading around $115,000, this provides a level of stability that reduces the probability of XRP seeing a dramatic decline. Hilton acknowledged that XRP maintains its market drivers, such as partnerships, acquisitions , and potential regulatory or institutional developments. However, he insisted that its performance remains strongly correlated to Bitcoin’s broader market direction. If Bitcoin were to fall significantly, for example, to $80,000, Hilton argued that XRP would inevitably be impacted. Conversely, with projections that Bitcoin potentially reaching between $150,000 and $200,000 by the end of 2025, he views this as a supportive environment for XRP growth. XRP Holders! It's not going to happen! pic.twitter.com/gTvH7yMi19 — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) August 19, 2025 Assessing Risk and Price Projections Hilton explained that one of the main concerns for any crypto holder is the worst-case scenario for asset pricing. Addressing this directly, he said the current market outlook shows limited downside risk for XRP. Even in a situation where Bitcoin retraces to $100,000, Hilton suggested that XRP would not collapse into ranges as low as $0.50. Instead, he estimated that downside risks would likely be contained above $2, barring extreme global circumstances. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Looking ahead, Hilton described a more optimistic scenario in which XRP could rise significantly if Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory. In his view, XRP could move into ranges between $4 and $10 or higher by the end of 2025, especially if additional catalysts such as exchange-traded funds or large-scale partnerships materialize. Market Perspective Hilton evaluates the importance of assessing XRP not in isolation but within the broader dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. He encouraged holders to consider Bitcoin’s role as the market leader and highlighted how its movements influence other major assets, including Ethereum and Cardano. By recognizing this connection, Hilton argued that XRP investors can have a clearer understanding of both the risks and opportunities in the coming months. He concluded his video by reinforcing his main message: XRP holders are unlikely to see a severe price collapse under the current market conditions. According to Hilton, the data suggest that both Bitcoin and XRP are positioned for long-term growth, with only limited downside risk in the short to medium term.

50477918,562721,1755842404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50477918.jpeg,"Chainlink’s Unprecedented Feat: ISO 27001, SOC 2 Compliance Achieved",https://bitcoinist.com/chainlinks-unprecedented-feat-iso-27001-soc-2/,"Decentralized oracle provider, Chainlink (LINK), has made significant progress in terms of regulation by becoming the first oracle platform to achieve both ISO 27001 and SOC 2 compliance, enhancing the protocol’s security standards. How Chainlink’s Certifications Enhance Its Oracle Services The announcement detailed that the compliance assessments encompass Chainlink Data Feeds—particularly focused on Price Feeds and SmartData, including Proof of Reserve and Net Asset Value (NAV)—as well as the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). By achieving these certifications, Chainlink sets a new benchmark for data and interoperability oracle platforms within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector. Chainlink’s dominance in the oracle market is evident; it currently holds approximately 68% of the total value secured (TVS) in DeFi, which translates to over $90 billion in secured assets. However, given the recent achievement of compliance standards, it is expected further adoption and usage of the protocol, as well as demand for LINK tokens, not only from retail, but also from institutional investors. Chainlink’s interoperability standard is also gaining traction among financial institutions and asset issuers, such as Swift and UBS, marking a significant step towards bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology . The ISO 27001 certification confirms that Chainlink has established a comprehensive Information Security Management System (ISMS) that governs the infrastructure, development, operations, and security of its services. Meanwhile, the SOC 2 Type 1 attestation validates that Chainlink has implemented a robust set of security and operational controls, ensuring reliable and compliant oracle services designed to safeguard both the organization and its clients. Leveraging US Crypto Regulations The timing of these certifications is ideal for the protocol, as the regulatory landscape in the US is seeing a major shift under President Donald Trump’s administration and its pro-crypto vision . With the recent passage of key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, experts assert that Chainlink is well-positioned to capitalize on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the adoption of blockchain technology by institutions. Market analysis firm Birb Nest underscores that no other project provides such a comprehensive suite of services in the crypto market, positioning Chainlink as the essential link between traditional finance and blockchain economies. Major financial institutions, including J.P. Morgan, Mastercard, and Fidelity, have publicly acknowledged their collaboration with Chainlink technology, signaling widespread adoption. The firm notes that as institutions increasingly adopt blockchain technology, the demand for secure data, interoperability , compliance, privacy, and integration with legacy systems will only grow. Interestingly, Chainlink is set to stand out as the only unified and modular platform capable of delivering these needs at scale. As a result of the excitement surrounding the protocol’s potential, LINK has been the top performer of the market with a nearly 9% surge on the weekly time frame. Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) on the other hand, record losses of 8% and 5% during the same period. When writing, the token trades at $25, 52% below its all-time high of $52.

Speed, Mobile Mining, & 300+ dApps Pre-Launch",https://thecoinrise.com/what-sets-blockdag-apart-from-kaspa-speed-mobile-mining-300-dapps-pre-launch/,"When Kaspa entered the scene with its rapid blockDAG system, it reshaped the possibilities of proof-of-work chains. Now, BlockDAG (BDAG) is gaining attention as the logical evolution, a scalable, hybrid Layer 1 chain that brings together performance, protection, and adoption strategies few projects can match. Having raised over $378 million during its presale, with more than 2.5 million mobile miners and 4,500+ developers working on 300+ dApps, BlockDAG is becoming one of the most talked-about names in crypto. But beyond the buzz, what is BlockDAG really about, and why do analysts believe it builds on Kaspa’s foundation? Combining DAG Structure with Proof-of-Work Strength BlockDAG’s design is built around a directed acyclic graph (DAG) combined with a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus system. DAG allows for many blocks to be processed at once, eliminating the slowdowns caused by the linear nature of traditional chains like Bitcoin or Ethereum. PoW, meanwhile, provides the security that early blockchain systems became known for. The result is a network that can handle up to 10 blocks every second, a pace that rivals post-launch projects such as Solana and Avalanche. But unlike Solana, BlockDAG doesn’t trade decentralization for speed. Its structure is intended to encourage broad participation without leaning on validator centralization. While Kaspa was the first to bring blockDAG consensus to life, BlockDAG enhances it with easier mining access and tools that appeal to developers, giving it wider appeal across different groups. Building a Large Community Before Mainnet A key part of BlockDAG’s strategy is building a large user base even before the mainnet goes live. The X1 mobile miner app, with more than 2.5 million users, allows anyone to mine BDAG coins right from their phone, with little technical effort required. This move has created one of the largest networks of users before a chain’s full launch. BlockDAG has also sold 19,350 ASIC miners, adding serious hash power from institutional-grade setups. This mix of individual and industrial participation means BlockDAG is launching with a built-in ecosystem. Unlike Kaspa, which had to gradually attract its mining community, BlockDAG starts with both community and infrastructure in place. Developer Activity & Expanding the Ecosystem The success of any blockchain hinges on its ecosystem, and BlockDAG is already making progress here. Over 4,500 developers are currently building more than 300 decentralized apps (dApps), covering categories from DeFi to games. This level of developer involvement before launch is rare, and it shows how much value BlockDAG’s EVM compatibility brings. Developers can move Ethereum apps over with little need for code changes, making the switch smoother. Kaspa impressed with its architecture, but BlockDAG appears to be addressing a more complete equation: high speed, strong security, user access, and ecosystem adoption. By bringing together everyday users, technical developers, and industrial-scale hardware all before launch, BlockDAG is creating the foundation for long-term activity. Its presale, already past $378M, reflects this momentum. With Batch 29 coins priced at $0.0276 and a confirmed listing price of $0.05, early participants are looking at a possible 3025% return. This rapid presale growth shows more than just retail enthusiasm. Larger buyers have also started getting involved in recent stages, suggesting a shift toward institutional backing. Unlike Layer 1 chains that focus heavily on media attention, BDAG has moved quietly, focusing on network building and long-term infrastructure. This approach sets it apart from hype-driven projects. With careful execution and growing participation, BDAG is heading into its listing phase with strong preparation. Why BlockDAG Draws Comparisons to Kaspa The question many are asking is whether BlockDAG can follow Kaspa’s path. Analysts believe that if the ecosystem grows as expected, BDAG could reach $1 within 12–18 months after listing. From the Batch 29 price of $0.0276, that would be a nearly 36x gain. Some longer-term forecasts go even higher, to between $5 and $10, depending on how adoption scales, much like what Solana and Avalanche achieved. Of course, this growth depends on consistent developer activity, reliable exchange listings, and system stability. Still, with hundreds of dApps underway, millions of users on board, and real hardware supporting the network, BDAG has already built more than many L1s had at launch. Kaspa made history by showing how blockDAG consensus could deliver speed and efficiency. BlockDAG builds on that idea with added infrastructure, a strong community, and compatibility with Ethereum-based applications. If Kaspa proved what was possible, BlockDAG looks like the version made for broader adoption. Its progress toward a $600M presale goal is a sign that the market sees its long-term value. Closing Thoughts BlockDAG isn’t just running another presale for attention. It’s taking Kaspa’s key breakthrough and stretching it into a larger, more complete strategy. With its combination of DAG and PoW, its large user base before launch, strong developer involvement, and a fast-moving presale, BlockDAG could become one of the most important Layer 1 projects in recent memory. Whether it hits the $1 mark after launch or climbs even higher over time, the foundation already laid is impressive. At a time when many projects chase headlines, BlockDAG is focusing on real results, and that’s why many are calling it the best crypto to buy before it reaches exchanges.

Ethereum Perpetual Futures Volume Dominance Has Hit 67% According to data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the Ethereum perpetual futures volume has shot up recently. Below is the chart cited by Glassnode, showing the trend in the perpetual futures volume dominance breakdown between Ethereum and Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, Ethereum overtook Bitcoin in perpetual futures volume a while ago, indicating that speculators shifted their attention from BTC to ETH. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Volume Signal Nailed The Top & Bottom: Analytics Firm The two have only continued to diverge since then, meaning that trader interest in the coin ranked number two by market cap is only going up. Following the latest continuation to the increase, the ETH perpetual futures volume dominance has reached the 67% mark, which is a new all-time high (ATH). The analytics firm explains, Over the years, Ethereum has generally been considered a bellweather asset, with periods of its out-performance usually correlated with broader a “altseason” phase in the digital asset market. As such, this pronounced rotation in trading activity can be a sign of growing focus on the altcoin sector among the investors. Glassnode also notes the trend could point to “an acceleration of risk appetite within this market cycle.” Ethereum’s dominance has also grown in terms of another perpetual futures market indicator: the Open Interest. This metric measures the total amount of contracts related to a given asset that are open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. Here is a chart that shows how ETH’s dominance of this metric has changed relative to BTC over the past few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum perpetual futures Open Interest dominance has climbed to 43.3% recently. Bitcoin remains dominant with the metric sitting at 56.7%, but compared to earlier in the year, the difference is a lot closer. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear Is Back: Traders Flip As Price Plunges To $113,000 In terms of the futures sector as a whole, the combined Open Interest across major altcoins (Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin) set a new ATH of $60.2 billion recently. Though, this high couldn’t last, as the indicator suffered a sharp $2.6 billion drawdown soon after. This drop in the Open Interest of the major altcoins is the tenth largest on record. The report notes, These rapid fluctuations underscore that altcoins are currently drawing a significant amount of investor attention, and have meaningfully contributed to heightened reflexivity and fragility across digital asset markets. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $4,200, down almost 7% in the last seven days.

The analysis shows that when China's money supply (M2) outpaces that of the US, Bitcoin typically trends upward. The report argues that Bitcoin prices have seen a strong increase in the past few weeks, particularly following liquidity injections from the People's Bank of China (PBoC). Furthermore, the decline in US M2 money supply dominance is also considered a positive signal for BTC. According to available data: China's M2 Money Supply: 329.94 trillion yuan. This represents a 0.10% decrease compared to last month and an 8.78% increase compared to last year. US M2 Money Supply: $22.02 trillion. This represents a 0.63% increase compared to last month and a 4.53% increase compared to last year.

M2 Money Supply is a measure of the money supply that includes, in addition to M1 money supply, financial assets primarily held by households, such as savings deposits, time deposits, and balances in retail money market mutual funds. M1 includes more liquid financial assets such as cash, traveler's checks, demand deposits, and other withdrawable deposits. *This is not investment advice.

This pivotal shift, as reported by U.Today citing a Financial Times report, indicates a move away from earlier considerations of private blockchains. The decision underscores the EU’s urgency to accelerate its digital currency efforts, driven by concerns about lagging behind the U.S. in the rapidly evolving stablecoin market. Why Public Blockchains for the Digital Euro Project? The EU’s potential pivot towards public blockchain networks for its digital euro project signals a strategic re-evaluation. While central banks often prefer private ledgers for control, public chains offer distinct advantages: Enhanced Transparency: Public blockchains allow verifiable transactions, fostering trust and accountability. Innovation Ecosystem: Leveraging platforms like Ethereum or Solana taps into vast developer communities, potentially accelerating the digital euro project’s development and adoption. Resilience: Building on a public network can offer decentralized aspects, making the system more robust and less prone to single points of failure. This strategic choice reflects a proactive stance by EU officials. They aim to prevent the EU from falling behind in digital currency innovation, especially given global stablecoin advancements. Ethereum or Solana: Which Platform Will Power the Digital Euro Project? The choice between Ethereum and Solana presents a critical decision for the digital euro project , with each offering unique strengths: Ethereum’s Strengths: As the leading smart contract platform, Ethereum boasts a massive developer community, robust security, and a proven track record. Its mature ecosystem and extensive tooling provide a reliable environment for complex applications. Solana’s Advantages: Solana is known for its high speed and low transaction costs. Its impressive throughput capabilities are crucial for a national digital currency expected to handle millions of daily transactions. Solana’s scalability could efficiently address high user volumes for the digital euro project . The EU’s technical assessment will carefully weigh these factors. The chosen platform must balance security, scalability, cost-efficiency, and a strong community to support the long-term vision of the digital euro project . What Are the Hurdles Facing the Digital Euro Project? While a public blockchain-powered digital euro project is exciting, several significant challenges require robust solutions: Regulatory Frameworks: Integrating a digital currency into existing finance demands extensive regulatory adjustments and clear legal guidance for public ledgers. Scalability: Even advanced public chains face pressure handling national-scale payment systems. Ensuring peak demand without compromising speed or cost is vital. Privacy Concerns: Balancing user privacy with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) compliance is delicate, given the transparency of public blockchains. Interoperability: The digital euro must seamlessly integrate with current banking infrastructure and other digital payment systems. Addressing these challenges effectively is paramount for the successful implementation and widespread adoption of the digital euro. The EU’s exploration of these options shows a serious commitment to overcoming potential hurdles. The EU’s contemplation of Ethereum and Solana for its digital euro project is more than a technical decision; it’s a profound statement about the future of finance. This move signals a growing recognition of blockchain technology’s transformative potential. Should the EU proceed with a public blockchain, it could set a significant precedent for central banks globally, influencing the trajectory of central bank digital currencies and the broader crypto landscape. The journey ahead for the digital euro project promises to be immensely fascinating, shaping how we transact and interact with money in the digital age. Frequently Asked Questions about the Digital Euro Project Q: What is the digital euro project? A: It’s an EU initiative to create a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the eurozone. This digital euro, issued by the ECB, would complement physical cash and bank deposits. Q: Why consider Ethereum and Solana? A: The EU explores these public blockchains for their transparency, innovation ecosystems, and resilience. This also helps avoid falling behind other nations in digital currency development. Q: What are public blockchain advantages for a CBDC? A: Benefits include greater transaction transparency, access to a vast developer community for innovation, and enhanced system resilience compared to private ledgers. Q: What challenges might the project face? A: Challenges involve complex regulatory adjustments, ensuring scalability for national transaction volumes, balancing user privacy with compliance, and achieving interoperability with existing financial systems. Q: How does it differ from cryptocurrencies? A: Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, the digital euro would be a centralized CBDC issued and controlled by the ECB, offering stability and trust similar to physical cash.

50478596,562900,1755843607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50478596.jpeg,Dogecoin’s Four-Year Pump Pattern Flashes Again —  Maxi Doge Presale Draws Speculators,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-cycle-hype-maxi-doge-presale-hits-1-3m/,"Dogecoin ($DOGE), the original meme coin, shows signs of once again repeating its historic market cycle – the same pattern that triggered monster rallies in 2017 and 2021. While long-time $DOGE holders watch closely for a breakout, there’s a new dog in the pack. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is aggressively marketing itself as the next contender in the meme coin space, already securing over $1.3M in presale commitments. Will $DOGE break out? Can $MAXI catch him? Buckle up for a wild ride. Dogecoin’s Familiar Playbook Despite being down 18% in the past 30 days, Dogecoin’s chart structure keeps drawing attention from analysts who point to its repeating four-to-five-year rhythm. Popular analyst, Trader Tardigrade , highlighted on X this week that $DOGE has entered the lower range of its long-term pump channel. Those points have, in past cycles, preceded face-ripping rallies to new highs. Adding weight to the bullish narrative, $DOGE also printed a golden cross earlier last week, a technical signal that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day. Historically, this has preceded momentum-driven upswings across both traditional and crypto markets. On-chain activity also suggests Dogecoin remains relevant beyond speculation. Payment processor BitPay recently reported that $DOGE accounted for 6% of all crypto transactions on its network in July. Add in a dash of the normal Elon Musk crypto news – inevitably seen as a boost for $DOGE, a perennial Musk favorite – and $DOGE, while down, is certainly not out. Meme Coins in Context The same is true for the broader meme coin sector. It has proven resilient despite volatility across digital assets in 2025. According to CoinGecko, the category holds a combined market capitalization of around $70B, led by Dogecoin, Shiba Inu ($SHIB), and Pepe ($PEPE). Though critics often dismiss meme coins as mere speculative vehicles with little intrinsic value, they have consistently drawn liquidity during bullish phases. And during those bullish phases, nothing explodes quite like a good meme coin, which can see winners come out of nowhere to boom 10x or even 100x or more, leaving more established altcoins in the dust. And dog-themed coins do their own thing; taken broadly, the dog-themed meme sector accounts for roughly $45B of the $70B total meme coin market. And it’s about to get another boost from the biggest Doge yet. Enter Maxi Doge ($DOGE) , a new Doge-themed meme coin with a booming presale. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Enters the Arena Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is Doge for the gym-bros among us. Styled with gym culture aesthetics and high-risk trading promises, the project has already raised an eyebrow-raising $1.3M+ in less than four weeks. Its main premise is to embody and embolden the risk-takers in the crypto market. Its 1000x leverage philosophy is more than a joke — it’s a lifestyle. It’s about embracing the pump, chasing max gains, and trusting your skills. Speaking of skills, the project even teases futures partnerships and derivatives trading competitions with airdrop rewards for top ROI traders. Overall, Maxi Doge is positioning itself as a high-risk, high-reward meme asset for degens, with community building for futures traders under the hood as well. A gym-heavy, meme-filled project, $MAXI is still a reliable one; its smart contracts have been audited by Coinsult and SOLIDProof. Our guide on how to buy $MAXI covers more key project details, including its roadmap, features, and community sentiment. Currently priced at $0.0002535 in its presale round, $MAXI’s price is scheduled to rise within two days. Buyers can immediately stake their tokens for an estimated 214% dynamic APY through the project’s native staking platform. Check Maxi’s presale for more information. Market Outlook: Looking Up for $DOGE, $MAXI Maxi Doge ($MAXI) has no intention of staying in $DOGE’s shadows. $MAXI is a bigger, better version of $DOGE itself, swollen with raw gains potential and a desire to profit, profit, profit. Dogecoin is once again flirting with its trademark cycle, and history suggests traders ignore it at their peril. But as new challengers like Maxi Doge step forward with aggressive marketing and bold promises, the meme coin market could be gearing up for another chaotic chapter. As always, do your own research; this isn’t financial advice.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|ZRX|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-22 06:20:07
