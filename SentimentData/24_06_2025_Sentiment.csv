On June 23, 2025, the EU Commissioner for Industrial Strategy, Stephane Sejourne, while talking to the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that countries within the EU need to establish joint strategic reserves of rare earths to counter supply chain disruptions and potential “economic blackmail” from China. The EU can defend itself from economic blackmail from China It is common knowledge that all European countries have oil and gas reserves, but Sejourne wants to take things further by advocating for the creation of a strategic reserve for raw materials. In June, the European Union announced 13 new raw material projects outside the bloc that would increase its supplies of metals and minerals essential to its competitiveness in the energy transition, as well as defense and aerospace. This followed China’s decision in April to impose export curbs on rare earth magnets until new licences are obtained, which left diplomats, carmakers and other companies from Europe and other countries rushing to meet with Beijing officials and avert factory shutdowns. That move from China opened the EU’s eyes to how dependent it has become on the Asian giant for rare earths, and Sejourne wants that to end. She has committed to launching further tenders this year to promote alternative raw material sources. Sejourne has also warned Beijing, reminding them that the EU also has the tools to defend itself in a potential trade war. “Europe must finally use the same weapons as its competitors,” he said. China responded in June, saying it attached great importance to the EU’s concerns and would consider speeding up the approval process to get rare earth exports to the EU. EU leaders hope to address rare earth access at a July summit with China The issue of the EU’s dependence on China for rare earths is a priority for the EU, and leaders are reportedly planning to address rare earth access at the upcoming July 2025 summit with China. While China has offered a “green channel” to expedite licenses for EU firms, this is seen as a partial fix, as approvals are still subject to Beijing’s discretion. The summit aims to negotiate stable supply terms, but EU officials are wary of China’s leverage, and rightfully so, given it has a history of using rare earths exports as a diplomatic tool. Earlier this month when China’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, met with EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, he talked about reciprocation, mentioning how he hoped the bloc would also “adopt effective measures to facilitate, safeguard, and promote compliant trade of high-tech products with China.” They also spoke of Chinese electric vehicle imports into European countries, which the EU has hit with levies over allegedly unfair subsidies from Beijing. “The negotiation on the price commitment of electric vehicles between China and Europe has entered the final stage, but both sides still need to make efforts,” the commerce ministry said.

The emerging token is now being compared by some analysts to the early stages of Solana and Ethereum’s historic rallies — and with Litecoin showing fresh signs of life, the market narrative is shifting toward unexpected leaders in the altcoin space. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 2025 Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the most talked-about early-stage crypto asset of 2025. Its presale has seen overwhelming demand, with phases selling out almost instantly and over $10 million raised from global buyers. This surge is not just hype-driven—analysts highlight its scarcity-focused tokenomics, fully audited smart contract, and disciplined rollout as key structural strengths. The project’s limited supply and asymmetric reward mechanics are drawing comparisons to early-stage runs of meme giants, but with a more refined and strategic approach. Analyst Projections: 30x–100x Potential Crypto analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver returns between 25x and 100x, with some estimates suggesting an 18,500% ROI for early buyers. This optimism is fueled by: Scarcity mechanics that reduce dilution risk and prime the asset for exponential growth. Massive presale demand and accumulation by both retail and institutional players, indicating strong conviction and long-term holding behavior. Cultural relevance and a politically charged brand that drives organic growth and community engagement Solana: Institutional Catalysts and ETF Hopes Solana (SOL) recently experienced a strong bounce from key support, with a 5.2% price increase to $139.30 on June 23, 2025, and trading volumes exceeding $2.1 billion in 24 hours.The excitement around a potential Solana ETF approval is a major catalyst, with institutional interest surging and the network’s Alpenglow upgrade promising sub-second transaction finality. SOL’s price action is closely tied to broader risk-on sentiment in tech stocks, further amplifying its upside in bullish market conditions. Ethereum: Technical Breakout Imminent Ethereum is trading above $2,500, having rebounded 79% from its April low. Analysts are eyeing a “golden cross” on technical charts—a historic bullish reversal signal. Whale accumulation is at record highs, and inflows into spot ETH ETFs underscore growing institutional confidence. Forecasts suggest a decisive breakout above $4,000 could propel ETH to $6,000–$8,000 in 2025, marking a new all-time high. Litecoin: The “Silver” Factor While not as explosive as Solana or Ethereum, Litecoin remains a staple for risk-averse investors seeking reliable upside during bull cycles. Its established reputation as “digital silver” and consistent network activity make it a favored hedge, especially when meme and altcoin rallies accelerate. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Replicate These Rallies MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current setup mirrors the early momentum seen in Solana and Ethereum before their historic rallies: Early-stage accumulation and scarcity-driven tokenomics echo Solana’s pre-ETF surge and Ethereum’s pre-breakout consolidation. Strong community and cultural branding provide viral potential, reminiscent of meme coin booms but with greater structural integrity. Analysts’ conviction in 30x–100x returns is based on the same market imbalances that fueled Solana and Ethereum’s exponential growth in previous cycles. Conclusion With surging presale demand, disciplined rollout, and a scarcity-focused model, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as the breakout altcoin of 2025 . Its trajectory could mirror the explosive rallies of Solana and Ethereum, while its fundamentals offer a more calculated approach than typical meme coins—making it a strategic pick for those seeking outsized returns before mainstream exchange listings.

Here’s Why Smart Investors Believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is the Best Bet For Such Returns,https://timestabloid.com/missed-shiba-inus-shib-100x-rally-heres-why-smart-investors/,"Shiba Inu made headlines for its phenomenal 100x rally, creating countless overnight millionaires. But for many who missed that boat, repeating such returns may feel like a distant dream. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI), a rising star in cryptocurrency. With a structured growth plan, innovative applications, and a presale raising over $1.9 million , smart investors are now turning to Ruvi AI as the best bet for achieving life-changing gains. Why Ruvi AI Is Smarter Than Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu thrived on speculation and community hype, its lack of clear utility left many wondering about its long-term relevance. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, blends blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to address practical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. This focus on real-world problem-solving ensures RUVI tokens have sustained value beyond just market trends or social media buzz. Ruvi AI’s structured growth model is another key advantage. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at a highly accessible $0.015 per token. At the end of the presale, the price will lock at $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts also predict Ruvi AI could hit $1 after listing , offering an extraordinary 66x ROI for early investors. This transparency and clear growth trajectory make Ruvi AI particularly attractive to investors seeking predictable yet massive returns. Strong Presale Performance Signals Potential Ruvi AI’s presale numbers paint a promising picture for its future. Key milestones include: Raising over $1.9 million, showcasing strong community and investor interest. Selling more than 160 million tokens, highlighting substantial demand. Growing a community of over 1,600 holders, reflecting its widespread appeal. Unlike Shiba Inu’s unpredictable rises and falls, Ruvi AI offers a guaranteed price of $0.07 post-presale. This ensures financial stability and an immediate boost in value for investors who join during this early stage. Maximize Your ROI With VIP Investment Tiers For those looking to seriously grow their investments, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers , designed to reward early backers with generous bonus tokens. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers not only offer immediate value but also create opportunities for mind-blowing returns as Ruvi AI approaches its $1 price projection. Built-In Security and Transparency Another factor making Ruvi AI stand out is its commitment to security and transparency. Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI has undergone a third-party audit by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. This successful audit ensures the platform is secure, further building trust among investors. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity. This means RUVI tokens will be tradeable as soon as the presale ends, providing flexibility and reliability for investors eager to capitalize on market growth. Real-World Applications Ensure Demand While meme coins like Shiba Inu rely on community hype, Ruvi AI builds demand through practical utility. Here’s how it stands out across industries: Marketing: Businesses optimize ad strategies, refine audience targeting, and increase ROI with Ruvi AI’s AI-driven tools. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from personalized AI tools and blockchain-secured payment systems, making it easier to grow audiences and monetize content. Finance: Institutions use Ruvi AI for fraud detection, scalability, and improved operational transparency, leading to streamlined processes and better outcomes. This diversity in applications ensures that RUVI tokens maintain demand over time, creating a robust foundation for consistent growth. Why Ruvi AI Is the Best Bet for 100x Returns For crypto enthusiasts who missed Shiba Inu’s once-in-a-lifetime rally, Ruvi AI represents a second chance, but with far more predictability and functionality. The presale pricing at just $0.015 per token , coupled with a locked $0.07 post-sale valuation , gives early investors a clear roadmap to high returns. Having raised over $1.9 million , sold more than 160 million tokens , and secured partnerships with trusted names like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI has laid the groundwork for unparalleled success.

46645353,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72345,1750719793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Flare CEO: A New Product That Will Put 10’s of Billions of XRP to Work Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/flare-ceo-a-new-product-that-will-put-10s-of-billions-of-xrp-to-work-is-coming/,"Flare Network CEO Hugo Philion has teased a groundbreaking innovation that could transform the XRP ecosystem: Firelight. In a recent post on X, Philion revealed that he spent time in the U.S. with the Firelight team, praising the product as “hugely innovative” and capable of putting “billions, if not tens of billions, of XRP to work” on the Flare Network. Introducing Firelight: Unlocking XRP’s True Potential Firelight is a liquid staking protocol designed to bring dormant XRP to life through decentralized finance (DeFi). At its core, Firelight allows users to mint FXRP, a fully collateralized representation of XRP on the Flare Network . Once FXRP is deposited into Firelight’s Launch Vault, users receive an equal amount of stXRP—an ERC-20 token that can be traded, lent, or used across DeFi platforms while still earning staking rewards. According to Philion, this approach will revolutionize XRP staking, offering both flexibility and powerful yield-generating opportunities. Early adopters of Firelight will also earn Firelight Points, an incentive designed to reward participants for engaging with the protocol from the outset. I spent much of the last week in the US with the Firelight team. This product is hugely innovative and has the potential to put BILLIONS if not 10’s of BILLIONS of XRP to work -> on Flare. — Hugo Philion (@HugoPhilion) June 22, 2025 Institutional Adoption: Billions Already Committed Philion’s bold claims aren’t without backing. Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has already committed $100 million worth of XRP to the Flare ecosystem, specifically through Firelight, in a move aimed at generating stable yield and growing its treasury. Uphold, one of the largest holders of XRP with roughly 1.8 billion tokens in custody, has also confirmed plans to integrate FXRP, signaling major institutional confidence in the system. Meanwhile, testing on Flare’s canary network, Songbird, has shown strong early results. In just a few days, over $2 million in FXRP was minted, driving a 220% surge in total value locked (TVL) and significantly boosting stablecoin activity. A Secure, Scalable Framework for DeFi Security and trust are central to Firelight’s design. All collateral agents are KYC-verified, and FXRP is backed by a diversified pool of over-collateralized assets, including FLR and stablecoins. This ensures users can rely on Firelight for both performance and protection, key for attracting institutional and retail investors alike. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More importantly, Firelight solves one of the XRPL’s current limitations: the absence of native staking. By offering yield on XRP without compromisinadvised to conduct thoroughg liquidity, Flare positions itself as a leading hub for XRP-based DeFi—or what some now call “XRPFi.” A New Era for XRP Utility With XRP’s market cap sitting above $130 billion, even a small portion of assets deployed via Firelight could translate into tens of billions of dollars in active capital. Philion’s vision reflects this potential: a decentralized ecosystem where XRP holders can earn yield, participate in DeFi, and retain liquidity, all without leaving the safety of the Flare ecosystem. Firelight is currently live on Songbird, with a full launch on Flare’s mainnet expected soon. Once deployed, it could mark a major milestone—not just for Flare, but for XRP as a whole. As Philion put it, this is not just another product. It’s the beginning of a new financial paradigm for XRP holders worldwide.

It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!” Trump posted. He detailed that Iran would begin the first 12-hour truce, followed by Israel starting theirs in the second half, closing what he called the “12 Day War.” Trump also declared, “During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL.” He praised both countries for what he called their “Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence” to end a war he said could have “destroyed the entire Middle East.” Trump ended the post with a long line of blessings—naming Israel, Iran, the Middle East, the U.S., and “THE WORLD.” Iran rejects Trump’s ceasefire claims, accuses U.S. of deception as Netanyahu confirms the deal But Tehran denied all of it. Aziz Nasirzadeh, a senior official in Iran’s National Security Council, told CNN that Iran had not received any such ceasefire proposal. “At this very moment, the enemy is committing aggression against Iran,” he said, adding, “Iran is on the verge of intensifying its retaliatory strikes, with no ear to listen to the lies of its enemies.” Shamkhani said Iran would fight until it achieved “lasting peace,” calling Trump’s remarks a U.S. and Israeli attempt to justify further attacks on Iranian targets. Despite the denial, another Iranian official, Abbas Araghchi , speaking to Reuters, confirmed that Iran had agreed to a Qatar-mediated, U.S.-proposed truce with Israel. He did not mention Trump or the exact terms, but said Iran was “prepared to observe a temporary ceasefire under the current framework.” No full details were released. Still, this was the first public sign from Tehran that a diplomatic path might be on the table behind closed doors. Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has also confirmed the ceasefire, saying US and Qatar were key in making it happen. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted this on his X: “Those who know the Iranian people and their history know that the Iranian nation isn’t a nation that surrenders.” Markets surge, oil tanks, Bitcoin bounces back as traders price in peace U.S. markets reacted immediately to Trump’s post. Dow Jones futures went up by 134 points (0.3%), S&P 500 futures rose by 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures jumped 0.6%. The Dow added almost 375 points, S&P 500 closed 0.96% higher, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up by 0.94%. Investors, for now, are betting that some kind of ceasefire, whatever the official messaging, will take hold. Oil prices collapsed as traders pulled out of risk positions. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped more than 7% by Monday evening, falling to $64, which is now 3% below pre-war levels. That sharp fall suggests traders are fully pricing in the end of the war, even if there’s no formal joint statement. Crypto didn’t sit still either. Bitcoin, which had dipped to $98,000 during the U.S. strikes, bounced hard to $106,700 before settling at $105,600 by the time U.S. markets closed. Over $50 million in short positions were liquidated in just one hour, catching bears off guard and flipping sentiment.

Won-based stablecoins could potentially revolutionize the South Korean finance sector. They would allow people to make payments using privately issued tokens without involving fiat. The Bank of Korea has expressed skepticism. It has urged caution and is warning of a deleterious effect on the commercial banking sector . New Daily Kyungjae reported that credit card providers could also be adversely impacted by stablecoin rollouts. The media outlet noted that experts are concerned that the card industry “may face a structural crisis in the long term as its payment base gradually weakens.” Stablecoin rollouts could, the outlet warned, “may make it difficult for the industry to guarantee even short-term profitability.” However, an employee at an unnamed card provider offered a ray of hope, explaining: “It is difficult to predict the impact stablecoins will have on profitability. However, it will be difficult for them to replace our ability to offer spending on credit. That is the unique domain of card issuing companies.” But credit appears to be something of a double-edged sword for card companies. The outlet reported that domestic card issuers have been trying to “defend their profitability by expanding their high-interest loan offerings.” This, the outlet wrote, is causing a rise in loan defaults as “borrowers’ ability to repay is decreasing.” The Bank of Korea, South Korea’s central bank, is still lukewarm on proposals to launch a won stablecoin despite a recent meeting with the USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle. #SouthKorea #Stablecoins #USDC https://t.co/qPwbqgvtFg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The average monthly default levels of South Korean card companies in the first quarter of the financial year hit 1.93%. This is remarkably close to the 2% rate that the industry considers “dangerously high.” Worse still, three of the country’s biggest card firms (KB Kookmin, Hana, and BC Card) have already exceeded the 2% mark this year. Stablecoin Pivot: Which Companies Will Prosper? While banks and car providers are clearly fearful of what stablecoin-powered business could do to their industry, tech firms appear keen to embrace the change. Pinpoint News reported that while years of regulatory uncertainty have limited business expansion, IT heavy-hitters are “moving quickly as governments around the world begin to show signs of establishing clear guidelines.” The outlet made note of the likes of the search engine operator Naver and the chat app developer Kakao, both of which have been working on blockchain-related innovations for years. Naver share prices over the past month. (Source: Google Finance) Other firms said to be looking with interest at developments in the stablecoin space are the Hyundai subsidiaries Hyundai HT (smart homes) and Hyundai Mobis (auto parts). Another smart home firm, Kocom, was also named, along with the software developer MediaZen, the connectivity provider Kaon Media, and the IT services firm Bridgetec. The media outlet said that expectations are “growing” for a Naver stablecoin release and a link to web3 services that make use of this coin. #Hanwha Ocean ramps up push into U.S. Navy ship repair, eyes tech transfer via #Philly Shipyard.

It has built up a vast ecosystem of web, IT, and payment services. An unnamed industry expert said: “Positive changes in stablecoin policy will help accelerate Naver’s blockchain-related business.” In Naver’s case, stablecoin-related business expansion has the potential to cross borders. The firm has a close historical link with Line, a chat app popular in Japan and other Asian markets. A potential Naver-Line stablecoin cooperation or interoperability solution could provide a further boost, the outlet concluded. South Korea’s stablecoin frenzy has led to a flurry of speculative activity on the nation’s stock and crypto markets . Traders have been attempting to pre-empt lawmakers’ decision by snapping up stocks in firms that have previously expressed a willingness to do stablecoin-related business.

46646715,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169031,1750721402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/46646715.jpeg,"Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Be the Next Community Favorite for Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink Traders?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-the-next-community-favorite-for-bitcoin-xrp-and-chainlink-traders/,"MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto projects , drawing attention from traders of established giants like Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink. As the market pivots toward early-stage, community-driven tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s blend of meme appeal, fixed-supply tokenomics, and robust community engagement is fueling speculation that it could become the next breakout favorite among both retail and institutional investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Momentum and Strong Fundamentals Unlike many meme tokens that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on a foundation of transparent governance and a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, eliminating inflation risk and creating scarcity-driven value. The project is 100% community-owned, with its smart contracts fully audited by HashEx, boosting investor confidence and distinguishing it from typical meme coins. Early presale momentum has been explosive, with analysts predicting potential returns of 25x–35x once major exchange listings go live. The project’s strategic branding and disciplined rollout have attracted both seasoned traders and newcomers, echoing the viral trajectories once seen with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Bitcoin: The Benchmark for Crypto Traders Bitcoin remains the market’s bellwether, with 2025 price forecasts ranging from $100,000 to $175,000, driven by institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and political tailwinds. While Bitcoin offers stability and long-term growth, its massive market cap limits the kind of explosive upside that smaller, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE can deliver. Many Bitcoin holders are now seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging projects, fueling capital rotation into promising altcoins. XRP: Utility and the Prospect of a Major Breakout XRP is gaining renewed attention as analysts predict a bullish breakout, with price targets ranging from $5.50 to as high as $27 by the end of 2025, contingent on regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. The token’s real-world utility in cross-border payments and its growing ecosystem make it a favorite for traders seeking assets with both narrative and use case. However, like Bitcoin, XRP’s upside may be more gradual compared to the meteoric potential of new community-driven tokens. Chainlink: Infrastructure Powerhouse with Steady Growth Chainlink (LINK) continues to dominate the decentralized oracle sector, trading around $13–$16 in mid-2025, with analysts targeting $20–$30 as the next major resistance zone. Chainlink’s integration across DeFi and real-world applications ensures its relevance, but its growth is likely to be steadier and less volatile than the explosive rallies seen in smaller-cap tokens. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Appeals to BTC, XRP, and LINK Traders Asymmetric Upside: With a low price and a capped supply, early MAGACOIN FINANCE backers are positioning for outsized returns not typically available in large-cap coins. Community-Driven Model: Like Dogecoin and early Chainlink, MAGACOIN FINANCE is powered by grassroots enthusiasm, which can drive viral adoption and price surges. Security and Transparency: The HashEx audit and transparent governance address common concerns among serious traders, making it more than just a meme play. Strategic Timing: As capital rotates from blue chips to high-upside altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to capture significant inflows from traders seeking the next big thing Conclusion For Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink traders seeking the next community-driven favorite with explosive upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top contender for 2025. Its blend of meme culture, fixed-supply economics, and genuine community engagement is attracting serious attention—and if current momentum holds, it could soon join the ranks of the market’s most beloved tokens.

46647054,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72365,1750721939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Why XRP Price Starts Rising Suddenly,https://timestabloid.com/heres-why-xrp-price-starts-rising-suddenly/,"A surprising policy shift by the Federal Reserve Board has triggered fresh optimism across the crypto markets, with XRP leading the charge. On June 23, the Fed announced it will no longer consider “reputational risk” as a component of its examination programs when supervising banks. The move, seen by many as a step toward regulatory clarity, immediately fueled speculation that barriers facing crypto-friendly banks may be easing. XRP, in particular, responded with a sharp 6% increase, currently trading at $2.14, and catching the attention of market participants. Excitement for the Pro-crypto Shift The update was shared widely on X, with crypto commentator Amonyx (@amonbuy) calling it a moment that eases crypto banking restrictions. He shared a screenshot of the Fed’s release, which outlined the Board’s intention to eliminate reputational risk assessments from supervisory materials and replace them with more targeted evaluations of financial risk. JUST IN: THE FED JUST REMOVED ""REPUTATIONAL RISK"", EASING CRYPTO BANKING RESTRICTIONS. BULLISH #XRP pic.twitter.com/nGtqoWm3Ke — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 23, 2025 That detail is critical, as it removes a long-standing regulatory ambiguity that had often been used to restrict banking relationships with digital asset companies. This move follows the Comptroller of the Currency’s decision to remove crypto restrictions on regulated banks , allowing them to buy and trade digital assets. Why This Matters for XRP The connection to XRP is not arbitrary. XRP’s use case in banking and cross-border settlements has often required partnerships with financial institutions . Over the years, many U.S. banks avoided direct crypto exposure, citing reputational risk. The Fed has now shifted its stance. It recently recognized the advantages of XRP’s consensus mechanism . With this restriction now officially removed from its supervisory framework, there is a clearer path forward for regulated banks to engage with blockchain infrastructure providers, including those that use or support XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Opens New Doors More significantly, the Fed emphasized that while reputational risk will be excluded from its examination criteria, this change does not alter the requirement for banks to maintain strong risk management or comply with existing laws. In practical terms, this means that as long as banks uphold financial and operational standards, their choice to serve crypto firms can no longer be challenged on vague reputational grounds. For XRP, which relies heavily on adoption through real-world utility and integration, this policy change signals a more open environment. It reaffirms the growing perception that U.S. regulators are rethinking their approach to crypto-related banking access, removing barriers hidden in regulatory language and adopting a significantly different approach from the former administration’s war on cryptocurrencies.

This follows recent breaches at CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinTelegraph (CT) that exposed users to wallet-draining phishing schemes. The CMC and CT Attacks “Hackers are targeting information websites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect,” CZ said in a post on X. He pointed out that CMC was attacked just two days before CT was hit with a similar breach. The trouble began on June 21 when CMC users started seeing a pop-up that said “Verify Wallet” and asked them to connect their crypto wallets. Members of the crypto community on X quickly flagged the notification as a phishing attempt designed to deceive victims into revealing private keys or sensitive information. Shortly after the reports spread on social media, the platform acknowledged the malicious notification on its account. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” CoinMarketCap said in a Friday update . The team added that security investigations were underway and warned people not to connect their wallets. CZ later shared that early checks showed 39 individuals were affected by the incident, with total losses of around $18,570. CMC also revealed plans to reimburse those affected by the hack. On June 23, Cointelegraph’s website was also compromised in a front-end exploit. This time, users saw a pop-up promoting a fake token airdrop. The notification claimed people were eligible to get 50,000 “CTG” tokens, worth around $5,500 if they connected their wallets. The pop-up also falsely claimed that CertiK, a well-known security firm, had reviewed the smart contract. The media outlet confirmed the issue on Sunday night and said it was working to fix it. “Do not click on these pop-ups, connect your wallets, or enter any personal information,” it warned on X. Blockchain Security firm Scam Sniffer also found that the fake JavaScript code came from the company’s advertising system. Hackers Are Shifting Tactics In both cases, the bad actors were able to approve transactions and steal crypto once users connected their wallets. These incidents show a new trend where attackers are now using trusted news and data platforms to reach people instead of going after crypto exchanges directly. Meanwhile, a recent study by TRM Labs showed that phishing schemes and malware-based infrastructure attacks made up 70% of the $2.2 billion stolen in crypto-related hacks in 2024. Another report by Cybernews revealed a massive data breach that exposed over 16 billion login credentials, making it one of the largest stolen data collections ever found. Researchers believe this came from infostealer malware, credential stuffing, and past leaks that were repackaged.

The move appears to have reversed recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment across crypto markets. At 10:02 p.m. UTC on June 23, Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. According to his statement, each country would pause hostilities in coordinated stages: Iran would initiate a 12-hour ceasefire, followed by Israel, leading to a 24-hour complete cessation of the conflict. Trump described this as a successful conclusion to what he labeled a 12-day war — one he claimed could have escalated into a much longer and more devastating regional conflict. He praised both sides for choosing restraint and credited the agreement with averting further turmoil in the Middle East. The announcement injected a wave of optimism into the crypto market, especially for high-beta assets like ether. Prior to the rally, ETH had already been showing signs of strength, supported by steady whale accumulation. On-chain data shows over $265 million in ETH was acquired by large holders during the recent downturn, including a single wallet that purchased 47,070 ETH —r oughly $113 million — over a three-day period. Ethereum’s network fundamentals remain robust, with an average of 1 million new ETH wallet addresses created weekly since mid-May, representing a 50% year-over-year increase. With volatility receding and risk appetite returning, traders are now watching whether ETH can break through the next psychological threshold of $2,500. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH rallied 7.7% from $2,230 to $2,401 over the 24-hour analysis window. High-volume support formed between $2,220 and $2,230, with initial buying at $2,191.36. Price broke out above $2,400 during the 22:02–22:11 window as volume spiked to 28,149 ETH. Resistance at $2,275 flipped into support as buying momentum accelerated. ETH touched an intrahour high of $2,434.95 before entering a consolidation phase. Price action formed a potential bull flag as ETH traded between $2,390 and $2,402. Volume surged to 2.5x the 24-hour average in the final three hours of the session. Higher lows confirmed bullish structure throughout the uptrend.

Despite recent market turbulence, Ethereum whales and long-term traders are doubling down — but not just on ETH. Many are allocating into next-wave opportunities with stronger risk-to-reward ratios. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered that conversation with increasing frequency, especially as its early fundamentals now resemble the kind of token setups ETH traders historically favored in pre-breakout phases. Aptos Traders Are Eyeing Strategic Diversification Aptos has drawn strong developer interest and ecosystem engagement in 2025, maintaining a lead in blockchain activity. However, Aptos traders — particularly those focused on community-driven assets — are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. The project offers both meme energy and structured tokenomics, striking a balance that APT holders find appealing as they search for tokens with early-stage momentum and long-term potential. With its token supply locked and staking now live, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a framework that encourages accumulation, not speculation. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating Analyst Forecasts Analysts tracking altcoin rotations in mid-2025 have started highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare convergence of investor energy, ecosystem clarity, and strategic fundamentals. What began as a meme-centric project has evolved rapidly into a credible altcoin with legitimate infrastructure and community traction. The coin’s performance — both in terms of participation and market sentiment — suggests it may be entering a breakout cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining favor because of several key structural traits: Supply Certainty: With a locked supply of 170 billion tokens, there’s no inflation risk and no behind-the-scenes minting. Traders can assess value without fearing dilution. Audit by HashEx: Institutional-grade transparency has helped attract more serious capital and enhanced credibility. No Insider Control: The project is entirely community-owned with no VC interference, a trait especially important to Ethereum and Aptos veterans who’ve witnessed misaligned token launches in the past. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is the way it has combined meme-driven appeal with structural strength — a hybrid model that’s increasingly rare in the altcoin landscape. Final Thoughts: Is This the Ethereum of the Meme Era? While Ethereum and Aptos will likely continue dominating their sectors, the smartest investors are looking for what’s next. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a compelling answer — a project that mirrors early Ethereum in its community formation and upside potential but fits the current market’s appetite for engagement, utility, and reward mechanics. As more institutional and retail investors take notice, this token is quickly becoming more than a curiosity — it’s shaping up to be the 2025 cycle’s most watched altcoin.

New projects are bringing better tech, more adoption, and fresh attention from investors. Coins like Web3 ai (WAI), Sui (SUI), Cronos (CRO), and Litecoin (LTC) are gaining popularity through useful features, active communities, and strong development. Each coin shines in its own way, from blockchain-based AI to upgrades in DeFi. These coins are being seen as some of the best cryptos for 2025 for this cycle. In this article, we’ll cover why Web3 ai, SUI, CRO, and LTC are worth watching. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, understanding these coins will help you spot great buying opportunities. Let’s dive in! 1. Web3 ai (WAI): Driving AI and Blockchain Forward Web3 ai is fast becoming one of the best cryptos for 2025 today. Its unique blend of AI and blockchain makes it stand out. Many crypto projects focus on hype, but Web3 ai is building real tools for everyday users. These tools will help people make smart choices in the DeFi space and beyond, once it launches. Its AI-powered features offer real-time insights and smarter ways to use blockchain. Unlike other projects made for developers, Web3 ai ($WAI) is made for all users. One key reason why Web3 ai is leading among the best cryptos for 2025 is its deep blockchain integration. By linking AI with blockchain tech, it enables automated actions, smart predictions, and better decision-making for everyone. Its strong presale results show its value. Currently in stage 9, each $WAI token is priced at $0.000443. Over $8.4 million has already been raised, with 23.3 billion tokens sold. There are 50 stages in total. The last stage price will be $0.003276, with a listing price of $0.005242, giving a potential ROI of 1747% to early holders. Web3 ai’s clear roadmap and growing community prove it’s more than just another token. It’s shaping the future of AI and blockchain together, one of the best cryptos for 2025 to keep an eye on. 2. Sui (SUI): Attracting More Institutional Buyers Sui (SUI) is showing resilience, even after a 16% dip caused by the Cetus Protocol issue. The coin’s core strengths remain strong. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has climbed back to $2.47 billion. Institutional interest is also rising. A new spot ETF filing by 21Shares highlights growing confidence in SUI. Technically, SUI is trading above its 50- and 100-day EMAs. If it breaks past $4.26, it could soon retest its earlier high of $5.37. If market sentiment turns positive, Sui could outperform many bigger tokens. It holds its spot as one of the best cryptos for 2025 with strong potential. 3. Cronos (CRO): On the Path to Recovery Cronos (CRO) has bounced back from a steep 68% drop earlier this year. It found solid support around $0.07 to $0.08 and has now moved above $0.105. With an RSI of 53, CRO has room to climb higher without being overbought. If it crosses $0.1238, it could target $0.14. Growing interest on-chain and renewed community support make CRO worth watching. Among the best cryptos for 2025, it’s showing good momentum again and could challenge larger tokens if positive trends continue. 4. Litecoin (LTC): Smart Contracts Through BitcoinOS Upgrade Litecoin, known as “digital silver,” is seeing renewed interest. Its chart is forming a bull flag, hinting at a move toward $130. Whales are actively moving billions of LTC between wallets. Plus, over 75% of LTC holders have held onto their coins for at least 18 months, showing a strong belief in its long-term value. The recent BitcoinOS upgrade brings smart contracts and zero-knowledge rollups to Litecoin. This greatly boosts its DeFi abilities. With a fixed supply and fast transactions, LTC stands firm among the best cryptos for 2025 today. It can compete with legacy coins like Cardano and Tron. Final Thoughts As the market gears up for its next phase, coins like SUI, CRO, and LTC are gaining technical strength and community interest. Each brings something unique, from new DeFi features to growing institutional support. But Web3 ai stands apart for its practical AI tools, easy-to-use design, and strong presale momentum. It’s one of the best cryptos for 2025 to watch closely now. While all four coins offer exciting opportunities, Web3 ai’s clear use case and fast growth could make it the standout choice as the market heats up.

This paradox leaves traders and investors weighing which force will ultimately dominate the market’s next move. As pressure mounts from both sides, understanding the technical nuances behind this tug-of-war becomes crucial to anticipating BNB’s trajectory in the near term. BNB Faces Pressure From Key Technical Levels Analyzing the BNBUSD setup on the M30 timeframe, Thomas Anderson in an X post highlighted that the price is currently testing the yellow support line at $626.95, following a decisive drop below the cyan price line at $633.99. This breakdown has shifted short-term sentiment, suggesting that sellers are beginning to exert stronger control over the price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Breakout Could Trigger ATH Rally Repeat – Is $730 The Next Stop? According to Anderson, the 200 MA (red line), positioned between $642 and $645, is now acting as a dynamic resistance zone overhead. With price trading below this moving average, any attempts at recovery may face immediate rejection. He also pointed out that the H1 chart confirms the ongoing bearish momentum, with the price continuing to trade below both the cyan level and the 200 MA. This alignment between the M30 and H1 timeframes strengthens the case for further downside movement, especially if the current support at $626.95 fails to hold. Until buyers manage to reclaim key resistance levels, the overall outlook remains weak, and traders should keep an eye on how the price behaves around the current support to gauge the next likely move. BNB’s Price Outlook Strengthened By Bullish Continuation Signal Despite the bearish outlook presented by Thomas Anderson, eL Zippo expressed a more optimistic stance in his latest X tweet regarding BNB. He believes that BNB still has the potential to rise in value, challenging the prevailing negative sentiment around its recent price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Eyes Comeback: Can It Regain Momentum and Rally Higher? EL Zippo’s view is supported by the formation of a bullish flag pattern on the chart. This pattern is widely recognized as a continuation signal, indicating that the asset may resume its prior upward trend after a period of consolidation. For eL Zippo, the presence of this structure suggests that BNB could be setting up for another leg higher if market conditions align. At the time of writing, BNB was trading around the $623 mark, reflecting steady price action. The asset’s market capitalization stood at approximately $87.7 billion, signaling strong investor interest. Additionally, BNB recorded a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $1.8 billion, with price and volume showing percentage gains of 2.11% and 13.22%, respectively—an indication of renewed activity and positive sentiment in the market.

In a post on the social media platform X, Swissblock highlights a sudden plunge in on-chain liquidity, something the firm says needs to reverse if BTC should rally. “At the same time as the rest of the market has consolidated back into BTC, we have seen a drop off in our on-chain liquidity. For bullish continuation, we need to see an uptick again in on-chain liquidity.” Source: Swissblock/X On-chain liquidity refers to how easily and efficiently Bitcoin can be bought or sold without significantly impacting BTC’s price. Low liquidity environments suggest that there are not enough buyers to absorb sell orders, triggering price declines. Swissblock says that the fast drop in liquidity by itself is “a concern” and that BTC is showing a reduction in overall activity in the Bitcoin network. However, the analytics firm says that BTC’s long-term bullish market structure still looks solid. “Lower liquidity as price is more correlated with on-chain dynamics vs external factors. Lower activity making price more susceptible to downside volatility.. All is not lost. Even though we have had a liquidity flush, the bullish long-term structure is still intact as long as our Risk off signal is at 0… While liquidity conditions have deteriorated, the broader bullish structure remains intact – provided risk signals continue to hold.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $101,833.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity is causing some traders to hesitate and SUI bullish structure shows signs of a potential breakout, Unstaked is making its move, and it’s happening quickly. With a presale that’s already raised over $10.4 million and climbing, Unstaked is generating serious buzz and jumping into the conversation as the top crypto to buy right now. Unlike SHIB and SUI, Unstaked isn’t just riding waves, it’s building momentum with a clear structure, growing demand, and game-changing utility. This isn’t just another presale. It’s a front-row chance at the next big launch, and people are lining up. SHIB Whale Sell-Offs Raise Red Flags, But Could Offer a Reset There’s been a big shift in Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity, and it’s got the market watching closely. Major holders have started moving large amounts of SHIB to exchanges, often a signal that sell-offs are underway. For short-term traders, that’s a concern, especially as SHIB slips below critical moving averages. The $0.000025 zone is now acting as a key support, but if SHIB can’t hold, we could see more downside. Still, some see opportunity here. When whales exit, they often reset the chart, and for buyers with patience, that might be a golden entry point. Whether this is just a shakeout or a deeper dip is still unclear, but the impact of large wallets can’t be ignored. One thing’s certain: Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity is driving the short-term mood, and the next few days could set the tone for what’s ahead. SUI Bullish Structure Could Be Days Away from Breaking Out Now here’s where it gets interesting, SUI bullish structure is tightening, and that’s usually a pre-breakout signal. With a steady climb of higher lows and volume starting to build, SUI is gearing up for something bigger. Traders are eyeing key resistance levels, and if those flip, SUI could take off fast. Momentum is coiling like a spring. Technical indicators show positive signs, and the trendline is holding strong. Add in growing interest from technical traders, and SUI is now firmly on breakout watch. If it moves past resistance with volume, this could quickly become one of the most explosive charts on the table. All eyes are now on SUI, and if you’re not watching it, you might miss the move. Unstaked’s $100M Goal Might Look Bold, But the Presale’s Already Taking Off While others are still fighting resistance, Unstaked is flying past milestones. With a presale goal of $100 million and over $10.4 million already secured, this project is moving fast. Right now, it’s in stage 21, priced at just $0.011739, and that won’t last long. What sets it apart? It’s not just the numbers. Sixty percent of the total 6 billion $UNSD tokens are open to the public, with no secret deals or private sales. That means regular buyers get real access and real upside. On top of that, $20 million in launch liquidity is already locked in, which could smooth out the price action once trading begins. And then there’s the utility. At launch, Unstaked will introduce AI agents designed to grow and manage online communities. These tools will automate engagement, drive traffic, and reward performance through a unique Proof of Intelligence system, all powered by $UNSD. With a listing price of $0.1819, the current rate offers a steep discount. That’s why so many are calling this the top crypto to buy right now, because it’s still early, but not for long. Wrapping Up When price action cools down, serious buyers look at the roadmap. SHIB is uncertain, and SUI’s breakout hasn’t confirmed. Meanwhile, Unstaked is marching forward. With transparent tokenomics, a fully public presale, and AI utility going live at launch, it’s got structure, and that’s something most tokens can’t say before listing. $10.4 million raised already. A public presale with no hidden whales. A $0.011739 entry before a $0.1819 listing. If you’re still on the sidelines, you’re risking missing out. Unstaked isn’t just about hype, it’s delivering all the elements that matter, and it’s doing it now. If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy right now , this might be your moment to act before the market catches on.

The announcement comes as NATO leaders gather in The Hague to adopt the 5% goal —an increase from the alliance’s current 2% target—amid rising global security concerns. “This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to NATO and drive greater investment in the nation’s wider security and resilience,” Starmer said in a statement ahead of the summit. The pledge, seen as a nod to US President Donald Trump’s longstanding calls for European nations to shoulder more defense responsibilities, marks a significant step up from the UK’s current plans to reach 2.6% by 2027, including intelligence spending. However, the government has not detailed how it plans to meet the 5% goal, especially given that the lion’s share of the increase will occur after the next two general elections. Broader definition of security to include cyber defense, infrastructure, and borders As part of the new framework, the UK will broaden its definition of security spending beyond traditional defense to include border protection, critical infrastructure, and supply chain resilience. Starmer’s office said that factoring in these additional categories, the UK will hit 4.1% of GDP on security by 2027. Despite the expanded scope, the government has no current plans to increase core military spending beyond 2027. Still, the commitment envisions dedicating 3.5% to defense by 2035, leaving the remaining 1.5% for broader security efforts. Starmer had previously presented his increase in defense spending to 2.5% of GDP as “the biggest sustained rise since the end of the Cold War.” He first hinted at further increases in an interview earlier this month. NATO allies respond as the UK extends deadline and emphasizes strategic independence Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has intensified calls across Europe to bolster defense budgets, especially with growing uncertainty around the US security posture under a potential second Trump administration. To that end, Starmer ultimately won a commitment from the NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, to extend the deadline from 2032 to 2035. Most NATO allies will accept the new target. Still, Spain won an exemption through lobbying, demanding the rate be set at 2.1%, arguing that capability, not money, matters. Germany, meanwhile, said it intended to increase its defense expenditure to 3.5% in the next five years . The UK is also expected to unveil its National Security Strategy this week, alongside a long-awaited review of its ties with China and a new industrial plan. According to Starmer’s office, the strategy will emphasize competitiveness in areas such as science, education, trade, and advanced technology. It includes £86 billion ($116 billion) earmarked for R&D investment to support technology growth and strengthen protection against cyber threats and sabotage. Starmer’s office said they would become more unapologetic and systematic in pursuing their national interests, signaling a shift toward greater strategic independence and resilience.

With blue-chip assets stabilizing, the spotlight is shifting to early-stage projects that offer scarcity-driven growth and asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity, Structure, and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly gained traction as one of 2025’s most promising altcoins , joining the ranks of top bullish picks for the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its hard-cap mechanics, community-led rollout, and audited smart contract, ensuring no VC dilution or inflation risk. Its rapid series of sold-out pre-sale stages reflects real strategic demand. Its scarcity model and limited access favor early believers, creating the same kind of supply shock potential that fueled Ethereum’s early rise. On-chain activity shows that accumulation isn’t random: large, informed capital is locking in positions now, echoing historical patterns from past altcoin cycles. Bitcoin: Solid Foundation, Slower Expansion Bitcoin remains the foundation of the crypto market, currently trading at impressive levels with continued institutional interest. While BTC offers long-term security, many traders recognize that its upside is increasingly capped by market maturity. As a result, investors are branching out into smaller-cap projects with higher potential, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , in search of greater ROI while maintaining a core BTC position. Ethereum: Innovation Leader, but Competitive Ethereum continues to dominate as the leading smart contract platform, driven by its ongoing upgrades and expanding network utility. However, its price movements are now closely tied to regulatory headlines and broader macro trends. Traders seeking outsized returns are increasingly diversifying into earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offers exposure to rapid growth without Ethereum’s scale limitations. Kaspa: Steady Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Upside Kaspa is also gaining traction for its technical fundamentals and blockDAG technology, appealing to long-term builders and early adopters.

The deal, negotiated through Gulf intermediaries and direct talks with Israeli and Iranian officials, marks a dramatic de-escalation after nearly two weeks of military strikes. The crypto market responded immediately. With tensions cooling and traditional safe havens like gold plateauing, Bitcoin regained its risk-on momentum. Traders are betting that a period of regional stability could restore confidence in speculative assets. Trump credited early Iranian warning of a retaliatory missile strike for avoiding casualties at U.S. bases in Qatar, which helped pave the way for the truce. As regional hostilities paused, investors rotated out of defensive positions and re-entered crypto markets. Breaking News Trump has posted that he has brokered and ""complete and total ceasefire"" between Iran and Israel. #Iran #IranIsraelConflict #Trump #ceasefire pic.twitter.com/zQPraXx7Qa — The Blue Collar Intellectual (Julian) (@JulianAcciard1) June 23, 2025 Why Peace Lifts BTC and Crypto Geopolitical clarity tends to revive appetite for higher-risk assets. Ceasefire agreements, especially those with direct U.S. involvement, often act as catalysts for equity and crypto rebounds. Reduced global uncertainty restores market confidence. Traders unwind hedges like gold and bonds. Volatility decreases, encouraging capital inflows to crypto. Bitcoin, known for its sharp sensitivity to macro headlines, acts as a barometer for global sentiment. With risk appetite returning, its rebound above $105K could signal broader recovery across altcoins and digital assets. Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes Breakout The Bitcoin price prediction turned bullish following the cryptocurrency’s recent surge, pushing it through the 50-period EMA at $103,806 and forming a strong bullish engulfing pattern. Momentum indicators like MACD have turned decisively bullish, with a wide histogram and crossover signal suggesting more upside. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, BTC now faces critical trendline resistance near $106,000. This level marks the descending barrier from June highs and remains a key decision zone for bulls. Key Levels: Resistance: $106,000, $107,580, $109,041 Support: $103,965, $102,199, $100,487 Trade Idea: A confirmed breakout above $106K on strong volume may open a run toward $109K. A failed retest or bearish engulfing at $106K could send BTC back to $102K. With over $64.9B in daily trading volume and a $2.09 trillion market cap, Bitcoin remains technically balanced but fundamentally charged. The Israel-Iran ceasefire may be the pivot traders needed to chase higher highs, as long as peace holds. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.3M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1.5 million milestone in its public presale, raising $1,527,516.42 out of a $1,763,403 target. With just hours left before the next price tier, buyers can still secure HYPER at $0.012 per token. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC network. It combines Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with ultra-low gas fees and seamless BTC bridging. Audited by Consult, Bitcoin Hyper is built for trust, scale, and performance. Over 91 million $HYPER are already staked, with projected post-launch staking rewards of up to 577% APY. The token fuels gas fees, dApp access, and decentralized governance. The presale accepts both crypto and cards, and through Web3Payments, no wallet is required. Meme culture meets utility—Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as Layer 2’s potential breakout star of 2025.

The Galaxy Unpacked summer event in Brooklyn, New York, starting at 10 a.m. local time, aims to debut the company’s latest breakthroughs in foldable smartphones and artificial intelligence technology. The new Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 will focus attention. These devices will bring a better design, features, and overall user experience to help the company remain dominant in the foldable phone market. The external display on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is also said to be larger and more functional when the phone is closed. This could make it more friendly to those who prioritize a handset that doesn’t require them to pick up the phone without being as aggressive in the design stakes as Motorola’s Razr Ultra. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is believed to follow the firm’s lead and further refine its vision for a smartphone-tablet crossover. The Fold 7 is likely to address some of the problems with foldables, including thinness, the size of the bezels, and durability. Samsung is confident its relentless technology evolution and leadership will grow foldable devices into a more mainstream product. The company faces fierce competition, especially from Chinese brands like Huawei, Honor, and Oppo, which have aggressively expanded their foldable offerings. Samsung drives AI transformation in mobile devices Aside from the hardware, Samsung is also working hard on AI. Among the arsenal we expect the company to unveil is its Galaxy AI suite , an array of AI-powered tools designed to change how consumers interact with their devices. From clever photo editing and real-time translation to productivity gains and better search, Galaxy AI is set to play a significant role in next month’s event. According to Bloomberg, Samsung is reportedly nearing a deal to put Perplexity’s AI assistant on future Galaxy devices as a pre-installed replacement or supplement to Google Assistant on certain devices in certain markets. The move could represent a significant change in Samsung’s AI strategy, offering it an even larger degree of control over the user experience while reducing the reliance on Google’s ecosystem. AI integration is coming as Samsung and other tech giants are racing to stay ahead with the increasing demand for smart, context-aware tools. AI has emerged as a critical battlefield in mobile, and Samsung seems set to make a bigger push into that field. Rivals challenge Samsung’s foldable dominance Samsung may be the leading player in the global foldable market, but the war has just begun. Some Chinese handset makers have been even more aggressive; Honor unveiled an extra-thin foldable, the Magic V5, that falls to a skinflinty 8.8 millimeters when collapsed for those who need the power but want to look stylish. In the United States, Google is Samsung’s closest competitor in the world of foldables. Later this summer, the tech giant is also expected to unveil the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a new and sorely needed challenger to Samsung’s dominance. Google has never approached Samsung’s scale in this area, but its Android-AI story has some unique charm for certain users. Apple, Samsung’s largest smartphone competitor worldwide, has not released a foldable device. However, insiders indicate that Apple is secretly developing its own foldable iPhone for a possible release by 2026. Apple’s foray into foldables would turn the market on its head and maybe push foldable phones towards becoming a mass-market product.

BlockDAG is one of them. It has already raised over $318.5 million, sold 23.1 billion coins, and is now aiming for a $600 million finish. This isn’t just another Layer 1 idea; it’s a functional system already welcoming users, developers, and miners before any exchange listing. Many projects throw around the term most successful crypto, but BlockDAG is showing the receipts. With a technical backbone that fuses DAG’s scalability and Proof-of-Work’s security, the path to that $600M milestone looks more possible by the day. From Testnet to Mainnet: Inside BlockDAG’s Infrastructure Unlike the usual whitepaper projects waiting to build, BlockDAG already has a live testnet. Smart contracts are active. A no-code dApp builder is available to both devs and non-devs. Plus, over 2 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 app. The mainnet launch is on a six-week countdown, ready, scheduled, and about to begin. Here’s the rollout plan: Week 6: Presale ends, staking wraps up, wallet migration kicks off. Week 4: Mainnet and ASIC mining go live, though BDAG isn’t circulating yet. Week 3: Community nodes and mining pools come online. Week 2: Airdrop of 40% presale supply and DeFi tools like DEX, bridge, and oracles go live. This isn’t theory, it’s a timeline with clear execution, and that clarity is helping push the presale forward fast. No-Code Tools, Dev Incentives, and a Builder-First Ecosystem Hyped coins come and go. But protocols that thrive long term tend to do one thing right: bring in developers. BlockDAG knows this. It’s launching grants, hackathons, and tools before listings even begin. Its no-code builder is already in use, letting anyone launch smart contracts on testnet. Add EVM support, and it becomes even easier for Ethereum-based teams to try BlockDAG’s faster, more affordable platform. The team is also backing early projects with grants and promo support, aiming to hit 1,000+ dApps by 2026. This type of growth clearly implies that BlockDAG could hit listings with a live app ecosystem, something even Solana and Avalanche needed time to build. Why the $600M Target Means Real Infrastructure, Not Just Hype Large raises usually scream hype. But for BlockDAG, $600 million is about making the system real. The numbers speak for themselves: 2M+ users mining via X1 App Over 18,100 ASIC miners sold Live public testnet with smart contracts No-code dApp builder already active 20 exchanges lined up Over 200,000 holders of BDAG This raise isn’t just for attention. It’s to support a network built before listing. The goal isn’t to pump post-launch, it’s to empower the people building it now. Right now, BDAG is available at $0.0020, but that climbs to $0.0030 after June 24. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, that means early supporters could be looking at a 2,400% upside by the time it hits exchanges. Is BlockDAG the Most Successful Crypto of 2025? “Success” can mean different things. For some, it’s price gains. For others, it’s utility and growth. BlockDAG is setting up for both. It’s already outpacing major Layer 1s in early traction, raising $318.5 million without VC help, delivering real systems, and launching with a mapped-out public countdown. It has the tools. It has the roadmap. And more importantly, it’s got real momentum. Once the presale hits $600M and the rollout executes step-by-step, BlockDAG might not just be another project launch. It could very well be the most successful crypto of 2025.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Just Made Large Exchange Inflows At A Loss In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about how the Bitcoin short-term holders have reacted to the price volatility that has come alongside rising tensions in the Middle East following US strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The other side of the network, the holders with a holding time greater than 155 days, are termed as the long-term holders (LTHs). The former group contains the new entrants and low conviction holders, who generally panic easily whenever some change occurs in the market. On the other hand, the latter cohort includes the veterans of the market, who tend to sit tight through crashes and rallies alike. As such, given the recent sharp price action that has occurred in the sector, the STHs are likely to have made some moves. And indeed, on-chain data would confirm so. The above chart, shared by the analyst, shows the data for the profit and loss exchange deposit transactions that the STHs as a whole are making. Investors usually transfer to these centralized platforms when they want to sell, so inflows going to them can provide hints about whether selling is elevated or not. From the graph, it’s visible that the loss transactions going to the exchanges from this cohort have amounted to 14,700 BTC, which, although lower than the two major capitulation events from the past couple of months, is significant. Thus, it would appear that some of the STHs have reacted to the news by exiting the market, even if it means taking a loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? It’s also apparent from the chart that the profitable transfers have remained relatively low at 3,100 BTC. This is likely down to the fact that the STHs are left with little profit following the price decline, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. In the chart, the trend of the STH Realized Price is displayed. This indicator keeps track of the Bitcoin cost basis or acquisition level of the average STH. During the crash, the price almost retested the line, and even after the rebound, it remains close to it, meaning the profit margin for the cohort is still tight. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $101,300, down over 5% in the last week.

As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates and large-cap momentum slows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing early-stage watchlists. Could it become the most strategic play for these seasoned investor bases? MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Builds Ahead of Public Listing MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong traction among early-stage investors, with experts calling it one of the most promising new altcoin entries of 2025 . Its momentum is being fueled by a limited token supply, a rapidly filling pre-sale, and a growing wave of institutional and retail interest. The project is fully audited and structured to deliver long-term value, making it a standout in today’s altcoin landscape. Key highlights include: Over $10 million already raised , with ongoing demand across every pre-sale round Scarcity-based tokenomics and capped supply , designed to support price stability and upside Full smart contract audit and transparent governance , building investor confidence ahead of public listing XRP: Seeking Sharper Upside Beyond Legal Resolution XRP continues to trade in a tight range while the Ripple vs. SEC case nears conclusion. Prediction markets now estimate an 88% chance of spot ETF approval before year-end. Although XRP’s global payments use case and DeFi integrations are expanding, its price remains capped. Many XRP holders—aware that previous cycle returns are unlikely to repeat—are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a fresh-growth opportunity ahead of exchange listings. Solana: Institutional Inflows and Layer-1 Strength Solana is enjoying increased institutional adoption, with public firms investing for its speed, staking yield, and strength in NFTs and DeFi. Spot ETF approval odds for SOL are now at 92%, fueling its recent climb above $178 and momentum toward $200. But as Solana becomes more mature, many traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE , which analysts forecast could deliver up to 4,000% upside —a rare window in today’s market. Polygon: Scaling Ambitions, but Traders Seek Higher Multiples Polygon’s “Gigagas” roadmap targets up to 100,000 TPS and broader interoperability for global payment dominance. While MATIC may reach $0.27–$0.35 in June 2025, it remains range-bound. Facing growing competition, many Polygon investors are moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its capped supply, rapid pre-sale sellouts, and projected listing price of $0.007 . Conclusion With traders from XRP, Solana, and Polygon all seeking the next breakout altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the consensus early-stage favorite for 2025. Its scarcity-based tokenomics, surging demand, and strong analyst backing suggest that those who act early could be perfectly positioned for the next cycle of crypto growth.

Dogecoin Consolidates in Mid‑$0.17 Range Amid Cautious Market Sentiment As of the time of writing, the trading price of dogecoin (DOGE) is about $0.1682 with the intraday highs being at $0.1715 and the lows at around $0.1674. The meme-coin has been contained in the range over a series of days, with the price movement remaining below the significant moving averages. Unless DOGE surpasses the resistance point of 0.1760, analysts caution that the cryptocurrency can remain in its consolidation stage. Long‑term accumulation on-chain indicates that DOGE still remains on the radar. In the meantime, new tokens also start appearing in the spotlight of investors, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,300 early adopters and more than $11 million raised, it’s clear to see this isn’t a flash in the pan wave of sentiment, Mutuum Finance is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. Whereas tokens are founded on ephemeral mania for the most part, Mutuum is founded on usability and sustained scalability with sound fundamentals backing it. Phase 5 investors will be rewarded with up to 2x ROI, when the token launch price of $0.06 is hit. Stable, Audited, and Future-Proof: A USD-Pegged Token on Ethereum In its strategic efforts to deepen its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Unlike highly volatile algorithmic stablecoins, this token is crafted to hold its value even in extreme market fluctuations, earning it a solid store of value and medium of exchange. Security and integrity are central to the project. The Mutuum Finance platform was audited completely by CertiK, one of the most established blockchain security firms. This audit again testifies to the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and long-term sustainability. Early Investors Reward as Community Grows To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens as a “thank you” for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. Dogecoin’s stagnant price action around $0.17 continues to leave investors underwhelmed, while utility-first projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are stealing the spotlight. Currently priced at just $0.03, MUTM has already raised over $11 million from 12,300+ investors, offering up to 2x returns before launch and long-term upside driven by real DeFi use. With a USD-pegged stablecoin, CertiK audit, and a $100K giveaway fueling momentum, Mutuum Finance is proving to be a smarter, future-ready alternative to hype-driven coins like DOGE.

In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rare opportunity—analysts are increasingly calling it the most undervalued crypto asset of the year , mirroring the early dynamics of Bitcoin’s historic bull runs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Momentum and Analyst Confidence Unlike fleeting meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on a scarcity-focused framework and a community-first governance model. Its fixed supply and structured tokenomics have triggered rapid sellouts across every pre-sale phase, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Experts say the current valuation is significantly disconnected from its long-term upside—a pattern historically associated with substantial returns, echoing early Bitcoin cycles. A full smart contract audit and aggressive marketing strategy further strengthen the project’s credibility. As altcoin rotation accelerates, analysts project exponential gains as MAGACOIN FINANCE enters price discovery on major exchanges. Bitcoin’s Rally Sets the Stage for Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin recently broke above $111,000, fueled by institutional inflows, ETF approvals, and a surge in whale accumulation. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside from here is seen as more modest compared to early-stage altcoins. Analysts believe the next phase of the bull cycle will see capital rotating into high-upside tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, echoing the pattern that sent Ethereum and Solana soaring after Bitcoin’s previous peaks. Ethereum and Injective Protocol: Momentum and Upgrades Ethereum, despite a recent security scare, is expected to stabilize and regain momentum as network upgrades and innovation continue. Meanwhile, Injective Protocol’s launch of INJ 3.0 and deflationary tokenomics have secured overwhelming community support, positioning it as a leader in the next wave of innovation. Both ETH and INJ are seeing capital rotate into early-stage opportunities, with many traders now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next breakout candidate. Conclusion: The Rare Setup Everyone’s Watching With Bitcoin’s rally confirming the bull market and Ethereum and Injective Protocol driving innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the high-upside play analysts say could echo the legendary returns of past bull cycles. As pre-sale stages sell out and momentum builds, the window for early entry is closing fast—making MAGACOIN FINANCE a top contender for 2025’s breakout story.

46652909,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=754131,1750729011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46652909.jpeg,Is Mango’s Multi-VM approach enough to solve fragmented liquidity?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-mango-fix-liquidity-fragmentation/,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) still struggles with fragmented liquidity, where users face higher costs, developers must duplicate their efforts across chains, and capital becomes less efficient because every blockchain operates in isolation. A new Layer 1 blockchain, Mango Network , claims it runs several virtual machines, Ethereum’s EVM, Solana’s SVM, and Facebook’s MoveVM (Multi-VM architecture) on a shared system. This allows it to connect apps and users from different blockchain communities without risky third-party tools. Mango even launched a major airdrop to reward early users, and its testnet claims to handle more than 297,000 transactions per second due to high-speed performance. But can a single blockchain link multiple virtual machines, both enable assets to move freely, process extremely fast transactions, and remain secure? Some followers say Mango will open up access to liquidity and open the world of decentralized finance to everyone in a more connected and useful way, to a wider array of people. Still, critics worry the system is too complex, too new, and potentially so unstable that it becomes increasingly difficult to untangle as it grows. Why should anyone care about Mango Network? Mango Network is a newly launched full-chain Layer 1 blockchain that aims to change how developers build and users interact with decentralized applications across different ecosystems. While traditional blockchains rely on just one type of virtual machine (VM), such as Ethereum’s EVM or Solana’s SVM, Mango supports multiple virtual machines running side by side within a single network. The company may use Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for Solidity-based apps, MoveVM for applications written in the Move language (originally developed by Meta), and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for Rust-based, high-performance programs. With this unique structure, Mango creates one platform where developers from different blockchains can build apps using their preferred tools. At the same time, users interact with these products through one account and ecosystem without leaving the platform or going through risky, expensive, and slow bridging processes. The company gave away 5% of its MGO token supply to early adopters, testnet participants, and contributors through a community-first airdrop that allowed users to trade, stake, or move their tokens as they please before Mango’s Token Generation Event (TGE). Mango secured $13.5 million in Series B funding in February 2025 for security audits, ecosystem development, developer onboarding, and expanding toolkits to make it easier to build on the network. Mango’s vision of shared infrastructure, native cross-VM communication, and unified state management could set a new standard for what a blockchain can do. Why does DeFi struggle with fragmented liquidity? Each blockchain (Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, etc) has its tokens, apps, smart contracts, and user base locked within its network that traps money and assets in silos. This isolation slows down the entire DeFi economy because money can’t move freely or interact with other ecosystems, and creates multiple small liquidity pools instead of one large, flexible pool of capital. Users have to use third-party bridges or deal with wrapped tokens that copy the value of the original asset, but come with their risks, just to move assets between chains, like sending tokens from Ethereum to Solana. Bridges cause huge losses because they’re often slow, expensive, and complicated, and in many cases, they’ve been hacked or broken. In contrast, wrapped tokens can break the connection to the original asset or lose value if the wrapping system fails. This fragmentation costs developers time and money and splits their user base across different versions of the same application. They must either stick to one chain and limit their audience or rebuild and redeploy their app across multiple chains to reach more users. It also multiplies their workload and adds unnecessary complexity to DeFi building as they must maintain these versions, manage different smart contracts, and track separate liquidity pools. On the other hand, users must set up different wallets, learn new interfaces, and pay extra fees each time they move money around just to use apps on multiple chains. The struggle creates a broken experience where users feel like they’re jumping between disconnected worlds instead of using one global financial system. How Mango Network tries to fix liquidity fragmentation Mango Network connects smart contracts on different VMs through a communication protocol built on OPStack (OP-Mango) that syncs all the VMs and ensures data and events are correctly passed between them. Developers can mix and match components from different VMs, and users can access a unified experience because cross-chain interactions are faster, smoother, and far more secure. There’s also no need to sync data across different parts of the chain on Mango’s shared global state across all VMs because every virtual machine (EVM, MoveVM, and SVM) reads from and writes to the same underlying ledger. On top of that, users only need one account to access all dApps and services across all supported VMs. In addition, Mango allows tokens to move freely and natively within the network through a standardized format for digital assets across all VMs, making wrapping, copying, or bridging unnecessary. Developers can now create more reliable apps, and users can transfer or use their tokens more confidently, knowing they won’t encounter compatibility problems. Mango’s unified liquidity pools across all VMs allow assets deposited into one protocol to be used instantly by another, even if the apps are written in different languages and built for different VMs.You won’t have to copy funds, bridge tokens, or manually move assets between services because a lending protocol built on EVM can contribute liquidity to a DEX written in MoveVM, and vice versa. Can Mango’s Network handle the load? Mango Network says the blockchain can process up to 297,450 transactions per second (TPS) and offer sub-second finality. This means a transaction gets confirmed and finalized almost instantly once a user sends it. Mango could support thousands of decentralized apps and millions of users without suffering from congestion or delays if these numbers prove true on the mainnet. The network processed over 120 million on-chain interactions in more than 500,000 wallet addresses from token swaps, staking, cross-chain transfers, and decentralized trading through its ecosystem partner, BeingDEX, in just a few weeks during its testnet campaign. Mango’s parallel execution engine, MoveVM, uses the Move language’s resource-oriented design to process many operations simultaneously rather than waiting for each one to finish before starting the next. Moreover, Solana’s SVM runs on the Sealevel execution engine to provide blazing speeds and high throughput in the Solana ecosystem. However, testnets may not behave the same way as real economic activity on a live chain because they often involve simulated or incentivized traffic. Mainnet conditions introduce new challenges like malicious behavior, network-wide stress tests, flash loan attacks, and unexpected user spikes that can expose weaknesses in performance or security.. Mango’s true test will come after its Token Generation Event (TGE) and mainnet launch, when real users, real assets, and real market demand begin to flood the chain. The platform could set a new benchmark for performance in DeFi infrastructure if it can deliver sub-second speeds and high transaction throughput without compromising security, reliability, or developer experience. However, it may need to scale back its ambitions or make rapid improvements if it doesn’t. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

While concerns about a potential double top persist, on-chain data has yet to show any major warning signs. Bitcoin Undergoing Healthy Consolidation According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Avocado_onchain, despite broader market sentiment turning bearish, BTC has not yet displayed any significant red flags. In fact, the cryptocurrency still appears to be in a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Pull 4,500 BTC From Binance, Hinting At Incoming Rally Notably, the 30-day moving average (MA) of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicates that long-term holders are continuing to hold onto their BTC rather than selling. This suggests that investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential for further upside in the near term. For the uninitiated, the 30-day MA Binary CDD smooths out daily fluctuations to show how frequently long-term Bitcoin holders are moving their coins over a month. A lower value suggests strong holding behavior and accumulation, while a higher value may indicate distribution or selling pressure from experienced holders. The analyst noted in a previous analysis that when Bitcoin’s Binary CDD exceeded 0.8, it was typically followed by a steep correction. However, this time, the indicator has peaked around 0.6 and is now on the decline – suggesting the market is far from overheating. They added: Although the data may not align perfectly from cycle to cycle, this moderation below 0.8 still implies the market may be entering a consolidation period, and further price or time correction could follow. The analyst emphasized that this indicator does not signal the end of the bull run. Rather – similar to the previous two market phases – Bitcoin could be following a “staircase-like movement,” where periods of consolidation are followed by a strong upward leg. They concluded that BTC historically tends to rally when market attention fades and sentiment remains quiet. Therefore, the current period of low volatility could be a precursor to Bitcoin’s next major move to the upside. Are BTC Bears In Trouble? While the current bearish sentiment may have raised hopes for further price pullback for the largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap, both technical and on-chain indicators suggest otherwise.

That said, some caution is warranted, as short-term holders have been selling during recent dips, showing a lack of confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its upward trajectory. At press time, BTC trades at $101,954, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

XRP and Arbitrum attract attention with volume surges and price forecasts, but Unstaked offers a new model based on usability. Its platform lets users build, deploy, and profit from AI agents without writing a line of code. These bots can be rented or monetized across X, Telegram, and other platforms. Unstaked stands out among top crypto performers for empowering users to create and benefit from infrastructure-level participation. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Prediction Reflects Mixed Sentiment Arbitrum (ARB) is regaining interest after dipping to $0.73 in May 2025. Analysts see potential recovery paths: a range of $0.25 to $1.20 for late 2025, and $1.50 to $2.40 by 2026 if Ethereum’s layer-2 demand grows. Long-term predictions stretch from $0.43 to $5 by 2030, depending on regulatory clarity and infrastructure adoption. While volatility remains a factor, the Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction highlights how scaling needs and Ethereum developments could shape its future performance. XRP Futures Reach $30M: New Tools & Price Movement XRP futures launched on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and quickly reached nearly $30 million in trading volume. This momentum has sparked speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF, which could drive further liquidity. Technical analysis shows XRP breaking past key resistance levels, aiming for a mid-term target of $4.90. The new futures market gives traders additional ways to hedge and speculate, enhancing market depth and boosting overall visibility. XRP price analysis remains central as institutional interest expands. Unstaked Introduces a No-Code, AI-Driven Creator Model Unstaked brings a new approach to digital ownership. Users can become “Agent Creators” and build AI agents without coding skills. These bots handle content, community tasks, and interaction across social platforms. Backed by Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence system, each agent’s actions are recorded on-chain, allowing owners to lease or license them.

SHIB Price Stalls & WLD Picks Up",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-to-ship-miners-before-trading-even-begins-18100-units-sold-shib-price-stalls-wld-picks-up/,"SHIB’s sideways trend continues, while WLD’s recent spike is stealing market attention. Was it just a temporary rise or the beginning of sustained growth? Traders remain cautious, eyeing Shiba Inu’s potential breakout and WLD’s resistance levels. But while those two battle technical uncertainty, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking bold action. BlockDAG has taken a different path, shipping actual mining hardware before its coin even enters the market. Scheduled for shipping from July 7 onwards, these ASIC miners are being sent out ahead of trading. So far, over 18,100 mining rigs have been sold. This early rollout places BlockDAG in a category of its own. For those focused on finding the highest ROI crypto, moving ahead of exchange listings might be the smartest step. Unlike the stalled SHIB charts, BlockDAG is already delivering. BlockDAG To Ship Miners Before Trading Kicks Off BlockDAG is flipping the script on how crypto launches work. Instead of waiting to earn credibility through listings, it’s already delivering. The shipment of real ASIC miners begins on July 7, well before BDAG appears on any exchange. With a US-based sponsorship set to be announced on June 30, it’s not simply preparing for success; it’s demonstrating readiness now. What makes this even more significant is that BlockDAG becomes the first blockchain project to release hardware before exchange trading. It shows real-world commitment and preparation, not empty claims. While many coins are still selling ideas, BlockDAG is handing users actual machines. This approach is why people are calling it the highest ROI crypto of 2025. The presale currently sits in Batch 29 of 45. So far, over 23.1 billion BDAG coins have been sold, raising more than $318.5 million. Right now, buyers can still get BDAG at a special limited-time price of $0.0020 until June 24, after which it will increase to $0.0030. As each new batch pushes prices upward, the $600 million goal draws closer. There’s no need to wait for proof; BlockDAG is already showing results. It’s not just another presale; it’s one already in motion. Early backers have seen their funds grow by 2,660% since batch 1. The machines are nearly out the door; those who act before the next price rise may get the highest ROI crypto entry of this cycle. WLD’s Price Gains, Backed by Solid Ecosystem Support Worldcoin (WLD) recently climbed from $1.11 to $1.18, largely due to new developments tied to OpenAI and stablecoin adoption. OpenAI’s shift to Google Cloud gave WLD a boost, as did the World Chain’s June 11 integration of USDC. This added tangible use cases, expanding its reach to Uniswap, Morpho Labs, and BitGo. These updates increased trade volume by 38% and brought WLD close to its $1.20 resistance. Financial rising graph and chart with lines and numbers that illustrate stock market behaviour. Concept of successful trading. Dark blue background. 3d rendering Despite this positive trend, WLD hasn’t broken through $1.20 with conviction. Technical indicators are mixed, RSI is neutral at 52, and while MACD leans bullish, there’s hesitation. If the coin doesn’t break above resistance soon, a short-term pullback is likely. WLD’s near-term future hinges on how strongly it can push past its current ceiling. SHIB Price Formation Suggests a Breakout May Be Forming SHIB continues to hover around $0.0000122, trading in a narrow range since June 12. A double-bottom pattern is forming near its key support, hinting at possible upward momentum. Should it break past $0.00001285, its 50-hour simple moving average, it might target the $0.0000133 range. Though trading volume has dipped, the chart setup hints at steady accumulation. However, confirmation will only come once SHIB holds above $0.0000126. If it slips, a fall toward $0.0000115 could follow. The 50-day SMA continues to act as a ceiling, limiting upward moves. While the current pattern doesn’t yet signal major strength, it also doesn’t suggest weakness. A volume-backed move beyond resistance could be the catalyst SHIB needs. Final Thoughts! WLD’s climb reflects optimism around its OpenAI and USDC connections, but resistance at $1.20 remains a challenge. Meanwhile, SHIB’s tight price formation suggests a breakout may be coming, though it still lacks confirmation. Both are showing activity, but neither has broken through to dominance. BlockDAG, in contrast, has already stepped ahead. With miners shipping on July 7 and a US-based sponsorship going live on June 30, it stands out as the only project delivering real value ahead of listings. The $0.0020 price freeze ends June 24, marking this moment as a possible entry into what many are calling the highest ROI crypto for 2025 . The path is clear, and progress is already visible.

With SEI ecosystem traders and top analysts now spotlighting this pre-sale, the stage is set for a disruptive new entry that could reshape the altcoin narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Advantage MAGACOIN FINANCE is forecasted by analysts to deliver returns that could outpace even sector giants, with projections of a 75x–100x surge upon listing. Strategic investors are flocking to its pre-sale, drawn by a capped supply, full audit, and zero stealth minting risk. Unlike Bitcoin and Solana—now tied to macro trends and ETF flows—MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare early-stage entry point with outsized ROI potential. Each presale phase is filling fast, fueled by transparent tokenomics, community-first incentives, and SEI traders rotating profits into what many call the next crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin & Solana: Strength, But Limited Explosive Upside Bitcoin is trading above $105,000, buoyed by ETF inflows and supportive policy, while Solana’s ecosystem is booming with upgrades and institutional traction. Both assets are expected to post steady gains, with Solana forecasted to reach the $270 range and Bitcoin potentially targeting $135,000–$175,000 by year-end. However, their massive market caps now suggest more stability and less room for the kind of exponential moves seen in earlier cycles. SEI: Bullish Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight SEI is drawing attention for its uptrend and robust ecosystem, with forecasts suggesting a rise toward the $1 range by year-end. Yet, even as SEI posts strong gains, traders are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its unmatched early-stage upside and rapidly growing community. The pre-sale’s momentum and security assurances are setting a new standard for what’s possible in 2025’s altcoin market. Conclusion: The Breakout Story of 2025? While Bitcoin, Solana, and SEI remain strong performers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of traders and analysts alike. With a scarcity-driven model, robust security, and surging demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the breakout altcoin story of 2025—especially for those who position early.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin recovered to $106K after dipping below $98.5K, following Trump’s ceasefire announcement. An 8% drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate raised concerns, though analysts say such volatility is not unusual. Markets are now pricing in higher odds of Fed rate cuts, supporting risk assets like BTC. The recovery came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a “total ceasefire” between Israel and Iran, calming market nerves after a weekend of geopolitical uncertainty. The sudden price dip led to $193 million in liquidations of long leveraged Bitcoin positions, but that accounted for just 0.3% of total open interest. With roughly $68 billion in leveraged positions still active, the derivatives market remains largely unaffected. Bitcoin’s Hashrate Drops 8% in One Week Adding to the volatility, Bitcoin’s hashrate dropped 8% over the past week, from 943.6 million TH/s to 865.1 million TH/s, fueling speculation of disrupted mining activity. Analysts have pointed to Iran’s role in global mining, though accurate data remains elusive. Reports suggest up to 2 gigawatts of electricity may be consumed by unauthorized mining operations in the country. However, sudden hashrate fluctuations are not uncommon. Energy-related shutdowns in the U.S. are often the cause. Analyst Daniel Batten noted similar dips occur during extreme weather events, such as the April 22 storms in Texas and Oklahoma that temporarily slashed hashrate by 27%. No this is not because Iran is secretly mining large swathes of Bitcoin using nuclear energy. Firstly, drops like this are common (see chart below) and are more likely due to ERCOT curtailment (being paid to shed load, or getting a price signal it's uneconomical to mine).… https://t.co/AxX3poncZ6 pic.twitter.com/XnL4YGaMCl — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) June 23, 2025 On the macro front, oil prices dropped sharply Monday, retreating from a Sunday peak of $77, as broader markets responded positively to the ceasefire. The S&P 500 rose 1%, while expectations grew for U.S. interest rate cuts. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, the probability of the Federal Reserve maintaining its current 4.25% rate through November has fallen to 8.4%. Meanwhile, the chance of rates dropping to 3.75% or lower rose to 53%, up from 38% last week. Whether Bitcoin can break through $110,000 remains uncertain, but the quick recovery suggests institutional appetite hasn’t weakened. For now, traders are balancing optimism over de-escalation with caution around global and macroeconomic developments. Crypto Funds Log $1.24B in 10th Week of Inflows Crypto funds recorded $1.24 billion in inflows last week, marking the tenth consecutive week of gains and pushing year-to-date totals to a record $15.1 billion. Despite the milestone, the pace of inflows slowed in the latter half of the week. The report attributed the decline to the U.S. Juneteenth holiday and rising geopolitical uncertainty surrounding reports of U.S. involvement in the Iran conflict . The US remained the primary driver, contributing $1.25 billion in inflows. Canada and Germany added $20.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Bitcoin attracted $1.1 billion in fresh capital, marking its second straight week of inflows despite recent price weakness, signaling continued appetite among institutional buyers. Short-Bitcoin products, meanwhile, saw modest outflows of $1.4 million, reinforcing the bullish bias.

Over the past week, the price dropped below a crucial support zone between $2.50 and $2.10, triggering a sharp fall toward the $1.95 to $1.92 range. As predicted earlier, XRP did find temporary support around $1.92, bouncing slightly from that level. However, if the price breaks below $1.90 on a daily closing basis, it could trigger a further decline towards $1.80 to $1.79, which is considered the next key support zone. For now, resistance for XRP stands between $2.16 and $2.60. A decisive breakout above $2.16 would be the first sign that the downtrend might be easing. Until then, the overall market structure remains bearish on the daily chart, with small bounces likely but no confirmed trend reversal yet. If XRP falls below $1.79, it could enter a risky zone where lower levels like $1.56 and even $1.21 might come into play. On the other hand, a break above resistance with a strong five-wave pattern could hint at a bullish recovery starting earlier than expected. Expert Says ‘Nothing Is Confirmed Yet’ Analyst Casi Trades has warned that XRP is once again approaching a key support level at $1.90. Casi explained that this kind of “bounce-then-final-dip” move is common before a proper bottom forms. While nothing is confirmed yet, XRP remains in a wider trading range between $2.13 and $1.55. “This week is already full of tension in world events and in the charts. Eyes on this next test.

At the same time, new altcoins are capturing serious investor attention. One project gaining momentum across investor watchlists is MAGACOIN FINANCE—positioning itself as a high-upside contender in the evolving altcoin landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Growth and Surging Demand MAGACOIN FINANCE is building rapid momentum, with analysts highlighting it as a top early-stage pick thanks to its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-selling presale. The project has already raised over $10 million, backed by a full HashEx audit and a capped supply model designed for sustained value growth. Investor confidence is rising, supported by a transparent governance structure and community-first focus. As presale phases continue to fill, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a compelling opportunity in the altcoin space—well-positioned for further upside as it nears public listing. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Institutional Inflows Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum in June 2025, trading near $2,800–$2,900. Institutional buying, DeFi growth, and recent upgrades—including ETF developments—are fueling optimism for new highs. On-chain data reveals accumulation and tightening supply, with analysts predicting that ETH could reclaim the $2,800–$3,000 range this month and potentially retest all-time highs later in the year. As Ethereum’s network fundamentals strengthen, its momentum is helping to lift interest in new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Legal Catalysts and Breakout Potential XRP is trading near $0.54, buoyed by positive momentum from the upcoming Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation. Analysts forecast potential breakouts above $0.65, with high trading volumes and institutional interest supporting the price. June 2025 could see XRP reach as high as $2.09, depending on legal outcomes and market sentiment. As traders seek the next major mover, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly mentioned as a high-conviction alternative for those looking to diversify beyond large caps. Aptos (APT): Short-Term Weakness, Long-Term Watch Aptos is currently experiencing bearish sentiment, with a recent price drop and forecasts suggesting a short-term decline to $3.28 by late June. Despite this, APT maintains key support levels and could stabilize as the market digests recent volatility. While sentiment remains cautious, some investors are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE, attracted by its early-stage upside and scarcity-driven model. Conclusion With Ethereum and XRP both showing strong momentum and Aptos stabilizing, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top early-stage contender in 2025. Its unique fundamentals, rapid presale sellouts, and growing institutional interest suggest the project could continue its rise—potentially outperforming many established names as the cycle unfolds.

According to a detailed thread posted on X by on-chain analytics account Lookonchain on June 23, the punter’s aggressive leveraged bets unraveled spectacularly as the Israel-Iran conflict rocked global markets and sent crypto prices on a wild ride. Anatomy of a $35M Meltdown Lookonchain’s forensic analysis traced the rapid downfall of a wallet linked to AguilaTrades, who publicly celebrated a number 1 ranking on Bybit in late 2024, and claimed to have turned U.S. election predictions into a $50 million windfall. The sequence in question started on June 8, when the trader moved $39.18 million in USDC from Bybit to perpetual futures exchange Hyperliquid. His strategy was straightforward, aggressively leveraging long positions on BTC. He initiated his first major long on June 9, making paper gains of around $5.6 million. However, he refused to take profits, a decision that proved disastrous when Bitcoin plunged sharply after Israel made a preemptive attack on several strategic Iranian nuclear installations and military personnel. As a result, he was forced to close this position at a $12.47 million loss. The investor didn’t give up, though, doubling down with new long positions on June 15 and June 20, both of which saw significant gains. The former bet put him $10 million in the black, while the latter resulted in a more modest but no less grin-inducing $3.2 million in unrealized profit. Once again, AguilaTrades didn’t collect on his windfall, choosing instead to push his luck some more. Fate wouldn’t be tempted, nonetheless, and over the weekend, things went from bad to worse, with the U.S. executing direct military strikes on Iran, and the Persian Gulf state reportedly voting to close the Straits of Hormuz, a key oil transit chokepoint. The action saw BTC crash below $100,000 for the first time since the last week of May, liquidating both of AguilaTrades’ positions and causing him losses of $2.95 million and $17 million, respectively. Data from CoinGlass confirmed that he was not alone in his misery, with over $700 million in leveraged positions liquidated on Saturday alone. According to Lookonchain, the trader made one final dice throw, choosing to go short this time. But, in a cruel twist, Bitcoin bounced back , leaving the luckless investor with an additional $2.33 million loss. “Don’t Be Greedy” The analytics platform bluntly summarized the grim lesson: “Don’t be greedy—take profits. Don’t FOMO into positions during a rally. Avoid using high leverage.” BTC was trading around $101,429 at this writing, down about 1% in the last 24 hours and 5.2% over seven days. It has shown relative resilience compared to the broader crypto market, which lost 7.1% of its value in the past week, a fact that will be of little solace to those caught over-leveraged.

Key Takeaways: Senator Schiff’s COIN Act would bar the president and family members from issuing or endorsing crypto. The bill requires disclosure of any digital asset sale over $1,000. It also suggests penalties including fines and prison time for violations. The bill, titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act , comes amid rising concern over the intertwining of politics and digital assets, particularly in the context of former President Donald Trump’s expanding crypto footprint. The COIN Act proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of cryptocurrency, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. New Bill Requires Disclosure of Digital Asset Sales Over $1,000 The new bill also mandates disclosure of any sale of digital assets worth over $1,000. Violators, including a sitting president, would face a civil penalty equal to the amount of profit made and up to five years in prison. Schiff directly linked the proposal to Trump’s crypto dealings. “President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family,” he said in a statement. However, the timing of Schiff’s move has raised eyebrows. Just last week, he voted in favor of the GENIUS Act , a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. And here it is: An Obama holdover?

Democrats initially balked at the GOP’s refusal to include language addressing presidential crypto conflicts in the GENIUS Act. But facing pressure to push the legislation through, they ultimately relented. Schiff, along with 17 other Democrats, voted in favor. Nine Senate Democrats joined Schiff in co-sponsoring the COIN Act. Seven of them also voted in favor of the GENIUS Act. Other Democratic-led proposals targeting Trump’s crypto ventures include the MEME Act and the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, though none are expected to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes.

Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which approved similar legislation, Texas allowed the reserve and provided funding for it. The state has allocated $10 million to invest in the Bitcoin reserve. With this approach, Texas has made a significant step toward the future of finance. Trump’s pro-crypto stance attracts more US states to adopt Bitcoin reserves The Bill 21 requires the state to set up a Bitcoin reserve that operates separately from the main treasury. This aligns with a few other states also looking into digital asset reserves. The announcement that Texas has allocated $10 million for a Bitcoin reserve comes months after the Trump administration said it would establish a national crypto reserve. However, such a vehicle is supposed to be funded strictly by budget-neutral means, such as crypto asset seizures or issuing crypto bonds. Abbott also signed bill HB 4488, a companion measure that shields the Bitcoin reserve from standard “fund sweeps” into the state’s general revenue. The legislation changes how states handle digital assets, not just as speculative devices, but as sovereign financial instruments that one might want to hold onto for the long term. Texas sets up Bitcoin reserve to fight inflation and flex financial muscle Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), which finally allowed the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to the bill’s text, the new reserve will help make the state more financially resilient while acting as a potential hedge against inflation. In addition, only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included, a threshold only Bitcoin currently has. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage the fund and be guided by an advisory committee with three crypto investment experts. Aside from direct purchases, the reserve could be filled through forks, airdrops, investment profits, or public crypto donations. A public report listing the fund’s holdings and performance will be issued every two years. With this, Texas becomes the third state in the US to pass Bitcoin reserve legislation. Public firms demonstrate a growing trend of purchasing more BTC for their treasuries Several publicly traded companies follow Michael Saylor’s strategy by adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. For instance, on Friday, June 20, US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency adviser, David Bailey‘s Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings, raised $51.5 million in new funds through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal to purchase more BTC. Moreover, last week, The Blockchain Group, a technology company listed in Paris, increased its Bitcoin reserves by buying 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. This purchase raised its total holdings to 1,653 BTC. Just over the past month, companies have added Bitcoin to their treasuries, a trend that has been documented with the help of data from BitcoinTreasuries. Furthermore, NET shows public companies still have an appetite for BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a breakout contender, drawing comparisons to the early trajectories of these market leaders and positioning itself as a high-upside opportunity in the evolving altcoin landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Growth and Surging Demand MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly building momentum, with analysts highlighting it as a top early-stage pick thanks to its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-selling presale. The project has already raised over $10 million, supported by a full HashEx audit and a capped supply model designed for sustained value growth. Investor confidence is rising, underpinned by a transparent governance structure and a strong community-first focus. As presale phases continue to fill, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a compelling opportunity—well-positioned for further upside as it nears public listing. Analysts note the project’s structured rollout and scarcity mechanics, which historically have produced outsized returns for early entrants. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Momentum and Market Anchor Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, trading above $112,000 and supported by robust institutional inflows and ETF demand. Analysts see potential for BTC to reach $130,000–$200,000 if the current uptrend persists. While Bitcoin’s upside is steady, its early-stage success story is inspiring investors to seek similar growth in new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Network Strength Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, trading above $2,500 and benefiting from institutional buying, DeFi growth, and recent upgrades. On-chain data reveals accumulation and tightening supply, with analysts predicting that ETH could reclaim the $2,800–$3,000 range this month and potentially retest all-time highs later in the year. As Ethereum’s fundamentals strengthen, its momentum is helping to lift interest in new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Growth Potential Polkadot is trading near $4.74, with forecasts pointing to a possible rise to $5.03 by the end of May 8 . While DOT’s gains are modest compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it remains a key player in the interoperability sector. Analysts highlight Polkadot’s long-term potential, but many investors are now seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the market and Polkadot maintaining its role as a key interoperability platform, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top early-stage contender in 2025. Its unique fundamentals, rapid presale sellouts, and growing institutional interest suggest the project could follow a similar path to success—potentially outperforming many established names as the cycle unfolds.

That brings the year-to-date haul to $15 billion. Even holiday trading lulls and global jitters haven’t stalled the momentum. Investors seem to be treating this pullback as a chance to buy, not a reason to sell. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead The Pack According to CoinShares data, Bitcoin pulled in $1.114 billion this week alone. It has now logged $2.37 billion month-to-date and $12.7 billion YTD, across nearly $152 billion in assets under management. Ethereum chipped in with its ninth straight week of gains, adding $124 million in weekly inflows. That pushed its month-to-date total past $1 billion and its YTD figure to $2.43 billion, across $14.29 billion of assets. Investors aren’t scooping up bearish bets, either: short Bitcoin products saw just $1.4 million in outflows this week and $8.7 million since January. Altcoins See Mixed Results Solana attracted $2.80 million this week and nearly $3 million month-to-date, lifting its YTD flows to almost $86 million. XRP pulled in $2.70 million weekly and $10.55 million month-to-date, taking its year-long total to $268 million across $1.205 billion in managed assets. But funds that package multiple tokens bled $5.76 million this week and almost $17 million for the month—though they’re still up $58 million in 2025. Other altcoin vehicles are in rough shape, with $509 million of outflows since January. Regional Trends Highlight The US The United States led global flows with $1.25 billion in weekly inflows. That’s $3.37 billion month-to-date and $14.30 billion YTD, out of $135 billion under management. Canada added nearly $21 million this week and $42.8 million for June. Germany chipped in almost $11 million while Australia booked $16.6 million. Brazil bucked the trend with $9 million of outflows this week and $26.4 million in June, but it’s still about $34.8 million ahead for the year. Smaller Tokens Struggle For Attention Some newer names drew mixed reactions. Sui saw $8.5 million drain this week despite $3.3 million of gains so far in June. Litecoin eked out $0.21 million in weekly inflows and clos to $6 million YTD. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free—Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Cardano and Chainlink grabbed $0.34 million and $0.6 million this week, respectively. But smaller “other” products pulled in only $2.75 million against heavy selling since January. Institutions are still finding reasons to back crypto even as global events and holiday thins slow trading. Total weekly flows hit $1.23 billion, taking June’s total to $3.38 billion and the year’s to $15 billion, across $176 billion in overall assets. Based on these trends, big spenders aren’t ready to abandon digital tokens. They’re treating pullbacks like offers they can’t pass up.

Ethereum Price Regains Traction Ethereum price started a fresh increase from the $2,120 support level, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,200 and $2,250 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The bulls even pushed the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,114 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,440 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,460 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,114 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,500 level. A clear move above the $2,500 resistance might send the price toward the $2,550 resistance. An upside break above the $2,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,620 resistance zone or even $2,650 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,460 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,340 level. The first major support sits near the $2,320 zone. A clear move below the $2,320 support might push the price toward the $2,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) remain dominant forces, but many traders are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for its rare early-stage upside. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is also on the radar, though its recent volatility has prompted a shift in capital toward projects with stronger momentum and structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the most talked-about pre-sale of 2025 , with over $10 million raised and every phase selling out at record speed. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven tokenomics, full audit, and disciplined rollout as key reasons for its surge in demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a reputation for credibility and long-term potential, with experts’ analysis citing: Capped token supply and full HashEx audit , ensuring long-term integrity and no stealth inflation Strong retail and institutional interest , with momentum growing across altcoin trading communities Bitcoin (BTC): The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin continues to set the tone for crypto markets, trading above $105,000 and attracting significant institutional inflows. While BTC remains a benchmark for bullish sentiment, its massive market cap now implies more stability and less explosive upside compared to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Many seasoned BTC holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking the kind of sharp returns that defined Bitcoin’s early years. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum, But Investors Seek More Solana is drawing strong forecasts, with some projecting 2025 highs between $220 and $1,000. Its ecosystem growth and potential ETF inclusion are fueling optimism. However, as SOL matures, many traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for its greater upside potential and scarcity-driven model. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Volatility Spurs Diversification NEAR Protocol is experiencing heightened volatility, recently dropping to $1.89 despite increased trading volume. While some analysts expect a potential recovery, the broader sentiment is cautious. With support levels weakening and resistance holding firm, investors are seeking more stable growth paths—leading many to diversify into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion In a market where timing and structure are everything, even a small investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE could reshape portfolios for those who act early. As Bitcoin and Solana traders seek sharper returns and NEAR faces headwinds, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout candidate of 2025.

A new airdrop event by Midnight , a privacy-focused blockchain connected to Cardano, is now live, offering free NIGHT tokens to eligible ADA holders. And no, it’s not just a few tokens — the numbers are quite impressive . So, here’s how to claim your FREE Night token. What Is Midnight and Why Does It Matter? Midnight is a fully integrated partner chain of Cardano that utilizes Cardano’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism for its security and governance. What sets it apart is its strong multichain strategy, targeting not only Cardano users but also holders on Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and more. However, the ongoing buzz is mostly around the “Glacier Drop”, the first phase of Midnight’s token distribution plan. According to the project’s whitepaper , 12 billion NIGHT tokens—half of the entire supply—will be given away to eligible users. And the largest beneficiary of this ecosystem will be the Cardano wallet holders. More Than Just an Airdrop—It’s Cardano’s Growth Catalyst What’s exciting is that Midnight isn’t some side project—it’s deeply tied into Cardano’s architecture. The NIGHT token is minted directly on Cardano. Stake pool operators (SPOs) can even earn NIGHT without giving up ADA rewards. With strong tokenomics, real utility, and multichain support, Midnight might be the boost Cardano needs to reclaim its spotlight in the crypto space. How to Claim Your NIGHT Tokens To be eligible for the Midnight airdrop, you must have held at least $100 worth of ADA in a Cardano wallet at the time of a previously taken snapshot. Midnight is bringing private smart contracts, cross-chain privacy, and dual-token mechanics ($NIGHT + $DUST ). It’s free to claim if you qualify — don’t miss it. For more alpha follow @onewisemelon — melon (@onewisemelon) June 23, 2025 The claiming process is simple and gas-free, just sign with your wallet and provide a clean Cardano address. There’s no KYC or cost involved. How Much NIGHT Could You Receive? However, each person’s airdrop amount depends on how much ADA they held compared to others. For example, if you held 5,000 ADA, and the total eligible pool was 1.5 billion ADA, you’d receive around 40,000 NIGHT tokens. How Much 1 NIGHT Token Worth? Now here’s where it gets interesting. If NIGHT reaches a $500 million market cap, each token could be worth around $0.0208, which means your free 40,000 NIGHT tokens could be worth over $800. There is a 60-day window to claim your tokens, and they won’t be usable right away. Meanwhile, claimed tokens will first be locked and will “thaw” gradually during the Redemption period, allowing holders to access them over time.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 03:32:37

Over the past few months, Ripple has made several strategic moves, fueling talks of an eventual public listing , even though the company has officially said it’s not on the table for 2025. While Ripple’s executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Monica Long, have made it clear that no IPO is planned this year, signs of IPO preparation are visible. The company recently launched a $700 million share buyback and has been hiring for corporate development and investor relations roles. Its $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road and a $250 million deal for custody provider Metaco also hint at long-term growth plans. Adding to this, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton reacted to a video clip of Garlinghouse commenting on Circle’s market performance after its IPO. Deaton said that while Ripple isn’t in a rush to go public and doesn’t need to raise capital, timing an IPO is crucial. I know @bgarlinghouse said @Ripple is NOT in a rush to go public. They certainly don’t need to raise capital, which is often, a primary reason to go public. But TIMING an IPO is also a big consideration.

XRP’s price has been trading within a tight range since its drop from $3.40 in January, hovering around $2. It briefly spiked to $3 in March after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed including XRP in a national crypto reserve. Since then, the token has remained trapped within a rigid range. Meanwhile, institutional interest around XRP appears to be growing. Publicly listed firm VivoPower recently partnered with the Flare blockchain to earn yields on its XRP holdings and invested $121 million in XRP for its treasury. While Ripple’s IPO plans remain speculative for now, the company’s expanding footprint and market activity continue to keep investors watching closely.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 03:41:00

The digital asset reached lows of approximately $98,974 following reports of US military strikes on Iran. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has regained some ground and is trading at $102,1010, representing a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours and a 5.82% decrease over the last week. Amid this price performance, recent on-chain analysis points to a phase of consolidation rather than a structural breakdown. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared in a QuickTake post that long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be maintaining their positions rather than exiting, indicating continued conviction despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Signal Consolidation, Not Capitulation According to Darkfost, the current market behavior is reflective of a quiet consolidation period, with long-term holders showing little inclination to sell. Based on the 30-day moving average of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), his analysis shows that the metric has stayed below the 0.8 threshold typically associated with major corrections. The value recently peaked at 0.6 before trending downward, suggesting limited market overheating at present levels. Darkfost emphasized that this moderation could precede a continuation of the broader bull cycle, mirroring past market structures where consolidation phases led to further price advances. He noted that past bull runs have often been characterized by a “staircase” trajectory, periods of sideways or modest downward movement followed by renewed upward momentum. In this context, subdued sentiment may indicate that the market is preparing for a potential next leg higher. The analyst wrote: Importantly, this does not signal the end of the bull cycle. Instead, similar to the past two phases, we may once again see a staircase-like movement where consolidation is followed by another leg up. Historically, Bitcoin’s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move. Whale Behavior Remains Steady Amid Market Tensions Complementing this outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, provided insight into whale activity during the current consolidation phase. He noted that while the market setup resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021, key on-chain signals from whales have not aligned with those seen during that previous peak. Specifically, Ethereum transaction outflows, often used as a proxy for large investor exits, have not shown the kind of spikes observed during the 2021 market top. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Mignolet pointed out that although Ethereum has seen a gradual decline in market share relative to other layer-1 and layer-2 chains since 2020, its transactional data still maintains a strong correlation with Bitcoin price movements. The absence of aggressive exit activity among large holders suggests that major market participants are not rushing for the exits, despite heightened geopolitical uncertainty and short-term price volatility.

Instead of betting on pure hype, the focus is now on coins backed by adoption, delivery, and clear roadmaps. That’s where the current spotlight is turning, toward a new mix of value and upside. Among the top picks gaining traction right now are BlockDAG , Avalanche, Cardano, and Cosmos. Each brings something unique to the table, but only one stands out with fresh infrastructure rollouts and a strong entry price window. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in now, this shortlist gives you the most relevant updates and pricing insights to help you decide before the next breakout. BlockDAG: $0.0020 Price Ends June 24 BlockDAG is quickly becoming a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, attracting considerable attention even before its official exchange debut. This growing interest is evident in its impressive presale success and its dedication to swift infrastructure development. The presale has garnered significant investor confidence, with over 23.2 billion BDAG coins sold, raising an impressive $318.5 million. Currently in Batch 29, the price is set at $0.0020 until June 24th, after which it will rise to $0.0030. This strategic price increase encourages early adoption, promising substantial returns. If BlockDAG hits its target listing price of $0.05, early investors could see a remarkable 25x return, leading many analysts to recommend it as a top pre-launch investment. BlockDAG’s commitment to rapid infrastructure development further solidifies its credibility. The X1 mobile miner already boasts over 2 million active users, showcasing early community engagement. Additionally, the X30 and X100 mining rigs are slated for shipment on July 7th, emphasizing a push towards decentralized mining. Strategic exchange listings with major platforms like MEXC, BitMart, and LBANK are also secured, ensuring broad accessibility and liquidity. The project has undergone rigorous audits by CertiK and Halborn, reinforcing its security. With a clear plan for post-launch liquidity and price stability, BlockDAG is actively rolling out features and building a robust ecosystem. The upcoming price increase offers a prime investment opportunity in a cryptocurrency with significant growth potential. Avalanche: Short-Term Weakness but Long-Term Potential Avalanche (AVAX) has been trying to hold support levels this week, currently trading near $16.83 after seeing highs of $17.13 and lows around $15.72. Short-term sentiment is slightly bearish as some analysts warn of a possible breakdown below $15.50, which could lead to a move toward $10.50. However, the on-chain metrics tell a different story. Avalanche continues to see solid activity, especially in DeFi and meme coin launches on its C-chain earlier this year. The divergence between strong network usage and recent price dips suggests that AVAX may be undervalued at current levels. If the ecosystem continues to expand, this could become a recovery play. For those looking at ecosystem strength over temporary volatility, Avalanche still offers real potential. While it may not be the best crypto to invest in now for short-term returns, it’s definitely one to keep on the radar if the market sentiment shifts. Cardano: Oversold Setup Could Fuel a Bounce Cardano (ADA) is hovering around $0.54, having pulled back from earlier resistance levels around $0.60. Over the past few days, ADA has faced downward pressure, dropping roughly 6.5% due to global market jitters and heavy volume trading. Still, its charts are now flashing oversold indicators, which some analysts say could set up a bounce if ADA holds above the $0.513 support range. On the ecosystem side, Cardano continues to be active with over 2,000 projects in development, 110+ million transactions, and 355 developer commits this week alone. It also leads the market in exchange outflows, over $932 million ADA has been pulled off exchanges so far this year, signaling long-term holder confidence. While ADA might not be leading the pack in short-term gains, its strong fundamentals make it a reasonable pick for anyone balancing long-term positioning with current opportunities. It still earns a spot on any serious list of the best crypto to invest in now. Cosmos: Range-Bound but Still Building Cosmos (ATOM) has been trading in a narrow range, currently sitting at about $3.78, with support at $3.60 and resistance around $3.87 to $4.00. Over the past few sessions, the coin has been consolidating, and although it hasn’t made a clear breakout, traders are watching for any signals that might push it beyond this resistance band. Indicators like RSI and MACD are mostly neutral, and volume has been steady. Despite the price stall, Cosmos isn’t sitting idle. Its interchain upgrades like IBC Eureka and Tokenomics 2.0 continue to drive interest from both developers and institutional players. Recent ecosystem momentum includes ongoing CBDC trials and new integrations with chains like Ethereum through IBC. Cosmos may not be the flashiest pick today, but it still brings real utility and infrastructure backing it. If the charts hold and the next upgrade cycle hits on time, it could surprise to the upside, making it one of the best crypto to invest in now from a mid-term growth angle. Summing Up All four coins in this list offer different types of value right now. Avalanche is rebuilding momentum after a recent dip. Cardano has strong development and network metrics pointing to long-term resilience. Cosmos is quietly building under the surface with key infrastructure updates. But BlockDAG stands out for one simple reason, it’s not even live yet and already has infrastructure, traction, and funding most live coins are still chasing. With a presale price of $0.0020 ending on June 24 and a target listing of $0.05, the upside is clear. Combined with its mobile miner adoption and exchange listing roadmap, BlockDAG offers the most immediate and scalable upside. That’s why if you’re picking the best crypto to invest in now, this list helps, but the smart money will move before the next presale price hike hits.

With early parallels to the breakout trajectories of XRP , Ethereum (ETH) , and Polkadot (DOT) , the project is earning attention for its structured rollout, growing community support, and high-upside forecasts. As more capital rotates into early-stage plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a serious contender. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Before Listing MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing attention across crypto circles thanks to its strong pre-sale demand and investor-friendly design. With a hard-capped supply of 170 billion tokens, a full audit, and zero VC control, the project is winning over both retail and institutional buyers. Experts cite its fast sellouts, and transparent tokenomics as signs of a disciplined build-up phase before exchange listing. 100% community-owned structure Full smart contract audit completed Projected ROI estimates reaching up to 100x XRP: Strong But Seeking More XRP continues its uptrend, bolstered by legal clarity and ETF speculation. However, many XRP holders are now exploring MAGACOIN FINANCE as a new route to higher returns. Ethereum: Consolidating Before a Move ETH remains a heavyweight, with forecasts suggesting a surge to new highs. Yet with slower upside expected, traders are allocating to earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper growth potential. Polkadot: Bullish on Fundamentals DOT retains developer momentum and cross-chain relevance, but range-bound prices are causing some holders to diversify into high-ROI setups—making MAGACOIN FINANCE a rising pick among altcoin traders. Conclusion With early-stage metrics accelerating and analyst forecasts pointing to 100x+ ROI , MAGACOIN FINANCE is being called one of the most undervalued opportunities of 2025. As other altcoins mature, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the one early mover investors talk about for years.

However, crypto prices spiked today after President Trump announced a ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel. Bitcoin rose nearly 3% as it climbed above $106,000. XRP also posted gains around 6% in the last 24 hours. No Long Delay in Sight There were speculations that the Ripple vs. SEC case could drag into late 2026. But Bill Morgan clarified that such a delay is unlikely, unless Judge Torres rejects the current joint proposal. The most probable outcome, he says, is both parties accepting the summary judgment, along with a penalty and permanent injunction. The court is now waiting on a key SEC filing due by mid-August. The XRP community remains on edge, unsure of what Judge Torres might decide next. Experts say that “it could go either way” but nobody has backed the idea of a delay into 2026.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 04:01:17

The price is back above $2.10 and might struggle to continue higher above the $2.20 zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.050 zone. The price is now trading above $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if there is a close above the $2.180 resistance zone. XRP Price Eyes More Gains XRP price remained supported above the $1.920 zone and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price recovered above the $2.00 and $2.020 resistance levels. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2.00 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even cleared the $2.10 resistance and $2.150 hurdle. However, the bears were active below $2.20. A high was formed at $2.170 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.910 swing low to the $2.170 high. The price is now trading above $2.10 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.1650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.180 level. The next resistance is $2.20. A clear move above the $2.20 resistance might send the price toward the $2.250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.300 resistance or even $2.320 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.50. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.180 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.0880 level. The next major support is near the $2.050 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1.910 swing low to the $2.170 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.050 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.00 support. The next major support sits near the $1.920 zone.

The move further cements Amazon’s long-term commitment to the UK as a key market and powerhouse of talent and innovation. The far-reaching investment will impact several industries, including logistics, digital technology, creative industries, and cloud computing. It is expected to add £38 billion to the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2027. A significant portion of the £40 billion spending spree will expand Amazon’s operational network throughout the UK. That includes four new, high-tech fulfillment centers. Two of these sites, Hull and Northampton, are already known. Two additional fulfillment centers will open in the East Midlands. While it is unknown where these will be, the expansion suggests that the tech giant is keen to spread its sites further across the country rather than just concentrating on London, where much of its previous infrastructure spending has occurred. Along with these new sites, Amazon will open dozens of new delivery stations to assist with its last-mile delivery service . They’ll help slash delivery time, cut congestion, and enable businesses to be more productive all across the UK. The online retail powerhouse also intends to renovate and grow over 100 active buildings, including warehouses and sortation centers. Investments such as new robotic systems, sustainability improvements, and worker-friendly features will increase safety and productivity. Amazon will also create two new office buildings at its UK headquarters in East London to back up its corporate employees. They are intended to house locally based teams in software development, customer experience, and artificial intelligence. Amazon to create thousands of jobs across UK Amazon’s £40 billion commitment would significantly impact employment in the UK, especially in areas that have received less investment from the private sector in the past. The firm expects thousands of permanent, full-time jobs to be established throughout the country over the next three years. Amazon has over 75,000 employees in the UK and is one of Britain’s largest private-sector employers. That number will increase substantially with the expansion, and the new and existing plants will generate more than 60 different kinds of jobs. Positions will range from warehouse associates and robotics technicians to mechatronic engineers, IT workers, and health and safety officers. The firm is also pioneering apprenticeships and training schemes, which have been secured since the lockdown, to maintain a talent pipeline for future positions. Amazon pays a competitive wage starting at £28,000 a year outside London and £30,000 in London. The company also provides various employee benefits, such as health care, parental leave, and education assistance. Amazon supercharges UK’s digital and creative sectors with cloud, AI, and studio expansion A large part of Amazon’s investment will be towards enhancing the UK’s digital economy. That funding extends to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing unit. Amazon said in September 2024 it planned to spend £8bn by 2028 creating, operating, and servicing data centers throughout the UK. These data centers will help power cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning services. They will be vital to UK companies of all sizes and will help drive national aspirations to lead the world in AI infrastructure. Amazon is expanding its footprint with Prime Video and studio operations in the creative field. It will redevelop the historic Bray Film Studios in Berkshire as part of the new investment. The site will become a major production hub for UK-originated film and TV content, providing new opportunities for the creative economy and creating hundreds of jobs for the area for production crews, writers, and actors. The company also invests in upskilling UK creatives through multimillion-pound training initiatives and a new education partnership focused on media and digital production.

This marks his first transactions in a disposal scheme that could total $865 million by the end of 2025. According to US Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Huang sold 100,000 shares in two batches, earning $14.4 million. These are his first sales under a Rule 10b5- 1 trading plan he set up in March 2025 and revealed in Nvidia’s latest quarterly report. Jensen Huang sells shares through a pre-set stock plan Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is selling company shares under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan . This system allows executives to sell stock at predetermined times, even if they possess confidential or market-sensitive information. The plan prevents accusations of insider trading and assures the public that the sale isn’t based on private knowledge by removing the executive’s control over the timing of the sales. Nvidia publicly disclosed it, thus proving to investors that these transactions were scheduled in advance and not influenced by current market conditions or company developments. Huang filed documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that show he sold 100,000 shares over June 20 and June 23 and brought in about $14.4 million. He submitted a second filing around the same time, showing he plans to sell another 50,000 shares. The 10b5-1 plan allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares by December 31, 2025, worth around $865 million if fully sold based on Nvidia’s closing stock price of $144.17 on the Monday before the filing. This plan could reduce any potential disruptions to the stock’s value and give the market time to absorb the transactions gradually by spreading the sales over time. Huang is deeply committed to Nvidia’s long-term success and growth. The shares he wants to sell under this year’s plan amount to less than 1% of his total holdings of more than 900 million shares (nearly 4% of the company). Most of his estimated $126 billion wealth comes from his Nvidia shares. The CEO has already sold more than $700 million between mid-2024 and early 2025 alone and over $1.9 billion in Nvidia stock throughout his career using similar 10b5-1 plans to manage his financial assets. Mark Stevens sells millions in Nvidia stock without a preset plan Nvidia board member and billionaire investor Mark Stevens joined the wave of insider stock sales this June. He did this at his own discretion and without a preset trading plan like Rule 10b5-1. He has more control over the timing of his trades because he can decide when and how much to sell without a fixed schedule. His approach hasn’t raised any concerns or red flags so far. However, it placed the company under greater public and investor scrutiny, as they are not automatically distanced from the possibility of insider knowledge. A separate filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows Stevens brought in approximately $88 million in proceeds from selling more than 600,000 Nvidia shares on June 18. Earlier, he filed a proposal to up to 4 million shares (worth around $550 million, depending on market performance). After Nvidia’s rapid and unprecedented stock rally, he has already sold over 2 million shares as part of a broader strategy to rebalance his portfolio. Steven’s trades reflect a conscious, real-time decision based on prevailing market conditions or personal financial goals. They are completely legal and fairly common among board members or long-term investors. However, it lacks the built-in safeguards that a preset plan offers against perceptions of timing trades based on non-public information. Most of Steven’s estimated net worth of around $9.8 billion is tied to his Nvidia holdings, so it’s understandable that he might look to convert part of his paper wealth into liquid assets with the company becoming one of the most valuable firms in the world.

While meme coins are slowing down, utility-driven and infrastructure-backed coins are starting to lead the action. Among today’s strongest movers, BlockDAG is drawing attention for its presale milestones and clear pricing roadmap, while Aptos, Solana, and Cosmos show solid technical activity and on-chain progress. Each of these networks is riding distinct drivers, some tied to ecosystem growth, others to smart partnerships or protocol upgrades. But one thing is common: these aren’t just short-term plays. From price action to platform rollouts, here’s why they’re each being called a top performing crypto today and what you need to watch going forward. BlockDAG Pushes Past $318.5M as June 24 Deadline Nears BlockDAG is leading the presale conversation with its current $0.0020 price in Batch 29, which holds until June 24 before rising to $0.0030. With over 23.2 billion BDAG sold and around $318.5 million raised, it’s already showing strong traction. The earliest buyers have seen returns of over 2,660%, and the coin is targeting a listing price of $0.05, which would give it a potential $400 million market cap, enough to land near #140 on CoinMarketCap. These are not just targets on paper. BlockDAG is backing them up with infrastructure already deployed and more rolling out before the listing. More than 2 million users are already mining BDAG via the X1 app, and physical mining rigs, X30 and X100, are set to ship on July 7, followed by X10 units on August 15. On top of that, BlockDAG has completed a security audits with Halborn and CertiK. Exchange listings are lined up post-presale, including MEXC, BitMart, XT.com, and others, with market-making and liquidity plans in place. This isn’t just a presale, it’s an operational launch sequence. For those scanning for the best altcoins to buy now, BDAG offers a clear runway with solid infrastructure, high ROI potential, and a presale window that’s closing fast. Aptos Breaks Out After Stablecoin Win Aptos is showing strong price recovery today, bouncing near $4.01 after dipping earlier in the week. The rebound comes after Aptos received top scores from Wyoming’s Stable Token Commission to participate in the WYST stablecoin pilot. This put Aptos in a stronger spotlight alongside Sei and Solana, and price responded with a sharp 3% move upward during the announcement window. What makes Aptos a top performing crypto today is how it’s pairing this institutional nod with rising developer activity. It’s being featured on several altcoin watchlists ahead of its FA token standard migration deadline at the end of June. Meanwhile, a token unlock on July 12 could cause some temporary volatility, but traders are eyeing the $4.90 resistance level as a key breakout point. Right now, Aptos is riding renewed trust and real use cases, with strong interest returning to its DeFi and stablecoin potential. Solana Rebounds From Lows With Kazakhstan Boost Solana is trading around $134 after dipping to a two-month low near $126. This recovery is being fueled by both a macro bounce and big news on the adoption front. Kazakhstan just launched the first-ever “Solana Economic Zone” in Central Asia, linking the Solana Foundation with local financial entities for tokenized assets and regulatory sandboxes. Adding to that momentum, Solana also rolled out Network Extensions, an infrastructure boost allowing devs to run isolated apps without fragmenting liquidity. Traders are watching key resistance around $137 to $142, with some calling for a breakout to $145 if current volume holds. Given this technical setup and real-world expansion, Solana earns its place as a top performing crypto today, especially as it fights to hold the $130 support level. If it clears $142 cleanly, the sentiment could flip decisively bullish. Cosmos Sees Renewed Energy From IBC and Governance Cosmos (ATOM) is slowly climbing back, now priced around $3.79, showing a small but steady gain of over 1% in 24 hours. Today’s action is tied to strong developer traction and fresh interoperability upgrades. The IBC Eureka upgrade is now actively boosting Ethereum integration, while the Interchain Foundation’s funding of evmOS means Cosmos may become an even bigger bridge between Ethereum and the rest of the multichain world. Security was also in focus this week, with access revoked from a former contributor linked to North Korea. Cosmos responded by doubling bug bounties and launching a full governance overhaul, including a new Gaia v25 proposal and changes to voting period timelines. These changes are pushing Cosmos back into conversation as a top performing crypto today, with developers and traders both signaling confidence in its direction. It’s not just about price, it’s about sustained commitment to protocol evolution and ecosystem safety. Summing Up Today’s action isn’t being led by hype, it’s being driven by updates, upgrades, and serious buyer interest. BlockDAG has set the tone with a $318.5M presale push and a 50% price jump coming on June 24, putting it at the front of the top performing crypto today . Aptos is back in the spotlight thanks to the Wyoming stablecoin pilot. Solana is bouncing with both tech rollouts and international partnerships, and Cosmos is turning heads with strong governance and IBC utility upgrades. Whether you’re tracking momentum or planning accumulation, these four are commanding attention for a reason. Keep watching BlockDAG especially, because once that $0.0030 price kicks in, the regret zone for missing out gets very real.

As the cryptocurrency attempts to hold a key support area, some analysts believe this make-or-break retest will determine its next big move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Wobbles? Metaplanet Buys Big, Breaks $1 Billion Mark Cardano To See More Bleeding Cardano is recording a 4.5% daily increase after bouncing from the $0.51 area on Sunday. Notably, ADA was in a downtrend following its 3-year high of $1.32 in December 2024, which ended after the late April breakout and May bullish rally. However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to hold its April-May range amid the June market pullback, losing the key $0.66 area ten days ago. Since then, Cardano has recorded seven consecutive red daily candles and fallen below the $0.60 support. Sjuul from AltCryptoGems suggested that Cardano’s rally will be halted unless some ground is recovered. According to the analyst, the cryptocurrency’s multi-month price action “ended up being a classic distribution schematic” after losing the $0.66 support. This would signal that ADA’s uptrend has ended and a potential downtrend is ahead. “As long as we don’t reclaim $0.66, just expect further downtrend from now on,” he asserted. Meanwhile, market watcher Man of Bitcoin highlighted the cryptocurrency’s June downtrend, affirming that if the price remains below the descending trendline, downward pressure will persist. He added that “One more low in wave iv is still possible,” hinting that a drop below the $0.50 could be on the horizon before the next wave up. Nonetheless, the analyst noted that “it should be a brief wick to the downside” as a “sustained break lower would weaken the bullish outlook.” ADA Retest To Trigger Rally To $1? Amid the ongoing global war tensions, ADA’s price retested the crucial $0.52 support on Sunday, hitting a four-month low of $0.51, before recovering and closing the week around the $0.54 mark. Market watcher Rose Premium Signals noted that a weekly close around the crucial $0.56 level would continue the possible double-bottom setup forming on ADA’s chart. The analyst added that a confirmed rebound from the $0.54-$0-56 area could send the price to the initial $0.99 target and set the stage for a climb toward the $1.20 and $1.50 resistances. On the contrary, failing to hold this area could see Cardano lose its six-month price range and retrace to the $0.32 level. Meanwhile, Crypto Billion affirmed that Cardano appears to be forming a potential triple bottom structure, which could lead to a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move As the cryptocurrency retested the $0.50-$0.52 area over the weekend, the analyst highlighted that this key range had been held twice before since the November breakout. Additionally, he pointed out that ADA’s price appears to be trading within a multi-month falling wedge pattern, which suggests a breakout toward the $1 mark if the price climbs toward the upper boundary.

The move is reshaping capital flows across the space, with traders now seeking assets that mirror ETH’s early growth curve. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as a core beneficiary of this trend—alongside legacy giant XRP and high-speed blockchain SEI. This rotation signals a shift toward structured, high-upside plays that can capture the current market energy. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Leading the Early-Stage Charge As Ethereum’s upgrade lifts broader sentiment, investors are locking in positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE —a fast-moving pre-sale project gaining major traction. With a fixed 170 billion token cap, full audit, and visible staking mechanics, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a future leader. What’s fueling demand: Scarcity-based structure with zero VC allocation Presale rounds selling out consistently Analysts projecting up to 100x return potential Investor behavior shows that capital isn’t just rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE—it’s staying. That conviction is what’s propelling the asset to the top of watchlists for 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Upgrade Ignites Market Rotation Ethereum’s recent upgrade—focusing on scalability, staking incentives, and lower transaction costs—is being hailed as a critical leap forward. ETH is now trading above $2,900 and showing bullish signs of continuation toward $6,000. As Ethereum leads the way technically, many traders are redeploying profits into pre-sale plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture ETH-style gains in earlier cycles. XRP: Momentum Returns with Regulatory Clarity XRP remains firmly in bullish territory, holding above $2.30 in June. Following legal clarity and strong ETF speculation, trader sentiment has rebounded. However, with much of XRP’s upside now priced in, investors are increasingly exploring MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater exponential potential in the short term. SEI: Speed and Narrative Build, But Traders Want More SEI is gaining popularity due to its lightning-fast throughput and growing DeFi presence. While it has strong fundamentals, its price has remained range-bound. Many SEI holders are now complementing their portfolios with positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE, hoping to gain exposure to a fresh, scarcity-driven growth engine. Conclusion Ethereum’s upgrade is changing the altcoin landscape—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is reaping the rewards. As XRP and SEI benefit from rising sentiment, it’s the early-stage momentum and scarcity model of MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s drawing the sharpest investor focus in 2025.

Founded by U.S. President Donald Trump, the company has just approved a $400 million stock buyback while reaffirming its strong commitment to digital assets. Meanwhile, Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire led to a 3.2% gain in Bitcoin’s value over 24 hours , with the cryptocurrency holding firm above the $100,000 mark despite the recent bloodbath. Stock Buyback Shows Confidence Trump Media has approved a $400 million stock buyback plan to return value to shareholders while signaling strong confidence in its long-term strategy. CEO Devin Nunes highlighted that with $3 billion on the company’s balance sheet, there’s enough flexibility to fund the buyback without affecting its $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. Nunes called Bitcoin “a crown jewel” and said the repurchase is also meant to protect the company from what he described as discrimination against conservative businesses by financial institutions. The funds are part of a broader push to support Trump-branded crypto products, including upcoming ETFs, pending regulatory approval. Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Still on Track While the buyback grabbed headlines, the real game-changer is Trump Media’s ongoing plan to build a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury . The strategy, similar to what Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has done, signals the company’s intent to become a major crypto holder. The plan includes a private placement offering to fund the crypto reserves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back After Trump’s Ceasefire Announcement , In short, Trump Media is going all-in on crypto with fresh capital and bold plans. It filed to register nearly 85 million shares for resale and secured $2.3 billion through deals with about 50 investors, including $100 million from Chicago-based firm DRW. Additionally, the company has taken things a step further by filing for a combined Bitcoin-Ether ETF in partnership with Crypto.com. The fund is expected to hold 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ethereum, aiming to capitalize on both leading cryptocurrencies. This funding supports its Bitcoin treasury strategy, though the company hasn’t revealed how much BTC it holds yet. Meanwhile, its stock (DJT) rose over 3% on Monday, hitting $18.39 after weeks of sharp declines. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

CEO Devin Nunes emphasized Bitcoin as a core asset that symbolizes financial freedom and independence—especially against what they describe as discrimination from traditional financial institutions. Will the SEC approve Trump Media’s Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF? It’s unclear. While the SEC has started approving Bitcoin ETFs, a politically affiliated company might face extra scrutiny. However, having a partner like Crypto.com may improve their chances. Is Trump Media really buying billions in Bitcoin, or is it all just hype? So far, Trump Media has announced a $2.3B Bitcoin treasury plan, but they haven’t disclosed actual purchases or wallet addresses. What’s the deal with the $400M stock buyback—why now? Redditors speculate it’s to boost investor confidence after sharp stock declines and distract from the lack of real Bitcoin on the balance sheet. Others say it’s a standard financial tactic—but timed to ride the bullish crypto news cycle. Is this Bitcoin reserve made of newly bought crypto or just seized assets? Reddit threads (especially on r/Buttcoin) suggest some of the BTC might be seized assets now labeled as a “reserve.” If true, this wouldn’t involve new market purchases—raising concerns about the plan’s authenticity.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 05:07:45

The price is now showing positive signs and might aim for more gains in the near term. BNB price is attempting to recover from the $600 support zone. The price is now trading below $632 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $632 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes More Gains After forming a base above the $600 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $620 and $625 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin . There was a decent move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $651 swing high to the $602 low. Besides, there was a break above a bearish trend line with resistance at $625 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The price is now trading below $632 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. It is also consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $651 swing high to the $602 low. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $644 level. The next resistance sits near the $650 level. A clear move above the $650 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $665. A close above the $665 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $680 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $700 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $644 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $635 level. The next major support is near the $632 level. The main support sits at $625. If there is a downside break below the $625 support, the price could drop toward the $612 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $600 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $632 and $625.

The rally comes after a turbulent weekend driven by U.S. and Israeli military activity in the Middle East, which briefly pushed the token below key psychological support. Now back above $2.17, XRP is testing fresh resistance levels with high-volume support holding at $1.97. News Background Geopolitical tensions have gripped global markets, with crypto especially reactive to headlines involving Iran, Israel, and the U.S. XRP’s recent climb comes amid this volatility, showing relative strength despite the uncertain macro backdrop. Trading volumes surged as buyers stepped in at the $1.97 level, setting off a high-momentum breakout that topped out at $2.173. Some analysts now forecast a potential run toward $6 by the end of the month — though others warn a 25% correction to $1.55 remains possible. While sentiment is split, market data shows institutional players are still active. Futures open interest and volume are elevated, and on-chain flows suggest accumulation over distribution. The $2.13–$2.15 zone is now acting as immediate support, and the broader structure appears bullish if it holds. Price Action XRP climbed from $1.967 to $2.173 over the past day, posting a 10.5% range with bullish momentum concentrated in the late session. The decisive breakout came during the 22:00 hour with 217M volume — nearly 3x the average — establishing $2.06 as strong resistance. Buyers first stepped in at $1.97 around 17:00 with 130M in volume, setting the foundation for the surge. Price has since consolidated above $2.13, with $2.154–$2.156 emerging as a new support zone defended by bulls.

Ether ETH, Solana's SOL SOL, and Cardano's ADA ADA surged around 7% in the past 24 hours. Ether climbed back above $2,400, while SOL and ADA rose over support at $140 and 50 cents respectively. Crypto trading volumes also rebounded after a brutal Sunday-Monday flush that saw nearly $600 million in long liquidations. XRP XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB BNB, and dogecoin DOGE also rose between 4%-6%. The broader CoinDesk 20 CD20}], a liquid index tracking the largest tokens, rose over 3%. The bounce followed a wave of macro relief. Brent crude slipped 1.8% and S&P 500 futures turned positive, even as the ceasefire lacked formal confirmation from either government. But traders were quick to rotate back into altcoins, betting on a volatility cooldown. “We think the market will soon normalize and move on from the latest geopolitical episode,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. “But we’re more worried about a bigger shake-out to stop out recent longs… and the negative FOMO signals from all the public companies looking to establish new BTC treasuries as their latest financial engineering gig,” Fan added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin {{BTC continues to consolidate near $105,000, testing overhead resistance as institutional flows hold steady. Some see structural strength in the asset's performance over the past few weeks. “Its ability to hold above $100K underscores resilience amid geopolitical and macro volatility,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, told CoinDesk. “As institutional inflows and ETF demand rebound, BTC’s decoupling from traditional risk-off signals suggests a maturing role as a macro hedge in the long term,” Lu added. Still, some traders caution that the next leg of the move could be driven by profit-taking, especially in overheated tokens, such as ether.

But as the world waits with bated breath for a full mainnet release and practical token use, it is beginning to be asked if Pi Coin will ever reach the $2 mark in 2025. Meanwhile, though, another project— Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) —is quickly growing in favor as the new go-to among meme token investors. Learn more about $APORK here. Pi Network Booms to 60M Users Pi Network’s growth in users is undeniable. As of mid-June 2025, more than 60 million accounts actively mine using its mobile-first platform. The app is still one of the most downloaded crypto apps in the world, and its low-barrier entry (clicking a button each day) has promoted mass adoption, particularly in the emerging markets. Though it is large, Pi Coin is still not listed on mainstream exchanges such as Binance or Coinbase. So, how do I buy or sell Pi? Trading is relegated to unofficial OTC (over-the-counter) markets through IOU tokens and these IOUs tend to go from $25–$40 per Pi, though specialists predict a realistic launch price will be more in the range of $0.50–$0.55 after the token is actually listed. And it is estimated to reach $1 soon enough. When is Mainnet launching? — necessary to facilitate real token use — is still on the waitlist. KYC verification is being carried out, and community threads indicate that identity validation and ecosystem integration lags are slowing progress. The Pi Core Team has not yet made any public commitment to a launch schedule, keeping even early miners guessing. In spite of this, the sentiment for the market is cautiously optimistic. If exchange listings happen and utility increases (e.g., merchant adoption or DeFi usage), Pi Coin might trend up toward $1 or even $2 by 2025. With little on-chain visibility and no existing liquidity, however, the short-term potential is constrained. Earn 60,000% APY, The earlier you get in the higher the APY – Buy $APORK Why $APORK Is Gaining Momentum As Pi Network investors await tradability, there’s an opportunity for high growth in Angry Pepe Fork ($APORK) — a meme coin built with actual token utility and well-designed tokenomics that reward early users. Where Pi is closed and speculative, $APORK is open, live, and rewarding participation today. The Differentiators: CommunityFi Mechanics: $APORK rewards users for activities such as retweets, referrals, and Telegram engagement. All contributions are value-add and token-earning. GambleFi Utility : Players can bet and win tokens through on-chain gaming. Part of each prize pool is burnt in perpetuity, lowering overall supply over time. Multi-Chain Launch: In contrast to the majority of meme coins, $APORK launches on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, providing broad reach and low-fee access from launch. Its token model is transparent and investor-centric. Its maximum total supply is 1.9 billion , and with burning tokens on every jackpot payout, supply diminishes over time. Its presale price is $0.0269, and 380 million of its tokens are reserved for early birds. Its soft cap is $4 million, and the hard cap is $10 million, which is a feasible range that indicates potential gain when the project booms. Early stakers can stake in the presale for returns of over 10,000% APY, based on entry level. Already, more than $240,000 has been raised in days since release — with investor activity rising exponentially as word spreads. Together with clear supply, early staking returns, and viral participation mechanisms, $APORK becomes a high-potential alternative in the meme coin market today. Last But Not Least: Pi Has Scale, $APORK Has Speed Pi Network’s size is stunning — 60 million users is no joke — but until mainnet launch and exchange listings arrive, its token is locked in speculation. By contrast, $APORK is already creating liquidity, establishing community incentives, and getting ready for multi-chain deployment.

While the rest of the crypto market has been stagnant in recent weeks, BCH has been roaring, rising 98% since its April 2025 low point. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is currently trying to break the $500 resistance point. The rotation into BCH reflects changing market dynamics, as investors look for fresh growth elsewhere. Recently, the US Federal Reserve announced that it would maintain interest rates steady, which reflects steadiness in the US economy. So far, Bitcoin Cash has gained over 11% in the past week, with the climb to $500 still expected. While BCH has been going against the grain in the crypto market in recent weeks, investors are looking elsewhere for massive growth. One of the options they have turned to so far is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which analysts expect to deliver some explosive growth. According to the latest analysts, MUTM tokens could rise by as much as 27x when they go live. Not wanting to miss out on these bombastic gains, the project’s presale has seen an escalation in participation. Let us dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and the stellar performance of its presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi miracle Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project built on the firm foundation of utility. The project is built as a decentralized lending protocol where users can participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders, they can deposit their assets into the pools to earn interest. The interest rates in the pools are based on the utilization rate. As more borrowers take loans from a pool, the interest rate rises. That attracts more borrowers seeking out higher yields, while at the same time, it pushes borrowers to repay their loans. This process creates a positive feedback loop that ensures optimal capital efficiency. To protect liquidity on the protocol and ensure the long-term health of the ecosystem, all loans on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are over-collateralized. That simply means that borrowers have to deposit collateral of a higher value than the loan they plan to take. The overcollateralization is based on various characteristics of an asset. For instance, the more volatile an asset is, the higher the level of collateralization is needed. That ensures that there is enough of a buffer in which liquidators can step in to stabilize a position. When a loan position becomes undercollateralized, liquidators step in and purchase the debt at a discount. The discount they receive is used to incentivize them to act fast and stabilize the ecosystem. Asset vetting on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance also has strict token vetting measures in place to ensure that only high-quality assets make it onto the protocol. That helps to minimize exposure to unstable assets that could impact the long-term health of the ecosystem. For instance, if the design of an asset could introduce new code complexity that increases the overall gas fees for other users, it will not be added. Additionally, some assets may be added, but only limited to being used for borrowing, and not as collateral. That ensures that they cannot be used to siphon liquidity from the protocol unfairly. Mutuum Finance could also impose caps on some assets. These caps ensure that, in case of increased volatility, the potential impact that they have is limited. Additionally, caps serve as an elegant solution to the potential problem of infinite asset minting that can be used to drain liquidity from the protocol. Besides the strict asset vetting, Mutuum Finance will have a top-tier team that will monitor the protocol and intervene when the need arises. These interventions can include pausing activity related to a given asset until it can be interrogated further. T o augment these efforts, they will launch a bug bounty program where experts will be incentivized to hunt for vulnerabilities on the protocol and report them to the internal team. The MUTM token presale Mutuum Finance is currently in the middle of an extremely successful presale. So far, over $11 million has been raised in the ongoing presale, which is currently in phase 5. Tokens in the current phase are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. Around 12,400 unique buyers have secured their tokens, with the figure expected to continue rising at an accelerated pace. According to the latest forecasts, MUTM tokens could rise by 27x. That means that a $1,700 investment in the presale at the current price could grow to over $45,000. With such a lucrative forecast, there is no reason to miss this presale. To sweeten the deal, tokens in the current phase are going for a 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. Do not let this awesome opportunity slip through your fingers.

They announced key milestones, including Pi Domains, Pi Ventures, and the FurityPi game. Additionally, they released updates on the user base. The team revealed network growth, with over 3 million new Pioneers joining the mainnet. According to the update, there are now over 13 million users, and they have activated over 400k nodes. The Ecosystem interface has also undergone upgrades, and the launch of the Pi Ad Network for Pi App developers. Additionally, they released several apps. However, there are still concerns from the community. For instance, PI has not secured a listing on a major exchange. There are also no mainnet dApps yet. Another point of contention is the PI coin price, which has been moving sideways. Amid the price of PI coins stalling, investors are looking for growth elsewhere, and one of the options they are turning to is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project is turning heads in the ecosystem as investors make positive forecasts about its future. According to the latest analysis, MUTM tokens could soar 3,300% once they go live. These positive forecasts are driven by the massive utility of the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. In a market increasingly focused on utility over hype, the MUTM tokens could be your biggest winner of 2025. A deep dive into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that allows users to participate as lenders or borrowers. As lenders, they can deposit their assets into a pool on the protocol to earn interest. The interest rate that they earn on their assets is based on the pool utilization rate. When the utilization rate increases, it pushes up the interest rate, which causes borrowers to start repaying their loans. At the same time, it incentivizes lenders to deposit more liquidity in the pools to benefit from the rising yields. These actions collectively push up the total liquidity in the pools, which also leads to optimal capital efficiency. To protect liquidity in the pools, the Mutuum Finance protocol requires that all loans be overcollateralized. That means the value of collateral in a loan position must be worth more than the value of the loan it covers. This overcollateralization is required due to the apparent volatility in the crypto market. When a loan falls below the required level of collateralization, it becomes eligible for liquidation. In that situation, liquidators step in and purchase the debt at a discount. The discount is used as an incentive to make them act fast to stabilize the ecosystem. As such, based on the level of instability a position poses to the ecosystem, the discount can be turned up to get liquidators to act with haste. Besides the overcollateralization, Mutuum Finance will use other tools to stabilize the ecosystem. One of these is the use of liquidity rewards, which will see the team offer MUTM token rewards to liquidators to boost liquidity on the protocol. The liquidity rewards program will be reserved for high-quality assets that are in high demand from the crypto market. These will be stable assets like ETH and USDT. In contrast, high volatility assets will be excluded from the program due to the significant challenge of instability that they pose. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans on vetting tokens to protect the long-term liquidity. That vetting process will entail checking the volatility and liquidity of a token, its centralization, and the complexity of the code. As part of that vetting process, assets may be restricted to limited functionality, or they may not be allowed on the protocol at all. Additionally, the team may impose caps on certain assets to limit the possible impact on the long-term health of the ecosystem. In general, every decision taken by the Mutuum Finance team will aim to find a perfect balance between the long-term health of the ecosystem and ensuring mass ecosystem participation. The MUTM token presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has been a roaring success so far. It has raised over $11 million from around 12,400 unique buyers, with this figure growing daily. In the current phase of the presale, tokens are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of 40.01. 47% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have already been sold as investors rush to take advantage of the massive 50% discount on the MUTM tokens based on the $0.06 listing price. A major driver for this presale has been the planned beta version release on the token listing day. The massive 50% discount, coupled with the planned beta version launch, makes the MUTM token presale one of the most exciting growth opportunities of 2025. Do not be left out of this massive opportunity for growth.

The move came amid heightened geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, which triggered broad volatility across crypto markets but failed to derail DOGE’s momentum. The meme coin broke through a long-standing descending trendline, confirming a shift in short-term market structure. Hourly RSI readings recovered from oversold territory, while netflows turned neutral, suggesting that sell-side exhaustion may have run its course. News Background Global markets have been rattled by renewed military activity in the Middle East, with U.S. airstrikes in Iran over the weekend raising risk-off sentiment. Despite the wider crypto selloff, Dogecoin showed relative strength, recovering faster than Bitcoin or Ethereum and pushing past key resistance levels. Technical analysts note that the rally was driven by a sharp increase in trading activity, particularly during the 22:00 UTC hour, when volume surged past 800 million units and price spiked 3.77% in under 60 minutes. The breakout has sparked renewed discussion about a potential retest of the $0.17–$0.18 range if volume remains elevated and global risk sentiment stabilizes. Dogecoin’s network fundamentals also remain intact, with transaction volume and active wallet counts trending higher over the past week. While macro conditions remain fragile, the memecoin’s resilience is capturing renewed attention from traders betting on short-term altcoin rotation. Price Action Dogecoin traded in a broad range from $0.1508 to $0.1632 over the session, ultimately settling around $0.1615. The $0.150 zone acted as a springboard after the asset reached a local bottom following weeks of declining momentum. A clean break above $0.162 resistance has now established a short-term higher high, with $0.165 emerging as the next level to watch. The final hour of the session saw minor consolidation, with DOGE pulling back slightly from intraday highs and forming a potential bull flag above $0.161. Technical Analysis Recap • DOGE posted a 6.56% gain, rising from $0.153 to $0.1632 over 24 hours • Price broke above a descending trendline, confirming bullish breakout • Key support formed at $0.150 after a two-month low, with volume over 800M during rebound • $0.165 now acts as short-term resistance; $0.162 holding as support • RSI has exited oversold conditions; MACD signals a potential continuation • Final-hour pullback remains shallow, indicating healthy consolidation",Markets|AI Market Insights|Dogecoin|News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-24 05:26:01

The scheme is being led by former Coral Capital Holdings executives Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger and Johnathan Pasch. Nasdaq-Listed Company to Be Renamed and Transformed into a BNB-Focused Company According to investor documents reviewed by Bloomberg News, the trio is planning to use an unnamed Nasdaq company to carry out the plan. The fundraising process is expected to be completed this month. After that, the company is planned to be renamed “Build & Build Corporation” and start accumulating BNB directly.

Circle Internet Group has become the largest component of VanEck’s global crypto equity index following a sharp post-IPO stock rally, while decentralized finance protocol Veda has raised $18 million to expand its vault platform. Circle Surges to Top of VanEck’s Crypto ETF as CRCL Stock Rockets 750% Above IPO Price Shares of Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL), the company behind the popular USDC stablecoin, have skyrocketed to dominate VanEck’s MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index (MVDAPP), a benchmark designed to track the largest and most liquid publicly traded companies in the crypto economy. As of Monday, Circle stock represents a commanding 13% of the index — up from roughly 11% last Friday — surpassing even industry mainstays like Coinbase (COIN) and MicroStrategy (MSTR). The increase suggests not only investor confidence in Circle’s explosive public market performance but also the firm’s growing strategic relevance within the broader digital asset sector. VanEck’s MVDAPP index serves as the backbone for its Digital Transformation ETF, a publicly traded fund launched in 2021 that seeks to replicate the performance of crypto-exposed companies. For inclusion, companies must derive at least 50% of their revenue from digital asset-related businesses. The ETF, which currently holds $210 million in net assets, mirrors the index with a 24-stock portfolio that includes Coinbase, Bitcoin-accumulating Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Japanese firm Metaplanet, and Jack Dorsey’s Block. CRCL Stock’s Monumental Rise Post-IPO Circle’s rise to the top of the index is backed by a stunning stock performance following its recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Less than three weeks after going public at an IPO price of $31, CRCL shares surged 167% on their first day and have since climbed over 750%, closing Monday above $263. Shares of Circle extended their rally on Monday, rising more than 11% to $263 (Source: Google Finance ) The company increased the size of its IPO ahead of the debut to accommodate robust institutional demand, a decision that now looks prescient given the stock’s exceptional rally. The gains have positioned Circle as one of the most valuable publicly traded crypto firms in the world. Behind Circle’s market dominance is its flagship product, USD Coin (USDC), a dollar-backed stablecoin that ranks second only to Tether’s USDT in terms of circulation. USDC has increasingly become a core building block in the digital economy, powering everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to centralized exchange settlement layers. Momentum for USDC could accelerate even further if the pending GENIUS Act clears the final stages of legislation in the US Congress. The bill, which aims to establish regulatory clarity for stablecoins, passed the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote of 68–30 and is now under consideration in the House of Representatives. In parallel, Coinbase Derivatives and Nodal Clear announced a partnership to integrate USDC into US-regulated futures markets as eligible collateral, with implementation expected in 2026. This would mark a major step in bridging crypto and traditional finance, giving USDC a pivotal role in collateralized trading. A Bellwether for Crypto’s Institutionalization Circle’s meteoric rise reflects more than just investor appetite — it underscores how the digital asset economy is maturing in the eyes of institutional allocators. The ability of CRCL stock to outperform legacy crypto equities in such a short timeframe signals a shift in focus from pure-play exchanges or mining firms to infrastructure and utility providers. The growing dominance of Circle in VanEck’s ETF also speaks to how important stablecoin issuers have become in shaping the future of finance. As the market evolves from speculative assets to utility-driven frameworks — especially with rising regulatory clarity in the US — Circle appears well-positioned to benefit from a new wave of adoption. Circle’s success is symbolic of a larger trend: the merging of crypto-native innovation with traditional financial instruments. The company’s ascent within VanEck’s ETF portfolio not only highlights investor conviction but may foreshadow a future where regulated stablecoins like USDC serve as the backbone of global payments, trading, and settlement infrastructure. With CRCL stock continuing to gain traction and USDC’s real-world applications expanding, Circle is no longer just a key player in crypto — it’s a central figure in the future of finance. Veda Raises $18M to Fuel Cross-Chain Yield Innovation and Stablecoin Disruption In other news, decentralized finance protocol Veda has secured $18 million in fresh funding to expand its growing footprint in the onchain yield economy, as institutional and retail demand for yield-bearing digital assets accelerates across the crypto landscape. The company announced Monday that the round was led by CoinFund, with major backers including Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Ventures, BitGo, Mantle EcoFund, and GSR, among others. Veda, founded in 2024, provides the infrastructure for issuing cross-chain yield products, most notably yield-bearing stablecoins , a new category of digital assets poised to challenge traditional financial instruments like bank savings accounts and money market funds. The company’s latest raise marks a significant step in scaling its vault platform, which allows asset issuers to tokenize and distribute DeFi products across multiple chains. Veda’s vault protocol supports a range of DeFi use cases, including liquid staking tokens (LSTs), decentralized savings accounts, and synthetic stablecoins with built-in yield mechanisms. It already powers several of the largest vaults in the space, including Ether.fi’s Liquid, Mantle’s cmETH, and the Lombard DeFi Vault. According to data from DeFiLlama, Veda’s total value locked (TVL) has surpassed $3.3 billion, underscoring its rapid growth and adoption. Veda’s total value locked (TVL) has surged since the end of 2024. (Source: DefiLlama ) “Demand for dependable Bitcoin yield is high,” said Sun Raghupathi, Veda’s co-founder and CEO. “But harvesting even a modest few-percent yield is often complex and time-consuming.” To solve this, Veda has partnered with Lombard, a developer focused on liquid-staked Bitcoin using Babylon, an emerging Bitcoin staking layer. This move aims to unlock more efficient and accessible Bitcoin-based yield products — a sector that has long lagged behind Ethereum in DeFi participation due to Bitcoin’s limited programmability. Stablecoins Enter Their “iPhone Moment” The market for stablecoins is already massive — and growing. Tether’s USDT remains the dominant player with nearly $156 billion in circulation, followed by Circle’s USDC, which has a supply exceeding $61 billion, according to RWA.xyz . The stablecoin market leaderboard (Source: RWA.xyz ) But according to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, the market is just getting started. The addition of native yield — especially if programmable and transparent — could provide a compelling value proposition that even the best traditional finance products struggle to match. This is especially true for users in emerging markets or those with limited access to high-yield banking options. Big Names Back Veda’s Vision The $18 million raise drew not only institutional backing but also an impressive list of angel investors, including the co-founders of Anchorage, Ether.fi, and Polygon — all key players in the evolution of blockchain infrastructure and decentralized financial systems. Their participation is a strong endorsement of Veda’s cross-chain strategy and its vision for unlocking passive income opportunities across the crypto spectrum. By enabling asset issuers to create yield-generating instruments — whether backed by staked ETH, tokenized treasuries, or future innovations like liquid Bitcoin — Veda aims to become a foundational layer of the onchain financial system. Traditional financial institutions are already beginning to feel the ripple effects of this shift.

Metaplanet bought another 1,111 BTC this week, boosting its total to 11,111 and bringing it within reach of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The corporate Bitcoin adoption trend is gaining global momentum, with firms in Norway, France, and South Korea also jumping in. Meanwhile, Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream, has dubbed this trend “the new alt season,” and encouraged speculators to shift funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of Bitcoin-holding companies. He believes this wave is a precursor to hyperbitcoinization and a potential $200 trillion Bitcoin market. Despite criticisms from traditional firms like Meta and Microsoft, the enthusiasm surrounding corporate Bitcoin treasuries suggests that there is a transformative shift in how companies view asset diversification and long-term value preservation. Sequans Pushes Into Bitcoin Sequans Communications announced a bold move to raise $384 million to establish a strategic Bitcoin treasury, joining a growing wave of companies betting on Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The IoT semiconductor and module developer plans to raise approximately $195 million through an equity issuance and $189 million via convertible debentures, which could later be converted into company shares. To support this initiative, Sequans is partnering with Swan Bitcoin, a firm that specializes in Bitcoin treasury management. Announcement from Sequans The company's CEO, Georges Karam, explained the long-term investment thesis behind the decision, and called Bitcoin a ”premier asset.” This aligns Sequans with the rising trend among corporations looking to diversify their treasuries with Bitcoin holdings. Just in the past few days, firms like Nakamoto Holdings and Metaplanet expanded their Bitcoin reserves. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that over 240 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, which is almost double from several weeks ago. Collectively, these firms control roughly 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) However, the strategy is not without its critics. Major corporations like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft steered clear of Bitcoin treasury allocations, due to its notorious volatility and the still changing regulatory landscape. For these firms, preserving capital is a priority, and the risk profile of Bitcoin doesn't align with more traditional treasury management objectives. Despite these concerns, Michael Saylor’s Strategy is still a benchmark in the corporate Bitcoin landscape. With a stash of 592,345 BTC valued at over $60 billion, the company continues to lead in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, often leveraging convertible debt to fund its acquisitions. Now that Sequans joined the ranks of Bitcoin-holding companies, the trend of corporate adoption could reshape how institutions approach treasury diversification. Metaplanet Buys 1,111 More BTC Metaplanet, which is Japan’s leading corporate holder of Bitcoin, also announced on Monday that it bought an additional 1,111 BTC , pushing its total holdings to 11,111 Bitcoin. The acquisition was shared in a regulatory filing , and puts the company within close range of Tesla’s 11,509 BTC. The latest purchase cost the company approximately 17.26 billion Japanese yen, or about $117 million, with an average purchase price just below $105,500 per coin. Although Bitcoin was trading slightly lower at just under $102,000 at the time of the announcement, Metaplanet’s overall average cost basis is still favorable at $95,560 per Bitcoin, keeping the firm well-positioned even in the face of short-term market fluctuations. This move happened after Metaplanet’s previous acquisition of 1,112 BTC just one week earlier, which brought its holdings to 10,000 BTC and cemented its place as the eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. After briefly slipping to ninth due to an increase in holdings by mining company Hut 8, Metaplanet now regained its eighth-place standing . Top 10 largest Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Tesla is the next target in the rankings, with only 398 more BTC than Metaplanet. This gap could be closed in the coming weeks given the company’s recent momentum. Above Tesla, the next holder is CleanSpark, with 12,502 BTC. Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation is also part of the broader trend among public companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Parataxis Holdings also entered the space with the launch of a Bitcoin-native treasury platform aimed at the South Korean public market. In Norway, K33 recently announced plans to raise approximately $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC. Meanwhile, the Norwegian Block Exchange saw its stock price soar by more than 138% after declaring its intent to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. France-based The Blockchain Group also joined the movement by acquiring 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. As more companies embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the trend appears to be gaining unstoppable momentum. Bitcoin Treasuries Are the New Alt Season Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and inventor of Hashcash, believes the growing trend of public companies adopting Bitcoin treasuries has become the new altcoin season for speculators. On Monday, he stated that “Bitcoin treasury season is the new ALT SZN,” and encouraged investors to move funds from altcoins into Bitcoin or shares of companies accumulating Bitcoin. According to Back, firms are acquiring BTC aggressively, often through methods like convertible note offerings, to increase their Bitcoin per share. This is a strategy that is drawing the attention of market participants looking for stronger exposure to Bitcoin. His comments come during a huge wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption, with the number of public companies holding BTC doubling since June 5. Back sees this trend as a precursor to “hyperbitcoinization,” a scenario where Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies as the dominant global financial system. He previously suggested this shift could turn Bitcoin into a $200 trillion market opportunity, led by treasury-heavy institutions and early government adopters. While the trend is accelerating, it also introduces some risks. For example, Metaplanet saw its Bitcoin premium soar to over $596,000 in late May, indicating that shareholders were paying more than five times the market value of Bitcoin through its stock. This raised questions about the speculative overvaluation of such companies. Nonetheless, Back firmly believes that Bitcoin-focused firms may provide a way out for investors who have suffered losses in altcoins. In a response on X , he suggested that switching to Bitcoin via treasury companies could help these investors recoup some of their altcoin-related losses. Even though altcoins have struggled to gain momentum, some are also seeing institutional traction. Interactive Strength , a Nasdaq-listed fitness equipment company, disclosed its intent to raise $500 million to start a token treasury centered on Fetch.ai. This means that the concept of crypto treasuries is expanding beyond just Bitcoin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-24 05:33:37

According to a June 24 report by Reuters, Trump said both countries had agreed to end hostilities after a 12-day conflict, though Israel has yet to confirm the agreement, and missiles were reportedly launched from Iran early Tuesday. Markets reacted swiftly. After suffering losses over the weekend due to concerns about a wider conflict in the Middle East, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization increased 2.4% to $3.35 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed 3.7% to $105,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ) surged 7% to $2,396. Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ) also posted strong gains of 7% and 6%, respectively. Alternative’s Crypto Fear & Greed Index jumped 18 points to 65, marking a return to “Greed” territory. Other market indicators suggest improving sentiment. Data from Coinglass shows the average relative strength index across the market rose to 58, a neutral level. Open interest rose by 4% to $135 billion, while total liquidations dropped to $481 million, down 24% from the previous day.

Bitcoin fell nearly 4% to $98,615 at the time, with Ethereum and Solana dropping up to 10%. The attack also led to nearly $1 billion in crypto long- liquidations and a $40 billion loss in total market capitalization. Traders now appear cautiously optimistic. Trump claimed the ceasefire was brokered in coordination with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and mediated through Qatari and U.S. diplomatic channels. While Iranian officials suggested a willingness to pause attacks if Israel halted further aggression, they stopped short of a full commitment. In traditional markets, the ceasefire news also boosted sentiment. After-hours trading saw a 0.4% increase in S&P 500 futures, while oil prices fell from recent highs as concerns about disruptions to Gulf shipping routes subsided. Crypto markets seem to be pricing in a de-escalation for the time being, but traders are still on the lookout for any new developments. The rally might depend on whether the ceasefire holds in the days ahead, as geopolitical risk is still high and neither party has officially confirmed a ceasefire.

Crypto Market Rebound on Ceasefire and Fed Bets The sudden recovery wasn’t just about peace talks. Traders are now betting on U.S. interest rate cuts, with the CME FedWatch tool showing a 53% chance that rates could fall to 3.75% or lower by November. That’s good news for risk-on assets like Bitcoin, which thrive on looser monetary policy. Despite the recent $193 million in long liquidations, Bitcoin’s open interest remains robust at $68 billion. This signals continued institutional interest, even in the face of macro turbulence. Bitcoin Hashrate Dips 8%, But Analysts Stay Calm No this is not because Iran is secretly mining large swathes of Bitcoin using nuclear energy.

However, analysts like Daniel Batten see no reason to panic.

Combined with its $2.3 billion in fresh capital and crypto ambitions, the company’s moves are adding to the overall bullish tone in the market. Bitcoin Price : $110K in Sight? With institutional flows strong, geopolitical fears easing, and Trump’s ETF push catching eyes, the road to $110,000 might not be far off. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s next move. Bitcoin’s rally got a major push after Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy dropped a massive $1 billion into BTC. Moreover, this rebound has sparked fresh momentum across the altcoin market too, lifting coins like Ethereum, XRP, Cardano, Polkadot, and even Pi Network. The market saw it as a strong signal, since big players are doubling down on Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Crypto market reacted sharply to the news of military operations against Iran’s nuclear sites. Bitcoin dropped below $103,000, and major altcoins fell over 9% in 24 hours. The sell-off was mainly due to increased risk aversion, fears of rising oil prices, and concerns that inflation might prevent the Fed from cutting interest rates. Liquidations surged by 38%, exceeding $682 million. Is this a good buying opportunity, or should I wait for more stability? Some users see this as a buying opportunity, especially for those who follow a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. One commenter noted that Bitcoin often drops during geopolitical tensions but tends to bounce back harder than traditional markets. However, others warn that volatility could continue if tensions escalate, so caution is advise What are people doing with their crypto during the crisis? Some are moving funds into cold storage or shifting from high-risk altcoins to Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are seen as more resilient. Others are taking profits or waiting for further dips before re-entering the market. Will the market recover quickly now that there’s a ceasefire? Sentiment is turning positive after the ceasefire announcement. Bitcoin rebounded above $106,000, and Ethereum surged 9%. Many expect further recovery, especially with expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts and continued institutional inflows. However, volatility remains high, and some users are still cautious about re-entering the market",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 05:36:06

The man was taken into custody on Sunday by the Shin Bet security service and Tel Aviv police. According to investigators, he had been in contact with Iranian operatives for several months and allegedly carried out intelligence-gathering tasks at their request. Local outlets reported these included photographing the homes of Israeli public officials, documenting military bases, and spray-painting graffiti as instructed. Crypto Allegedly Used to Fund Espionage Activities for Iran Authorities say the suspect received thousands of dollars in virtual currency. During a search of his home, they seized computers and digital storage devices. These are believed to have been used to communicate with his Iranian handlers. He appeared in court on Monday. The Tel Aviv Magistrate’s Court extended his detention until June 26. Meanwhile, investigators are still reviewing the materials seized from his home. They are working to determine the full extent of his activities. In a joint statement, the Shin Bet and Israeli police warned of ongoing efforts by Iranian intelligence and affiliated terror groups to recruit Israelis. They noted that these recruitment attempts often begin through social media. As a result, they urged the public to avoid any contact with foreign actors and to report suspicious outreach immediately. Security officials vowed to treat such cases with the “utmost severity,” warning that Israeli citizens caught aiding hostile nations would face the full force of the law. Iran Tightens Crypto Controls After $90M Exchange Breach The arrest comes at a time of heightened tension between Iran and Israel , with both countries engaged in a long-running shadow war that spans cyberattacks, intelligence operations and regional proxy conflicts. The digital nature of this latest case highlights how cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used to mask payments in covert operations. Just last week, Iran’s central bank moved to restrict operating hours for domestic crypto exchanges after a cyberattack drained more than $90m from Nobitex, the country’s largest trading platform. That directive, aimed at improving oversight, shows how digital assets are becoming central to both financial infrastructure and geopolitical maneuvering.

However, caution quickly emerged as Iran's foreign minister denied a US-brokered deal, insisting Iran would only halt attacks if Israel stopped its airstrikes. Meanwhile, financial markets showed little reaction to Iran's non-fatal strike on a US base in Qatar, finding further relief in Tehran's decision to avoid targeting the strategic Strait of Hormuz.

Coinbase Assets announced on June 23 that support for Sonic ( S ) will go live “on or after 9AM PT on June 24” across Coinbase and Coinbase Exchange. Trading for the S-USD pair will launch in phases once liquidity conditions are met, and transfers will only be supported on the Sonic network. https://twitter.com/coinbaseassets/status/1937176599658467498?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Market activity immediately increased as a result of the announcement. Sonic’s trading volume surged sharply, rising more than 76% to $266.6 million. According to Coinglass data , open interest has increased by 9.57% to $25.47 million. The rise in open interest indicates greater speculative interest and possible upside conviction, even though the volume of derivatives stayed largely unchanged. Despite the recent gains, S remains nearly 30% lower over the past month and still sits 68% below its all-time high of $1.03 recorded in January 2025. A Coinbase listing typically translates into greater accessibility and broader market appeal, especially for retail users who prefer fiat onramps. In addition, it boosts liquidity and generally strengthens the credibility of the project. You might also like: Sonic Labs announces GSR as the official market maker for S SonicStrategy chief executive officer Mitchell Demeter commented that the listing may open doors to institutional inclusion, with S potentially being considered for managed portfolios and custodial products. That credibility may be further strengthened by Sonic’s expanding ecosystem. Sonic recently kicked off its Season 2 airdrop on June 18, distributing $82 million worth of S tokens to active community members, including Sonic Point holders, NFT minters, and Sonic Arcade users. The initiative aims to increase token distribution and user activity. On June 19, the Sonic network also merged with the decentralized finance aggregator 1inch, enabling low-cost swaps and cross-chain transactions. More Sonic users can now join 1inch’s well-established DeFi platform thanks to the move. From a technical perspective, the S token is showing tentative signs of recovery following weeks of steady decline. The price is currently testing the middle Bollinger Band around $0.338 after rising from recent lows around $0.25. If price breaches this level with high volume, it could indicate trend confirmation. Sonic price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Momentum indicators are also beginning to change, with the MACD now positive. The 10-day moving averages have turned supportive, but the 20- to 50-day averages still serve as resistance to the general trend. Although the relative strength index has moved out of oversold territory and reached 41.8, it has not yet entered bullish territory. If the Coinbase listing encourages more inflows and retail participation, S may attempt to break through resistance at $0.34 and potentially move toward $0.42, a level last seen in May. The token might, however, retrace toward $0.29 or lower if it is unable to hold onto its current level, especially if post-listing enthusiasm wanes or overall market weakness persists.

Per the official announcement , ProCap Financial will hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It will offer services including trading, lending and capital markets, all denominated in Bitcoin. Further, the $750 million funding includes $235 million in convertible debt, with the remaining amount comprising equity. “It is time to get to work,” said podcast host Pompliano. In a reply to Strategy’s CEO, Michael Saylor, he said, “Your idea is spreading globally as people realize the value of Bitcoin.” Indeed, inspired by Strategy (previously MicroStrategy), which currently holds 592,345, after adding 245 Bitcoins on Monday , several public companies are turning into Bitcoin proxies. Intersection of Bitcoin and Traditional Finance However, according to Pompliano, ProCap is pushing beyond that model. He said that the company would build a financial services platform on top of it, besides accumulating Bitcoin. “Our objective is to develop a platform that will not only acquire bitcoin for our balance sheet, but will also implement risk-mitigated solutions to generate revenue and profits from our bitcoin holdings,” he said. Additionally, equity investors will have immediate exposure from day one, the announcement added. “ProCap Financial aims to become the leading financial services firm at the intersection of bitcoin and traditional finance.” Pompliano told CNBC that the goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution, which resonates very differently with capital allocators.

All he shared was a single emoji, but that was enough to get the XRP community buzzing. — Arthur Britto (@ahbritto) June 23, 2025 David Schwartz, Ripple’s CTO also confirmed that Britto’s post on social media was authentic and not the result of a hack or account compromise. The Man Behind the Ledger Britto is one of the three original creators of the XRP Ledger, alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb. While McCaleb went on to build Stellar and Schwartz became Ripple’s CTO, Britto stayed out of the spotlight. Britto has long been linked to the bold statement that “XRP was designed to reach $10,000.” The famous quote appears to originate from a YouTube video published in 2019, which claimed that Britto made this prediction around 2017. He envisioned a global network that could connect everyone on the planet. To achieve that, he and the team designed the XRP Ledger to be fast, extremely cheap, and scalable enough to support billions of users. In a 2013 internal memo, Britto had made it clear that XRP was not about hype or price speculation.“The value of XRP is probably less important than the spread. I expect most people and institutions using the ledger to ignore XRP altogether.” While Britto stayed silent, the XRPL has evolved into a powerful network. It now supports smart contracts, CBDCs, institutional stablecoins like RLUSD, and is widely used for DeFi, NFTs, and cross-border payments. A Surge in Activity and Key Signals Britto’s return comes just as XRP Ledger recorded 1.5 million transactions in 24 hours — its highest in four months. At the same time, several major signals are lining up: Record on-chain activity, Ripple IPO rumors, and there are also signs of a new bull market. The Federal Reserve also recently announced that it will no longer include “reputational risk” as a factor in how banks are examined. This clears a path for banks to engage more freely with digital assets like XRP. This regulatory shift, the emerging catalysts, and remarks like these hint at something bigger happening behind the scenes. It could be upcoming technology upgrades, insider developments, new global liquidity partnerships, or well-timed strategic moves in response to growing institutional interest.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 05:52:19

Here’s why. Bitcoin CBD Suggests Build Up Of Supply In This Range In a new post on X, Glassnode has discussed about a potentially significant zone for Bitcoin based on the Cost Basis Distribution. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) is an indicator that measures the amount of the BTC supply that investors last purchased or transferred at the various price levels. As is visible in the above graph, there is a dense supply zone located between $97,000 to $98,000. Generally, investors are quite sensitive to retests of their cost basis, so a large amount of them (or alternatively, a few large holders) having their acquisition level inside a narrow range could make retests of it significant for Bitcoin.

They may do so believing that the same level would end up proving profitable again in the future and the retrace is just a ‘dip.’ The cryptocurrency suffered a plunge yesterday and nearly touched this region. Since then, however, things have turned around for the asset and it has gained some distance over it once more. In the event that the decline does continue, which may not be too unexpected given the volatile geopolitical situation at the moment, the zone could end up acting as the next true pivot for Bitcoin, according to the analytics firm. While the CBD tells us where the cryptocurrency’s supply is concentrated, it doesn’t contain any information about who bought or sold at those price levels. Glassnode’s behavioral cohorts, investor groups divided on the basis of their behavior, solve this problem. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by these holder cohorts over the past few years: There are five of these behavior groups. First Buyers (green) include the investors who are buying Bitcoin for the very first time. As displayed in the chart, the supply of this group has been on the rise, indicating fresh demand has been coming in. Momentum Buyers (blue) are those that capitalize on market momentum by buying during uptrends. On the opposite spectrum are the Conviction Buyers (purple), who buy despite falling prices. Finally, there are the Loss Sellers (red) and Profit Takers (yellow), who correspond to investors exiting at a loss and profit, respectively. During the past couple of weeks, the former cohort has seen an increase of 29%, a sign that weak hands have been capitulating.

Some are cutting losses – others are actively lowering their cost basis.” BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,900, down more than 4% in the last seven days.

The remarks come at a time when XRP was facing significant downward pressure, with CoinMarketCap data showing a price downturn. Vet opened his statement by noting that “too many here are victims of their own investment,” alluding to the emotional and reactionary behavior observed among some XRP investors when prices move sharply. He called on the community to reflect on their foundational belief in the XRP Ledger, a technology stack that he believes has endured numerous challenges in the industry. The Role of an Informed Thesis in Navigating Volatility Vet’s central message focused on the importance of developing a personal, research-backed investment thesis. He argued that the XRP Ledger has proven its durability, having weathered multiple crises and targeted attacks over time. According to him, investors must not only believe in the system’s resilience but also prepare themselves mentally to withstand temporary market downturns. “The XRP Ledger is here to stay,” he said, adding, “Just make sure you do too. But how?” He continued by explaining that investors who find themselves losing sleep during periods of market turbulence are likely misaligned in their approach. He believes that genuine conviction in XRP and the Ledger must stem from rigorous self-education and familiarity with its technology and use cases. In his words, “In the process of forming a strong thesis you gain knowledge about the XRP Ledger, its intricacies, role of XRP, TradFi, crypto and much more.” He added that this process helps refine expectations, creating a mental resilience that can withstand temporary losses while maintaining long-term vision. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Knowledge Over Token Accumulation A key point in Vet’s statement is his call for prioritizing knowledge acquisition over simply accumulating XRP. He described education as “absolutely key” and emphasized that understanding the ecosystem should take precedence. Without this foundation, he warned, investors would be left at the mercy of “flavor of the week news, volatility, drama, worries and FUD.” He concluded his remarks by restating that lacking this groundwork leaves individuals vulnerable. “You become a victim of your own investment,” he reiterated, stressing that discipline, understanding, and clarity are critical in enduring volatile cycles. Community Reflection on Long-Term Vision In response to Vet’s commentary, X user Grape offered a personal anecdote comparing his XRP investment outlook to his early experience with Tesla (TSLA). He noted that in both cases, the strength of the underlying technology and leadership were key factors in his decision to hold through difficult periods. Grape stated, “I followed the tech, studied it, trusted Elon’s as a visionary, held firm when things looked grim, and was well rewarded.” He added that he sees a similar pattern now with XRP, praising the robustness of the XRP Ledger, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s leadership, and the potential for future adoption. As XRP navigates its current downturn, Vet’s remarks appear aimed at shifting the conversation toward self-responsibility and informed conviction, suggesting that long-term participation in the XRP ecosystem must be built on more than price speculation.

Norway’s Labor government plans to temporarily ban the construction of new crypto mining data centers that use energy-intensive “proof-of-work” systems, according to Reuters. Proof-of-work systems are a key part of Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, and are used to secure the network. If approved, the ban is expected to come into effect in the fall of 2025. The government's main goal is to preserve the country's electricity capacity for more efficient and productive sectors. “Cryptocurrency mining consumes a lot of energy and contributes little in terms of employment or income to local communities,” Norwegian Minister of Digitalization Karianne Tung said in a statement. Tung also noted that this move is a clear indication of the government’s intention to limit cryptocurrency mining in Norway as much as possible. Related News: Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Announces Both an Airdrop and Listing Norway has long been a favorite of bitcoin miners looking for low-cost, clean energy thanks to its abundant renewable hydropower. Companies like Kryptovault, near Oslo, operate data centers that consume up to 40 MW of power and recycle the heat to dry wood or heat buildings. But despite the renewable energy infrastructure, the need for continuous and high-capacity energy from these mining facilities is increasingly considered by regulators as a waste of resources that should be directed to more efficient areas such as industry, heating or artificial intelligence data processing. However, Norway only has a proportional impact of 0.74% in terms of hashrate, the measure of Bitcoin mining, and is ranked as the 11th most mined country. *This is not investment advice.

And yes, this seems to take aim straight at Donald Trump’s growing crypto ventures. What Is the COIN Act? Officially called the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, the bill proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or promoting any kind of digital asset. This includes meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins, which have become popular ways for public figures to build wealth. Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 If passed, it would prevent not only the president and vice president, but also members of Congress and senior executive officials from endorsing or sponsoring any kind of digital asset project. Why Now? Schiff Points to Trump’s Crypto Profits This legislation is a direct response to Donald Trump’s growing presence in the crypto market. In 2024 alone, Trump reportedly earned over $57 million from token sales and crypto-related ventures. He’s also involved in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs — all of which raise concerns about conflicts of interest. Schiff argues that allowing presidents to profit from these markets while in office could blur ethical lines and compromise decision-making. What the Bill Would Do The COIN Act would cover not just the president but also senior executive officials and members of Congress, including their immediate families. Key features include: A ban on creating or promoting crypto assets Mandatory disclosure for digital asset sales over $1,000 Penalties for violations: profits forfeited and up to 5 years in prison Schiff’s Change of Heart? Interestingly, Schiff supported the GENIUS Act just last week—a bill aimed at setting rules for stablecoins but which left out restrictions for presidents and vice presidents. Now, Schiff seems to be correcting that omission with the COIN Act. So far, nine Senate Democrats have backed the bill. Trump’s Crypto Rise Continues Despite the political pushback, Trump’s crypto activity shows no signs of slowing. He’s involved in everything from Bitcoin mining to launching memecoins and ETFs. His company, TMTG, recently gained SEC approval tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. With 2025 shaping up to be even bigger for crypto and politics, Schiff’s COIN Act could become a major turning point—if it can pass in a Republican-controlled Congress.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 06:11:24

According to a June 24 disclosure , the Tokyo-based firm said the new funding will accelerate the next phase of its Bitcoin ( BTC ) acquisition campaign, including the implementation of its “555 Million Plan” revealed earlier this month. The funds will be used to purchase more Bitcoin, supporting Metaplanet’s goal of acquiring 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, or 1% of the capped supply. Metaplanet Treasury Corp, established in Florida in May 2025, serves as the company’s operational hub for U.S.-based treasury activity. The firm claims that the U.S. market’s institutional infrastructure, deep liquidity, and transparent regulations make it an excellent place to execute. Miami in particular was picked due to its pro-Bitcoin stance and growing reputation as a digital asset hub. This $5 billion capital contribution is expected to be funded through the exercise of newly issued stock acquisition rights. While Metaplanet emphasized there would be no change to the previously disclosed use of proceeds, it noted that any material financial impact would be disclosed in due course.

The company has become one of the biggest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world and has quickly grown its Bitcoin treasury by issuing convertible bonds and equity. It is now the eighth-largest holder globally, surpassing firms such as Coinbase and Hut 8. So far this year, Metaplanet’s stock has increased by more than 300%. Analysts have, however, noted that there is an increasing premium built into the price of its shares. Some estimates place the price of Bitcoin at between $596,000 and $759,000 per coin, which is significantly higher than current market rates. This premium raises questions regarding sustainability and dilution risk, but it also reflects investors’ desire for indirect Bitcoin exposure through equity markets.

Despite positive legal momentum and gradual adoption, XRP remains in what analysts are calling technical limbo, with no strong signal of breakout or breakdown in sight. But while XRP moves sideways, a lesser-known project is quietly gaining ground. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a potential standout in the current cycle. Mutuum Finance, which cost only $0.03 in its presale, has already risen 200%, making it one of the hottest new crypto tokens this quarter. The project has already acquired over 12,400 investors who have chipped in $11.1 million while the presale is ongoing. Investors participating in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will enjoy a 100% return on investment when it goes live at $0.06. As traders look beyond legacy tokens for higher short-term potential, Mutuum Finance could be one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in before Q4, especially for those asking what crypto to buy now in a consolidating market. XRP faces critical test near $2.30 as altcoin spotlight shifts XRP is trading at $2.14 forming a triangular consolidation between the significant points of between $1.79 and $2.34, a factor that indicates that there is no tech area to regard the token. Analyst Michael XBT, who correctly forecasted a rally in XRP before, comments that this trend has developed within a few months and a definite breakout, in either direction towards about $2.34 or down towards less than $1.80, might determine the next trend. Still, other bearish indicators are in place such as a slight downtrend with crypto sentiment being cautious in the broader macro-related concerns. On total, the current situation of XRP is technical limbo slightly under the level of $2.50, as the possible movement would be either influenced by the volume-based breakout or breakdown. In the meantime, there is also a spike of interest in new altcoins, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Game-changer: Mutuum Finance disrupts DeFi lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is revolutionizing a new generation lending platform where users retain full ownership of their assets and passively diversify to optimize the earning potential using a flexible safe system. The system is an effective dual-lending system that combines the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model uses a smart contract to control lending pools whose interest rates are floating. The system is made responsive to real-time market conditions, a factor that makes returns to lenders more certain and borrowers financially sound. In the meantime, there are also the like of the P2P model which completely excludes middlemen and allows the user to agree on terms among themselves. That sort of setup of direct lending is particularly helpful with less stable assets such as those of meme coins since flexibility and control take priority there. Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance presale is underway, $11M+ raised Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale became a record by raising over $11.1 million, attracting over 12,400 token holders. It is currently on Phase 5 investor confidence continues to grow as the platform distinguishes itself from short-term meme coins. Mutuum Finance stablecoin and CertiK audit In yet another step to further build its ecosystem Mutuum Finance is soon to launch a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Contrary to algorithmic stablecoins which have been challenged by price stability problems Mutuum Finance’s stablecoin is to be backed by real assets. The platform has also undergone a security audit by CertiK one of the most known names in blockchain security. XRP is stuck below $2.50 with no clear breakout, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 867,700 followers on the social media platform X that he’s long-term bullish on Bitcoin, and he thinks dips below the six-figure price level are golden opportunities to stack more BTC. “I bought 25 BTC to start to scale in. Spot, of course. But I think the biggest area I want to buy is around $94,000 if given, where I would go pretty heavy. I think in the next few years we are going much, much higher regardless. In the short term, it’s hard to say. The chart looks not ideal. I see that area as current value, however. Of course, I was hoping for us to see $120,000+ at the recent highs. It just didn’t happen. We don’t always get what we want.” Source: Pentoshi/X While the trader thinks that Bitcoin will soar over a long arc of time, he points out that macro uncertainties and geopolitical tensions could drive BTC to lower levels in the short term. “I don’t suggest following me into this at all, there’s a TON of uncertainty. And we likely do go lower. My time frames likely differ from yours. I mostly focus on broader, higher time frames than the minute-to-minute stuff. I would say odds are higher we do go lower for those looking to actually knife catch.” As for the catalyst that will fuel Bitcoin’s ascent in the coming years, Pentoshi says the debasement of the US dollar will drive people to dump their fiat currency in favor of BTC.

46669126,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=754164,1750748700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46669126.jpeg,"These 5 Coins Will Outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Delivering 15,000% Returns by Market Peak in 2026",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/these-5-coins-will-outperform-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-delivering-15000-returns-by-market-peak-in-2026/,"June 2025 — Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the twin pillars of the crypto ecosystem, but their scale now limits the kind of exponential returns seen in previous cycles. While they continue to lead institutional adoption and ecosystem development, many investors are eyeing a new wave of high-upside tokens with the potential to 15x, 150x—even 15000%—by the 2026 peak. In this list, we spotlight five standout altcoins—led by Little Pepe (LILPEPE) and including Solana, Dogecoin, Cardano, and Sui—that are positioned to outperform BTC and ETH over the next 18 months vastly. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): Meme Utility at Layer-2 Speed Little Pepe isn’t just a meme—it’s infrastructure for the meme economy. Unlike viral coins scrambling to add utility after launch, LILPEPE was designed as a Layer 2 blockchain tailored for meme tokens from the outset. Its standout features include sniper bot immunity, zero tax on transactions, and a native token launchpad ( Pepe’s Pump Pad ) that lets anyone deploy a secure meme token with locked liquidity and pre-audited contracts. The presale, now in Stage 3, is experiencing a surge. With more than 67% of tokens sold at the current tier and prices rising incrementally per stage, investors are rushing in before major centralized exchange (CEX) listings go live. Backed by meme veterans with a track record of launching viral tokens, Little Pepe’s roadmap includes: A launch on Uniswap and two major centralized exchanges A $1 billion market cap target A top-100 CEX’s push by year’s end By combining technical innovation with meme-driven virality, LILPEPE could easily outperform traditional tokens. Its current low market entry point could result in four—to five-digit percentage returns in the coming cycle. Solana (SOL): Still a Contender, Despite a Summer Lull Solana has faced headwinds recently. Following a double-digit drop over the past month, trading volumes have also slid by over 16% in the last 24 hours alone. Investor confidence has waned, with price movement stagnating in a tight, sideways range that many view as a symbol of broader altcoin fatigue. However, history shows that Solana’s quiet periods often precede periods of aggressive growth. In past cycles, periods of low volatility and declining interest created accumulation zones that set up multi-month bull runs. The key lies in Solana’s underlying fundamentals: fast transaction speeds, low fees, and a massive NFT and DeFi ecosystem that remains unmatched among L1 competitors. While the $200 mark for Solana seems unattainable, once the network activity picks up and the market climate improves, Solana can recover some of the lost ground. Analysts say breakout potential remains within reach as innovations continue and on-chain activities pick up. Due to its solid developer community and growing institutional appeal, Solana remains a high-beta wager with massive growth potential, especially for those who buy in during consolidation periods. Dogecoin (DOGE): Compression Before Explosion? Dogecoin nears breakout as symmetrical triangle tightens, signaling potential major move ahead. Recently, the coin has been tested for its support and resistance levels multiple times. Price recovery attempts have been met with sell pressure, but support has remained firm, indicating accumulation beneath the surface. Analysts suggest that the current pattern could resolve with a 60% move in either direction, with macroeconomic developments—such as Federal Reserve announcements—acting as a likely trigger. Though the breakout direction isn’t guaranteed, the setup is hard to ignore. With Elon Musk’s continued support and DOGE’s integration into several mainstream platforms, even a moderate rally could reignite speculative interest. In a euphoric market, DOGE could once again set its sights on the elusive $1 mark, making now a strategic moment for entry. Cardano (ADA): ETF Approval Bets Fuel Institutional Interest Cardano’s price has been under pressure, weighed down by recent market sell-offs and whale liquidations. Yet underneath the bearish surface lies one of the most powerful potential catalysts of the next 12 months: ETF approval odds hitting all-time highs. Analysts at Bloomberg now assign a 79% probability to a spot Cardano ETF being approved in the U.S.—a significant shift from earlier this year, when odds hovered below 70%. The SEC’s interactions with big asset managers and new interest from crypto institutions fuel this newfound excitement. While some whales have let go of their holdings throughout this recent turbulent period, on-chain data shows that mid-tier investors continue to buy, demonstrating conviction that growth will occur over time and that inflows triggered by ETFs will add fuel to the fire. Although ADA is not exhibiting significant price action, factors such as fundamentals, regulatory tailwinds, and the level of developer engagement suggest the possibility of a multi-phase recovery rally when risk appetite returns. Should the ETF case play out in 2025, Cardano could undergo a drastic pivot, offering rewards that surpass those of other slow-moving assets. Sui (SUI): Oversold but Structurally Promising Sui has been under intense selling pressure in both spot and derivatives markets. Open Interest has cratered by over 40% since late May, while taker sell volume outpaces buys by a wide margin, highlighting weak sentiment and capital flight from leveraged positions. Yet, this capitulation phase might be exactly what SUI needs. The RSI indicates a bullish divergence scenario, as the price forms higher lows while testing support. MACD flattening hints downtrend is weakening; SUI eyes reversal if $3 resistance gets tested. A break of that resistance could lead to recovery toward monthly highs and possibly reestablish momentum toward all-time levels. Given its strong infrastructure backing and developer interest, a turnaround here could signal the beginning of a larger move. For contrarian investors, SUI may offer one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the current altcoin landscape. Final Word: Don’t Just Watch Bitcoin—Beat It Real 2026 gains lie in undervalued, high-utility altcoins with momentum. Little Pepe leads this list as the most explosive narrative play of the year, while Solana, DOGE, Cardano, and Sui offer fundamentally solid setups with technical breakout potential. In a cycle where infrastructure meets meme culture and regulation meets DeFi, this is the moment to look beyond the giants—and position yourself before the wave hits.

While the BTC price fell to $98,000, ETH and altcoins also experienced significant declines. However, after the news that Iran and Israel reached an agreement, BTC and altcoins turned green, while Santiment issued a volatility warning for some altcoins. Cryptocurrency analysis platform Santiment announced the four altcoins that whales transferred the most to exchanges. Accordingly, Santiment said that significant transfers to exchanges were seen in five altcoins. These include PAX Gold (PAXG), Space ID (ID), Gala (GALA), Aethir (ATH), and Pendle (PENDLE). “PAX Gold, Space ID, Gala, Aethir, and Pendle are among the altcoins that have seen whale transfers of over $1 million to centralized exchanges. Be prepared for volatility, especially when high percentages of a coin’s supply are transferred to a CEX.” Such large altcoin inflows to exchanges are generally interpreted as preparations for sales. It usually signals potential selling pressure and increased volatility, as whales may be preparing to unload their positions. Therefore, whale transfers can increase short-term volatility for these altcoins and affect price action. At this point, investors should also monitor PAX Gold, Space ID, GALA, ATH, and PENDLE, as increased exchange transfers could signal increased selling pressure. *This is not investment advice.

The recovery follows a high-volume bounce from major demand zones, with momentum indicators pointing toward a potential short-term continuation. However, the price remains capped below a critical resistance band, creating a tight range heading into June 25. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin price action on the daily chart shows BTC moving within a medium-term ascending pitchfork. After breaking below mid-channel support earlier this week, bulls stepped in aggressively at the lower bounds near $100K. This level also aligns with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement zone and prior breakout support. The daily structure remains fragile, as price is now approaching key resistance levels between $106,000 and $108,000. This area overlaps with a Fibonacci pivot and prior rejection zone. Meanwhile, upside targets are visible at $109,150 and $114,890, both significant Fibonacci and pivot cluster zones. On the downside, $102,000 and $100,000 form crucial intraday support levels.

Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 into law over the weekend, allowing the state to set aside $10 million to buy Bitcoin. Unlike other states that have shown interest in digital assets, Texas is proving its commitment by putting real money on the line. Lone Star State becomes the first in the U.S. to officially fund a Bitcoin treasury $10M Bitcoin Bet Is Now Official The newly signed law directs the state to build a Bitcoin reserve that will be managed independently from the state’s main treasury. The Texas Bitcoin reserve will be managed by the state comptroller with guidance from a three-member crypto advisory committee. Along with direct purchases, the fund may grow through forks, airdrops, profits, or public donations. A detailed public report will be released every two years. This makes Texas stand out from states like Arizona and New Hampshire , which approved similar legislation but never actually funded their crypto reserves. The $10 million may sound small for a state the size of Texas, it’s just 0.0004% of the overall state budget, but crypto experts say it’s a big step forward. Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, says this sends a powerful signal that Texas is ready to lead in the future of finance. In addition, only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included, a threshold that only Bitcoin currently has. Bitcoin Reserve Gets Extra Legal Protection Alongside Senate Bill 21, Governor Abbott also signed HB 4488. This bill makes sure that the Bitcoin held by the state isn’t accidentally swept into the general budget during financial reshuffling. In other words, Texas wants to keep its Bitcoin stash safe and untouched. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Senator Adam Schiff Drops COIN Act to Ban Presidents from Crypto Profits , This move comes as the Trump administration works on building a national crypto reserve, though the federal version plans to rely on crypto seizures or bond issuance instead of direct funding. Texas, however, is making its crypto ambitions crystal clear. Bitcoin isn’t just a speculative asset anymore, and with more support from US states, it’s part of the state’s financial future. The move could spark interest from other states looking to modernize their treasury strategies. For now, Texas is the first to step up and put Bitcoin on the books, literally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Texas aims to position itself as a crypto-forward state and hedge against fiat currency risks. With Senate Bill 21, the state officially allocated $10M to Bitcoin as a signal of long-term confidence in digital assets and financial innovation. Could Texas start accepting Bitcoin for taxes or state services? Not yet, but this move lays the foundation for such innovations in the future. If this reserve performs well and the legal framework strengthens, Bitcoin payments could become a viable option How does the Texas Bitcoin reserve differ from similar proposals in Arizona and New Hampshire? Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which passed laws but didn’t allocate actual funds, Texas has put $10 million into its reserve. This shows real financial commitment, making Texas the first state to officially fund and manage a crypto treasury. What’s HB 4488, and how does it protect the Bitcoin reserve? HB 4488 ensures that Texas’s Bitcoin reserve stays separate from the general state budget. It protects against budget reshuffling, ensuring Bitcoin isn’t sold or moved unless explicitly approved.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 07:15:42

Institutional investors poured $1.24B into crypto funds this week, marking ten straight weeks of inflows. With inflation fears cooling and macro conditions stabilizing, crypto appears poised for sustained growth. The cryptocurrency market has staged a recovery after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a “complete and total” ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. The move, which de-escalates the Israel-Iran conflict, sparked a surge in risk appetite among investors, sending Bitcoin 3% higher to reclaim the key $105,000 level. The market-wide rally began late Monday after President Trump’s announcement on Truth Social was followed by confirmations from senior Iranian officials, according to Reuters . The de-escalation caused a sharp reversal from the risk-off sentiment that had gripped markets. Ceasefire Sparks Broad Market Rally Markets responded swiftly and decisively.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Neo Pepe’s explosive presale momentum is turning heads, outpacing ADA’s steady rise and even XRP’s historic rally with its bold mix of memes, DAO power, and investor safeguards. Table of Contents Reviewing Cardano’s growth and Ripple’s historic surge Ripple’s 833% rally: Key drivers and market impact Neo Pepe Coins projected returns: Rising star among crypto legacy Why Neo Pepe is surpassing expectations Crypto craze pulls back the curtain on Neo Pepe Top 5 reasons NEOP stands out Conclusion If Cardano were to repeat the massive 833% rally that Ripple made in 2021, its holders would be enjoying some thrilling gains. Yet even this remarkable growth would fall short compared to the stellar returns that seem likely for Neo Pepe. Acknowledged as one of the leading presales in the crypto space, the Neo Pepe presale has surged well past $1.3 million and moved into stage 4, with tokens going for an attractive $0.083153. Neo Pepe makes for an intriguing new investment opportunity, in part because of its blend of meme culture, strong DAO governance, and community-controlled treasury, which set it apart from traditional cryptos like ADA and XRP. Reviewing Cardano’s growth and Ripple’s historic surge Cardano ( ADA ) and Ripple ( XRP ) tell two fundamentally distinct stories within the crypto industry. Ripple’s impressive 833% rally was powered largely by speculative fervor, legal clarity, and growing institutional adoption. Technological strides, including the RLUSD stablecoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, have significantly enhanced XRP’s utility. In contrast, ADA has taken a steadier road, backed by a rapidly expanding decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and community enthusiasm across the globe. Despite its less explosive nature, ADA’s rise carries strong growth indicators. Ripple’s 833% rally: Key drivers and market impact Cardano and Ripple narrate two fundamentally distinct stories within the crypto industry. Ripple’s impressive 833% rally was largely powered by speculative fervor, legal clarity following a favorable SEC settlement, and growing institutional adoption. Technological strides, including the RLUSD stablecoin and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility, enhanced XRP’s utility in ways that impressed even insiders. But ADA’s growth narrative, while not as visually appealing, is a story of community, numbers, and an expansive DeFi ecosystem that hits all the right notes. Neo Pepe Coins projected returns: Rising star among crypto legacy In the saturated crypto landscape, Neo Pepe has emerged as a compelling new contender with projected returns ready to eclipse even the legendary performances of coins like Ripple that took off in 2021. As the newest Pepe coin gaining swift traction, Neo Pepe (NEOP) offers several distinctive features. It has a fixed token supply of 1 billion tokens. Added to that is a robust DAO governance system that empowers token holders to drive decisions in a way that’s fully transparent via proposals and community votes. Neo Pepe also introduces new mechanics vis-a-vis adding liquidity to U.S. dollars directly to the liquidity pool, where it adds liquidity to Uniswap as soon as a transaction happens, while ensuring that LP tokens are burned instead of being given to investors. That also ensures that any price dips are unlikely to happen since anyone that wants to charge a price for Neo Pepe must buy back the LP tokens they failed to dump in order to have price liquidity. In addition to this, Neo Pepe’s smart contracts are fully audited along the way, especially by reputable auditors in the space like Certik. You might also like: XRP revives bullish faith, Neo Pepe Coin’s massive presale shakes up market Why Neo Pepe is surpassing expectations Neo Pepe is not simply another cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized powerhouse, community-controlled and meticulously designed, that intends to redefine crypto investing. Its treasury management system is entirely under the control of DAO governance, ensuring risk-free transparency and maximizing trust among token holders. Very structured presale stages provide momentum and increasing token prices reward those who join early. And the token unlock schedule is created in a way that it reduces volatility and promotes price stability. Furthermore, Neo Pepe boasts a vibrant and engaged community that actively participates in governance decisions, amplifies social media presence, and undertakes grassroots promotional efforts. Crypto craze pulls back the curtain on Neo Pepe Stepping boldly away from tired cryptocurrency clichés, Crypto Craze serves up an incisive, engaging analysis of Neo Pepe that stands apart from typical cheerleading or skepticism. Rather than just listing features, they thoughtfully explore what makes this token’s presale distinct: the inventive auto-liquidity design genuinely aimed at stability, a governance model anchored by community voices, and a presale structure designed not for quick hype but for sustained interest. While openly enthusiastic about Neo Pepe’s thematic depth and early traction, Crypto Craze questions whether its strengths are sufficient to survive the notoriously fickle memecoin market long term, making this analysis a must watch for prospective buyer and investors. Top 5 reasons NEOP stands out Decentralized power: Every NEOP holder actively shapes the project’s governance and strategic decisions. Structured and rewarding growth: The staged presale approach guarantees appealing rewards for those who invest early. Proven market stability: Automated liquidity management and strategic token unlock schedules significantly reduce volatility. Influential community impact: Token holders directly influence strategic decisions, including treasury allocations and exchange listings. Deflationary tokenomics: Regular token burns ensure a continuously decreasing supply, enhancing long-term value appreciation. Conclusion Crypto investors are continually searching for the next groundbreaking opportunity, and Neo Pepe has clearly positioned itself as the leading contender in 2025. Its pioneering approach, grounded in community governance and proactive tokenomics, distinctly sets it apart from competitors. Analysts forecast sustained growth potential, driven by ongoing community engagement and strategic exchange listings, solidifying its status as a top-tier crypto asset.

On June 20, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 1498 , a bipartisan law that gives law enforcement the power to seize digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ), NFTs, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrency tied to criminal activity. The bill received full approval and is set to take effect on Sept. 1. Under the new law, digital assets can be seized if they were used in or gained from crimes such as drug trafficking, fraud, theft, organized crime, or human trafficking. Any increase in the value of the seized assets between the time it was obtained and the time it is seized can also be claimed by the state. Law enforcement would be required to move any seized assets tied to these crimes into a secure, offline wallet that can only be accessed by the agency or the state’s attorney. The forfeiture case would be filed in the county where the seizing agency is based.

Lawmakers said SB1498 addresses gaps in current law and is needed as digital assets increasingly play a role in financial crimes. Meanwhile, Arizona is also updating its laws to expand the state’s forfeiture laws to include digital assets. SB1498 arrives alongside SB21, signed by Texas Governor Greg Abbott on June 22, making Texas the first state to allocate public funds and create a dedicated framework specifically for holding Bitcoin. Managed separately from the general treasury, the reserve aims to strengthen the state’s financial resilience and serve as a hedge against inflation.

According to data from crypto.news, Sei ( SEI ) token rallied by 33 % to $0.268 on June 24, its highest level since May 12, and is now up more than 90% from its April low. Its market cap stood at $1.49 billion with a daily trading volume of 557 million, 175% higher than the previous day. SEI’s price uptick today coincided with a broader market recovery, which saw the global crypto market cap climb 2.5% to $3.36 trillion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaimed the $105,000 level, while major altcoins including Ethereum ( ETH ), XRP ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) also posted notable gains. The positive sentiment followed news of a potential ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump, signaling an end to a 12-day conflict that had weighed on global risk assets . Beyond the broader macro tailwinds, SEI’s rally was supported by strong on-chain fundamentals. According to DeFiLlama , total value locked on the Sei blockchain has climbed to $1.13 billion, nearly doubling from $526 million at the start of the year and approaching its all-time high of $1.15 billion set in May.

Yei Finance, a lending protocol inspired by Aave, now holds approximately $820 million in assets. Takara Lend, another lending dApp, has also attracted $80 million in TVL. Additional data shows the total stablecoin supply on SEI has grown to over $225 million, up from just $1.2 million in March. USDC remains the dominant stablecoin, accounting for 83.3% of the stablecoin market on the network. Revenue generated by Sei-based DeFi protocols has also seen notable improvement. Monthly earnings surged from $116,000 in March to $562,000 in June, indicating a strong uptick in transaction activity and protocol usage. SEI price analysis From a technical perspective, SEI has broken out of multiple bullish patterns. It recently cleared the upper resistance of a multi-week descending channel, signaling a trend reversal. SEI price, 50-day and 200-day SMA chart — June 24 | Source: crypto.news The token has also broken above the symmetrical triangle pattern that had been forming since February, another bullish continuation signal. SEI now trades above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, confirming a favorable trend structure. Additionally, the Supertrend indicator has flashed a green signal, and the MACD has registered a bullish crossover, both of which suggest positive momentum is likely to continue. SEI Supertrend and MACD chart — June 24 | Source: crypto.news Hence, the next potential upside target lies at $0.36, which coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the year-to-date high. If macroeconomic sentiment continues to improve and on-chain strength sustains, SEI could attempt a move toward the $0.50 psychological resistance zone, which aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci level.

Among the new platforms, Tudou Guarantee has seen the largest migration, with user numbers more than doubling and transaction volumes now matching those once recorded by Huione Guarantee. User numbers of certain guarantee marketplaces post Huione shutdown | Source: Elliptic Elliptic’s analysis found that many merchants formerly active on Huione Guarantee have resumed operations on Tudou Guarantee, continuing to offer services such as stolen data, money laundering, and scam-related infrastructure. On-chain data shows that while Huione Guarantee attempted to provide private escrow services post-shutdown, its crypto transaction volumes, mainly in Tether (USDT), fell to negligible levels by late May. The report also clarifies that some ongoing activity may have been wrongly attributed to Huione Guarantee.

However, these transactions are distinct from those linked to the marketplace, with different wallet infrastructure and business operations. “The closure of Huione Guarantee has sent shockwaves through the guarantee market ecosystem, However, many other similar Telegram-based marketplaces remain in operation and continue to expand,” researchers said. “It will require wider, ongoing removal of these marketplaces from Telegram if these key enablers of the global scam epidemic are to be stopped.” Huione Guarantee , once described as the largest darknet marketplace of its kind, had facilitated over $27 billion in illicit transactions prior to its shutdown. Operating primarily in Chinese, it functioned as an escrow-based platform connecting vendors and buyers involved in online scams, particularly across Southeast Asia and China. Vendors on the platform offered a range of illicit goods and services, including fake IDs, SIM cards, surveillance tools, and money laundering arrangements. Payments were typically conducted in stablecoins like USDT, with merchants required to post deposits as a trust mechanism. Rebranded domains keep Huione network alive Further investigation from Chainalysis supports some of Elliptic’s findings. A report earlier this month revealed that while Huione Guarantee’s original domain and public channels were taken down, its laundering network remained operational. According to Chainalysis, Huione reemerged under a new domain, Huione.me, preserving its original branding along with its linked token XOC and the USDH stablecoin, both of which remain actively listed for trading. USDH, in particular, has been flagged by FinCEN for its design, which makes it difficult for law enforcement to freeze, thereby enabling illicit actors to move funds with minimal risk of seizure. Chainalysis also observed increased activity in rival marketplaces such as Tudou Guarantee. However, it noted that these platforms processed only a fraction of Huoine’s historical volume, which exceeded $81 billion in crypto transactions since 2021. A separate report from TRM labs warned that Huione and related groups were exploring proprietary messaging apps such as ChatMe and SafeW, designed to avoid third-party moderation as Telegram continues its crackdown.

The legislation would bar the president, vice president, and their immediate family members from engaging in crypto-related business ventures while holding office. The bill comes amid rising concern over the intertwining of politics and digital assets, particularly in the case of President Donald Trump’s recent involvement in crypto. The COIN Act proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of cryptocurrency, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. Schiff introduces the COIN Act Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I'm introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. pic.twitter.com/8wieNSCPgC — Adam Schiff (@SenAdamSchiff) June 23, 2025 The new legislation mandates that officials disclose any sale of digital assets worth over $1,000. According to the bill, violators, including a sitting president, would face a civil penalty equal to the amount of profit made and up to five years in prison. Schiff also linked the proposal to Trump’s crypto dealings, saying they have raised significant ethical, legal, and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of presidency to enrich himself and his family. Trump and his family have doubled down on their footprint in the crypto space, as his administration has pushed to create a more favorable regulatory environment for the industry, including through legislation. “That’s why I am introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First family. We need far greater scrutiny of the president’s financial dealings, and to stop him and any other politician from profiting off of such schemes.” – Adam Schiff , U.S. Senator for California. The senator’s proposal also raised eyebrows since he just voted last week in favor of the GENIUS Act , a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. Schiff acknowledged in a video posted Monday that Trump’s stablecoin venture was a central piece of the graft going on in the White House. The legislation restricts members of Congress and some executive officials from issuing stablecoins but exempts the president and vice president. Democrats had initially threatened to walk away from the bill at the Republicans’ refusal to include language addressing presidential crypto conflicts in the GENIUS Act. Due to pressure to push the legislation through, the U.S. officials finally relented. Schiff, along with 17 other Democrats, voted in favor of the bill, and it passed on June 19. According to the proposal, nine Senate Democrats joined Schiff in co-sponsoring the COIN Act. Seven of them also voted in favor of the stablecoin legislation. Democrats propose other legislation targeting Trump’s crypto ventures Democrats have also proposed other legislation targeting Trump’s crypto ventures, including the MEME Act, introduced by Sam Liccardo in the House and Senator Chris Murphy. Representative Maxine Waters also introduced the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, though none of the legislations are expected to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. Last year, Trump and his sons launched a crypto project, World Liberty Financial, which has since released a stablecoin. According to a recent financial disclosure, the President has garnered around $58 million from the venture. That total is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his memecoin launched in January. Trump launched his memecoin (TRUMP) shortly after his inauguration and held a dinner with the top investors last month. His wife, Melania Trump, also launched her memecoin ( MELANIA ) days after Trump launched his token. The President’s involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest. In May, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal also opened an investigation into Trump’s crypto businesses. Blumenthal revealed that the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations would be opening a preliminary inquiry into the launch of the President’s cryptocurrency, along with DeFi platform WLFI and other digital asset interests. Trump Media & Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, has raised $2.5 billion to create a Bitcoin reserve and has advanced towards launching several crypto-related financial assets. The SEC approved the filing on June 13, which covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Midnight’s native NIGHT token is a Cardano-native asset, with a large airdrop for ADA holders. The analyst predicts the NIGHT token has the potential to become a top-25 crypto asset. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello has identified the upcoming launch of Midnight, a privacy-focused protocol built on Cardano’s infrastructure, as one of the most powerful potential catalysts for the ADA token this cycle. He argues that Midnight’s deep integration with Cardano is designed to drive value, development, and capital directly back to the main ecosystem. “This isn’t some side project,” Gambardello emphasized. “Midnight is Cardano growing into a foundational layer for a new wave of Web3.” Midnight: A Cardano-Centric Privacy Protocol Midnight is a data-protection-focused protocol that will introduce its own native token.

Here’s Why A 200% Surge Could Follow,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-repeat-of-2021/,"Ethereum saw a notable decline in its price over the last week, and the weekend culmination pulled the price back towards levels not seen in over one month. The movement tracks with the established bearish trend of the month of June and continues to show mounting sell pressure on the cryptocurrency. However, with this decline has emerged a trend similar to what was seen back in 2021, right before the market picked up and saw the beginning of the altcoin season. Ethereum Price Crash Similar To 2021 Looking at the current Ethereum price action and that of what was seen back in Q2 2021, there have been some striking similarities. Most especially, how the Ethereum price has performed in the month of June so far has been the same as what happened back in June 2021. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens In 2021, the Ethereum price began the month of June trading above $2,600. However, as the month went on, the altcoin suffered multiple declines and crashed below $2,000 before it was over. Eventually, the price would find its bottom somewhere around $1,600 before the decline was over. Fast forward four years to the year 2025, and the month of June is showing the same trend. June 2025 had begun with the Ethereum price trending above $2,600 before the bears took control. Since then, the altcoin has crashed by more than 20%, and looks primed for more. Using the historical performance, it would suggest that the Ethereum price decline is far from over. If there is a repeat of June 2021, then Ethereum could suffer another 20% crash before the month of June is over, to find its bottom somewhere between $1,600 and $1,700. The Trigger For Altcoin Season Given that Ethereum is the largest altcoin in the market, it is naturally the trigger for the altcoin season. Looking back on 2021, the altcoin season began when the Ethereum price began to rally. But the recovery did not begin until the month of July, and eventually lasted into the month of November.

This is expected to trigger a market rally for risk assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, coupled with the fact that a resolution to the Iran-Israel war could be in the works. If this trend holds, then it is possible that the Ethereum price would begin to rally in July. As seen in 2021, Ethereum would end up rising over 200% in the course of five months, to put in a new all-time high in the month of November.

This recovery follows a bounce from the Bull Market Support Band and a reclaim of the long-term trendline, as buyers re-entered near oversold levels.

According to a June 24 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn, the total circulating supply of Tether ( USDT ) on the Tron ( TRX ) blockchain has now exceeded $80 billion. This record positions Tron as the largest network for USDT issuance . Since late 2020, USDT supply on Tron has grown almost continuously. It jumped from just under $7 billion to over $39 billion during the 2021 bull market. For the first time in three years, it surpassed Ethereum ( ETH ) in terms of the overall USDT supply in November 2024. The growth continued into 2025, rising from $59.76 billion at the beginning of the year to more than $80.76 billion by mid-June. Despite this rapid growth in stablecoin supply, the network’s total value locked has decreased from about $7.5 billion in January to just $4.3 billion, as per DefiLlama data . You might also like: Can Tron price surge 60% and revisit December highs? However, its decentralized exchange volumes paint a more optimistic picture. Monthly trading volume on TRON-based DEXs rose from $4.9 billion in April to $5.5 billion in May, showing renewed trading activity on-chain. At the time of writing, TRX is trading at $0.2729, up 2.2% over the past 24 hours, with a weekly range of $0.2605 to $0.2791. The token is still 36% below its peak of $0.4313, which was reached in December 2024. With daily volume down almost 29% to $939 million, spot trading activity seems to have cooled. From a technical perspective, TRX appears to be consolidating near key support levels. The price has been moving sideways just below the 20-day simple moving average. However, it is still above the majority of important exponential moving averages over both short and long timeframes, such as the 10-, 30-, 50-, and 100-day EMAs. TRX price analysis. Credit: crypto.news This alignment points to underlying strength in the trend, even though price is still range-bound. The Bollinger Bands are showing a slight narrowing, which indicates less volatility, and TRX is hugging the middle band. The relative strength index, which is near 50, shows a neutral momentum bias. The momentum and bull/bear power indicators are flashing buy signals, but the MACD indicator is still in slightly bearish territory. If TRX decisively clears the 20-day SMA and breaks above the $0.28 range, a bullish breakout might develop, possibly paving the way for a retest of the $0.30–$0.32 range. On the downside, the token may be susceptible to additional losses toward the lower Bollinger Band around $0.262 if it is unable to hold above $0.265.

The Japanese hotel company set up its Florida-based subsidiary on May 1, aimed at expanding its global bitcoin treasury operations. The contribution is expected to significantly accelerate the implementation of its “555 million plan,” disclosed earlier on June 6, the company said in a statement . Metaplanet’s strategic objective is to accumulate up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, leveraging the deep capital markets and advanced institutional infrastructure in the U.S. to optimize acquisition and management processes. This U.S. expansion aligns with the company’s broader vision to establish a globally integrated treasury model that supports shareholder value, improves treasury yield efficiency and strengthens its leadership in bitcoin capital markets. The funding for this contribution will come from exercising the 20th to 22nd series of stock acquisition rights, and all proceeds will be directed toward additional bitcoin purchases. Importantly, there is no change to the previously disclosed intended use of funds. The financial impact on the company’s current fiscal year results is expected to be minimal, but Metaplanet has committed to promptly disclosing any material developments.

The country was one of the largest markets for crypto as the popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum grew among the citizens. As the demand for crypto grew, China tightened its rules and regulations to maintain stability and protection. As of 2025, China has implemented one significant law that changed the entire landscape of crypto. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in China Crypto Tax in China Crypto License in China Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in China May 30, 2025- Comprehensive Ownership Ban The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership. The crypto ban decree became effective from June 1, 2025, states the suspension of crypto transactions, asset seizure measures, enforcement, and penalties. Previous major crypto regulations in China– Date Law/ Regulation Details September 24, 2021 Crypto trading, mining, and transactions ban Effectively banning digital tokens such as Bitcoin June 2021 Ban on crypto mining Concerns regarding cryptocurrency January 2018 Crackdown on cryptocurrencies Miners shifted operations overseas September 30, 2017 ICO ban ICO, crypto exchanges, trading cease April 1, 2014 Closure of Bitcoin trading PBOC ordered to close bitcoin trading accounts December 5, 2013 Banking restrictions Banks/ payments institutions banned from bitcoin transactions June 2009 Prohibition of virtual currencies To prevent purchasing real-world goods What is the Chinese Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? By implementing the recent ban on cryptocurrency, the Chinese government is reaffirming its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital currency, the yuan . Its current focus is on: Outlawing private ownership of crypto Accelerating the adoption of central bank digital currency (CBDC) Mitigating financial risks related to crypto Reasserts its financial hegemony by banning decentralized crypto Crypto Tax in China As China implemented a ban on crypto trading, mining, and ownership, any crypto tax is irrelevant. It has ceased all crypto activity, while focusing on blockchain innovations with its digital yuan. The government is not focusing on crypto tax as long as the crypto ban stays. Crypto License in China China does not have any crypto license, as Beijing has expanded its crypto ban. Since no one will be able to hold crypto or other digital assets (except its own digital yuan), a license implementation is not necessary. Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Before China enforced the crypto ban in 2025, the adoption rate was fluctuating, and the market was unstable. Since Chinese crypto policies are too strict and have made the market sentiment rigid, it has influenced users to use VPNs to access foreign exchanges. This raised some concerns regarding crypto, and eventually, the government banned it. Conclusion When crypto was regulated in China, the government had a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financial terrorism (CFT) framework. However, after its historical changes of banning private ownership of crypto, China is focusing on centralizing the political power and encouraging the country’s own digital currency. Despite the restrictions, use of crypto for illicit activity remains a concern for the Chinese government. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

No, as of June 1, 2025, China has implemented a comprehensive ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, making it illegal to hold or transact in crypto. Why did China ban cryptocurrency? China banned cryptocurrency to centralize financial control, accelerate the adoption of its state-backed digital yuan (CBDC), mitigate financial risks, and reassert its financial hegemony by outlawing decentralized crypto. How has crypto adoption been affected by China’s regulations? Before the 2025 ban, China’s strict policies led to fluctuating adoption and market instability, pushing users to access foreign exchanges via VPNs. The complete ban aims to eliminate private crypto use. Will China unban crypto in the future? It’s highly unlikely China will fully unban private crypto ownership in the near future. Their ban reinforces financial control and promotes the digital yuan, with no current signs of reversal for decentralized digital assets.",Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 07:38:38

The bill, titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act, was framed as a direct response to President Donald Trump’s increasing ties to the crypto industry and the large sums reportedly flowing into his accounts from crypto-linked ventures . “President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns,” said Schiff in a statement. “That’s why I’m introducing legislation to prevent the financial exploitation of any digital assets by public officials, including the president and the First Family.” The proposed bill comes after Trump disclosed $57.4 million in income linked to World Liberty Financial (WLF), a cryptocurrency firm reportedly backed by members of his family. Schiff’s legislation seeks to bar public officials from issuing, endorsing, or profiting from digital assets—including crypto, memecoins, NFTs, and stablecoins—from 180 days before assuming office until two years after leaving it. Schiff Targets Stablecoins and Financial Influence The bill explicitly highlights stablecoins, likely due to WLF’s USD1 stablecoin, launched in March . The coin reportedly played a role in a $2 billion investment settlement announced by an Abu Dhabi firm involving Binance. Schiff emphasized that these entanglements raise questions about the use of political office for personal enrichment. By June, the Trump family had reduced its stake in WLF from 75% in December to 40%, though estimates suggest the family may have pocketed millions through the reduction. Additionally, a report from State Democracy Defenders Action in April estimated that Trump’s digital asset holdings were worth around $2.9 billion—roughly 40% of his total wealth. Parallel House Action and Political Hurdles Ahead On the same day Schiff introduced the COIN Act, Representative Maxine Waters proposed a separate bill in the House—the Stop Trading, Retention, and Unfair Market Payoffs (TRUMP) in Crypto Act. Waters’ bill aims to clamp down on Trump’s personal memecoin project and what she called “crypto corruption,” referencing a dinner hosted by Trump for top holders of the coin. Despite the bold legislative push, both bills face steep challenges. With Democrats currently in the minority in both chambers, and Trump likely to veto any passed measure, either bill would require a two-thirds majority in the House and Senate to become law—a hurdle that appears unlikely to be overcome.

The new capital injection of up to $5B will aim to expand Metaplanet’s BTC treasury model. The Japanese company announced the additional capitalization as part of its ‘555 million plan’. The funding will be allocated to the Florida-based Metaplanet Treasury Corp. *Notice of Additional Capital Contribution to U.S. Subsidiary* pic.twitter.com/5dWd5Y3s40 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 24, 2025 The expansion of the US subsidiary will allow the company to access markets with deeper liquidity. Currently, Metaplanet found sufficient BTC from Japanese exchanges, using the BitFlyer market. Recently, the company also bought BTC from the wallets of QCP Capital. Metaplanet is also one of the companies with a fully transparent treasury and known cold wallets. Corporate purchases rely on diminishing sources of BTC available through exchanges and OTC desks, and are considered the main factor for the creation of coin scarcity. On a weekly basis, corporate purchases often reach three times the amount of newly mined BTC. The company now holds 11,111 BTC, surpassing its previous plans of buying up to 10K BTC by the end of 2025. The ability to buy more BTC hinged on the rally of the Metaplanet stock price. In the past six months, the shares expanded by 1,250%, peaking at 1,895 JPY (around $13.05). Metaplanet saw one of the biggest rallies among BTC treasury companies, allowing it to accelerate the recent BTC purchases. | Source: Google Finance In the past weeks, Metaplanet has outperformed Strategy (MSTR) with a more relentless climb, allowing for the latest large purchases. However, Metaplanet has only 0.000018 BTC per share, a factor of 100 lower than Strategy. The Japanese company also started out at a later stage, with an average BTC purchase price of $95,869. After the latest BTC purchases, Metaplanet is climbing the ranks of treasury companies, which are becoming even more exclusive. In the past week, Metaplanet added another 1,111 BTC to its reserves, becoming the eight-largest holder and closing in on Tesla, Inc. The latest addition surpassed Strategy’s weekly purchase, which this time shrank to just 245 BTC . Metaplanet aims at an international market presence Metaplanet is making more aggressive moves, aiming for a global presence and a much higher BTC treasury. Currently, small-scale companies are also announcing BTC purchases, with some treasuries as low as 10 BTC. The Japanese company also boosted the Market Vector index of crypto companies, which has been on a non-stop expansion since the lows in April. The requirement for treasuries is now around 21 BTC to join the top 100 buyers. Metaplanet is competing with aggressive acquisitions, where the top 100 companies own 834,000 BTC. A position in the top 100 or top 10 may be more beneficial for stock prices, as well as the ability to further expand the BTC treasury. Metaplanet aims to position its US-listed subsidiary in a way that will give the company access to financing, as well as reputation and exposure. The company also aims to acquire 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. A treasury of this size would rival national governments and is one of the most ambitious plans. Other BTC treasury companies in the top 10 had more sporadic purchases and no clear plan of expansion, but Metaplanet aims to gain a similar reputation to Strategy.

After undergoing regulatory crackdowns, geopolitical shocks, and cycles of hype and despair. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are expected to offer stability, the spotlight is gradually shifting toward new-generation projects with cutting-edge infrastructure and real-world utility. One name that stands out is “SUI”. Founded by former Meta engineers and launched in 2023, SUI has quickly made its presence felt not just for its price action but for its robust technical design. Now trading at $2.85, up over 246% in one year, SUI is poised for a major breakout in the evolving Web3 narrative. Bitcoin and Ethereum: The Reliable Safe Havens? In turbulent markets, Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to serve as financial bedrocks in the crypto market. As global tensions rise, like the recent military escalations between global powers, investors often seek refuge in these legacy assets. BTC’s finite supply and ETH’s growing utility in DeFi, NFTs, and staking protocols reaffirm their place as long-term value stores. With institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and ARK continuing to expand Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF exposure, the floor for these assets is more solid than ever. Although they may not deliver 10x returns, they are likely to provide relative stability and respectable gains as the broader market matures. Why SUI Could Be 2025’s Breakout Star SUI isn’t just another Layer-1 blockchain, it is designed with scalability, security, and developer flexibility at its core. Using a unique object-centric data model and the Move programming language, it addresses many of the vulnerabilities seen in legacy blockchains. This innovation allows it to support high throughput and low latency, perfect for mass adoption. Launched at $1.4, SUI hit a high of $5.35 within 18 months, solidifying its place among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Its daily trading volume has surged by 49.83%, and the RSI indicator, currently at 48.4, suggests a possible bullish reversal as it bounces from the mid-range. Successively, if all goes well, SUI price could eye the $7 mark in 2025. Adding further bullish momentum is NASDAQ’s 21Shares ETF filing for SUI, a move that could drive institutional capital into the ecosystem. While SUI is still young and may face stiff competition from older Layer-1 chains, its growth trajectory, innovation, and institutional signals make it a crypto to watch, and potentially one that could boom in 2025. Curious about Sui’s long-term target? Read our Sui Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs Is SUI a risky investment in 2025? It carries risks, but its rapid growth, strong fundamentals and adoption reduce uncertainty. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum still be good investments in 2025? Yes, they will remain reliable choices, especially for conservative investors seeking stability. Why is SUI getting ETF interest so early?

However, Ruvi AI (RUVI) is rapidly emerging as a rival, offering a unique combination of real-world utility, structured growth, and massive ROI potential. With a 103x forecasted return, Ruvi AI isn’t just catching up to Avalanche; it may soon surpass it as a top contender for forward-thinking investors. Why Ruvi AI Could Rival Avalanche While Avalanche focuses on speed and scalability, Ruvi AI takes innovation to another level by combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). This blend unlocks practical use cases across industries like marketing, entertainment, and finance, ensuring that its token, RUVI, has a functional demand beyond speculative trading. Ruvi AI’s structured growth strategy is also a game-changer. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale, RUVI tokens are priced at only $0.015 each. Once the presale concludes, their value is guaranteed to rise to $0.07, marking an almost 5x ROI. Analysts predict these tokens could reach $1 post-listing, representing a staggering 103x ROI. This clear roadmap provides Ruvi AI with an edge over Avalanche, especially for investors seeking sustainable returns. Presale Success Highlights Ruvi AI’s Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale has been nothing short of impressive, capturing the interest of both retail and institutional investors.

Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These VIP tiers incentivize higher participation while delivering incredible ROI opportunities, making them a popular option for investors who recognize Ruvi AI’s potential. Safety and Transparency Build Investor Trust Ruvi AI differentiates itself further by prioritizing security and transparency.

The rebound comes as DOGE reclaims its short-term trendline on the 4-hour chart, with bullish signals returning across multiple indicators. However, with price now approaching a cluster of EMA and volatility-based resistances, the next move depends on whether bulls can clear $0.129–$0.130 decisively. What’s Happening With Dogecoin’s Price? DOGE price forecast (Source: TradingView) Following a week of downward pressure, Dogecoin price action has started to stabilize. The current bounce aligns with the retest of the 4-hour ascending trendline support near $0.1175, where a bullish engulfing candle marked a reversal. Since then, DOGE has pushed back above $0.123 and is now testing short-term resistance around $0.127. DOGE price forecast (Source: TradingView) The 4-hour chart shows a developing bullish structure, supported by the recent flip in the Supertrend indicator to green.

Corporate holdings—both public and private—have not only surged in quantity but have also surpassed the projected annual Bitcoin issuance of 164,250 BTC. This shift is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity, the rising perception of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, and the growing demand for decentralized financial assets. Public Companies : Hold over 725,000 BTC, more than a 135% increase from 2024. Private Companies : Estimated to hold over 300,000 BTC, though transparency remains limited. Total Corporate Holdings : Likely exceeds 1 million BTC, rivaling sovereign holdings. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption — A Global Trend In 2024, only 64 public companies held Bitcoin on their balance sheets. As of June 2025, 151 public firms have integrated Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. This growth is influenced by: U.S. policy shift recognizing Bitcoin as a strategic asset . Institutional frameworks and clearer taxation laws globally. Public endorsements from high-profile business leaders and political figures. Verified Bitcoin Holdings by Public Companies Company Verified BTC Holdings (2025) Estimated Value (USD) Accumulation Strategy Strategy Inc.

Strategic reserve purchases Block Inc. (Square) 8,485 BTC $800M+ Dollar-cost averaging since 2020 Note: Some discrepancies in reported vs verified holdings (e.g., Coinbase) have been corrected based on updated disclosures. Estimated Holdings by Private Companies Private company holdings remain partially unverifiable due to the lack of reporting obligations. However, industry sources and historical data suggest the following: Company Claimed Holdings Est. Value (USD) Notes Block.one 140,000 BTC $14.2B Originated from EOS ICO (unverified 2025 status) Tether Holdings 100,521 BTC $10B+ Used as reserve asset for stablecoin backing Xapo Bank 38,931 BTC $3.44B Early adopter and custodian-based accumulation Stone Ridge 10,889 BTC $1.1B Not verified in 2025 reports SpaceX 8,285 BTC $841M 2021 purchase confirmed; no updates since Note: Treat private company figures cautiously unless disclosed via audited reports. Section 4: Total Institutional Accumulation vs Bitcoin Supply Projected BTC Issuance in 2025 : 164,250 BTC Public Holdings Alone (Mid-2025) : 725,000+ BTC Private + Public Holdings (Est.) : 1 million+ BTC This implies that corporate demand alone is absorbing over 6 years’ worth of new Bitcoin issuance, indicating extreme institutional confidence in BTC’s long-term value . New Entrants in 2025 Several emerging companies have begun adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset, inspired by favorable U.S. policy changes and global inflationary risks: Davis Commodities SolarBank River Financial Worksport Mercurity Fintech Though holdings remain undisclosed, public filings and announcements confirm their strategic interest in Bitcoin.

Conclusion: The Institutional Bitcoin Era Is Here The corporate accumulation of Bitcoin in 2025 marks a turning point in global finance. With public firms now holding more Bitcoin than the annual supply and private firms quietly amassing large reserves, Bitcoin is no longer a fringe asset—it’s a mainstream corporate treasury standard.While price volatility remains, the adoption curve indicates that strategic Bitcoin reserves are becoming the norm, not the exception. The trend is expected to continue as more companies—particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and North America—announce their Bitcoin treasury models. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yep, it absolutely is. Public company holdings more than doubled from 2024 — from 64 companies to 151. Firms are no longer experimenting — they’re going all in, especially after the U.S. government signaled policy support. Did companies really buy more Bitcoin than what was mined in 2025? Yes, and it’s kinda wild. The total BTC mined this year is around 164,250 BTC , but corporate holdings have eclipsed 725,000 BTC just from public companies alone. Add private firms to that and you’re looking at 1M+ BTC in corporate wallets. Which public companies are leading in Bitcoin holdings? There’s frequent debate and sharing of lists about top holders like MicroStrategy (now Strategy Inc.), Marathon Digital, Tesla, and Galaxy Digital. Users track these companies’ quarterly filings and press releases to stay updated on their Bitcoin reserves. How do companies acquire their Bitcoin reserves? Forum members highlight two main strategies: direct purchase on the open market and accumulation through mining (as seen with Marathon and Hut 8). Some companies also use dollar-cost averaging or allocate a portion of profits to steady Bitcoin accumulation How do corporate Bitcoin holdings affect the market? Many users speculate that large corporate purchases can drive price surges, reduce circulating supply, and influence retail investor sentiment. There’s also concern about centralization if too much Bitcoin is held by a few large entities. who holds the most Bitcoin overall in 2025? In 2025, Satoshi Nakamoto remains the largest Bitcoin holder with approximately 1.1 million BTC. He is followed by major institutional players like BlackRock, holding around 662,000 BTC, and Binance with about 611,000 BTC. Other significant holders include Fidelity, Grayscale, Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy), and several national governments. Which new companies are jumping into Bitcoin this year? In 2025, several new companies are jumping into Bitcoin, including Davis Commodities , SolarBank , River Financial , Worksport , and Mercurity Fintech . Most of these firms are early-stage buyers , just beginning to build their BTC reserves.",Research Report,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 07:58:37

This move is widely seen as a direct response to Donald Trump’s growing footprint in the crypto industry. Restrict Presidential Crypto Activity Titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act , the bill seeks to ban current and recent top officeholders, including the president, vice president, cabinet members, and their immediate families, from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, NFTs, or memecoins during their term. It also has a buffer of 180 days before and two years after leaving office. The legislation would also require public disclosure of digital asset sales exceeding $1,000 and impose steep penalties, including prison time, for violators. In an official statement , Schiff said the bill was necessary to address “ethical, legal, and constitutional” concerns tied to Trump’s crypto dealings, particularly his involvement in World Liberty Financial (WLF), a crypto firm that launched the USD1 stablecoin and helped Trump earn over $57 million in 2024 alone. The bill has garnered support from nine other Senate Democrats, several of whom had previously backed the GENIUS Act . That earlier vote has sparked criticism of apparent inconsistency among some Democrats, including Schiff himself, who has now argued for tighter oversight. While lending support to the bill, Senator Ben Ray Luján said, “President Trump is using the highest office in the land to profit off a personal meme coin – it’s beneath the presidency, and it’s blatant corruption. This kind of self-dealing is a serious conflict of interest and a violation of public trust. That’s why my colleagues and I are introducing the COIN Act to ensure that the President and their immediate family can’t exploit public office to cash in on digital assets.” Democrats Target Trump’s Crypto Profits From WLF WLF has reportedly seen massive inflows and even attracted international interest, with a $2 billion transaction involving USD1 announced by an Abu Dhabi-based firm. Meanwhile, the Trump family appears to have scaled down its stake in WLF from 75% to 40%. This move, critics say, may point to an effort to mitigate scrutiny without relinquishing profit. While Schiff’s COIN Act joins a series of recent Democratic proposals, such as the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement (MEME) Act, all face an uphill battle in a Republican-controlled Congress. Even if the bills were to clear both chambers, the likelihood of a presidential veto looms large.

46675806,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=171590,1750757429,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/46675806.jpeg,ETH Whale: ConsenSys-Linked Entity Makes Massive $8.91M Ethereum Buy via Galaxy Digital,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eth-whale-galaxy-digital/,"BitcoinWorld ETH Whale: ConsenSys-Linked Entity Makes Massive $8.91M Ethereum Buy via Galaxy Digital In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, big moves by institutional players often send ripples across the market, signaling shifts in sentiment and potential future trends. Recently, a significant transaction caught the eye of on-chain sleuths, igniting discussions across the crypto community: a substantial ETH whale , reportedly linked to blockchain giant ConsenSys, executed a massive purchase of Ethereum (ETH) through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk. This isn’t just a one-off event; it’s part of a much larger accumulation trend that signals profound confidence in the future of the crypto market. What exactly does this mean for Ethereum, and why are major entities like ConsenSys and Galaxy Digital at the heart of it? What Exactly Did This ETH Whale Do, and Why Does it Matter? About twenty minutes ago, according to insights shared by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X, an entity believed to be a major institution or a very wealthy individual purchased 3,704 ETH. This significant acquisition was valued at approximately $8.91 million at the time of the transaction. What makes this particular buy noteworthy isn’t just its size, but the method and the entity behind it. The purchase was facilitated through Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk, a preferred channel for large-volume transactions that aim to minimize market impact. Furthermore, this recent acquisition is not an isolated incident. Lookonchain’s data reveals that the same entity has been on an impressive accumulation spree over the past three weeks, amassing a staggering 161,112 ETH, with a total value exceeding $422 million, all channeled through Galaxy Digital. This consistent, large-scale accumulation by an ETH whale indicates a strategic long-term conviction rather than short-term speculation. It suggests that this player views current Ethereum prices as an opportune entry point or an excellent value proposition for future growth. Such sustained buying pressure from a prominent entity can often serve as a bullish indicator for the broader market, as it reflects significant capital flowing into the asset. Decoding the ConsenSys Connection: What Does it Imply for Ethereum? The reported link to ConsenSys adds another layer of intrigue and significance to this massive accumulation. For those unfamiliar, ConsenSys is a leading blockchain software company, perhaps best known as the developer behind MetaMask, the world’s most popular non-custodial Ethereum wallet, and Infura, a crucial infrastructure provider for the Ethereum network. ConsenSys is deeply embedded in the Ethereum ecosystem, providing essential tools and services that power decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms. If this whale is indeed linked to ConsenSys , it carries immense weight. It could signify a corporate treasury management strategy, where the company or an affiliated investment arm is strategically allocating capital into Ethereum. This would be a powerful vote of confidence from an organization that not only understands Ethereum’s technical capabilities but also actively contributes to its development and widespread adoption. Such an endorsement from a foundational player like ConsenSys suggests they see intrinsic, long-term value and significant future growth potential for Ethereum . It moves beyond speculative trading and hints at a belief in Ethereum’s role as a foundational layer for the next generation of the internet. The Strategic Role of Galaxy Digital in Large-Scale Crypto Investment The choice of Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk for these substantial transactions is also highly indicative of the nature of the buyer. Galaxy Digital, founded by cryptocurrency pioneer Mike Novogratz, is a prominent financial services and investment management company specializing in the digital asset sector. They offer a range of services including trading, asset management, investment banking, and principal investments. OTC desks are crucial for large institutional players for several reasons: Discretion: OTC trades are executed off public exchanges, meaning they don’t immediately impact market prices. This allows whales to buy or sell massive amounts of crypto without causing significant slippage or signaling their intentions to the broader market. Price Stability: Large orders on open exchanges can lead to price volatility. OTC desks facilitate negotiated prices, ensuring better execution for large volumes. Institutional-Grade Service: Galaxy Digital provides bespoke services, including dedicated account managers, compliance oversight, and secure settlement, which are essential for institutional clients managing significant capital. The consistent use of Galaxy Digital for these transactions underscores the buyer’s preference for professional, discreet, and secure channels for their crypto investment activities. It highlights the growing maturation of the crypto market, where sophisticated financial intermediaries are catering to the needs of large-scale institutional investors. Why is Ethereum the Go-To Asset for Such Massive Accumulations? The focus of this whale’s accumulation on Ethereum is not by chance. Ethereum remains the undisputed leader in smart contract platforms and the backbone of the decentralized web. Its robust ecosystem supports a vast array of applications and innovations, making it a compelling asset for long-term investors: Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Ethereum hosts the vast majority of DeFi protocols, enabling peer-to-peer lending, borrowing, trading, and other financial services without intermediaries. Billions of dollars are locked in Ethereum-based DeFi applications, showcasing its utility and adoption. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): The explosion of the NFT market, encompassing digital art, collectibles, gaming assets, and more, largely occurred on the Ethereum blockchain. Its established infrastructure provides a secure and widely accepted standard for digital ownership. DApp Ecosystem: From social media to gaming and supply chain management, countless decentralized applications choose Ethereum for its security, network effects, and developer community. Proof-of-Stake (The Merge): Ethereum’s successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has significantly reduced its energy consumption, making it more environmentally friendly. This also introduced staking rewards for ETH holders and, coupled with EIP-1559, created deflationary pressure on ETH supply, making it a more attractive asset. Scaling Solutions: While gas fees and network congestion have been challenges, Ethereum is actively addressing these through Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) and future upgrades like sharding, promising greater scalability and lower transaction costs. These fundamental strengths, combined with ongoing development and a vibrant community, make Ethereum a prime candidate for significant long-term crypto investment , even for the largest players in the space. Broader Implications and Actionable Insights for Your Crypto Investment Strategy The actions of a major ETH whale , especially one potentially linked to ConsenSys and operating through Galaxy Digital, carry several implications for the broader crypto market and offer valuable insights for individual investors: 1. Strong Institutional Confidence: This consistent accumulation by a sophisticated entity underscores a growing belief in the long-term viability and growth potential of Ethereum. It suggests that major players are not just dabbling but are making significant, strategic allocations. 2. Maturation of the Crypto Market: The use of professional OTC desks like Galaxy Digital’s signifies the increasing institutionalization of the crypto space. This infrastructure allows large capital to flow in a structured and compliant manner, bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. 3. Potential for Bullish Sentiment: While whale movements can sometimes be volatile, sustained accumulation often precedes or accompanies bullish market cycles. Such activity can boost overall market confidence and potentially attract further institutional and retail interest. 4. Focus on Fundamentals: The choice of Ethereum, given its robust ecosystem and ongoing development, reinforces the importance of fundamental analysis in crypto investment . Assets with strong utility, active development, and clear roadmaps tend to attract serious long-term capital. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed, Don’t Blindly Follow: While whale movements provide valuable signals, always conduct your own due diligence. Understand the underlying technology and market dynamics. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Large institutional buys are often part of a multi-year strategy. For individual investors, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) into fundamentally strong assets like Ethereum can be a prudent approach to mitigate volatility. Understand the Role of Infrastructure: The rise of firms like Galaxy Digital highlights the importance of regulated and secure platforms for large-scale crypto transactions. This infrastructure contributes to market stability and accessibility. Diversify Wisely: While Ethereum is a strong asset, a diversified portfolio can help manage risk. It’s important to remember that the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various influences. While a massive accumulation by a ConsenSys-linked entity through Galaxy Digital is a significant positive signal, market volatility and external factors will always play a role. Conclusion: A Powerful Vote of Confidence in Ethereum’s Future The ongoing accumulation of over $422 million in Ethereum by a prominent ETH whale , potentially linked to ConsenSys and facilitated by Galaxy Digital, stands as a compelling testament to the growing institutional confidence in the world’s leading smart contract platform. This strategic crypto investment underscores Ethereum’s fundamental strength, its pivotal role in the decentralized economy, and its potential for sustained growth. As the crypto market continues to mature, the actions of such influential players provide valuable insights into the broader trends shaping the digital asset landscape, signaling a future where Ethereum plays an even more central role.

46675914,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72392,1750757558,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Beyond the Skepticism: Blockchain as Viewed by Alessio Vinassa,https://timestabloid.com/beyond-the-skepticism-blockchain-as-viewed-by-alessio-vinassa/,"A case for balanced thinking in the age of decentralization and digital transformation Disruption never arrives quietly. From the internet to AI, every breakthrough has been met with a mix of optimism and skepticism—and blockchain is no exception. As this technology continues to evolve, its narrative sits at the intersection of innovation, scrutiny, and transformation. For some, blockchain is the architecture for a trustless, decentralized future. For others, it’s a hype-driven experiment riddled with volatility and overreach. But to dismiss it outright is to miss the opportunity for thoughtful dialogue—and progress. “Skepticism is a sign of intellectual engagement,” says entrepreneur and Web3 advocate Alessio Vinassa. “It forces us to ask hard questions, demand real value, and separate foundational technologies from fleeting hype.” And that’s the point: skepticism isn’t the enemy of development. Informed doubt is what strengthens ideas—and builds better systems. The Inevitable Resistance to Innovation History is full of examples where game-changing technologies were initially dismissed. The internet was once branded a fad. Mobile phones were mocked. Even cloud computing faced early doubts from enterprise giants. Blockchain is now walking the same tightrope. It faces scrutiny for energy use, unclear regulations, and perceived ties to speculation. Yet beneath these concerns lies a deeper movement: the reimagining of trust through decentralized infrastructure. According to Gartner’s 2024 projections, 20% of global economic infrastructure will rely on decentralized platforms by 2030. Meanwhile, institutions like MIT, the World Bank, and the European Commission are exploring blockchain’s role in international development, identity, and sustainability. “The goal isn’t blind adoption,” says Vinassa. “It’s informed progression.” Doubt That Drives Innovation Skepticism becomes productive when it leads to critical thinking—not complacency. It’s what pushes innovators to refine, rethink, and rebuild. Environmental concerns over energy-intensive proof-of-work chains led to innovations like proof-of-stake, cutting energy use by 99.5% on platforms like Ethereum. Security concerns sparked breakthroughs in privacy-preserving technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation. Regulatory uncertainty is giving rise to proactive collaboration between governments, startups, and academia to establish clearer guardrails. “We should question everything,” Vinassa emphasizes, “but not reject everything. Healthy doubt is how we evolve. Cynicism, however, is how we stall.” Avoiding the All-or-Nothing Trap Much of the criticism around blockchain stems from binary thinking: either it’s a silver bullet, or it’s a scam. But like any tool, blockchain’s impact depends on how it’s used—not whether it exists. Vinassa urges decision-makers to focus on the real-world applications already reshaping global systems: Supply chain transparency in agriculture, food safety, and luxury goods Cross-border payments that reduce cost and settlement time Identity verification systems in underbanked regions Decentralized governance models for civic and protocol-based decision-making “It’s not about utopia,” Vinassa says. “It’s about building systems that are marginally better today—and exponentially better over time.” Leading with Balanced Perspective What defines a true thought leader isn’t blind evangelism—but measured vision. Alessio Vinassa exemplifies this through his call for balance: Developers should prioritize real-world usability. Regulators must engage in collaborative development, not confrontation. Enterprises should explore blockchain as a long-term structural tool, not a trend. “The goal isn’t to convert skeptics overnight,” Vinassa reflects. “The goal is to keep building responsibly, educating transparently, and listening—even to the doubters.” This approach resonates not just within crypto-native spaces, but across industries undergoing digital transformation—from finance and logistics to international governance and business growth. A Call for Curious Pragmatism All breakthrough technologies walk the same path: they are misunderstood, challenged, refined—and then accepted as necessary. Web3 and blockchain are no different. Instead of asking “Is this overhyped?” we should be asking: What problems are worth solving with decentralized models? How can we build responsibly while still pushing boundaries? What structures must evolve to support global adoption at scale? “We must remain vigilant, yes—but also curious,” Vinassa explains. “We must test assumptions, question claims, and support innovation that earns trust.” Conclusion: From Doubt to Dialogue Skepticism, when applied constructively, becomes a catalyst for innovation. It challenges technologists to mature their systems, encourages transparency, and brings legitimacy to new ideas. But cynicism—the kind that shuts down discourse—only delays business growth, dampens entrepreneurial momentum, and underestimates the value of global collaboration. “Skepticism should be a doorway, not a dead end,” Vinassa concludes. “If we channel doubt into dialogue, we can build something worthy of belief—not just hype.” And that’s how blockchain’s future will be earned: not through noise, but through clarity, responsibility, and collective effort.

Bitcoin has jumped from weekend lows or around $98,000 to $105,809 at press time. Also, top altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana gained up to 10% in the past 24 hours amid renewed optimism. While analysts anticipate continued uptrends and potential breakouts, investor attention remained on political-themed cryptos due to the renewed regulatory developments. In a bold move to distinguish public services from private gains, Senator Adam Schiff dropped the COIN (Curbing Official’s Income and Nondisclosure) Act yesterday. According to Adam Schiff, the COIN Act would prohibit the president, the vice president, his kids, and the first family, as well as top executive officials or special employees like Elon Musk. It would prohibit them from issuing a digital currency, from endorsing, or sponsoring one. Schiff’s bill seeks to ban the US president, Vice president, senior officials, and their families from advertising or profiting from digital asset undertakings while in office. The market reacted swiftly to these developments, with PolitiFi coins’ market cap increasing by nearly 10% from $2,006,990,100 to press time’s $2,203,062,675. Source – Coingecko The notable gain followed massive rallies in top political-tied tokens. Department of Government Efficiency, Pepe Trump, and the America Party memes soared up to 30% in the previous 24 hours. The sector’s trading volume increased remarkably within the past day to $622,950,060. That reflects renewed investor and trader interest in cryptocurrencies linked to politicians. The activity surge comes as PolitiFi tokens remain in the spotlight following the proposed legislation, which follows mounting concerns over Trump’s crypto investments. Schiff stated that the president and his sons earned around $57 million in Q1 2025 from the World Liberty stablecoin venture. The US president also participated in activities related to digital exchange-traded funds (ETFs), tokenized assets, and Bitcoin mining. Furthermore, Trump’s crypto regulation moves have raised worries over conflicts of interest. Recently, he argued HOUSE to act “Lighting fast” in passing the Genius bill . Understanding the COIN Act The bill aims to prevent mixing politics with digital asset profits. Adam Schiff @SenAdamSchiff · Follow Donald Trump and other senior administration officials have made a fortune off of crypto schemes. Today, I’m introducing the COIN Act to put a stop to this corruption in plain sight. Watch on Twitter View replies 2:03 PM · Jun 23, 2025 2 Reply Copy link Read 2 replies If passed, the COIN Act would ban high-ranking government officials from various crypto undertakings. First and foremost, it will bar officials from launching, endorsing, or advertising any virtual assets, including NFTs, stablecoins, meme tokens, and tokenized ETFs. Violations would attract serious consequences, including a 5-year jail term and profit forfeiture. While Schiff’s bill applies to all high-ranking officials, it has likely stemmed from Trump’s crypto dealings. The US president launched his meme token in January days before his inauguration. He recently organized a private dinner with holders of his meme token , a move that attracted a massive backlash. Moreover, Trump Media has reaffirmed its plan to accumulate Bitcoin worth $2.3 billion. Schiff added that the president has profited from various branded merchandizes, including Watches, Sneakers, and the Make America Pray Again Bible.

Recent statements and strategic moves from key figures and major corporations highlight a burgeoning interest in stablecoins pegged to the Korean Won (KRW). This development signals a significant shift in how international transactions and digital payments could be handled, particularly for the nation’s rapidly expanding global industries. Let’s delve into why KRW-based stablecoins are gaining such traction and what this means for the future of finance. Why the Surging Digital Asset Demand in South Korea? The conversation around digital asset demand in South Korea gained significant momentum with remarks from Min Byeong-deok, a prominent left-wing lawmaker who previously served as Lee Jae Myung’s head of digital assets during the South Korean presidential election campaign. In an interview with The Block, Min Byeong-deok unequivocally confirmed a robust demand for KRW payments within the realm of digital finance. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a reflection of deeper economic and cultural shifts. Min Byeong-deok articulated that this demand stems primarily from the global expansion of South Korean content, games, and e-commerce. Consider the phenomenal success of K-pop, the global reach of Korean dramas and films, the explosive growth of Korean online gaming, and the increasing international footprint of Korean e-commerce platforms. These industries are not just thriving domestically; they are conquering markets worldwide, generating vast volumes of cross-border transactions. The existing traditional financial infrastructure, while functional, often introduces friction, delays, and costs that can hinder this rapid global expansion. The inherent efficiency of digital payments, especially through stablecoins, offers a compelling alternative. For businesses operating on a global scale, the ability to send and receive payments swiftly and cost-effectively is paramount. This growing need for streamlined international financial flows is precisely what’s driving the confirmed digital asset demand for KRW-pegged solutions. Understanding KRW-Based Stablecoins : A Gateway to Global Commerce To fully grasp the significance of Min Byeong-deok’s statement, it’s crucial to understand what KRW-based stablecoins are and how they function. In essence, a stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility, typically by pegging its value to a stable asset like a fiat currency, gold, or another cryptocurrency. In this context, a KRW-based stablecoin is a digital asset whose value is designed to remain consistently equal to one Korean Won. These stablecoins operate on blockchain technology, offering the benefits of decentralization, transparency, and speed that are characteristic of cryptocurrencies, but without the wild price swings often associated with assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This stability makes them ideal for everyday transactions, remittances, and cross-border payments. For South Korean businesses and consumers engaging in international commerce, KRW-based stablecoins could serve as a powerful gateway, offering several key advantages: Reduced Volatility: Unlike unpegged cryptocurrencies, their value remains stable, making them reliable for pricing and payment. Faster Transactions: Blockchain technology allows for near-instantaneous settlement, often significantly quicker than traditional banking rails. Lower Fees: Transaction costs can be substantially lower, especially for international transfers, compared to conventional wire transfers or credit card fees. Enhanced Accessibility: They can facilitate financial inclusion by providing a digital payment method for individuals or businesses that might be underserved by traditional banking systems. 24/7 Availability: Unlike banks with limited operating hours, stablecoin transactions can occur at any time, any day of the week. Imagine a K-pop fan in Europe wanting to purchase merchandise directly from a Korean vendor, or a gaming company in the U.S. paying a Korean developer. Currently, these transactions involve multiple intermediaries, currency conversions, and associated delays and fees. KRW-based stablecoins could simplify this process dramatically, allowing for direct, efficient, and cost-effective payments. The Economic Imperative: How Won-Based Stablecoins Reduce Capital Conversion One of the most compelling arguments put forth by Min Byeong-deok for the adoption of Won-based stablecoins is their potential to mitigate the conversion of domestic capital into foreign currencies for overseas transactions. This economic benefit has significant implications for South Korea’s financial sovereignty and stability. Currently, when South Korean businesses or individuals engage in international trade or make payments abroad, their Korean Won typically needs to be converted into a foreign currency, such as the US Dollar, Euro, or Japanese Yen. This conversion process incurs foreign exchange (FX) fees, often involves unfavorable exchange rates, and can lead to capital outflow. Over time, these small fees accumulate, and the constant conversion can affect a nation’s capital reserves and balance of payments. By utilizing Won-based stablecoins for the settlement of overseas transactions, a significant portion of this conversion can be avoided. Instead of converting KRW to USD to pay a foreign supplier, a Korean company could potentially use KRW-pegged stablecoins directly. This means the underlying value, still tied to the Korean Won, remains within the domestic financial ecosystem for longer, reducing the need for immediate foreign currency acquisition. Consider the following comparison: Feature Traditional Overseas Transaction (e.g., USD) Won-Based Stablecoin Transaction Currency Conversion Required (KRW to USD) Minimized/Eliminated (KRW-pegged) FX Fees & Rates Incurred, potential for unfavorable rates Significantly reduced or absent Settlement Time Days (SWIFT, ACH) Minutes to hours (Blockchain) Capital Outflow Impact Direct capital conversion to foreign currency Retains Won-pegged value within ecosystem Transparency Limited, reliant on bank statements High (on public blockchain) This ability to retain capital within the domestic economy, even during international transactions, presents a powerful economic incentive for the South Korean government and financial institutions to explore and potentially embrace Won-based stablecoins . It aligns with broader national goals of fostering a robust and independent digital economy. KakaoPay Stablecoin Ambitions: A Major Player’s Strategic Move The demand for KRW-based digital payment solutions isn’t just a political talking point; it’s being actively pursued by major industry players. A significant indicator of this trend is the revelation that KakaoPay, a dominant mobile payment firm in South Korea, has submitted stablecoin-tied patent applications. This move by KakaoPay, a subsidiary of the tech giant Kakao (which also operates the ubiquitous KakaoTalk messenger), signals a serious intent to integrate stablecoin technology into its vast financial services ecosystem. KakaoPay boasts an enormous user base in South Korea, making it one of the most influential financial technology companies in the country. Its foray into stablecoins could dramatically accelerate mainstream adoption. While the specifics of their patent applications are not fully public, they likely pertain to the infrastructure for issuing, managing, and facilitating transactions with their own KakaoPay stablecoin or a stablecoin integrated within their payment network. The implications of a KakaoPay stablecoin are profound: Mass Adoption Potential: With millions of users already familiar with KakaoPay for everyday transactions, the introduction of a stablecoin could seamlessly onboard a large segment of the population into digital asset usage without needing deep technical understanding of blockchain. Ecosystem Integration: Kakao’s sprawling ecosystem includes not just payments but also e-commerce, gaming, content, and even ride-hailing. A stablecoin could act as a unifying digital currency across these diverse services, creating a powerful closed-loop economy. Enhanced Cross-Border Services: Leveraging its existing international partnerships and user base, KakaoPay could expand its cross-border payment services, offering more efficient and cost-effective ways for users to send and receive funds globally, directly competing with traditional remittance services. Regulatory Dialogue: As a major regulated entity, KakaoPay’s active pursuit of stablecoin technology will inevitably foster closer dialogue with South Korean financial regulators, potentially paving the way for clearer regulatory frameworks. KakaoPay’s strategic move underscores the commercial viability and growing market interest in stablecoin solutions. It demonstrates that the vision of efficient, Won-pegged digital payments is not just a theoretical concept but a tangible business opportunity being actively pursued by market leaders. Navigating the Landscape of South Korean Digital Finance : Challenges and Opportunities While the prospects for KRW-based stablecoins and the broader South Korean digital finance landscape appear bright, the path forward is not without its challenges. The successful integration and widespread adoption of these digital assets will depend on navigating a complex interplay of regulatory, technological, and societal factors. Key Challenges: Regulatory Clarity: This is perhaps the most critical hurdle. South Korea has a robust and evolving regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. For stablecoins, regulators will need to address issues such as issuer reserves, consumer protection, anti-money laundering (AML), and combating terrorist financing (CTF). Clear guidelines are essential for fostering trust and encouraging institutional participation. Interoperability: For stablecoins to achieve their full potential, they need to be easily transferable and usable across different blockchain networks and traditional financial systems. Establishing standards for interoperability will be crucial. User Education and Trust: Despite the rise of digital payments, a significant portion of the population may still be unfamiliar or skeptical about cryptocurrencies. Building trust and educating users about the benefits and security of stablecoins will be an ongoing effort. Technological Infrastructure: While South Korea is highly technologically advanced, ensuring that the underlying blockchain infrastructure can handle the massive transaction volumes expected from a widely adopted stablecoin will require continuous development and scaling. Competition: Stablecoins will compete not only with traditional payment methods but also with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) if the Bank of Korea decides to issue a digital Won. Immense Opportunities: Global Leadership in Digital Finance: By embracing stablecoins, South Korea has the opportunity to solidify its position as a global leader in digital finance innovation, setting precedents for other nations. Enhanced Economic Efficiency: The benefits of reduced FX costs, faster settlements, and capital retention can significantly boost the efficiency of South Korea’s international trade and financial services. New Business Models: Stablecoins can enable entirely new business models, from micro-payments for digital content to tokenized real-world assets, fostering innovation across various sectors. Financial Inclusion: While South Korea has high banking penetration, stablecoins can still offer benefits for specific demographics or cross-border workers, providing cheaper and more accessible remittance options. The journey for South Korean digital finance , particularly concerning KRW-based stablecoins , is just beginning. The convergence of political will, confirmed market demand, and the strategic moves of industry giants like KakaoPay paints a compelling picture of a future where digital Won-pegged assets play a pivotal role in the nation’s economic landscape. In conclusion, the confirmation of strong demand for KRW payments in digital finance by lawmaker Min Byeong-deok, coupled with KakaoPay’s proactive stablecoin patent applications, marks a significant turning point. This growing interest in KRW-based stablecoins is driven by the global success of South Korean content, games, and e-commerce, offering a powerful solution to streamline international transactions and reduce capital conversion. While regulatory clarity and adoption remain key challenges, the potential economic benefits and the strategic moves by major players like KakaoPay underscore a promising future for Won-based stablecoins within South Korean digital finance . The confirmed digital asset demand is undeniable, setting the stage for a new era of efficient and globally connected financial services.

As more corporations incorporate Bitcoin into their portfolios to diversify their assets, early-stage projects like Bitcoin Pepe are expected to gain from the growing optimism surrounding crypto assets. Bitcoin acquisition In a statement, Panther Metals detailed plans to acquire £4 million (approximately $5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin as part of its treasury management strategy. As part of this move, the company will use £1.3 million ($1.75 million) of its Bitcoin holdings as collateral to finalise the acquisition of the Pick Lake mining deposit in Ontario, Canada. “This allows the Company to complete the Pick Lake acquisition whilst retaining its total exposure to Bitcoin,” the firm noted, emphasising that Bitcoin will be treated as “productive capital” rather than simply held passively, as is common among other Bitcoin-holding companies. The company stated that its physical commodity portfolio, which includes critical minerals, gold, and other precious metals, will continue to expand, with support from the Bitcoin treasury. The firm also intends to grow its Bitcoin holdings over time. Panther Metals CEO Darren Hazelwood highlighted that this hybrid approach enables the company to finance high-quality mineral projects while minimising shareholder dilution, benefiting from the comparatively favourable financing terms in the digital asset space. Minerals and Bitcoin: a strategic blend The Pick Lake deposit is part of the broader Winston Project, which hosts about 85% of the project’s overall mineral resources. The Winston deposit is described as an advanced-stage polymetallic property, rich in zinc, copper, and precious metals. It offers potential for high-grade mining redevelopment and resource expansion. Zinc, in particular, is considered a critical mineral due to its importance in steel galvanisation and battery technology. Hazelwood stated that by combining the “stability of physical resources with the flexibility of digital capital,” the company aims to build a resilient business capable of navigating various market cycles. Bitcoin treasury adoption expands among corporations Panther Metals joins a growing number of companies integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. Earlier this week, real estate investor Grant Cardone announced the purchase of 1,000 BTC for his firm’s treasury. Meanwhile, established Bitcoin advocates such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan-based Metaplanet continue to increase their holdings, now at 592,345 BTC and 11,111 BTC, respectively. Bitcoin Pepe gains traction with a utility-focused approach Bitcoin Pepe is establishing itself as a notable player in the cryptocurrency market by combining meme-inspired branding with a focus on tangible utility and infrastructure development. Unlike many meme tokens that primarily depend on social media buzz, Bitcoin Pepe is pursuing a defined technical roadmap. This structured direction appears to be attracting investor interest, with Bitcoin Pepe having raised more than $15 million during its ongoing presale phase. The project’s team has announced that its native token, BPEP, is set to be listed on the cryptocurrency exchanges MEXC and BitMart. These listings are anticipated to improve the token’s visibility, trading liquidity, and perceived legitimacy as it moves closer to a wider market launch. An official announcement regarding the exchange listings is expected on June 30. In parallel, the team is working to establish additional partnerships with centralised exchanges (CEXs) to support BPEP’s rollout. To reward early supporters, all existing holders of the BPEP token will receive a 30% bonus on their current holdings.

The reticent figure, known for his secrecy and absence from public life, posted a single emoji on X late Monday, prompting an 8% surge in the value of XRP within 24 hours. Britto posted a single “face without mouth” emoji from his X account created in August 2011. Regardless of his intent, the XRP’s community reaction was immediate, largely due to his status as a founder who has avoided the spotlight since Ripple’s inception. Asserting that “it was not a hack or compromise,” David Schwartz—currently chief technology officer at Ripple and co-creator of the XRP Ledger—verified that Britto was the one who sent the message. ‘Ghost’ XRPL co-creator speaks after years of silence Not much is known about Arthur Britto, but according to Shwartz, he co-created the XRP Ledger in 2012 alongside Jed McCaleb, the latter also known for founding Mt. Gox and later the Stellar blockchain. Together, they launched what was initially known as NewCoin, later renamed OpenCoin, and finally Ripple Labs. In 2015, he slapped Jed McCaleb with a lawsuit, accusing him of breaching a contract by launching Stellar and allegedly copying Ripple’s code. The case was reportedly settled out of court, and the full terms of the settlement were never publicly disclosed. Though instrumental in building XRPL , Britto has stayed almost entirely invisible. He has never given a public interview, never appeared at a public event, and no verified photographs of him exist. His name is in public records and legal filings, but outside of official documentation, Britto’s persona has been more myth than man. The XRP co-founder is also listed as the founder and president of PolySign, a blockchain infrastructure firm. He also briefly served as a director at Bitstamp in 2014 before his role was terminated in 2015. Real, but as private as Satoshi Britto’s privacy has led to theories that he might be a pseudonym or not a real person. Others believe he is the person behind crypto’s most famous pseudonym, Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto. “ He is so private that he’s one of my dark horse candidates for being Satosh i,” one Reddit user remarked. David Schwartz addressed these rumors in a November 2023 post, proving Britto’s existence, adding that the developer is very insistent on privacy. “ He is a separate and distinct human being in his own right. But he is intensely private ,” Schwartz dispelled the chatter that Britto is a ghost in the Ripple machine. Additional evidence of Britto’s identity was found in a Ripple community post circulating on X earlier this month. The post included a 2012 agreement signed by Chris Larsen, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto. Dated September 17, the document awarded Britto 2% of all XRP, then referred to as “Ripple Credits,” and granted him lifetime rights to build on the Ripple protocol without needing future permission. Schwartz confirmed the document’s authenticity and noted that he is in contact with Britto. XRP price rally after community excitement After dropping to an intraday low of $1.97 one hour after Britto posted the emoji, XRP has climbed up 8.1% in the last day. Many traders interpreted the post as a bullish signal, buoyed by its cryptic nature. “ Bullrun confirmed? Too early to say. But Arthur Britto doesn’t casually drop breadcrumbs. When someone this silent speaks … you listen. In crypto, silence can be louder than noise. And Britto just broke his. Stay alert. Something’s coming ,” reckoned XRP enthusiast John Squire .

As CryptoPotato reported earlier today, Bitcoin’s price hit $106,000 immediately after Donald Trump announced that there’s been an agreement for ceasefire between Israel and Iran that’s already “in effect.” As seen in the chart below, the price rallied from a low of around $99,600 to a high above $106,000 in a matter of hours, sparking a considerable wave of short liquidations across the derivatives market.

The cryptocurrency remains 1.3% down for the week but the recovery seems to have started and, hopefully, it will continue. However, for this to happen, both Israel and Iran need to honor the agreement. Unfortunately, according to a report from CNN, Israel accused Iran of firing missiles and vowed to strike back, while Tehran denied violating the ceasefire agreement. The market remains volatile and over $500 million worth of leveraged positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass.

Bitcoin’s climb past $106K earlier today was cut short as news broke that Iran had violated a ceasefire deal with Israel, just hours after it was supposedly brokered by US President Donald Trump. The sudden escalation sent shockwaves through the market, triggering over $500 million in crypto liquidations within the hour. Long positions were hit the hardest as the market reversed. By press time, Bitcoin had slipped back below $105K, giving up most of its earlier gains. Ceasefire Off the Table, Tensions Spike What triggered the panic? Israel’s Defense Minister, Israel Katz, announced “intense strikes” on Tehran after accusing Iran of breaking the US-Qatar-mediated truce. The situation escalated rapidly, with the Chief of the General Staff, LTG Eyal Zamir stating. ""In light of the severe violation of the ceasefire carried out by the Iranian regime, we will respond with force."" -The Chief of the General Staff, LTG Eyal Zamir in a situational assessment now — Israel Defense Forces (@IDF) June 24, 2025 Iran has denied any ceasefire breach, but its top security council says the nation is fully prepared to retaliate if provoked. The ceasefire was meant to de-escalate regional tensions. But with missiles now back on the table, global markets are on edge, and crypto is once again acting as a volatility sponge. $500M Liquidated: Crypto Whales Take a Hit With the ceasefire unraveling in real time, traders scrambled. Liquidations soared to $500 million, signaling panic among leveraged long positions. The sudden move has shaken confidence just as Bitcoin was reclaiming bullish territory. “Time to Buy the Dip,” Says Van de Poppe Despite the turbulence, some seasoned traders see opportunity. Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe believes Bitcoin is still in an upward trend, calling the pullback a healthy retest. “Bitcoin has a trendswitch. It’s uptrending now, after we’ve had a massive liquidation crash taking place to sub $100K. It broke through $103K and hit the next resistance. Time to be buying the dip…” For dip buyers, $103K may be the key accumulation zone to watch. Trump Turns Up the Heat on the Fed Beyond the battlefield, Trump had more to say – this time targeting the Federal Reserve. In a pointed post on Truth Social, the president slammed Fed Chair Jerome Powell for holding rates steady at the June FOMC meeting. “No inflation, great economy – We should be at least two to three points lower. Would save the USA 800 Billion Dollars Per Year, plus.” Trump also said if the cuts don’t work out, Powell could hike again but warned Congress to “work this very dumb, hardheaded person over.” What Now for Crypto? Between rising geopolitical tensions and renewed pressure on the Fed, the crypto market is caught in the middle. Bitcoin’s recent pullback might just be noise or the start of a bigger shift. Either way, traders now have more than just price charts to worry about.

According to data from Mempool.space , a downward difficulty adjustment of around 9% is projected within the next five days. That would be the most since the China mining ban four years ago, when the hashrate, the total computational power used to mine blocks, plummeted 50% to 58 exahashes per second (EH/s) and bitcoin was trading near $30,000. The difficulty adjusts every 2,016 blocks to ensure that blocks continue to be mined at roughly 10-minute intervals. After the recent decline, the hashrate is now just under 700 EH/s, according to Glassnode data. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap was trading recently around $105,300. Significant hashrate and difficulty corrections are not unusual during the northern hemisphere's summer. Elevated electricity prices, driven by higher air conditioning demand and strained power grids, often lead miners to temporarily shut off machines, especially older or less efficient ones. This seasonal pattern has been observed in several previous years. The anticipated drop in mining difficulty will provide meaningful relief for miners. The hashprice, or miner revenue per exahash, currently sits at $51.9. This metric reflects the estimated daily income in dollars a miner earns per EH/s contributed to the network, based on block rewards and transaction fees. As difficulty decreases, mining becomes easier, meaning miners can earn more revenue for the same amount of computational effort. Assuming bitcoin’s price and transaction fees remain stable or increase, the hashprice should rise significantly in the coming days, helping to offset recent profitability pressure.",Markets|Mining Difficulty|Hashrate|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-24 09:46:47

Let’s sort out the facts from the noise. What’s the Claim? Many posts on X and Telegram groups are saying, “If you held XRP during the snapshot, you’re getting NIGHT tokens for free.” It sounds exciting — who wouldn’t want free tokens just for holding crypto? So, What’s the Truth? Yes, XRP holders will receive NIGHT tokens, but only if they meet the eligibility. According to the official 45-page whitepaper released by the Midnight team, the airdrop is being shared across eight blockchains. These include Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Avalanche, BAT, and XRP. To qualify, you needed to hold at least $100 worth of XRP when the snapshot was taken on June 11, 2025. There’s no need for KYC or any fees—claiming is as simple as signing with your wallet and submitting a valid Cardano address. However, the tokens will be locked at first, and 25% will unlock slowly over a year. How Did We Find That Out? The Midnight team detailed all of this in their whitepaper, breaking down the token supply and distribution plan. Out of the total NIGHT token supply, 50% (12 billion tokens) is set aside for Cardano (ADA) holders. Bitcoin (BTC) holders will receive the next biggest share, 20%, which is about 4.8 billion NIGHT tokens. The final 30% (7.2 billion NIGHT tokens) will be shared equally among six other blockchains: XRP, BAT, ETH, BNB, SOL, and AVAX. That means XRP holders are eligible to claim around 1.2 billion NIGHT tokens from this pool. So yes, if you held XRP during the eligible snapshot, you could qualify for a piece of that 1.2 billion NIGHT allocation.

Employing advanced B-2 stealth bombers and bunker-busting munitions, these strikes dealt significant damage to Iran’s nuclear enrichment capabilities. This action signifies a dramatic pivot in U.S. foreign policy toward overt military involvement, heightening stakes in an already unstable region. Iran responded immediately with retaliatory missile strikes aimed at Israeli cities. While most missiles were successfully intercepted by Israeli defense systems, several breached defenses, causing dozens of casualties and sparking widespread panic and chaos. Israel quickly escalated defensive measures, with sirens sounding across major urban centers. The international community swiftly reacted, with emergency sessions convened by the United Nations Security Council. Key global players including the United Kingdom and the European Union called for restraint, while Russia fiercely condemned the joint U.S.-Israel strikes, threatening retaliatory measures and potentially nuclear aid to Iran. The threat to oil transit through the critical Strait of Hormuz caused global oil prices to spike dramatically, intensifying economic uncertainties worldwide. Broader Conflict Risks & Diplomatic Tensions Amid escalating tensions, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Houthi rebels in Yemen have signaled readiness to back Iran with potential regional attacks. The specter of a broader conflict now looms heavily, exacerbating fears of an expansive proxy war that could envelop the entire Middle East. Israel has begun calling up reserve forces, preparing defensive positions along its northern borders in anticipation of possible incursions or rocket barrages. In the U.S., the Biden administration has faced intense scrutiny domestically and internationally for aligning directly with Israeli military actions. Criticism has mounted over the risks of destabilizing diplomatic relations not only with traditional adversaries like Russia and China but also with historically allied Arab nations concerned about the impact on regional stability. Diplomatic channels are working overtime as European diplomats scramble to mediate the crisis, attempting to de-escalate tensions through backchannel communications with Tehran. Meanwhile, international relief agencies warn of the potential humanitarian crisis looming from extended conflicts, emphasizing the urgent need for diplomatic resolution to prevent catastrophic regional spillover.

Dubbed SparkKitty, the malware focuses on stealing screenshots of wallet seed phrases stored in mobile phone galleries. Cybersecurity researchers from Kaspersky revealed that the spyware has been embedded within seemingly legitimate applications, including crypto portfolio trackers and modified versions of popular apps like TikTok. The malware campaign, which traces its lineage to an earlier variant known as SparkCat, has been active since at least April 2024. Some app samples date even further back. Once installed, SparkKitty uses deceptive permissions and optical character recognition (OCR) technology to identify and transmit images containing sensitive text such as seed phrases—an attack vector with serious implications for anyone storing their recovery phrases on their devices. Infected crypto apps bypassed store security Kaspersky’s analysis shows that SparkKitty successfully infiltrated the official Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store. The affected applications, including Soex Wallet Tracker and Coin Wallet Pro, disguised themselves as crypto tools offering real-time tracking, portfolio management, and multi-chain wallet services. In one instance, Soex Wallet Tracker was downloaded over 5,000 times before being delisted. Coin Wallet Pro, which positioned itself as a secure digital wallet, reportedly gained traction through social media advertisements and Telegram channels. These channels encouraged users to download the app and install additional developer profiles—bypassing normal app review mechanisms. This extra step allowed the malware to operate outside of standard sandbox protections that typically restrict access to photo galleries and system data. By prompting users during specific activities such as support chats, SparkKitty could gain access to photo storage. Once granted, it used OCR to extract any seed phrases visible in screenshots. These phrases are crucial for crypto wallet access and recovery, and losing control over them can lead to complete loss of funds. SparkKitty malware aims at visual data theft Unlike traditional malware that seeks direct access to wallet apps or private keys, SparkKitty’s focus on image galleries indicates a shift toward exploiting visual data storage habits among users. Many individuals, especially newer crypto users, save screenshots of their wallet seed phrases for convenience. This practice, while discouraged by most wallet providers, remains common. SparkKitty capitalises on this behaviour by scanning thousands of images in the background, looking for strings of words that match common seed phrase formats. Once identified, these are sent back to remote servers controlled by the attackers. The malware’s visual recognition model appears optimised for seed phrase lengths and formats used by popular wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Phantom. Kaspersky stated that while the bulk of infections appear concentrated in Southeast Asia and China, the method of app distribution—via social media and app stores—makes it highly scalable. Similar attacks could easily be redirected at other regions or user bases with minimal modifications to the codebase. Apple and Google take down apps, review system under scrutiny Following Kaspersky’s alert, Apple and Google removed the flagged apps from their platforms. However, questions remain over how these apps managed to pass initial reviews. The use of developer profiles to bypass app sandboxing suggests a vulnerability in mobile OS permission structures, particularly in cases where users are convinced to grant broad access. Kaspersky warned that the campaign may still be active in less regulated app marketplaces or via direct APK downloads. Security teams have been monitoring for similar behavioural patterns across newer apps, especially those associated with crypto-only features or decentralised finance (DeFi) tools. As a precaution, users are being urged not to save seed phrases in their photo galleries and to avoid installing unknown profiles or giving gallery access to non-trusted apps. Several crypto influencers and security accounts on Twitter and Telegram have also circulated warnings about the incident. Kaspersky’s team continues to track SparkKitty’s network infrastructure and has shared indicators of compromise with relevant cyber authorities.

The company revealed on X its intention to allocate an additional capital of up to $5 billion to its U.S. subsidiary. This decisive action underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations to integrate digital assets into their core financial frameworks, particularly when seeking optimal environments for growth and stability. Metaplanet’s commitment to strengthening its Bitcoin holdings through this substantial capital allocation is a testament to its long-term vision for the cryptocurrency. Metaplanet’s Pioneering Journey into Bitcoin and Digital Assets For those unfamiliar, Metaplanet has distinguished itself as a trailblazer among publicly traded companies in Japan by adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset. This strategy mirrors that of MicroStrategy in the United States, positioning Metaplanet as a key player in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies in Asia. Their initial foray into Bitcoin was driven by a desire to hedge against currency depreciation and seek long-term value appreciation, moving beyond traditional financial instruments. This latest announcement of an additional $5 billion in capital signifies not just a continuation, but a dramatic acceleration of their Bitcoin-centric strategy. It’s a clear signal that the company sees immense potential in Bitcoin, not merely as a speculative asset, but as a fundamental component of its future financial health. This move could inspire other Japanese and Asian corporations to re-evaluate their own treasury management strategies and consider a similar pivot towards digital assets . Why the US Subsidiary? Unpacking the ‘Optimal Conditions’ for Bitcoin Acquisition Metaplanet explicitly stated that the United States offers “optimal conditions” for acquiring and managing Bitcoin at scale. But what exactly makes the U.S. such an attractive destination for a Japanese firm looking to bolster its crypto holdings? Several factors likely contribute to this strategic choice: Regulatory Clarity (Comparatively): While the U.S. regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, it has seen significant developments, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This has provided a degree of institutional comfort and established clear pathways for large-scale digital asset investments, offering more certainty than many other jurisdictions. Mature Market Infrastructure: The U.S. boasts a robust and sophisticated financial infrastructure, including well-established crypto exchanges, custody solutions, and liquidity providers capable of handling multi-billion dollar transactions. This infrastructure is crucial for efficient and secure large-scale Bitcoin acquisition. Access to Capital and Expertise: The U.S. financial market is deep and liquid, offering ample access to capital markets and a wealth of expertise in digital asset management, trading, and compliance. This allows companies like Metaplanet to leverage specialized knowledge and resources. Investor Base and Adoption: The U.S. has a large and increasingly sophisticated investor base with a growing appetite for Bitcoin and other digital assets, which can influence market stability and liquidity for large holders. By channeling this massive capital allocation through its US subsidiary , Metaplanet aims to capitalize on these favorable conditions, ensuring its Bitcoin acquisition strategy is executed with maximum efficiency and security. The Mechanics of a $5 Billion Capital Allocation: What Does it Mean? The phrase “up to an additional $5 billion” indicates a significant commitment, though the exact timeline and deployment strategy might be flexible. This capital could be deployed in various ways, primarily focused on accumulating more Bitcoin : Direct Bitcoin Purchases: The most straightforward approach would be direct market purchases of BTC, similar to MicroStrategy’s strategy. This would involve leveraging their U.S. subsidiary to execute large block trades or dollar-cost average into Bitcoin over time. Investment in Bitcoin-Related Products: While direct purchases are likely, some capital could also be allocated to Bitcoin-related investment vehicles, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, if they align with Metaplanet’s strategic goals for liquidity and custody. Infrastructure and Operational Expansion: A portion of the capital might also be used to expand the operational capabilities of the US subsidiary , ensuring it has the necessary infrastructure, talent, and security protocols to manage such a substantial digital asset portfolio. This $5 billion commitment is not just a financial decision; it’s a strategic declaration. It signals Metaplanet’s profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its readiness to make substantial, calculated bets on the future of digital assets within a preferred regulatory environment. Bitcoin’s Enduring Appeal: Benefits and Considerations for Corporate Treasuries Metaplanet’s move highlights the compelling reasons why corporations are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The primary benefits often cited include: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is seen by many as a strong hedge against inflation and currency debasement, offering an alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and global accessibility position it as a modern store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power over time. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering a higher upside compared to traditional low-yield assets. Strategic Diversification: Including Bitcoin diversifies a company’s treasury portfolio, reducing reliance on single asset classes and potentially enhancing overall returns. However, corporate adoption of Bitcoin is not without its considerations. Volatility remains a key factor, as do evolving regulatory frameworks and the complexities of secure custody. Metaplanet’s decision to route this through its US subsidiary suggests a careful consideration of these factors, aiming to mitigate risks by operating within a jurisdiction deemed “optimal.” This thoughtful approach to capital allocation is crucial for any company venturing into the digital asset space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Digital Asset Adoption? Metaplanet’s monumental $5 billion capital allocation to its US subsidiary for Bitcoin acquisition sends a powerful message to the global financial community. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable corporate treasury asset, even among companies outside the immediate Western financial sphere. This could trigger a domino effect, especially among other Japanese and Asian corporations that have been observing the crypto space cautiously. As regulatory clarity improves globally and the infrastructure for managing digital assets matures, more companies may follow Metaplanet’s lead, diversifying their balance sheets with Bitcoin. This trend, if it accelerates, will have profound implications for Bitcoin’s price discovery, market liquidity, and its overall integration into the mainstream financial system. For investors, Metaplanet’s move serves as another strong indicator of institutional conviction in Bitcoin. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is evolving from a niche speculative asset to a foundational element of corporate finance. Keeping an eye on similar announcements from other publicly traded companies will be crucial for understanding the broader trajectory of institutional crypto adoption. A Bold Leap Forward for Metaplanet and Bitcoin Metaplanet’s decision to inject an additional $5 billion into its U.S. subsidiary for Bitcoin acquisition is nothing short of a bold and strategic maneuver. It highlights the company’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and the strategic advantage of operating within a jurisdiction that offers “optimal conditions” for digital asset management. This significant capital allocation not only reinforces Metaplanet ‘s position as a leader in corporate Bitcoin adoption but also serves as a powerful testament to the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets in the global economy. As more companies witness the potential benefits and navigate the complexities, Metaplanet’s pioneering spirit may well pave the way for a new era of corporate treasury management.

Circle Internet, as the issuer of USDC, stands to benefit significantly due to its compliance track record and market trust. Coinbase may benefit even more, leveraging its control over the Base blockchain and stablecoin transaction rails for revenue less sensitive to interest rates. The legislation could negatively impact traditional and decentralized finance players who lack regulatory compliance or efficient payment solutions. All of this is likely still a ways away, as USDC is primarily used in DeFi protocols rather than for peer-to-peer transactions in noncustodial and non-contract wallets. With the passing of the GENIUS Act by the United States Senate, the pathway to meaningful innovation in financial infrastructure is becoming a bit more clear from a regulatory standpoint. In this article, we'll briefly go over what the bill does, why Circle Internet Group's ( CRCL ) US Dollar-backed stablecoin USCoin ( USDC-USD ) is already well positioned to benefit, and I'll get into why I believe the stablecoin-fueled disruption of traditional payment processors isn't as close as it might seem. The GENIUS Act With a 68-30 bipartisan vote, the United States Senate passed the GENIUS Act in mid-June. The bill now heads to the US House of Representatives. If passed by the House, it would require just a signature from President Trump to become law. This is something Trump certainly supports as he has already put pressure on the House to pass the bill by August and Trump-connected World Liberty Financial (WLFI-USD) has launched a stablecoin already. If signed into law, GENIUS would establish a regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoin issuers. Some of those key considerations are as follows: Stablecoins must be fully backed 1:1 by cash reserves or T-bills Annual audits for issuers with over $50 billion in market capitalization (at present, there are two that would qualify) Issuers must practice KYC compliance and have the ability to freeze/seize assets at the discretion of regulators That last one might seem to be a major hurdle for stablecoin issuers, due the reputation cryptocurrencies have as being primarily used for illicit activities. But both Circle and Tether ( USDT-USD ) issuer Tether Limited Inc have historically banned addresses when prompted to. They can do this through freezing of assets via control of the coins' smart contracts on the blockchain. In fact, there are more than 2,000 banned USDT addresses already and roughly 300 banned USDC addresses. Stablecoin Banned Addresses (Dune Analytics/KARTOD) It's important to note that the GENIUS Act isn't necessarily a guarantee to getting through the House. The House Financial Services Committee has a completely separate stablecoin bill called the STABLE Act that has different language regarding foreign issuers - which would be more pertinent to Tether. Regardless of which Act eventually makes it through to the President's desk, USDC should benefit as the biggest stablecoin with an issuer who is domestic to the United States. Good for Circle, Maybe Better for Coinbase Following what has already been an absolutely stellar performance since an early-June IPO, Circle Internet is a clear public market winner here as the issuer of one of the top stablecoins by market capitalization as well as the top US-based stablecoin. I'd encourage those who have not yet read my recent CRCL article to check out that piece as well. Provided T-bill rates remain attractive, Circle will likely be a beneficiary of the GENIUS Act, in part, due to its history of compliance and trust with the market. However, Coinbase ( COIN ) may be in an even better position, given it controls some of the rails where USDC moves. I won't re-write my criminally under-read Coinbase piece from early-April, but given Coinbase's control of the sequencer on the Base blockchain network, the company generates revenue from stablecoin usage that isn't subject to the interest rate moves that Circle would be at the mercy of. With the recent release of Coinbase Payments , Coinbase has built a front-end interface that can directly compete with online payments providers like Stripe and PayPal ( PYPL ), small business POS operators like Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) or Clover ( FI ), as well as more traditional processors Visa ( V ) and Mastercard (MA). I'll get into this a bit more in a later section. Where Circle's earnings are at the mercy of T-bill rates and token supply, Coinbase can generate revenue on the actual usage of the tokens. Thus, even if the supply of USDC stays stagnant, increased velocity of those tokens generates incremental returns in fees for Coinbase provided the assets move through Coinbase Payments and/or Base directly through a more P2P function. Important USDC Metrics Base has been an important driver of the coin's adoption and usage. At roughly $61 billion in stablecoin supply, USDC is the second-largest stablecoin in the market and has a 25% share of total market supply. While this is undoubtedly impressive and makes the token the biggest stablecoin by a US-based issuer (by far), USDC is well behind Tether's $157 billion market cap. Supply is just one consideration; however, transaction volume is also important. Transaction Volume By Coin (Aretemis) At $2.3 trillion in transaction volume during the month of May, USDC was the most used stablecoin in the market by a fairly large margin. USDC had 57% of transaction volume market share in May, and that metric has been higher than 50% every month since October of last year. However, it's important to be aware that most of this transaction volume is from centralized exchanges rather than true 'peer to peer' wallet activity. We can see the degree to which this is the case through USDC's % of transaction volume from P2P wallets - or non-contract wallets: Top 3 May All Volume P2P Filtered % from P2P USDT $1,400 $814 $1,000 58.14% USDC $2,300 $353 $967 15.35% DAI $264 $2 $65 0.87% Source: Artemis, $ in billions In the table above, 'filtered' volume takes out centralized exchange volume. Stripping that out, USDC transaction volume in May was closer to $1 trillion than $2 trillion, and most of that was with a single DeFi protocol. A big driver of USDC activity on Base is the emergence of the decentralized exchange (or DEX) Aerodrome ( AERO-USD ). Even though Aerodrome is a DEX that is exclusive to the Base blockchain, it has accounted for over $516 billion in USDC transaction volume over the last 30 days: Stablecoin Applications (Artemis) This level of activity from just one platform helped make Base the second-largest mover of stablecoins by transaction volume in May, after only Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). While well below the monstrous three-figure APY numbers from Q1-24, the yield offered by providing liquidity to Aerodrome's USD pools is still significantly higher than the yields provided by the T-bill collateral underlying the USDC assets themselves. USDC Pools on Base (exponential.fi) Wherever there is a presence of these kinds of yields, there is an element of risk involved. But I share this example because I think it's important to highlight how USDC is being used. At least today, USDC is more of a DeFi instrument for lending and generating yields through providing DEX liquidity rather than for P2P payments at a significant scale. But a key consideration for Base and many other networks with USDC minted is that the median price to transact on these networks is often a fraction of a penny. Meaning, if a merchant wanted to accept a customer payment facilitated with USDC, that merchant can do so without requiring any intermediary other than the blockchain network utilized for the transaction. This is the biggest reason why stablecoins are viewed as a potential Visa/Mastercard killer. Stablecoins Could Cannibalize Visa/Mastercard From my early-April Coinbase article that I mentioned previously in this note: Processing Savings (AcceptUSDC) Consider what a small business that generates $10 million in annualized sales could save by eliminating credit card processing fees. The example above shows over $16,600 in monthly savings for a company that does half its sales with credit cards. This is important because it is an attack on the lifeblood of companies like Square and Clover - but also Visa and Mastercard; each of which generate their revenue from credit and debit card solutions. None of this should be a major surprise. I've been writing about the impact that cheap, fast blockchain networks can ultimately have on Visa and Mastercard at least as far back as 2022 . In a detailed piece covering Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) Lightning Network from September of that year, I wrote the following: It is undeniably cheaper for the goods and services seller to use Lightning for payments rather than credit cards. We're already seeing top US retailers supporting a bipartisan bill aimed at lowering credit card transaction fees. The market demand for alternatives appears to be there. The question is, will that demand find its way to Bitcoin's Lightning Network? Nearly three years later, Lightning Network growth has been a massive dud, while dollar-denominated stablecoin supply has nearly doubled from roughly $150 billion. And as Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures calculates it, stablecoin transfer volume is already ahead of both Visa and PayPal on a 30-day rolling average. Stablecoins vs TradFi (Artemis) However, what I find very interesting about these numbers is that the emergence of stablecoin volume hasn't made a dent in Visa or PayPal's activity. In fact, each of these entities are processing more monthly transactions than they were five years ago. So while stablecoins have seen major growth in supply, usage, and perhaps soon regulatory clarity; it has yet to come at the expense of major processors. And there may be good reasons for that. Visa and Mastercard Have Their Benefits To be clear, I do anticipate that stablecoins and the blockchain networks where they live will eventually erode the profitability of the traditional payment processor business. I suspect transaction fees will ultimately become a race to the bottom for dollar-denominated activity online. But I think we're probably further away from that than most crypto advocates might realize. For now, there are benefits to using credit cards that I don't think consumers will be willing to give up easily. First, rewards cards can be an effective way to minimize costs, especially if they're fully cash-back on all purchases. Second, credit cards provide a level of privacy that public blockchains simply don't have. As transparent blockchains, all one needs to know is what someone's wallet address is to see what they're spending stablecoins on through Base or Solana. Furthermore, once a merchant/customer transaction has taken place on public stablecoin rails, the merchant can then see everything else the customer has done with that same address. While this might be fine for smaller purchases at restaurants or coffee shops, stablecoins will likely need to have some sort of zero-knowledge proof capability before significant business can take place on-chain. Closing Takeaways With Congress one step closer to a real regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States after the Senate's passing of the GENIUS Act, the market is already beginning to see a change in payments in the future. To be sure, Visa and Mastercard would likely not be immune from challenges if there is meaningful growth in payments with blockchain-based stablecoins like USDC. To this point, we have yet to see such growth, despite significant growth in stablecoins supply and DeFi usage in recent years. But there's a big difference in using USDC to plow it into Aerodrome liquidity pools and using it to buy jeans. I do think the latter will eventually happen, but it's going to take more than just the passing of the GENIUS bill to get that done. Blockchain networks that facilitate stablecoins payments likely need to have some element of privacy to be used at scale. The end-user experience likely needs to improve as well. Ideally, blockchain rails would be obfuscated away entirely through a front-end interface that looks and feels like Cash App or Venmo. The future is likely bright for stables, but as far as I can tell, we're far from there yet.",COIN|USDC-USD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDC,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-24 09:56:13

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.19106519 9.32% Market cap $ 129,138,429,553.52 Circulating Supply 58,938,652,386.00 Trading Volume $ 5,149,092,258.4442 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP is currently in a pullback phase after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May. Since then, it has slipped below a key high-volume profile level. In June, XRP is trying to hold above the previous month’s swing low support at $2.10. However, any upside potential has been limited under worsening geopolitical conditions with the Iran and Israel conflict. Many were expecting a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but that, too, ended up in a 60-day pause in appeals. Also, on June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton XRP spot ETF amid ongoing conflicts. In the third week of June, the US bombed some Iranian nuclear sites, shaking investor sentiment seen even in top crypto. As a result of the past few days ‘ internal and external developments, the XRP price marked a low of $1.94, breaking below the 200-day EMA and alongside last month’s swing low support area. However, a quick climb in XRP price was witnessed on June 24th, rising over 12% with a ceasefire announced, turning it into a short-term battle. The improved investor sentiment shows less panic among investors this time, and a tremendous “buy-the-dip” philosophy has been exercised amid the chaos of battle. Yet, danger still lingers for XRP amid the renewed bullishness. If a ceasefire is broken, then the pressure could rise. That could push the XRP price down because a bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs remains active. If selling pressure continues and XRP breaks below the $2.10 support—which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA—the price could decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. On the upside, if any external or internal factor becomes a catalyst and boosts XRP price, XRP must break past the short-term EMA crossover and reclaim the key $2.40 resistance. Doing so could trigger a rally toward $2.80, with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in June or July. However, momentum depends heavily on a substantial rising volume, as witnessed last April to mid-May. On comparing volume to June, the rise in whale transaction count (>1m USD) contributed to increased exchange outflow. The volume is currently testing a declining trendline; if volume spikes more and breaches this volume trendline, a spark could be witnessed in sessions ahead. However, things would reverse if no clear and strong catalyst appeared, and then a flash crash could occur on the bearish plate. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yet even as SHIB climbs modestly, seasoned investors are moving toward platforms that offer more than price speculation. With passive income becoming the new priority in DeFi, value-conscious holders are now turning their attention to ecosystem-backed tokens with practical utility. This shift is placing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) firmly in the spotlight. Currently priced at $0.03 in its presale, the protocol is capturing interest due to its stable income design and forward-focused roadmap. While meme tokens chase social momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is laying the groundwork for structured, on-chain lending and dividend-driven staking, attracting long-term capital looking for real return potential. Real Yield Through Lending, Staking, and On-Chain Control At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its dual lending system. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model allows users to supply tokens like USDC, ETH, or AVAX into decentralized pools. As borrower demand rises, interest rates dynamically adjust—giving depositors returns that scale with real protocol usage. What sets the platform apart is its issuance of mtTokens: smart contract-backed assets that represent a user’s share in the liquidity pool, including earned interest. These tokens will remain fully in the user’s control at all times, stored within non-custodial contracts on the blockchain. When liquidity is sufficient, users will be free to redeem their mtTokens and withdraw their capital along with accumulated earnings. Those mtTokens will also serve a second function—staking. By locking mtTokens into designated contracts, users will earn additional MUTM rewards funded by protocol buybacks. A portion of all platform revenue will be used to purchase MUTM on the open market and redistribute those tokens to stakers. This mechanism is expected to reinforce token demand while rewarding active participants with dividends. For early investors, the earning equation becomes clear: stable income through interest, enhanced by protocol-powered buybacks and staking cycles. With over 12,400 holders and more capital entering daily, the incentive is aligning toward long-term participation. Collateral-Based Borrowing, Beta Launch, and Strong Upside Potential Borrowers on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will benefit from flexible terms not typically available in centralized platforms. There will be no fixed repayment deadlines; users will maintain their open positions as long as collateral ratios are healthy. This means that investors holding assets like ETH, SOL, or even SHIB will be able to unlock liquidity while still maintaining price exposure. For those looking to fund other strategies, hedge risk, or avoid taxable asset sales, this model will offer substantial advantages. In the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model, borrowers and lenders will connect directly—negotiating rates and durations for both mainstream and niche tokens. With permissionless, overcollateralized loans available on-chain, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer flexibility that traditional DeFi platforms often lack. The project has completed a full audit with CertiK, earning a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and Skynet Score of 76.34—numbers that reflect strong security and performance preparation. According to the roadmap, a beta version of the platform is planned to launch alongside token listing, providing immediate experience of utility on day one. The team is also developing a decentralized stablecoin that will be minted through collateral-backed borrowing and stabilized via interest rate adjustments and arbitrage mechanisms. For investors seeking consistent income and protocol expansion, these developments signal deeper value ahead. At the current price of $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a rare early-stage income opportunity. A $1,500 investment at this stage will become $45,000 at a 30x multiple—well within range given the platform’s broad functionality and protocol-driven rewards. Combined with an active $100K giveaway , where 10 winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM, and expanding traction across the DeFi community, the protocol is setting up for strong market entry. While SHIB remains a favorite among meme traders, long-term investors are moving toward structured DeFi ecosystems that prioritize passive income and user control. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as that next-generation platform—offering real yield, low-friction lending, and a robust utility token model that rewards holders and contributors alike.

Ahead of what promises to be a pivotal Jerome Powell Testimony before Congress, Trump has voiced a remarkably strong opinion on the direction of U.S. monetary policy. His insistence on substantial Interest Rate Cuts isn’t just a political talking point; it’s a declaration that could significantly influence economic discourse and, by extension, the volatile cryptocurrency landscape. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding these macroeconomic currents is paramount, as central bank actions often dictate the broader liquidity and risk appetite that fuel digital asset markets. Donald Trump’s Bold Call for Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts On his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump reiterated his firm belief that the Federal Reserve needs to drastically lower interest rates. His specific suggestion of a two to three percentage point reduction is not a minor adjustment but a seismic shift from current levels. Trump argued that such a move could inject massive savings into the U.S. economy, potentially saving the nation an astounding $800 billion annually. His rationale is straightforward: lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing for the government, businesses, and consumers, theoretically stimulating economic activity. He also proposed a flexible approach, suggesting that rates could be increased again if future economic conditions warranted it. This perspective underscores a fundamental divergence from the traditional, independent stance of the Federal Reserve. The Stakes for Jerome Powell’s Testimony: Navigating Pressure The timing of Trump’s comments is crucial, coming just before Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s scheduled testimony before Congress on June 24. Powell’s appearances before legislative bodies are always closely watched, offering insights into the central bank’s thinking on inflation, employment, and future monetary policy. However, this testimony carries added weight due to the explicit political pressure from a former President who may yet return to office. The Federal Reserve prides itself on its independence from political influence, making decisions based purely on economic data and its dual mandate of maximizing employment and maintaining price stability. Will Powell address Trump’s comments directly? How will he balance the Fed’s independence with the political rhetoric? These are key questions that investors, economists, and even crypto traders will be asking. Key Considerations for Powell’s Testimony: Inflation Data: Recent inflation figures will heavily influence the Fed’s stance. Employment Trends: The strength of the job market is another critical factor. Economic Projections: Powell will likely provide updated economic forecasts. Interest Rate Outlook: While he won’t commit to specific cuts, his language on future policy will be scrutinized. Response to Political Pressure: How he handles questions regarding political influence on Fed decisions. How Federal Reserve Decision-Making Shapes the US Economy Outlook The Federal Reserve Decision to raise or lower interest rates is arguably the most powerful tool in its arsenal for steering the US Economy Outlook . When rates are high, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can cool down an overheating economy and combat inflation. Conversely, lower rates make borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending, investment, and economic growth. Trump’s call for significant cuts reflects a desire for a more expansionary monetary policy, believing it will unleash economic potential. However, economists often debate the precise impact and potential pitfalls of such aggressive moves. Potential Economic Impacts of Aggressive Rate Cuts: Stimulated Growth: Lower borrowing costs can spur business expansion and consumer spending. Increased Debt: Cheaper money can lead to higher levels of corporate and government debt. Inflationary Pressure: Too much money in circulation can lead to a rise in prices. Dollar Weakness: Lower rates can make the U.S. dollar less attractive, impacting trade. Asset Bubbles: Cheap money can inflate asset prices, potentially leading to bubbles in real estate or stocks. The Fed’s challenge is to find the ‘Goldilocks’ zone – not too hot, not too cold – to ensure sustainable growth without triggering runaway inflation or a recession. This delicate balancing act is what makes every Federal Reserve Decision so impactful. Navigating Interest Rate Cuts: Implications for Crypto Markets For the cryptocurrency community, the prospect of significant Interest Rate Cuts by the Federal Reserve carries profound implications. Crypto assets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, are often viewed as ‘risk-on’ assets, meaning they tend to perform well when investors have a higher appetite for risk. Lower interest rates typically lead to: Increased Liquidity: When traditional investments offer lower returns, capital often flows into riskier, higher-potential assets like cryptocurrencies. Weaker Dollar: A weaker U.S. dollar, often a consequence of lower rates, can make dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more attractive to international investors. Inflation Hedge Narrative: If aggressive rate cuts lead to concerns about inflation, Bitcoin’s narrative as a digital store of value and inflation hedge could gain traction. Reduced Cost of Capital: For crypto projects and companies, lower rates mean cheaper borrowing, potentially fueling innovation and expansion within the industry. Conversely, if Powell’s testimony indicates a more hawkish (higher rates) or even a neutral stance, it could temper the enthusiasm for risk assets. The market’s reaction to the testimony will be critical, as it will signal whether the Fed is leaning towards an easing cycle that could benefit crypto, or maintaining a tighter policy. Comparison: High vs. Low Interest Rates and Crypto Factor High Interest Rates Low Interest Rates (Trump’s Proposal) Borrowing Cost Expensive Cheap Traditional Returns Higher (e.g., bonds) Lower Risk Appetite Lower (flight to safety) Higher (search for yield) Crypto Impact Potential headwinds, capital outflow Potential tailwinds, capital inflow Dollar Strength Stronger Weaker Expert Insights and Future Projections for the US Economy Outlook Economists and market analysts are divided on the optimal path for the US Economy Outlook . Some argue that the economy remains robust, with inflation still above the Fed’s 2% target, making aggressive rate cuts premature. They fear that such cuts could reignite inflationary pressures and lead to instability. Others contend that the economy is showing signs of cooling and that preemptive cuts are necessary to avoid a recession. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets the Fed’s rate policy, typically moves cautiously, preferring to observe data trends rather than reacting to political calls. The consensus view, prior to Trump’s recent comments, was that the Fed would likely implement one or two modest rate cuts later in the year, assuming inflation continued to trend downwards. Trump’s intervention, however, adds a layer of political complexity that could influence market sentiment, even if the Fed remains steadfast in its independence. Investors will be closely watching for any signals from Powell regarding the Fed’s reaction function to incoming data and, subtly, to external pressures. What to Watch For: Powell’s Tone: Is he dovish (leaning towards cuts) or hawkish (leaning against cuts)? Economic Data Releases: Future CPI, PPI, and jobs reports will be crucial. FOMC Statements: The language used in upcoming Fed meeting summaries. Geopolitical Events: Global events can quickly shift economic priorities. Conclusion: A High-Stakes Economic Showdown Donald Trump’s assertive call for substantial Interest Rate Cuts has set the stage for a compelling economic narrative, particularly ahead of Jerome Powell’s Testimony . While the Federal Reserve Decision -making process is designed to be independent, the sheer weight of such public demands from a prominent political figure cannot be entirely ignored by the markets. The ensuing debate highlights the fundamental tension between political expediency and sound monetary policy. For those invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, these macroeconomic shifts are not mere headlines; they are critical indicators of the broader financial environment that shapes digital asset valuations. The coming days will reveal how the Fed navigates these pressures, and the ripple effects will undoubtedly be felt across the entire financial spectrum, from traditional stocks to the volatile crypto markets. Staying informed and understanding these complex interplays is key to making strategic decisions in an ever-evolving economic landscape.

Despite strong fundamentals, Circle's shares are extremely overvalued at a 127.9X forward P/E, far exceeding Coinbase's valuation. Given the euphoric rally and stretched valuation, I recommend selling Circle shares and taking profits before a potential correction. Shares of the Circle Internet Group (CRCL) have soared after the company’s IPO earlier this month on renewed optimism about the cryptocurrency sector. Favorable stablecoin legislation approved by the U.S. Congress last week added to Circle's massive share price rally, with the company adding 20% to its market cap just on Friday. Shares, however, seem to be overbought now and the recent explosive price rally exposes investors to the risk of a downside correction. While Circle is profitable on both an EBITDA and net income basis, shares of the blockchain technology company are massively overpriced, and I would recommend investors to sell the greed and take profits. Data by YCharts An overpriced play on the cryptocurrency market Circle is a financial technology company and stablecoin issuer that develops crucial blockchain technology that is needed in order to facilitate rapid digital payments. Circle is the issuer of USDC ( USDC-USD ), the second-most circulated stablecoin after Tether ( USDT-USD ), and therefore a critical pillar of the digital currency ecosystem. Stablecoins are an important element in the cryptocurrency market as they minimize price volatility and allow users to redeem stable coins for US Dollar on a 1:1 basis. With stablecoins being pegged to the value of the US Dollar, stablecoins not only limit excessive price swings in the notoriously volatile cryptocurrency market, but they also help users lower transaction costs and help issuers to earn a return on their reserve assets. The almost nonexistent price volatility of stablecoins is related to the fact that their values are backed by real US Dollars held as reserves. Issuers like Circle and cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase ( COIN ) earn a share of the return on the reserve assets (US Dollars) which are invested in interest-producing income instruments. Global X ETFs Stablecoins have soared in popularity in recent years, in part because adoption of cryptocurrencies is growing and the U.S. government has declared its goal to make the U.S. the Bitcoin capital of the world. With growing adoption and a rising capitalization in the stablecoin market, Circle's IPO just came at the right time... CNBC The assets underlying stablecoins earn issuers recurring income. Circle, as an example, generated the majority of its revenue from “reserve income” and it represented 96% of the company’s total revenue in the first fiscal quarter. Reserve income has also consistently been the biggest block of Circle’s revenue mix over time. What stands out from Circle’s last S1 registration filing -- which includes current and historical financial statements -- is that Circle is already widely profitable on both an adjusted EBITDA and net income basis. In Q1’25, the blockchain technology firm and stablecoin issuer generated $122.4M in adjusted EBITDA, showing 61% year-over-year growth. Circle translated about half of these EBITDA earnings into net profits. In Q1'25, the enterprise earned $64.8M in net income, showing 33% year-over-year growth. Circle Compared to Coinbase, stablecoin issuers like Circle have much higher risk associated with their revenue models than cryptocurrency trading platforms, which often benefit from increased market volatility for digital assets (volatility benefits trading revenue). Although cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and others can be highly volatile, stablecoins themselves are pegged to the USD and therefore have practically no volatility to speak of. Coinbase and Circle co-founded USDC in 2018, a stablecoin that is fully collateralized by U.S. Dollars. As opposed to Circle, however, Coinbase runs a much more diversified business model with income coming in from multiple sources, including Blockchain rewards, interest and fee income as well as transactions-linked (trading) activity. In the first-quarter, Coinbase's stablecoin-related revenues represented only a revenue share of 15%, so the trading platform has much less exposure to the stablecoin part of the crypto business than Circle. Further, Coinbase gets paid fees for the amount of USDC held on its platform (on average, users held $12.3B in USDC on the platform in Q1'25). The more popular USDC is (the higher the market cap is), and the more accounts hold USDC, the more money a stablecoin issuer has to pay to Coinbase, which poses an earnings risk for Circle. USDC currently has a market cap in excess of $61.0B and has increased by about 88% in the last year. Coinbase Another risk for stablecoin issuers like Circle is slowing stablecoin adoption. While USDC adoption is currently rising (as seen by a surging market cap), other stablecoins may emerge in the future, founded by other alliances between blockchain companies and trading platforms like Binance, for example. Further, synthetic stablecoins that don't hold any underlying reserve assets may increase in popularity as a more cost-effective way to crowd out 'standard' stablecoins. Any challenge to the currently existing stablecoin model would therefore also be a fundamental challenge to Circle's business model. Strong IPO performance Circle completed its widely expected IPO earlier this month, which has been a massive success so far and exceeded investors' wildest expectations. Circle’s shares soared right out of the gate on June 5, 2025, when the stablecoin issuers shares were listed on the stock exchange for the first time: shares were priced at $31, but immediately surged to $69 per-share, with further price momentum benefiting early investors. Further, Circle’s shares benefited from the recent approval by the U.S. Senate of new stablecoin legislation, dubbed the GENIUS Act, which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act. The GENIUS Act is an important piece of legislation that seeks to establish regulatory clarity for stablecoin issuers and users. The GENIUS Act is part of an overarching regulatory drive of the U.S. government to legitimize digital currencies and blockchain technology, and further their adoption. Another major beneficiary of the GENIUS Act has been Coinbase, which runs a major cryptocurrency marketplace where retail and institutional investors can trade a variety of digital currencies. I covered Coinbase in my work last November 2024: A Directional Bitcoin Bet . Circle’s valuation After a 674% increase in valuation (calculated from Circle's $31 per-share IPO price), shares of Circle are now extremely highly valued. Considering that the company added yet another 20% to its market cap on Friday following news about the U.S. Senate approving of the GENIUS Act, I believe that the pendulum has swung too far in the direction of euphoria. Circle’s valuation is now also extremely stretched and may be at risk of correcting to the downside. Shares of Circle are currently valued at a forward (FY 2026) price-to-earnings ratio of 127.9X, which compares to 37.7X for Coinbase. This makes Circle's earnings about 3.4X more expensive than Coinbase's and indicates that the blockchain technology's companies shares may be overvalued at this time. I rated Coinbase's shares a strong buy in my last work on the cryptocurrency marketplace, amid strong adoption trends and positive price momentum for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). However, with Circle now trading at more than 120X forward earnings, I believe the company's valuation more than fully reflects the company's earnings position and legislation-driven expansion of the stablecoin market. I believe a ~50X P/E ratio could be justified given the fast EBITDA and net income growth... which implies a fair value of $78 per-share, which is about 68% downside revaluation potential. High-growth companies with considerable earnings upside and strong market positions, like Circle and Coinbase, could trade at premium earnings multiples, in my opinion. However, the current valuation seems excessive and chiefly sustained by extreme investor bullishness. Coinbase, as an example, last year had a 3-year average P/E ratio of ~50X which is why I recommended the cryptocurrency marketplace at a price of $296 per-share, with a fair value of $375 per-share. However, Coinbase has traded significantly above 50X forward earnings during market periods of very bullish market sentiment... a time that bears resemblance to what is going now on in the stablecoin market. Since Circle is expected to generate $1.56 per-share in earnings next year, on a consensus basis, applying a 50X earnings multiplier yields an indicate fair value of $78 per-share. Seeking Alpha Risks with Circle Blockchain technology, digital currencies and stablecoins are going to be a central part of our digital financial ecosystem going forward. However, digital currency prices can be extremely volatile and while adoption is growing, extreme price corrections for digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) make the crypto sector a high risk-sector. An exception is stablecoins, which are collateralized by U.S. Dollars, but because the stablecoin sector is woven into the broader crypto-economy, declining investor interest in digital assets could also a negative impact on stablecoin issuers like Circle (although not on the stablecoins themselves). What would change my mind about Circle is only a massive price correction to the downside, where the valuation is more connected to the company's underlying fundamentals. Final thoughts The IPO of Circle was a massive success. Shares have returned an incredible 674% return since June 5, 2025, and the recent news about the U.S. Senate approving of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework around stablecoins, is a major win not only for Circle, but for the entire cryptocurrency industry. However, with shares now being valued at an excessive 127.9X forward earnings and investors earning a multiple of their invested capital in a matter of weeks, I believe this may be a great time to sell into the strength. Investors are clearly extremely greedy right now, and the risk profile has therefore profoundly changed to the negative last week.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-24 10:02:23

Little Pepe is turning heads with $3.5m raised mid-presale, a meme-powered Layer 2 chain, and early-stage buzz that echoes Ethereum’s legendary 9,000% breakout. Table of Contents Why Little Pepe isn’t a typical memecoin LILPEPE just raised $3.5m mid-presale ETH pumped 9000%; Can LILPEPE do even more? How to join the $777k giveaway before it ends Final word Ethereum ( ETH ) famously delivered a 9,000% return in its early breakout years, turning early adopters into crypto legends. But those kinds of gains feel impossible now… or do they? Meet Little Pepe (LILPEPE), the frog-themed memecoin with an actual Layer 2 blockchain and a narrative loud enough to drown out the noise. With over $3.5 million already raised in its presale, market watchers are betting that this token will be the next 9,000% Ethereum rally. Why Little Pepe isn’t a typical memecoin Most memecoins ride the hype wave and then fade. Little Pepe is doing the opposite: It’s building an ecosystem before the market even realizes it’s not a joke. Behind the frog is a serious tech vision: A dedicated Ethereum Layer 2 chain designed for meme tokens. Zero tax on buys and sells, rewarding honest trading. The only chain to block sniper bots at launch, making it safer for real investors. An upcoming Launchpad to incubate more viral meme tokens. In a sea of meaningless tokens, LILPEPE is one of the few that pairs meme appeal with technical innovation, a combination that has historically preceded exponential growth. LILPEPE just raised $3.5m mid-presale Launched on June 10, the Little Pepe presale has recently dominated crypto discussions. With the first two stages selling out within days, Stage 3 of the presale is live, and the numbers say it all: Over $3.5 million raised Price currently $0.0012, rising to $0.0013 in the next stage Early entrants now sit on a 20% gain. Every stage sells tokens at a higher price, rewarding early adopters with instant unrealized profits and compounding excitement. To supercharge the community, the team launched one of the biggest meme token giveaways of 2025: a $777,000 prize pool, with 10 winners each receiving $77,000. This has further drawn traction to the ongoing, now viral presale.

Ethereum’s 9,000% surge in 2017 was one of the greatest investment runs in crypto history. But ETH started as an idea. LILPEPE starts with a product. If Little Pepe were to do just a 9,000% gain, a $1,000 investment today could become $90,000. But here’s the twist: Unlike early ETH, LILPEPE has meme virality on its side. And that’s key. Memes move faster than tech. Combine both? You get unpredictable upside. With: A functioning Layer 2 chain Top CEX exchange listings in the pipeline And a viral brand baked into the narrative LILPEPE has more ingredients than Ethereum had at the same stage.

With increasing attention on crypto market trends heading into the second half of the year, and XRP’s swift rise over the past 24 hours, we’ve asked ChatGPT for an XRP price prediction to kickstart the second half of 2025. Based on fundamental analysis, technical patterns, and current market sentiment, ChatGPT predicts that XRP could reach as high as $2.31 by July 1, 2025, continuing the bullish trend. Fundamentals and Market Position According to the AI’s analysis, XRP continues to derive its value primarily from its use in cross-border payment solutions . This utility offers a solid long-term foundation. However, the forecast notes that “it hasn’t translated into rapid price growth historically,” suggesting that XRP needs wider adoption for explosive growth. However, the steady use and current adoption rate could contribute to ChatGPT’s expected surge in the short term. XRP Technical Analysis and Market Structure From a technical standpoint, XRP has shown relatively stable price formations and resilience above support levels. The asset recently fell below $2 but quickly recovered, and has begun a rebound that could go to higher levels. The forecast identifies resistance between $2.30 and $2.50, which could be difficult to break through without a significant catalyst. In contrast, a return of bearish pressure could push it toward support levels between $1.80 and $2.00. However, this outcome is unlikely. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What’s Next for XRP? The AI adds that “XRP has historically shown slow, steady builds punctuated by sudden, volatile breakouts.” XRP is currently near the end of an extended consolidation phase , and the upcoming breakout could give it the momentum needed for a huge breakout. With potential catalysts like this, the asset could aim for higher targets, potentially reclaiming the $3 level by early July. A prominent analyst recently predicted that the asset will hit its cycle peak on July 21 , and ChatGPT’s predicted surge to $2.31 could contribute to the journey toward a potential peak. Summarizing its position, ChatGPT noted that XRP is “fundamentally strong” and has generated excitement from market participants. Its recent performance suggests that something big is coming. We could see a bull run in the short term. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This Hidden Gem Presale Could 50x & Save Your Portfolio appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Why Massive Gains Are Fading The cryptocurrency scene in 2025 is no longer the wild west of explosive returns. Investors dreaming of quick 40x-50x gains are hitting a reality check. Heightened regulation, market maturity, and relentless competition mean the era of easy exponential gains is rapidly fading. Projects relying solely on hype are quickly falling out of favor, with savvy investors pivoting toward ventures built on transparency, utility, and genuine community engagement. Moreover, the daily flood of new tokens has diluted excitement, forcing investors to adopt rigorous scrutiny. They now prioritize clear tokenomics, solid governance structures, and practical roadmaps that promise sustainable long-term growth. Critical Reason Most Crypto Projects are Doomed Why are most crypto tokens destined to disappoint? Because many lack the vital components for lasting success. Without tangible utility, robust community involvement, and strategic planning, these projects often collapse under their speculative weight. The new crypto investor seeks projects with clear decision-making processes, limited token supplies, and incentives to encourage long-term holding. Real-world utility—be it governance rights, unique economic models, or practical use cases—is now paramount. Projects missing these essential elements rarely make the cut, relegating them to speculative obscurity rather than sustained success. Undiscovered Token Set to Skyrocket Amid the crowded crypto landscape, two hidden gems are poised to defy the odds and deliver monumental returns. Backed by solid fundamentals, clear market propositions, and engaging presale mechanics, these cryptos are emerging as standout opportunities for discerning investors. Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP)— Dark Horse Set to Explode 50x Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP) is rapidly grabbing the spotlight, having already raised over $2 million. Stage 4 of its presale is nearly underway, with token prices set to rise to $0.083. This groundbreaking project merges meme culture with substantial utility, supported by a fully decentralized DAO. Neo Pepe Coin employs a unique auto-liquidity model, channeling 2.5% of each transaction directly into permanently burned liquidity pools, ensuring lasting scarcity and price stability. Additionally, the project boasts a prestigious Gold Standard CertiK audit, guaranteeing secure and reliable smart contracts. With a capped total supply of just 1 billion tokens, Neo Pepe Coin sets the stage for significant deflationary pressure and value appreciation. Investors Are Scrambling for Neo Pepe Coin: Neo Pepe Coin’s presale is strategically structured, incrementally raising token prices at each stage and rewarding early investors handsomely. Limited token availability at every stage amplifies urgency, driving engagement through gamified leaderboards and vibrant community participation. Holders of $NEOP can directly influence project strategies via the DAO, including liquidity management, partnerships, and exchange listings. If you’re seeking serious gains, you might want to get a little Neo Pepe Coin before it surges even further, buoyed by robust fundamentals and growing analyst recognition as the standout crypto presale.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community.

The fall continued in June, eroding nearly 38% of its gains to April’s low near $0.55 support level. The bleeding price has pierced its strong standing support zone in H1 2025, which aligns with the “FR volume profile level” at $0.60. This level was of utmost value, and losing this support makes the situation weaker for ADA. This all happened with geopolitical changes in June that pulled the ADA market to April’s low. However, ADA has seen renewed buying from this level back in April, and if it repeats the same this time, a rise above $0.60 could lead to a retest of the channels’ upper border again and break if firm bullish conviction joins in a future session. ADA must close above $0.74 to confirm a bullish breakout, which could open the path to retesting $1.10, as this was a significant resistance level since mid-December 2024. A breakdown here would be catastrophic, which could push the fall toward the lower border of the falling wedge. The support levels that could halt ADA from falling are $0.55 and $0.40. However, if selling fails to push the sustain above H1 support by clearing $0.60 in the short term and reverses, a fall could be severe. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) June 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

This crucial announcement, reported by Jin10.com and citing Chinese media CCTV, marks a potentially pivotal moment for the Middle East and, by extension, the intricate web of global financial markets, including the volatile yet promising cryptocurrency space. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding the ripple effects of such geopolitical shifts is paramount. Understanding the Iran Israel Ceasefire: A Glimmer of Hope? The news of an operational ceasefire between Iran and Israel is a development that demands attention. While specific details of the agreement remain under wraps, the mere confirmation of its implementation phase suggests a de-escalation of tensions that have long simmered in one of the world’s most sensitive regions. This move could signal a cautious step towards a more stable environment, potentially easing concerns that have weighed on international relations and economic forecasts. Historically, the relationship between Iran and Israel has been characterized by deep-seated animosity and proxy conflicts, contributing to regional instability. Any formal or informal agreement to cease hostilities, even temporarily, can have far-reaching consequences. It’s not just about the immediate cessation of conflict; it’s about the potential for reduced uncertainty, which is a commodity highly valued in financial markets. Why Geopolitical Stability Matters for the Global Economy The interconnectedness of the modern world means that events in one region can send shockwaves across continents. Geopolitical stability is a cornerstone of a thriving global economy . When major powers or key regions are embroiled in conflict, several economic consequences typically unfold: Supply Chain Disruptions: Conflicts can impede trade routes, disrupt energy supplies, and affect the movement of goods and services, leading to inflation and shortages. Investor Uncertainty: Heightened tensions cause investors to become risk-averse, pulling capital from speculative or volatile assets and seeking safer havens. Commodity Price Volatility: Prices of essential commodities like oil and gas are particularly sensitive to geopolitical events, as production and transit routes can be threatened. Reduced Consumer Confidence: Economic uncertainty can lead consumers to reduce spending, further dampening economic growth. Conversely, signs of de-escalation or peace often lead to renewed optimism, encouraging investment and fostering economic growth. A ceasefire, even if fragile, can inject a dose of confidence into markets that have been bracing for worse outcomes. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact: Opportunities and Risks So, how does this Iran Israel ceasefire news specifically relate to the cryptocurrency market? The crypto market, despite its decentralized nature, is not immune to global macro events. In fact, it often reacts with amplified volatility due to its relatively smaller market capitalization compared to traditional assets. Here’s how geopolitical shifts can influence digital assets: Flight to Safe-Haven Assets: During times of extreme uncertainty, investors often seek safe-haven assets . Traditionally, this has been gold, the U.S. dollar, or government bonds. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has increasingly been considered a safe haven by some, particularly during periods of fiat currency instability or regional conflict. A de-escalation could see some of this ‘safe-haven’ demand for Bitcoin wane, as investors might rotate back into riskier, higher-yield assets. Risk-On Sentiment: If the ceasefire holds and fosters greater global stability, it could encourage a ‘risk-on’ sentiment. This means investors might be more willing to allocate capital to growth-oriented and higher-risk assets, which includes cryptocurrencies. Increased investor confidence could lead to broader capital inflows into the crypto ecosystem, potentially boosting prices across the board. Market Volatility: While a ceasefire generally implies positive sentiment, initial reactions can still be volatile as markets digest the news and assess its long-term implications. Traders might take profits on assets that rallied during the period of heightened tension, or new capital might flow in, causing price swings. Altcoin Performance: Bitcoin often leads the market, but altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) tend to perform well during periods of broader market optimism. If the ceasefire contributes to sustained positive sentiment, we could see altcoins experiencing significant gains as investor appetite for riskier, higher-reward assets increases. It’s important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and geopolitical events are just one piece of the puzzle. Regulatory developments, technological advancements, institutional adoption, and broader economic indicators all play significant roles. What are the Challenges and Lingering Questions? While the news of a ceasefire is undoubtedly positive, it’s crucial to approach it with cautious optimism. Several challenges and questions remain: Fragility of the Ceasefire: Is this a temporary truce or a step towards a more enduring peace? The long history of tensions suggests that any agreement could be fragile and subject to immediate reversal if underlying issues are not addressed. Underlying Issues: A ceasefire addresses immediate hostilities but doesn’t necessarily resolve the fundamental disagreements and power dynamics that fuel the conflict. Broader Regional Dynamics: The Middle East is a complex region with numerous interconnected conflicts and alliances. This ceasefire, while significant, might not immediately resolve other regional flashpoints. Global Economic Headwinds: Even with improved geopolitical stability, the global economy still faces challenges such as inflation, interest rate hikes, and potential recessions in major economies. These factors will continue to influence market performance, including crypto. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amidst Evolving Geopolitics Given the potential for both positive and negative market reactions to geopolitical news, here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on geopolitical developments, particularly those involving major global powers or regions with significant economic implications. News sources like IRNA, Jin10.com, and CCTV can provide direct updates, but always cross-reference. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of different cryptocurrencies and potentially traditional assets, can help mitigate risks during volatile periods. Practice Risk Management: Use stop-loss orders, manage your position sizes, and avoid over-leveraging. Geopolitical events can trigger rapid price movements, making robust risk management essential. Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrencies are a long-term investment. While short-term volatility due to geopolitical news can be unsettling, focusing on the long-term potential of the technology and its adoption can help weather temporary storms. Assess Bitcoin’s Role: Continue to observe Bitcoin’s performance during periods of geopolitical stress. Its increasing acceptance as a potential safe-haven asset could further solidify its position in global finance. A Path Towards Stability? The confirmation of an Iran Israel ceasefire entering its implementation phase is a development that brings a cautious sense of relief. While the road ahead remains uncertain and filled with complexities, any step towards de-escalation in a region as pivotal as the Middle East is a positive sign for geopolitical stability and, by extension, the global economy . For the crypto community, this news underscores the profound interconnectedness of world events and the digital asset space. Investors should remain vigilant, adapting their strategies to navigate the evolving landscape, always mindful of both the opportunities and the inherent risks that come with a world in flux.

The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price has been down more than 75% since December 2024, and Q1 2025 played a significant role in pushing it deep down the well. However, in April of Q2 2025, bullish forces revived and took it to the 0.236 level-based resistance in mid-May. Despite the efforts, the Polygon was still very low and was among the list of altcoins that showed muted growth in Q2 compared to other altcoins. However, the muted growth was brief as mid-May to June bears pushed its price back to April’s low, which shows that the asset strongly lacks bullish conviction in the short term. The POL price could pull below $0.1000 if bearish forces continue downward pressure. All these circumstances occurred during Donald Trump’s presidential start in 2025, and by H1 so far, the market participants have witnessed multiple wars, resulting in bearish dominance. The recent Israel-Iran agreement was the most significant factor that pushed altcoins like POL’s price in June. However, on June 24th, POL saw a 7% intraday rise with a ceasefire announcement, which reignited people’s expectations. Therefore, if the conditions improve, the 0.236 Fibonacci level could be retested in June or July. If it clears that $0.4572 level in June or July, the odds of clearing Fibo are 0.50, 0.786, and the 1.0 level could be retested by the end of 2025. Additionally, RSI has reached oversold territory, and with the recent intraday rise, RSI has reversed, too. It shows that the Bullish sentiment is increasing in the short term.

The move caused a mix of security concerns, as Ledger’s devices were offered as a way to make private keys inaccessible. Ledger will introduce a key recovery feature to new wallets going forward, with a secondary PIN available for some devices. The new service, known as Recovery Key, is optional and can be used entirely offline. Recently, the company published a whitepaper about the features available with its new offline recovery. The new Ledger Recovery key is a smart card that stores a copy of the master secret, which is used to generate the Secret Recovery Phrase. The card can share the master secret from the Ledger Hardware Wallet , connecting via Near Field Communication. The Secure Element contains a tamper-resistant chip, which stores the master secret with no chance of leaking or being taken out via hardware. The element adds several layers of security, including a dedicated operating system for exclusive communication with Ledger devices, as well as a secure factory environment to avoid tampering or placing compromised devices. This is the second attempt to offer recovery to Ledger users, an answer to several high-profile cases of locked devices. However, the recovery feature also raises additional security issues for abusing the secondary PIN. Ledger Recovery debuts on Flex and Stax models Ledger Recovery is specifically tailored to the touchscreen products Ledger Flex and Ledger Stax. The new spare key is held in another secure device and can unlock the original Ledger device. A user can opt to create multiple spare keys, which are also generated online and protected. “ With Ledger Recovery Key we are making secure self-custody easy-to-use for everyone. Too many people are compromising by keeping their assets on exchanges and insecure software wallets. With Ledger Recover and now Ledger Recovery Key, as well as the traditional 24-words, we are proud to offer a recovery solution for every category of user.” ~ Ian Rogers, Chief experience officer at Ledger The new service will exist along with Ledger Recover, a paid feature that allows access to the device. However, Ledger Recover is a de-anonymizing service, requiring KYC. Some crypto owners remain skeptical of having their identity linked to crypto ownership, after multiple kidnapping cases . Ledger wallet owners have also been targeted , mostly to be pressured to unlock the device. The device itself can also be lost or abused in some cases. Ledger has already announced over 7.5 million total sales, becoming one of the leading tools for crypto hardware storage. Ledger introduces transaction check As Web3 usage increases, Ledger also boosted its software to intercept potentially harmful transactions. Ledger Transaction Check is the newest feature in Ledger Live, aiming at vetting transactions. The extra security is mostly targeted at Ethereum users. Transaction Check just hit Ledger Live: meet real-time threat detection for your Ethereum. Every time you want to sign a transaction, it scans to flag potential threats.

Tracked… pic.twitter.com/wur5EF7rPF — Ledger (@Ledger) June 23, 2025 While Ledger offers heightened security, signing with the devices may still be compromised. Bybit was reportedly using a Ledger Nano , but the exchange was still compromised via a multisig wallet that led to the loss of $1.4 billion. The feature adds more clarity to signing in an environment where malicious smart contracts can hijack the permission of Ethereum wallets, despite the secure hardware protection.

Brian Adesman, 32, is suing Chase Bank to recover $185,000 that was allegedly in his accounts when the bank closed them “without any notice,” reports The U.S. Sun. Adesman, a founding lawyer of the Miller Adesman law firm, says he had been a Chase Bank customer for more than a decade and had both personal and business accounts. “They refused to tell me why they were holding my money. No warning. No explanation. Just silence – while my credit score collapsed and debt collectors flooded my phone… This wasn’t just my business account. Chase shut down my personal and client trust accounts, too, without cause. It wasn’t policy enforcement. It was financial destruction.” Adesman claims the bank “destroyed” his life because after the financial institution seized his funds, he was forced to cancel his wedding and move into a caravan due to missing mortgage payments on his Los Angeles apartment. He allegedly filed complaints against the bank with government regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Attorney General and the Department of Financial Services. But more than a year later, he’s still fighting for restitution. A Chase Bank spokesman says, “We identified concerning transactions and took appropriate action as permitted by our account terms.” Chase Bank also points to a separate lawsuit filed by a company in New Jersey that claims it was duped into making fraudulent payments, including $3.7 million deposited into Adesman’s law firm’s account. Chase Bank, however, did not confirm whether the allegations led to the freezing of Adesman’s accounts. Adesman says he conducted no questionable transactions and suspects the bank flagged him solely after he received lawful settlement payments for legal services provided to a Mexican client. He also says he was unaware of the New Jersey legal case. “I was never told about, involving parties I’ve never heard of and facts I know nothing about and yet Chase is now pointing to it as some sort of retroactive justification for what they did to me.” In his initial suit, the lawyer says that Chase vowed to return some of his funds to the tune of $175,649 via a cashier’s check within 10 business days. But Adesman says he never received the promised check.

The U.S. financial landscape just delivered a resounding vote of confidence in the world of cryptocurrencies, specifically in Ethereum. On June 23, Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded an impressive total net inflow of $100.73 million , signaling a robust and growing institutional appetite for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This significant influx, reported by market observer Trader T on X, underscores a burgeoning interest that could reshape the future of crypto investment. What’s Driving the Latest Spot Ethereum ETFs Momentum? The recent surge in inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of increasing mainstream acceptance and institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. After a period of anticipation, the approval and subsequent launch of these ETFs have opened up a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This accessibility addresses concerns around custody, security, and regulatory compliance, making Ethereum an attractive proposition for a broader range of investors. Several factors contribute to this growing momentum: Regulatory Clarity: The SEC’s approval, even if somewhat unexpected, has provided a degree of regulatory clarity that institutional investors crave. This de-risks the asset class for many traditional funds. Diversification: For investors already holding Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs offer a valuable diversification tool within the digital asset sector, tapping into a different blockchain ecosystem with unique use cases. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Beyond price action, Ethereum continues to be the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast array of decentralized applications. Its ongoing development, including the transition to Proof-of-Stake and future scaling solutions, reinforces its utility and long-term value proposition. Market Maturation: The cryptocurrency market is evolving, moving beyond speculative retail trading to attract serious institutional capital, which views digital assets as a legitimate component of a diversified portfolio. Unpacking the Ethereum ETF Inflows: Who’s Leading the Charge? The Ethereum ETF inflows on June 23 were not evenly distributed, with some key players emerging as frontrunners in attracting capital. This provides valuable insight into which asset managers are successfully capturing investor interest in this nascent market segment. Here’s a breakdown of the leading contributors to the day’s net inflows: ETF Issuer Ticker Net Inflow (June 23) Fidelity FETH $60.48 million BlackRock ETHA $25.79 million Grayscale ETHE $9.01 million Grayscale (Mini) ETH $5.45 million Other ETFs – No Change Fidelity’s FETH clearly dominated the day’s inflows, capturing more than half of the total. This strong performance highlights Fidelity’s significant reach and trust among its client base, positioning it as a major player in the Ethereum ETF landscape right from the start. BlackRock’s ETHA also demonstrated a robust performance, underscoring its influence as the world’s largest asset manager entering the crypto space. Fidelity FETH and BlackRock ETHA: Powering the Surge The substantial contributions from Fidelity FETH and BlackRock ETHA are particularly noteworthy. These financial giants bring not only immense capital but also established distribution networks and a seal of legitimacy to the crypto market. Their active participation in attracting significant inflows suggests a concerted effort to offer diverse digital asset products to their vast clienteles. Fidelity’s Strategic Play: Fidelity has been a proactive player in the crypto space, offering various digital asset services. Their success with FETH indicates a strong alignment with investor demand for regulated crypto products. BlackRock’s Endorsement: BlackRock’s entry into the spot Bitcoin ETF market was a game-changer, and their strong showing with ETHA reinforces their long-term commitment to digital assets. Their involvement often acts as a beacon, drawing in other institutional investors who might have been hesitant previously. The combined force of these two titans driving the majority of the inflows signals a powerful shift. It moves Ethereum from a niche, speculative asset into a more widely accepted and investable instrument for traditional financial institutions and their clients. The Broader Impact on Crypto Investment and Market Sentiment These significant crypto investment inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs are more than just daily trading figures; they represent a fundamental shift in how digital assets are perceived and integrated into the global financial system. The positive sentiment generated by these inflows could have several ripple effects: Increased Liquidity: As more capital flows into these ETFs, it enhances the overall liquidity of the Ethereum market, making it more stable and efficient. Price Discovery: Institutional participation can lead to more robust price discovery mechanisms, potentially reducing volatility over the long term. Mainstream Adoption: The success of Ethereum ETFs paves the way for further institutional adoption of other digital assets, broadening the scope of the crypto market. Regulatory Precedent: The operational success of these ETFs could encourage regulators in other jurisdictions to consider similar products, fostering global crypto integration. While the initial inflows are promising, it’s crucial to remember that the ETF market is dynamic. Future performance will depend on sustained investor interest, overall market conditions, and regulatory developments. However, this strong start lays a solid foundation for Ethereum’s journey into mainstream finance. What Does This Mean for You, the Investor? For both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers, the emergence and success of spot Ethereum ETFs offer new avenues and considerations: Accessibility: If direct crypto ownership feels daunting, ETFs provide a regulated, familiar wrapper to gain exposure. Diversification: Consider how Ethereum ETFs fit into your existing investment portfolio, offering diversification beyond Bitcoin or traditional assets. Long-Term View: The institutional interest suggests a long-term belief in Ethereum’s utility and growth. While short-term volatility is always a factor in crypto, these inflows point towards a maturing asset class. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on ongoing inflow/outflow data, regulatory updates, and Ethereum’s ecosystem developments to make informed decisions. A Glimpse into Ethereum’s Bright Future The remarkable $100.73 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on June 23 marks a significant milestone. It’s a testament to Ethereum’s growing appeal and the increasing comfort of traditional finance with digital assets. As institutional giants like Fidelity and BlackRock continue to lead the charge, the path for Ethereum’s integration into mainstream investment portfolios appears clearer than ever. This initial surge of capital is not just a fleeting moment; it’s a powerful signal that the future of finance is increasingly intertwined with the innovation of blockchain technology.

With a somewhat patchy ceasefire now in force, there could be a calming of tensions in the Israel/Iran conflict. Will Bitcoin continue its latest rally? U.S. stock market: It’s like nothing happened Source: TradingView For the U.S. stock market it might have been that there was no escalating conflict in the Middle East. A strong trading day took the S&P 500 past the 6,000 point resistance with a near 1% move higher. As can be seen in the daily chart above, if the bulls can consolidate the price above 6,000, an all-time high will not be far away. That this recovery over the last few weeks has taken place amid huge geopolitical tensions and all the Trump tariffs repercussions says much for the inexorable march of increasing global liquidity. $BTC price shoots up to tag $106,000 resistance Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC reveals how the price shot up though resistance levels, flipping them into support, and how it just managed to touch the major resistance at $106,000 before falling back. Really, all this means is that the sideways price action has been regained, and any thoughts that the bears might have had to drag the price down much further have been stymied, at least for now. Now that the price has been rejected from $106,000, it may be that it turns back down as the short-term Stochastic RSIs seek to reset once again. This could take another few days. If the pullback is not too deep, this will give the bulls the chance to take out the $106,000 resistance on the next upward impulse. Bullish descending channel on daily time frame Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it does look like a large descending channel may have formed. This is generally a bullish candle pattern and the price has a greater expectation of exiting from the top rather than the bottom of the channel. Looking at the Stochastic RSI for the daily, it can be seen that the indicator lines are rising nicely from the bottom, indicating positive price momentum. At the very bottom of the chart is the RSI. This is showing that the indicator line has crossed above the yellow moving average line and could be about to cross up through the downtrend. Success or rejection could depend on today’s price action. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

After a sluggish start to the year, June 2025 is shaping up as a turning point—where market momentum, social sentiment, and raw innovation align across select tokens. But here’s the twist: it’s not just the usual suspects. New contenders are emerging from both ends of the crypto spectrum. With crypto markets gearing up for renewed momentum, June 2025 highlighted six coins showing strong signs of breakout potential. As attention shifts toward innovative Layer-1s and meme-driven ecosystems, here’s who’s leading the pack — and why one token might even threaten Cardano’s throne. Solana (SOL) Solana is reaffirming its strength in June, holding firm above the crucial support range around $140–$150. Fintech giants like R3 have backed a recent bloom in DeFi and developer activity. They partnered with banks such as HSBC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore to integrate Solana’s chain for asset tokenization. With ecosystem revenues surpassing $1 billion over two quarters and a network boasting over 3,200 developers, Solana remains at the forefront of scalable blockchain solutions. As demand for high-throughput chains increases, SOL looks ready to rally past its all-time high this year. Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Fartcoin is still riding the meme coin rollercoaster—but the hype has cooled off quite a bit lately. After a peak near $1.50 earlier in June, it’s now trading around $0.86. Its market cap is hovering near $850 million. It’s one of the more active meme tokens listed on major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance in the US. While volatile and high-risk, Fartcoin’s current trend gains traction as meme season intensifies, offering outsized gains for risk-tolerant investors. Toncoin (TON) Toncoin has recently dipped below the $3 mark, currently trading around $2.70–$2.80. It had been in a $3.00–$3.20 consolidation zone, but that level recently broke downward. Analyst sentiment is mixed; technical indicators lean bearish in the short term. On the other hand, its integration with Telegram’s crypto ecosystem remains its strongest long-term thesis. The narrative still holds: TON benefits from real-world usage inside a massive messaging platform. With growing usage across the Open Network (TON) blockchain for messaging, DeFi, and tokenized assets, it could rebound and spark serious investor interest. Sui (SUI) Sui has grabbed headlines in June by retesting previous highs near $4–$5. This was driven by bullish 50-day EMA crossovers and growing anticipation of listing on major platforms, such as Robinhood. While June saw weakness in the range of $2.09–$2.26, analysts remain optimistic about a rebound to $5–$7 if its ecosystem continues to mature. As a next-gen Layer-1 with rapid throughput and a budding developer base, Sui is a proven breakout candidate. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) Virtuals Protocol has posted strong annual growth, though recent performance shows over 30% correction. Still, its $1.30 market price ranks it comfortably within the top 100 cryptos. The token draws attention for powering on-chain virtual asset platforms, and its recent 52% monthly growth suggests strong cyclical upside. For investors tracking tech-forward Layer-1 infrastructure, VIRTUAL offers high-beta exposure in a still-developing niche. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – the meme-layer challenger to ADA Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) stands out as a powerhouse in the meme space, but what truly sets it apart is its ambition to rival chains like Cardano. $LILPEPE is the brainchild of meme coin veterans, packaged not as a token but as a dedicated Layer‑2 blockchain built for meme token deployment. Currently in Stage 3 of its presale at $0.0012, the project has raised over $1.69 million and sold nearly 1.55 billion of its 2.25 billion token supply in Stage three. This isn’t a slapdash project. Core features include a zero-tax environment, anti-bot launch safeguards, and a built-in Pepe’s Pump Pad launchpad for vetting and deploying new meme tokens with locked liquidity. Tokenomics support long-term engagement with 13.5% earmarked for staking, while liquidity and marketing allocations ensure sustainable growth. Where ADA thrives on careful rollouts and governance, Little Pepe is targeting a new era of meme-first blockchain design. Its ease of use, low cost, and immersive community hype give it a real shot at siphoning early adopter attention and capital. And influencers are strongly behind it. These influencers have promoted Little Pepe across various platforms, sparking major conversations about this new ADA challenger. Early adopters can enter before the next price tier is $0.0013. With planned ecosystem expansion (launchpad, staking, CEX listings), Little Pepe is well-positioned to outperform traditional meme coins and legacy Layer-1 players in an environment where speculative adoption is key. Little Pepe offers an almost unfair advantage: timing, structure, and narrative fuel its climb to prominence. Conclusion June’s crypto pulse is precise: investors are shifting toward innovation-focused projects with developer traction, memetic momentum, or both. Solana and Sui anchor the utility side, while Fartcoin and Virtuals offer high-beta meme exposure. Toncoin is a sleeper pick gaining institutional and on-chain activity. In the center stands Little Pepe —not only the strongest meme-layer candidate but also a direct challenger to chains like Cardano in terms of narrative, community, and tokenomics design. If 2025’s bull cycles reward speed, hype, and breakout capability, these six are poised for the next wave.

However, analysts warn that the downtrend may not be over yet, as projections point to a deeper price crash toward $94,000 soon. According to Bitcoin’s Elliott Wave count, the cryptocurrency is currently in a vulnerable phase that may trigger more losses, despite the market’s efforts to rebound. Still, the analyst notes that the next move after this projected crash could see Bitcoin potentially reversing upward to new levels. Bitcoin Faces Epic Crash As Wave 2 Unfolds Luca, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), has unveiled a foreboding forecast for the Bitcoin price, warning that the flagship cryptocurrency could still be headed for more pain in the short term. The analyst has outlined an Elliott Wave count for Bitcoin that suggests that the cryptocurrency has not bottomed yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again According to the 8-hour chart breakdown, Bitcoin is in the midst of completing a Wave 2 correction within a broader bullish trend. The chart shows a five-wave corrective structure unfolding, with the final leg potentially leading to a price crash toward the $94,000 support region. This level aligns with both the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement and a key support zone. While Luca reveals that some signs indicate that the correction might have bottomed already, the analyst maintains that one final push lower remains possible before Bitcoin’s next bullish move. The projected dip toward $94,000 is framed as the concluding move of the internal Wave (v) of Wave 2, creating what could be a textbook completion of a corrective cycle. With the Bitcoin price currently sitting above the $100,000 psychological level at $105,574, a decline to $94,000 would represent a massive blow to its slowly recovering value. Despite the possibility of an upcoming bullish move, this 11.3% decline from current prices could significantly slow down BTC’s momentum, putting more strain on the already volatile market. Nevertheless, Luca suggests that this decline could present a prime accumulation opportunity, indicating that now may be a favorable time to buy Bitcoin. Game-Changing Reversal With Wave 3 Push Despite the potential for a further pullback, Luca’s broader outlook for Bitcoin remains highly bullish. The Elliott Wave count on the chart signals that BTC is preparing to exit Wave 2 and initiate Wave 3—one of the most powerful phases in the five-wave structure. Once the projected correction to the $94,000 level concludes, Luca expects a strong reversal that could catapult the cryptocurrency to new ATHs. Related Reading: Crypto Pundit Reveals Why This Bitcoin Bull Market Feels Different As Crypto Enters ‘New Era’ A large purple upward arrow on the chart visualizes the anticipated Wave 3 surge, pointing toward a possible target zone above $122,000. This projection is rooted in the technical and historical tendency for Wave 3 to be the steepest and most aggressive wave in the Elliott Wave cycle. With Bitcoin still hovering near a high-confluence support zone, the stage appears set for a decisive rebound in the coming weeks, provided macro conditions don’t shift dramatically.

According to the Competition and Markets Authority, Google could be required to implement new “fair ranking” measures in its search results and give publishers more control over how it uses their content, including in output generated by artificial intelligence. The CMA has justified granting Google “strategic market status” — a label introduced under new digital market laws this year — because of its dominant position in search and search advertising, which would require the tech giant to abide by a number of such conduct rules. CMA takes first steps to improve competition in search services in the UK. We’ve proposed to designate Google with strategic market status under the new Digital Markets Competition Regime. https://t.co/hla7I5b56K — Competition & Markets Authority (@CMAgovUK) June 24, 2025 Regulator accuses Google of using market power to stifle competition A final decision is expected to come by October following a public consultation. However, it does not seem like Google is willing to let the attack slide. The search engine company has tagged the proposals “broad and unfocused,” even claiming they could threaten the UK’s access to its latest products and services. The Big Tech giant was one of the first companies to be targeted under strict new digital laws, which require businesses with an outsized impact in certain digital markets to be granted the SMS label and subjected to specific rules. The CMA’s investigation, which began in January, has been trying to determine whether Google’s position in search and advertising is “delivering good outcomes” for people and businesses in the UK. It found that Google’s dominance actually makes the cost of search advertising “higher than would be expected” in a more competitive market. CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell concedes that Google’s search engine has delivered significant benefits; however, the regulator sees opportunities to make the market more competitive and innovative. Other key proposals the CMA is considering include: requirements in how it ranks its search results and for Google’s distribution partners, who include Apple, to offer “choice screens” which could help people more easily switch between search providers instead of being offered the world’s most used search engine by default. Google’s senior director for competition, Oliver Bethell, called the scope of the CMA’s considerations broad and unfocused, with a range of interventions being considered. According to him, “punitive regulations” could alter how quickly Google launches new products in the UK and ultimately become a roadblock to growth. Google struggles to stave off EU antitrust fines The CMA’s proposed enforcement draws comparisons to the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which has imposed stricter rules and hefty fines on the search engine giant for similar reasons. Some months ago, the European Commission accused Google of favoring its own services over rivals in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). In response to that, Google proposed more changes to its search results to better showcase rivals. Under the new proposal, a vertical search service (VSS) selected on objective and non-discriminatory criteria would get its own box at the top of the search page with the same format, information and features as Google’s. The box would contain three direct links picked by the VSS, to hotels, airlines, restaurants and transport, while other VSS, which are specialized search engines within Google, would be ranked below but without a box unless users click on them. “We do not agree with the (Commission’s) preliminary findings’ position but, on a without prejudice basis, we want to find a workable solution to resolve the present proceedings,” the documents sent by both Google and the Commission to the rivals read. The proposals to adjust search result displays have been deemed insufficient by competitors. The CMA’s approach is described as more targeted than the EU’s, even though concerns remain about enforcement effectiveness and Google’s ability to adapt without significant market share loss.

For an unprecedented tenth consecutive trading day, these groundbreaking investment vehicles have recorded substantial net inflows, culminating in a remarkable $350.48 million on June 23 alone. This sustained accumulation is not merely a fleeting trend; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s burgeoning role in mainstream finance and a clear indicator of burgeoning institutional confidence. The Unstoppable Momentum of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A New Era for Digital Assets? The consistent performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs has captured the attention of investors worldwide. This impressive streak of net inflows, now spanning ten trading days, signifies a pivotal shift in the investment landscape. What began as a niche asset for early adopters has rapidly evolved into a legitimate component of diversified portfolios, largely facilitated by the accessibility and regulatory clarity offered by these ETFs. This sustained accumulation points to several fundamental drivers: Institutional Validation: Major financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products, viewing them as a safer and more compliant entry point than direct cryptocurrency purchases. Ease of Access: For a vast segment of the investment community, particularly those operating under strict mandates or preferring traditional brokerage platforms, spot Bitcoin ETFs remove significant barriers to entry, simplifying exposure to the digital asset. Market Maturation: The consistent demand from institutional players contributes significantly to the overall maturation and stability of the cryptocurrency market, gradually reducing its perceived volatility and enhancing its appeal as a long-term store of value. Macroeconomic Hedging: In an era of persistent inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin’s narrative as a potential hedge against traditional financial system vulnerabilities continues to resonate with sophisticated investors. The cumulative effect of these factors is creating a robust demand environment for Bitcoin, with ETFs acting as the primary conduit for this institutional capital. Diving Deep into Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Who’s Leading the Charge in This Financial Revolution? A closer examination of the specific contributions to these monumental Bitcoin ETF inflows reveals a dynamic competitive landscape among the various fund providers. On June 23, the distribution of inflows highlighted clear market leaders: ETF Ticker Provider Net Inflow (USD) IBIT BlackRock $217.65 million FBTC Fidelity $105.66 million BITB Bitwise $14.57 million BTC Grayscale (mini BTC) $10.06 million BTCO Invesco $6.18 million ARKB Ark Invest $2.05 million As the table illustrates, BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC continue to dominate, leveraging their brand recognition, extensive distribution networks, and competitive fee structures to attract the lion’s share of new capital. This strong performance by traditional financial powerhouses underscores the significant shift of institutional funds into the digital asset space. Understanding the Dynamics of BTC ETFs: Winners, Outliers, and Market Evolution While the overall trend for BTC ETFs is undeniably positive, it’s essential to analyze the nuances within the market. On June 23, one significant outlier was Grayscale’s GBTC, which recorded a net outflow of $5.69 million. This outflow, while modest compared to the massive inflows into other funds, is part of a broader, ongoing trend for GBTC since its conversion from a trust to a spot ETF in January. Early investors, who previously faced limited redemption options, are now able to exit their positions, often migrating to newer, more cost-effective Bitcoin ETF alternatives. This dynamic is a natural consequence of increased competition and market maturity. The remaining ETFs in the market reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating stability in their existing investor base. The emergence of these diverse ETF options has created a more competitive environment, ultimately benefiting investors by offering a range of choices with varying fee structures and management styles. BlackRock IBIT’s Dominance: A Closer Look at the Institutional Behemoth The consistent and overwhelming success of BlackRock IBIT in attracting significant capital is a defining narrative in the current Bitcoin ETF landscape. On June 23, IBIT alone accounted for over 60% of the total net inflows, pulling in $217.65 million. This sustained leadership can be attributed to several strategic advantages: Brand Trust: BlackRock’s unparalleled reputation as the world’s largest asset manager instills immense confidence in institutional and retail investors alike. Vast Distribution Network: Their extensive reach across financial advisors, brokerages, and institutional clients provides a direct pipeline for capital. Competitive Fees: While not the absolute lowest, IBIT’s fee structure is highly competitive, making it an attractive long-term holding. Proactive Engagement: BlackRock has actively engaged with the crypto community and regulators, demonstrating a serious commitment to the asset class. IBIT’s performance is a strong indicator that institutional capital is not just testing the waters but making substantial, long-term commitments to Bitcoin. This fund’s continued growth sets a benchmark for the industry and signals a robust appetite for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Grayscale GBTC: Navigating the Outflow Landscape and Future Prospects The story of Grayscale GBTC is one of transformation and adaptation. For years, it served as the primary, albeit imperfect, vehicle for U.S. investors to gain Bitcoin exposure through a regulated product. However, its conversion to a spot ETF unleashed significant selling pressure. The $5.69 million outflow on June 23 is a continuation of this trend, as investors move out of what was once a premium-traded trust into more liquid, lower-fee ETF options. Many long-term holders are realizing gains or reallocating their capital to optimize their investment strategies. Despite the outflows, GBTC remains the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management. Its future trajectory will depend on its ability to retain its remaining investor base and potentially attract new capital if its fee structure becomes more competitive. The outflows are not necessarily a negative reflection on Bitcoin itself, but rather a reflection of market efficiency and investor preference for more optimized products. Broader Implications: What Do These Sustained Inflows Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? The consistent net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs carry profound and far-reaching implications for Bitcoin and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. They suggest: Enhanced Price Stability: The steady absorption of Bitcoin by large institutional players can reduce market volatility and provide a more stable price floor, as significant buying pressure offsets potential sell-offs. Accelerated Mainstream Adoption: The success of these ETFs serves as a powerful catalyst for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional financial portfolios, encouraging broader acceptance among conservative investors and financial advisors. Increased Liquidity and Market Depth: As more capital flows into the market through ETFs, the overall liquidity of Bitcoin increases, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. Regulatory Confidence: The sustained interest and capital commitment from regulated entities signal growing confidence in the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets, potentially paving the way for further innovation and product development. Potential for Supply Shock: With a finite supply of Bitcoin, continuous large-scale accumulation by ETFs could eventually lead to a supply crunch, potentially driving up the asset’s value in the long term if demand continues to outpace available supply. While the cryptocurrency market will always retain a degree of volatility, the robust demand evidenced by these ETF inflows provides a compelling bullish narrative for Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and its eventual role as a cornerstone of the global financial system. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape For both seasoned crypto enthusiasts and newcomers, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs offers valuable insights: For New Investors: These ETFs provide a straightforward, regulated, and secure way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of managing private keys or navigating cryptocurrency exchanges. It’s an ideal entry point for those looking for traditional investment vehicles. For Existing Bitcoin Holders: While direct ownership remains a popular choice, ETFs can be used for diversification within a portfolio, or for tax-advantaged accounts where direct crypto ownership might be complicated. Consider Fees: Always compare the expense ratios of different ETFs. While BlackRock and Fidelity lead in inflows, other funds might offer competitive or even lower fees that could impact long-term returns. Understand Volatility: Even with institutional adoption, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Investors should only allocate capital they are prepared to lose and ensure it aligns with their risk tolerance and investment horizon. Stay Informed: The market is dynamic. Keep an eye on ongoing inflows/outflows, regulatory developments, and broader macroeconomic trends that could influence Bitcoin’s price and ETF performance. These ETFs are not just a product; they are a bridge, connecting the burgeoning world of digital assets with the established architecture of traditional finance. In conclusion, the astounding run of ten consecutive days of net inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, capped by the impressive $350.48 million on June 23, unequivocally underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance and formidable presence in mainstream investment portfolios. This relentless capital infusion, spearheaded by giants like BlackRock’s IBIT and supported by other major players, signals a profound shift from speculative interest to strategic institutional allocation. While Grayscale’s GBTC navigates its unique transition, the overall narrative is one of robust demand, increasing liquidity, and an accelerating pathway towards Bitcoin’s full integration into global finance. This trend not only validates Bitcoin’s resilience and potential but also sets a powerful precedent for its continued ascent as a legitimate and indispensable asset in the evolving economic landscape.

As fear swept through financial markets due to a worsening geopolitical crisis, Shiba Inu’s team issued a statement aimed at restoring calm and reaffirming its long-term commitment. Geopolitical Shockwaves Hit Crypto Markets The broader cryptocurrency sector endured heavy losses after international tensions reached a new high point. The catalyst came when President Donald Trump announced that U.S. military forces had neutralized three nuclear facilities in Iran. This move followed increasingly aggressive warnings from Iran’s Supreme Leader, who vowed consequences if the U.S. intervened in its confrontation with Israel. This escalation introduced a wave of uncertainty, triggering a rapid selloff across digital asset markets, causing assets like XRP to briefly lose crucial support . Amid the chaos, many traders sought to limit risk, and Shiba Inu was among the cryptocurrencies hit hard by this downward movement. Shiba Inu Community Urged to Avoid Rash Decisions Amid this downturn, Shiba Inu’s leadership moved swiftly to address the community. Lucie (@LucieSHIB), the project’s lead on marketing and communications, encouraged supporters to avoid panic and maintain confidence in the project’s direction. Rather than making short-term decisions based on price movements, she emphasized the importance of staying committed to the broader vision. Her statement positioned the recent price action as temporary and disconnected from Shiba Inu’s long-term trajectory. In her words, “If we haven’t won yet, it’s because it’s not over.” Panic is not an option. If we haven’t won yet, it’s because it’s not over. — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) June 22, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 SHIB Hits Lowest Point Since February 2024 As the selling pressure intensified, Shiba Inu’s price slid to $0.00001010, marking its lowest level since February 2024. Although the token has recovered most of its losses, the drop has renewed anxiety among community members who are closely watching market conditions. The situation shows the fragility of sentiment during global instability, as even assets with dedicated communities and active development can be impacted by external forces beyond their control. Other negative events, such as the recent theft and destruction of over $90 million in digital assets from Nobitex, Iran’s largest crypto exchange, have contributed to the bearish market pressure. Optimism About SHIB Future Remains Intact Lucie has previously spoken about ambitious targets for SHIB, including the possibility of the token reaching $0.01 , and even floated a hypothetical scenario in which SHIB climbs as high as $1 . However, she has made it clear that these are long-range goals, not short-term predictions, and should be understood in that context. Currently, SHIB trades at $0.00001157, showing a weekly decline of just over 2% as it is slowly building its way back up.

The rally came after a ceasefire was announced to ease escalating geopolitical tensions. The price surge followed a turbulent weekend driven by U.S. and Israeli military activity on Iran, making it a bearish June’s third week. With Monday’s advancement, a new week has begun for the XRP price . XRP Price Prediction For Next 24 Hours Metric Price (USD) Reason 24H High $2.33 Projected strong resistance level; target if bullish momentum continues. 24H Low $2.08 Key support zone; losing this may break short-term bullish structure. 24H Average Price $2.20 – $2.23 Estimated average based on recovery from $1.90 and current range movement. XRP Price Dips to Monthly Low Amid Geopolitical Tensions The 3-hour chart displays the impact of recent geopolitical events that briefly pushed the XRP price below the key multi-day psychological support zone. As a result, XRP price marked June month’s low at $1.90 from $2.33, eroding 18%. However, the XRP crypto showed immediate recovery on June 23rd. When writing, the recovery from the “weak low” has pushed XRP price 14% higher to $2.18, with $5.15 billion 24-hour trading volume and $129.08 Billion market capitalization. The short-term recovery has changed the short-term trend as it has broken the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, and as a result, the short-term structure has attained a “Change of Character (ChoCh).” The reason behind the rise was a short-term bullish conviction developed by the ceasefire news. This is also evident on-chain, as whale transaction count has increased, and exchange outflow has spiked. This shows that investors have not panicked as much as they did in the last few months, which is evident in evaluating metrics like age consumed and network realized profit/loss. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : What’s Next for XRP, ADA, and BTC Prices? , This indicates that a lot of buying on the dip happened, then panic selling, and it appears that the short-term rally is not over yet. 7% Move on the Horizon? Key Levels to Watch There are higher odds that in the next 24 hours, the continued “break of structure (BoS)” could take XRP price towards the short-term trend’s “strong high” at $2.33, which is a critical resistance level for tomorrow. While $2.08 would support tomorrow’s price action, retesting this support would shatter short-term bullish conviction, but if it rises, then a 7% big move is likely in the next 24 hours. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Now let’s discuss BMT price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Bubblemaps price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the BMT token? Let’s dive into the BMT price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Bubblemaps coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Bubblemaps price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to drop by -25.22% and reach $0.105093 by July 23, 2025. As of June. 24th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the BMT price outlook is bullish, with 9 technical analysis indicators showing bullish signals, 1 indicating a bearish trend, and 11 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Bubblemaps price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the BMT token’s price could fluctuate between $0.12 and $0.29, and may likely hold a yearly average of $0.27. CoinCodex projects that the BMT token can trade in the price channel of $0.097928 and $0.140529 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is essential to recognize that this prediction also carries a risk of being incorrect. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in BMT or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Bubblemaps price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Bubblemaps crypto price prediction for 2030, BMT’s price could vary between $0.299035 and $0.542074. DigitalCoinPrice expects that BMT’s price could climb to $0.64 or $0.74 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the BMT price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the BMT token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including BMT. A great way for BMT to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the BMT token.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including BMT, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Additionally, it is worth noting that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market can change rapidly, and a token that was once considered a future investment may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the BMT token. Will Bubblemaps go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is challenging to predict the exact value of the BMT token, it is essential to watch for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Bubblemaps price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low BMT can go. Should I invest in Bubblemaps? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or relying on a Bubblemaps price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks associated with market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the BMT token.

The recent announcement from the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) might just be the news you’ve been waiting for, or at least, a significant step towards clarity. William Pulte, Director of the FHFA, recently shared on X that the agency is embarking on a crucial study to understand how cryptocurrency holdings impact an individual’s eligibility for mortgages. This isn’t just a fleeting headline; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine how digital assets are viewed in the traditional financial landscape, especially concerning mortgage qualification . What’s Driving the FHFA Crypto Policy Study? The FHFA, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac – two giants in the U.S. housing finance market – plays a pivotal role in setting standards for mortgage lending. When Director Pulte announced the agency’s intention to delve into FHFA crypto policy , it signaled a recognition of the growing presence of digital assets in the financial portfolios of many Americans. For years, crypto holders have faced a unique hurdle when applying for home loans: how do lenders assess assets that are volatile, largely unregulated, and often held outside traditional banking systems? This study is a direct response to the evolving financial landscape. As more people accumulate significant wealth in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the disconnect between their digital assets and their ability to qualify for a conventional mortgage has become increasingly apparent. The FHFA’s move suggests a proactive approach to bridge this gap, aiming to develop a more comprehensive and fair framework for evaluating these modern forms of wealth. The agency’s primary goal will likely be to understand the risks and opportunities associated with including crypto assets in mortgage underwriting. This includes addressing concerns around price volatility, regulatory compliance, and the liquidity of various digital assets. By initiating this study, the FHFA is taking a crucial step towards potentially integrating digital wealth into the mainstream housing finance system, a development that could have profound implications for millions. The FHFA’s groundbreaking study could reshape the future of homeownership for crypto holders. How Might Cryptocurrency Mortgages Evolve? Currently, using cryptocurrency mortgages as direct collateral or as proof of funds for a home loan is a complex and often prohibitive process. Traditional lenders prefer stable, easily verifiable assets like fiat currency in bank accounts, stocks, or bonds. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a risky proposition for lenders who need assurance that a borrower’s assets will maintain their value over the loan term. However, the FHFA study could pave the way for new approaches. Imagine a future where your Bitcoin holdings, perhaps converted into a stablecoin or held in a regulated trust, could contribute directly to your down payment or serve as a recognized asset for your loan application. This evolution wouldn’t happen overnight, but the study is the first critical step. Here’s a simplified comparison of how mortgage assessments might look today versus a potential future where crypto is integrated: Aspect Current Mortgage Assessment (Typical) Potential Future Mortgage Assessment (with Crypto Integration) Recognized Assets Bank deposits, stocks, bonds, retirement accounts. Traditional assets PLUS regulated crypto holdings (e.g., stablecoins, tokenized assets, verifiable exchange balances). Income Verification W-2s, pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements showing consistent income. Traditional income verification PLUS potentially verifiable crypto-derived income (e.g., staking rewards, DeFi yields, with clear tax records). Risk Assessment Credit score, debt-to-income ratio, stable asset valuation. Traditional metrics PLUS new frameworks for assessing crypto volatility and liquidity risk, potentially requiring specific types of crypto or holding periods. Collateral Options Primarily the property itself. Property PLUS potentially certain crypto assets as supplementary collateral, perhaps with higher loan-to-value (LTV) requirements or specific risk mitigations. This potential shift could open up homeownership to a segment of the population that has been effectively locked out due to their wealth being primarily in digital form. It signifies a move towards financial inclusivity, acknowledging modern wealth creation methods. Understanding the Crypto Impact on Mortgages: Challenges and Opportunities The crypto impact on mortgages is multifaceted, presenting both significant hurdles and exciting possibilities. Addressing these will be central to the FHFA’s study. Challenges: Price Volatility: The most obvious challenge. How can a lender rely on an asset that can fluctuate 20% or more in a single day? The study will need to explore mechanisms to mitigate this risk, perhaps through requiring higher reserves, using stablecoins, or implementing dynamic collateral adjustments. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, comprehensive federal regulation for cryptocurrencies poses a significant hurdle. Lenders need clear guidelines on anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) compliance, and how to handle crypto assets in the event of default or bankruptcy. Valuation and Custody: Accurately valuing diverse crypto assets, especially less liquid ones, is complex. Furthermore, secure custody solutions that are recognized and trusted by traditional financial institutions are essential. Source of Funds Verification: Lenders are legally obligated to verify the legitimate source of funds for down payments. Crypto transactions, especially those involving peer-to-peer transfers or older wallets, can be difficult to trace and verify to the stringent standards required for mortgage lending. Opportunities: Expanded Borrower Pool: Acknowledging crypto wealth could significantly expand the pool of eligible homebuyers, especially among younger generations who have embraced digital assets. Innovation in Lending: This could spur innovation in lending products, potentially leading to hybrid mortgages that blend traditional and crypto-backed elements, or even decentralized finance (DeFi) lending models that integrate with traditional real estate. Alternative Collateral: For borrowers with substantial crypto holdings but limited traditional liquid assets, their digital wealth could serve as supplementary collateral, potentially lowering interest rates or improving loan terms. Efficiency Gains: In the long term, if crypto rails are used for parts of the mortgage process (e.g., smart contracts for escrow), it could lead to faster, more transparent, and more efficient transactions. Navigating Mortgage Qualification Crypto: Actionable Insights for Homebuyers While the FHFA study is underway, crypto holders shouldn’t wait passively. Understanding how to best position your assets for future mortgage qualification crypto opportunities is crucial. Here are some actionable insights: Maintain Meticulous Records: Document every crypto transaction, including purchase dates, prices, and sources. This includes exchange statements, wallet histories, and any relevant tax forms. Transparency and verifiable records will be paramount. Understand Tax Implications: Ensure you are fully compliant with all tax regulations regarding your crypto holdings and any gains. Lenders will scrutinize your financial history, and clear tax records demonstrate financial responsibility. Consider “Seasoning” Your Crypto: If you anticipate using crypto for a down payment, consider converting a portion into fiat currency and holding it in a traditional bank account for several months (typically 60-90 days, known as “seasoning”). This makes the funds appear more stable and verifiable to lenders. Consult a Financial Advisor: Seek advice from a financial professional who understands both traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. They can help you structure your assets in a way that maximizes your chances of mortgage approval in the current and future landscapes. Stay Informed: Follow updates from the FHFA and other regulatory bodies. The outcome of this study will directly influence future mortgage guidelines. Build a Strong Credit Profile: Regardless of your crypto holdings, a robust credit score and a low debt-to-income ratio remain fundamental to mortgage qualification. By taking these proactive steps, you can better prepare yourself for a future where your digital assets might play a more direct role in your homeownership journey. The Future of Digital Asset Home Loans The FHFA’s study marks a significant turning point for digital asset home loans . While the immediate outcome is uncertain, the very act of undertaking this study signals a growing acceptance and seriousness with which traditional finance views cryptocurrencies. We could see several potential scenarios unfold: One possibility is the introduction of specific guidelines for how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should consider crypto assets. This might involve requiring crypto to be held with regulated custodians, specific seasoning periods, or limits on the percentage of crypto assets that can contribute to a down payment. Another outcome could be pilot programs that test new lending models, perhaps involving stablecoins as collateral or using blockchain technology for more efficient property title transfers. In the long term, this initiative could accelerate the integration of blockchain technology and digital assets into the broader real estate and lending ecosystems. Imagine tokenized real estate, where fractional ownership is facilitated by blockchain, or mortgages executed via smart contracts, reducing intermediaries and costs. While these are more futuristic visions, the FHFA’s current study lays the groundwork for such innovations by legitimizing the discussion around crypto and housing. This isn’t just about making it easier to buy a house with crypto; it’s about building a more inclusive and technologically advanced financial system that reflects the diverse ways individuals hold and manage their wealth in the 21st century. The study will undoubtedly lead to a more nuanced understanding of crypto’s role in personal finance, ultimately shaping policies that could benefit millions of aspiring homeowners. In conclusion, the FHFA’s decision to study the relationship between cryptocurrency holdings and mortgage qualification is a landmark event. It signifies a crucial step towards acknowledging digital assets within the traditional housing finance system. While challenges like volatility and regulatory uncertainty persist, the potential benefits—from expanding the pool of eligible homebuyers to fostering innovation in lending—are immense. For crypto holders, this is a call to action: stay informed, meticulously document your assets, and prepare for a future where your digital wealth could genuinely unlock the door to your dream home. This study isn’t just about policy; it’s about progress, paving the way for a more integrated and accessible financial future for all.

The 37-year-old businessman turned policymaker, sworn in as FHFA director on March 14 after being nominated by President Donald Trump, made the announcement via social media. “ We will study the usage of cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages ,” he posted on X. We will study the usage pf cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages. — Pulte (@pulte) June 24, 2025 The FHFA oversees most parameters of the US housing market, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. It could push traditional mortgage lenders who have largely excluded crypto holdings from eligibility calculations to start accepting digital assets from homebuyers. Pulte pushes for crypto-backed house mortgages Pulte is the founder of Pulte Capital Partners and the grandson of William Pulte, who founded Pulte Homes, currently the third-largest homebuilder in the United States. His financial disclosures earlier this year revealed that he holds between $500,001 and $1,000,000 each in Bitcoin and Solana. The crypto-related investments also include shares in Marathon Digital Holdings , now rebranded as MARA, the well-known US-based bitcoin mining company. The portfolio also carries meme stocks like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond, and shares in Tesla, Palantir, and ventures linked to YouTube celebrity MrBeast. Pulte made his first crypto purchase of 11 BTC in 2019, in which he later pledged to give away crypto to followers on X, although the post is now de l eted . He is also a known supporter of Donald Trump’s political campaign, having donated $6,600 to the president’s 2024 re-election bid, along with contributions to Save America PAC and the Republican National Committee, according to filings by OpenSecrets. Crypto could be considered in mortgage lending Under current lending standards, most US mortgage providers do not accept direct crypto payments like Bitcoin or Ethereum to service home loans. Yet, proceeds from the sale of cryptocurrencies can be used for down payments or to cover closing costs, provided the funds can be verified and documented. Steven Glick, director of mortgage sales at HomeAbroad, notes that lenders prioritize the stability and traceability of funds. “ The lender needs to see that your funds are stable and not borrowed ,” Glick said. He explained that borrowers must convert their crypto holdings to US dollars through recognized exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken, then transfer the proceeds to a conventional bank account. Andrew Lokenauth, a personal finance consultant, explained to the Mortgage Research Network about a client who successfully converted $100,000 in Ethereum into a mortgage down payment. “ We documented every step, including the sale on Coinbase, the transfer to his bank, and two months of statements showing the money remained there ,” Lokenauth said. “ The rule of thumb is that a clean paper trail equals a happy mortgage underwriter. ” Documentation must include transaction records from the crypto exchange, deposit confirmations from the bank, and at least 60 days of “seasoning” where funds remain untouched. Lenders may also require evidence that the crypto was not obtained through a loan or margin account to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. “ If you can’t prove it, in the lender’s eyes you don’t own it ,” insisted mortgage advisor Cooling, reiterating that undocumented funds could disqualify a borrower. Outside of traditional banking, a group of crypto lenders could soon begin offering mortgage services based on digital assets. Thomas Franklin, CEO and founder of Swapped.com, a crypto brokerage firm, reckons the “fear” over crypto mortgages is often exaggerated.

This isn’t just another headline; it’s a pivotal moment that signals maturity and strategic growth within the cryptocurrency space. Bitcoin Treasury has officially completed a major amalgamation, a move that not only reshapes its corporate structure but also paves the way for a highly anticipated TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) listing. For anyone tracking the pulse of digital asset investment, this development is nothing short of compelling. What’s Next for Bitcoin Treasury After its Landmark Merger? In a strategic move that underscores its commitment to expansion and market presence, Bitcoin Treasury Corporation has successfully finalized its previously announced amalgamation. This significant corporate action involved merging with 2680083 Alberta Ltd., creating a unified entity that will continue to operate under the well-recognized Bitcoin Treasury name and business. This ensures continuity while leveraging the strengths of both parties. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, the integration was seamless, allowing the merged company to immediately focus on its ambitious future plans. This amalgamation is more than just a corporate restructuring; it’s a foundational step. By consolidating operations and assets, Bitcoin Treasury aims to enhance its operational efficiency, streamline its strategic initiatives, and solidify its position within the competitive digital asset landscape. This move is designed to create a more robust and agile organization, better equipped to navigate the dynamic market conditions inherent in blockchain finance. Why is a TSXV Listing a Game-Changer for Digital Asset Investment? Perhaps the most exciting development following the merger is Bitcoin Treasury’s submission of a listing application to the TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) for its common shares. While final approval is pending, this step represents a monumental leap for a company deeply embedded in the digital asset space. A TSXV listing offers several compelling advantages: Increased Visibility and Legitimacy: Listing on a recognized public exchange like the TSXV provides a significant boost in credibility and visibility. It opens the doors to a broader base of traditional investors, including institutional funds, who might otherwise be hesitant to engage directly with private crypto ventures. Enhanced Liquidity: Public trading typically leads to greater liquidity for the company’s shares, making it easier for investors to buy and sell. This can attract more capital and improve market efficiency. Access to Capital Markets: A public listing provides a more structured and accessible pathway for future capital raises, enabling the company to fund further growth and innovation without relying solely on private placements. Regulatory Oversight: Operating under the purview of a regulated exchange brings a layer of transparency and governance that can instill greater confidence among investors, distinguishing the company from less regulated entities in the crypto sphere. The journey to a full TSXV listing involves rigorous due diligence and compliance with exchange requirements. The successful completion of this process would not only be a triumph for Bitcoin Treasury but also a significant milestone for the broader acceptance of digital asset investment within traditional financial markets. How Does This Crypto Merger Impact the Broader Blockchain Finance Landscape? The amalgamation of Bitcoin Treasury Corporation and 2680083 Alberta Ltd. is a prime example of a growing trend: consolidation within the cryptocurrency and blockchain sectors. This particular crypto merger highlights a strategic response to market maturation, where companies seek to combine resources, expertise, and market share to achieve greater scale and resilience. Such mergers can lead to: Synergistic Operations: Combining two entities can result in shared technologies, reduced operational costs, and integrated teams that foster innovation. Stronger Market Position: A larger, more capitalized entity often holds a stronger competitive advantage, capable of undertaking larger projects and attracting top talent. Paving the Way for Others: Successful mergers and subsequent public listings set a precedent, potentially encouraging other private crypto companies to pursue similar paths towards traditional financial markets. This crypto merger isn’t just about the entities involved; it signals a broader shift towards more mature, institutionally-friendly structures in the digital asset space. It reflects a desire for stability and long-term growth, moving beyond the speculative early days of crypto. Fueling Growth: The $120 Million Digital Asset Investment Behind Bitcoin Treasury A crucial element of Bitcoin Treasury’s recent success and future ambitions is the substantial capital raised in conjunction with the transaction. The company secured approximately $120 million through a strategic combination of equity and convertible debenture offerings. This significant digital asset investment speaks volumes about investor confidence in Bitcoin Treasury’s vision and its position in the evolving blockchain finance ecosystem. Let’s briefly break down what these funding mechanisms mean: Equity Offerings: This involves selling ownership stakes (shares) in the company to investors. It provides direct capital without incurring debt, but it dilutes existing ownership. Convertible Debenture Offerings: These are a type of loan (debt) that can be converted into equity (shares) at a predetermined price or under specific conditions. They offer flexibility, providing initial debt financing with the potential for investors to participate in future equity upside. The successful raise of such a substantial sum in the current economic climate is a testament to the perceived value and potential of Bitcoin Treasury’s business model. This capital infusion will undoubtedly be instrumental in funding operational expansion, technological development, and strategic acquisitions, propelling the company forward as a key player in digital asset investment. Pioneering the Future: Bitcoin Treasury’s Role in Blockchain Finance With its merger complete, a TSXV listing on the horizon, and a significant capital injection, Bitcoin Treasury is positioning itself as a vanguard in the rapidly evolving field of blockchain finance . This company’s trajectory offers a compelling case study for how digital asset entities are maturing and integrating with traditional financial systems. Their strategy reflects a broader trend of institutionalization within crypto, where robust corporate governance, transparent financial reporting, and access to mainstream capital markets are becoming increasingly vital. Bitcoin Treasury’s journey exemplifies the bridge being built between innovative blockchain technologies and established financial frameworks. For those observing the future of finance, keeping an eye on how Bitcoin Treasury leverages its new structure and capital will offer valuable insights into the direction of blockchain finance . A New Chapter Unfolds The recent developments at Bitcoin Treasury Corporation mark the beginning of an exciting new chapter. The successful amalgamation, the pursuit of a TSXV listing, and the impressive $120 million capital raise collectively paint a picture of a company poised for significant growth and influence. As Bitcoin Treasury navigates its path towards public markets, its journey will undoubtedly serve as a benchmark for other digital asset firms seeking to integrate into the global financial landscape. This is a story of ambition, strategic execution, and the undeniable convergence of traditional finance with the innovative power of blockchain.

On June 24, Japan’s Financial Services Agency released a new policy proposal signaling a major regulatory transformation for cryptocurrencies, as initially reported by Coinpost. In a document titled “Review of the Systems Surrounding Crypto Assets,” the FSA announced the formation of a working group to explore the possibility of shifting crypto regulation from the current Payment Services Act to the more stringent FIEA. The proposal is set to be discussed at the Financial System Council’s plenary session on June 25. If approved, the change would introduce a flat capital gains tax rate of around 20% for crypto, putting it on par with stocks and easing the tax burden compared to the current tax regime, where rates can reach up to 55%.

As outlined in the government’s revised 2025 “New Capitalism Grand Design and Implementation Plan,” the responsible development of Web3 businesses can tackle societal challenges, boost productivity, and unlock global opportunities for Japanese cultural and regional assets. Additionally, this potential regulatory shift also aligns with Japan’s ongoing efforts to refine how digital assets are classified and governed. In a separate but related move, the FSA recently introduced a draft framework dividing crypto assets into two categories based on their purpose and decentralization. Type 1 tokens, which are issued for business or fundraising purposes, would face stricter disclosure rules to protect investors. In contrast, Type 2 assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), seen as decentralized and non-fundraising, would be monitored primarily through exchange oversight. Meanwhile, Japan is rapidly advancing its digital financial ecosystem, with the digital yen pilot program— initiated in 2023—fully underway.

Turkey’s Ministry of Treasury and Finance is stepping up efforts to combat money laundering through crypto. According to information obtained by Anadolu Agency , new regulations will soon be implemented to tighten oversight of crypto asset transactions. Specifically, Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) will be required to monitor the sources of funds and the purposes behind crypto transfers. All crypto transactions will have to include a minimum 20-character explanation from the user. For withdrawals where the “travel rule” does not apply, a time delay will be imposed — 48 hours after purchase, exchange, or deposit, and 72 hours for first-time withdrawals. Additional restrictions will be applied to stablecoin transfers, with daily and monthly limits of $3,000 and $50,000, respectively. These limits are introduced to prevent illicit outflow of funds, especially proceeds from illegal betting and fraud. CASPs that fully comply with the travel rule requirements may apply double these limits. Finance Minister Mehmet Şimşek stated that the goal is to prevent the outflow of illicit funds without restricting legitimate crypto activities. Transactions related to market-making, arbitrage, and liquidity provision, supported by verifiable fund sources, will be exempt from the new limits, provided they occur under the oversight of compliant platforms. Platforms failing to meet the new compliance standards may face administrative, legal, and financial penalties, including denial or revocation of licenses.

In March, the Capital Markets Board introduced licensing and operational requirements for CASPs, granting the regulator full authority over exchanges, wallets, and custodians. Under the new framework, crypto businesses must comply with stricter reporting and transparency standards, including issuing numbered transaction records that detail the type, quantity, and price of crypto assets, along with any associated fees or commissions. Additionally, platforms are required to provide customers with monthly account statements outlining all crypto assets bought, sold, or transferred.

According to a press release dated June 24, China-based Web3 infrastructure provider Nano Labs has set its sights on acquiring up to $1 billion worth of BNB ( BNB ) as part of a broader strategic growth initiative. To finance the plan, the firm has entered a $500 million convertible note agreement with investors. The zero-interest notes, maturing in 360 days, are convertible into Nano Labs’ Class A shares at an initial price of $20 per share. As part of the reserve strategy, Nano Labs will conduct a full evaluation of BNB’s value and technical resilience before proceeding with the initial phase of the acquisition. The company has also stated that its long-term goal is to accumulate between 5% and 10% of BNB’s total circulating supply.

Nano Labs’ latest move builds on its earlier crypto ambitions, first signaled in December 2024 when the company announced it would begin accepting Bitcoin payments for its services. At the time, there was no indication that it planned to hold BTC on its balance sheet, and the latest BNB initiative marks a bolder step into the digital asset space for the firm. If advanced, the billion-dollar accumulation would make Nano Labs one of the largest known BNB holders, outside of Binance itself. The latest announcement comes as BNB gains interest from institutions. Just a day earlier, Bloomberg reported a similar initiative by former Coral Capital Holdings executives Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Johnathan Pasch, to raise $100 million for the acquisition of the Binance token for corporate use. The trio reportedly will raise the capital through a Nasdaq-listed entity and aims to legitimize BNB in public markets. At press time, BNB trades at $637.34. The Binance Coin has significantly lagged behind its peers in recent months, gaining just 12% year-to-date and down roughly 20% from its all-time high.

Since then, the price has recovered slightly and is now resting at $2.79, a price right on the edge of the trend lines that can be seen on the chart.

This marks a key milestone in the country’s efforts to integrate blockchain -based payments into daily life. What Is AE Coin and How Is It Powering UAE Taxis? As part of Abu Dhabi’s smart city initiative, the Integrated Transport Center has partnered with Al Maryah Community Bank (MBank) to introduce AE Coin payments in taxis. AE Coin is the UAE’s first Dirham-backed stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the UAE Dirham. It is designed to deliver price stability, fast settlement, and low transaction costs, making it ideal for everyday digital transactions. Though relatively new, AE Coin is gaining momentum. It received its final license from the Central Bank of the UAE in December 2024, officially recognizing it as a regulated digital payment solution. A Boost to Abu Dhabi’s Smart Transport Vision Tawasul Transport General Manager, Ghena Jbour, emphasized that this integration supports Abu Dhabi’s broader goal of developing a smart and sustainable transportation system, offering passengers more flexible payment options. MBank CEO, Mohammed Wassim Khayata, added that AE Coin’s integration into transportation aligns with the UAE’s Digital Government Strategy 2025, which focuses on accelerating digital adoption across public and private sectors. AE Coin Adoption Expands to the Airline Industry Beyond taxis, AE Coin is now accepted by Air Arabia for flight bookings. This move reinforces the growing real-world utility of stablecoins in the UAE, signaling a broader shift toward crypto-inclusive commerce. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Israeli Arrested for Selling Secrets to Iran for Crypto , UAE Leads the Way in MENA’s Stablecoin Adoption The MENA region recorded $338.7 billion in crypto transaction volume between July 2023 and June 2024, accounting for 7.5% of global activity. Within the region, the UAE ranked third, contributing $34 billion in transaction volume with a 30% adoption rate. According to AE Coin General Manager Ramez Rafeek, stablecoins like AE Coin are proving that crypto can be seamlessly integrated into daily services across transportation and travel. Conclusion: UAE’s Digital Payment Revolution Is Underway With regulated stablecoins entering public services, the UAE is advancing its vision of becoming a global hub for digital innovation. The adoption of AE Coin in taxis and airlines is not just a tech upgrade—it’s a strategic step toward a blockchain-enabled economy. The future of everyday crypto payments is already unfolding in the UAE. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Recent court filings have pulled back the curtain on their joint venture, io, revealing the ambitious early stages of their work on a mass-market AI device . For anyone tracking the convergence of artificial intelligence and consumer electronics, these revelations offer a fascinating glimpse into what could be the next major shift in how we interact with technology. What’s the Buzz About OpenAI’s AI Device? Earlier this month, legal documents submitted by lawyers representing OpenAI and Jony Ive’s io startup provided unprecedented details about their collaborative efforts. These filings stem from a trademark dispute initiated by iyO, a Google-backed hardware startup specializing in custom-molded earpieces. The lawsuit has inadvertently become a window into OpenAI’s hardware ambitions, forcing the company to even pull promotional materials related to its substantial $6.5 billion acquisition of io. OpenAI is vigorously fighting allegations of trademark infringement, but the legal battle has shed light on the intense research and development taking place. For the past year, OpenAI executives and former Apple leaders now at io have been diligently exploring various hardware concepts. This deep dive into OpenAI hardware indicates a serious commitment to bringing AI beyond screens and into our physical world. The Evolving Vision: Is it an In-Ear Device? Initially, much speculation revolved around an in-ear form factor for the OpenAI-io collaboration. Court documents confirm that both companies purchased at least 30 headphone sets to analyze existing market offerings. They even met with iyO’s leadership, demoing their in-ear technology. However, the narrative took an intriguing turn. Tang Tan, a long-time Apple executive and co-founder of io, declared in court that the prototype OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned in io’s launch video is “not an in-ear device, nor a wearable device.” This statement significantly broadens the scope of what their first product might be. Tan clarified that the design is still unfinalized and the product is at least a year away from public advertisement or sale. So, if not in-ear, then what? Sam Altman has previously hinted at a “family” of AI devices. He reportedly told OpenAI employees that the prototype, once complete, would be able to fit in a pocket or sit on a desk. This “third device” would be fully aware of a user’s surroundings, complementing smartphones and laptops. OpenAI’s lawyers further stated that the company has explored a wide range of devices, including: Desktop-based and mobile Wireless and wired Wearable and portable This comprehensive exploration underscores their aim to create products that transcend traditional interfaces, truly pushing the boundaries of AI innovation . Navigating the Legal Landscape: The iyO Trademark Dispute The core of these revelations lies within the ongoing tech lawsuit . The dispute with iyO, a company focused on custom-molded earpieces, has brought to light specific interactions between the two entities. On May 1, OpenAI’s VP of Product, Peter Welinder, and io’s Tang Tan met with iyO’s CEO, Jason Rugolo, to learn about their in-ear product. This meeting, held at io’s San Francisco office, involved testing iyO’s custom-fit earpiece, which reportedly failed repeatedly during demonstrations. Tang Tan asserts he attended the meeting as a courtesy, taking precautions to avoid learning too much about iyO’s intellectual property. However, internal communications revealed that an io engineer, Marwan Rammah, suggested purchasing a large database of 3D ear scans from an iyO partner, “The Ear Project,” for “ergonomics.” It remains unclear if such a deal ever materialized. Despite these interactions, attempts by iyO’s CEO to forge a deeper partnership – including pitching iyO’s device as a “developer kit” for OpenAI’s final product, seeking investment, or even offering to sell iyO for $200 million – were declined. Evans Hankey, another io co-founder and chief product officer, has also declared that io is not developing a “custom-molded earpiece product.” This legal back-and-forth highlights the competitive nature of the burgeoning AI hardware market. The Future of AI Innovation: What’s Next for Jony Ive and OpenAI? The collaboration between OpenAI and Jony Ive represents a significant convergence of leading AI capabilities and iconic design philosophy. While smart glasses are a prominent form factor in the race for broadly adopted AI-enabled devices, with Meta and Google actively developing their own, the exploration of AI-enabled headphones by companies like Apple (rumored AirPods with cameras) indicates a diverse landscape of possibilities. OpenAI and io’s extensive research into in-ear products, even if their first offering isn’t one, shows a thorough approach to understanding user interaction and ergonomics in the context of ambient AI. Their ultimate goal, as stated by Altman, is to create products that move beyond traditional interfaces, offering a more integrated and aware technological experience. Unpacking the Challenges for a Mass-Market AI Device Developing a mass-market AI device is fraught with challenges. Beyond the technical hurdles of integrating advanced AI into compact hardware, there are significant design, user experience, and legal considerations. The iyO lawsuit itself exemplifies the complex IP landscape surrounding new technological frontiers. Ensuring privacy, managing data, and creating intuitive interactions for a device that is “fully aware of a user’s surroundings” will require groundbreaking solutions. The fact that OpenAI’s first hardware device is still over a year away from sale underscores the complexity and the meticulous development process involved. Their exploration of diverse form factors suggests a commitment to finding the most impactful and user-friendly way to introduce this “third device” into daily life, setting a new benchmark for AI innovation . The revelations from these court filings paint a vivid picture of OpenAI and io’s ambitious journey into hardware. Their meticulous research, diverse exploration of form factors, and strategic approach to a competitive market indicate a serious commitment to shaping the next generation of personal technology. While the exact nature of their first product remains somewhat elusive, it’s clear they are aiming for something transformative – a device designed to integrate seamlessly into our lives, aware of our surroundings, and poised to redefine our interaction with artificial intelligence.

EGRAG Crypto Shares Critical Resistance Targets,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-retest-or-breakout-egrag-crypto-shares-critical-resistance-targets/,"XRP is once again at a decisive turning point as it hovers around the $2.20 level —a price zone that could determine its short-term direction. According to top analyst EGRAG Crypto, this level isn’t just psychological; it’s technical, and how XRP behaves here could shape the market’s next major move. XRP at the Crossroads EGRAG Crypto highlights $2.20 as a critical resistance level on the daily chart. For the current bullish momentum to hold, XRP must close a full-bodied daily candle above this mark. A confirmed breakout would pave the way toward higher resistance levels at $2.30, $2.34, $2.48, and $2.65. Each of these levels, once surpassed with conviction, could accelerate XRP’s climb and reinforce confidence among investors. But the market hasn’t confirmed the breakout just yet. If XRP fails to close above $2.20, EGRAG warns that a pullback to $2.08 or $2.04 is likely. These zones could act as retest areas where bulls attempt to regroup before another push higher. If buyers step in at these levels, it would be seen as a healthy correction within a larger uptrend. #XRP – Retest or Breakout? If #XRP did not close a full daily candle above $2.20, then the price behavior is suggesting that $2.08 and $2.04 could serve as key retest zones . Critical Resistance Targets (full body candles on daily): $2.20 $2.30 $2.34 $2.48… https://t.co/FiARFojRZs pic.twitter.com/pIwceICN46 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 24, 2025 The Line Between Bullish and Bearish While upside levels offer potential targets, the downside presents clear warnings. EGRAG stresses that XRP must not close below $2.04, $1.90, or $1.71 on the daily chart. A close beneath any of these supports would suggest that the bullish structure is breaking down, potentially triggering a deeper correction or the beginning of a bearish trend. Among these, the $1.90 zone is particularly important . It aligns with a macro Fibonacci level and has acted as a major support area in recent months. Holding this level could mean the uptrend remains intact, while a breach could shift sentiment quickly. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Technical Landscape XRP’s current price action is unfolding amid a broader sense of optimism. Legal clarity in the U.S., growing adoption for cross-border payments, and expanding tokenization use cases continue to support the long-term outlook. On-chain data shows accumulation around the $2.00 mark, suggesting that large holders may be positioning ahead of a breakout. Still, volume remains moderate, and the lack of a decisive break above $2.20 suggests traders are waiting for stronger confirmation. A daily close above this level could bring a wave of momentum. Until then, caution remains the dominant mood. EGRAG Crypto’s analysis lays out a clear roadmap for XRP’s next move. With the price sitting exactly at $2.20, the market is at a technical stalemate . A breakout could ignite a fresh rally; a rejection might invite a short-term retest of lower levels. As XRP flirts with critical resistance, traders and investors alike should stay focused on daily closes. The next few candles may define the trend for weeks to come.

But even with all the uncertainty, SHIB has jumped 9%, sparking a big question among holders: Can SHIB really hit $0.00003? According to crypto analyst Jonathan Carter, this target is not unrealistic, especially considering the growing market interest and increasing token burn rates. What’s Driving Optimism? One major reason for the growing hope is the bullish sentiment in the altcoin market. With Bitcoin recovering and now holding steady above $105K, many altcoins, including SHIB, have gained almost 10%. SHIB’s strong community also plays a big part in keeping the momentum alive. Another strong factor is Shiba Inu’s impressive token burn activity. In the last 24 hours alone, SHIB’s burn rate surged by 582%, removing over 16.7 million tokens from circulation. This shrinking supply could lead to more upward pressure on price. Technical Pattern Hints 3X Gain for Shib Reaching the $0.00003 mark won’t happen overnight. According to analyst Jonathan Carter, Shiba Inu needs to follow a few key steps to hit that target. As of now, SHIB is trading around $0.00001170 , showing a 9% increase in the last 24 hours. On the daily chart, Carter notes that SHIB is forming a descending channel pattern. After falling from the upper resistance line, the price is now testing a key midline support zone. #SHIB Shiba Inu is forming a descending channel pattern on the daily timeframe The price has declined from the upper border and is now retesting the midline support zone A sustained bounce from this zone could drive the price toward targets at $0.00001250, $0.00001500,… pic.twitter.com/Zwtpqlm26V — Jonathan Carter (@JohncyCrypto) June 23, 2025 If SHIB manages to hold and bounce from this zone, Carter suggests it could climb to $0.00001250 first — and from there, a strong momentum push might carry it past $0.00003. This would be nearly a 3x move from current levels, which is why many see this as a major bullish setup, especially with SHIB continuing to hold key technical zones. Whale Activity Signals Confidence Backing this technical optimism is some massive on-chain activity. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that large Shiba Inu holders, wallets owning between 10 trillion and 100 trillion SHIB, went on a major buying spree. These whales purchased an eye-popping 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens in a single day, worth about $114 million. That makes it the biggest daily accumulation SHIB has seen in the last five months, and the second-largest for all of 2025 so far. What’s Next for SHIB? If momentum builds and retail investors follow the whales, SHIB could enter a new bullish phase. A confirmed breakout from the descending channel might be the green light needed for that push toward $0.00003.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 13:41:19

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading Bonk (BONK) Poised for Significant Move as Traders Watch Key Levels Bonk (BONK) is currently trading between $0.00001029 and $0.00001501. The coin has been moving within this narrow range, hinting at a potential breakout. Investors are keenly observing to see which direction it will take. Over the past week, Bonk's price has remained steady. It has not seen significant spikes or dips, suggesting a period of consolidation. This stability might be the calm before a storm, as the market anticipates a major move. The key level to watch on the upside is $0.00001781. A rise to this price would represent about a 40% gain from current levels. On the downside, the support level is at $0.000008373, which would be a drop of around 34%. Crossing either of these points could set the tone for Bonk's next trend. The potential for a significant price move makes Bonk an interesting coin to watch. Whether it breaks upwards toward the resistance or falls towards the support will depend on market momentum. Traders are keeping a close eye on Bonk, waiting for signals that could indicate the next direction. PEPE Coin Struggles Amid Downward Trend, Faces Key Resistance Levels Pepe (PEPE) is currently trading between $0.0000076027 and $0.0000108587. Over the past week, its price has decreased by 3.85%. In the last month, the coin has dropped by 26.07%, and over six months, it has fallen by 45.02%. These declines show a consistent downward trend in PEPE's value. The nearest resistance level for PEPE is at $0.0000128373. If the coin's price rises and breaks through this level, it could signal a potential upward movement. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 72.37. This high RSI suggests that the coin may be overbought, and the price could face downward pressure. On the other hand, the nearest support level is at $0.0000063253. If PEPE's price continues to fall, it might test this support level. A drop to this point would mean a further decline from the current price, adding to recent losses. Based on recent price changes, PEPE seems to be under selling pressure. The significant drops over the past month and six months suggest limited potential for quick growth. Watching the key resistance and support levels is important, as movements beyond these points could indicate future price directions. SHIB Struggles With 48% Drop—Overbought or Breakdown Ahead? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading between $0.00000966 and $0.00001193. Over the past week, its price has dipped by 0.08%. The monthly decline is sharper at 17.52%, and over six months, SHIB has fallen by 48.01%. This downward trend indicates sustained selling pressure. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for SHIB is 75.87. An RSI above 70 suggests that the asset is overbought, which could signal a potential price correction. Despite recent declines, the high RSI may indicate limited upside momentum. The nearest support level is at $0.00000872. If SHIB continues to drop, it may test this support, representing a decrease of about 9.76% from the lower end of the current price range. On the upside, the nearest resistance is at $0.00001326, which would require an increase of approximately 11.15% from the upper end of the current range. Given the current indicators, SHIB's price may face challenges in the short term. Monitoring the support and resistance levels will be crucial to understand its potential movement in the coming days. Turbo (TURBO) Preps for Breakout—Key Levels in Sight Turbo (TURBO) is currently trading between $0.002611 and $0.003912. This range reflects recent volatility, drawing attention from traders watching for potential movements. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0047. If the price rises to this point, it would be an increase of about 20% from the current high. Breaking through this resistance could signal a strong upward trend. On the other hand, the nearest support level sits at $0.0021. A drop to this level would mean a decrease of approximately 19% from the current low. Falling below support might indicate a downward shift. The proximity to these key levels suggests that Turbo's price could make significant moves soon. Traders are monitoring the coin closely to see if it will break upward or downward based on these critical points. Conclusion Although BONK, PEPE, SHIB, and TURBO have gained popularity, their immediate potential appears limited. Codename:Pepe crypto distinguishes itself by utilizing authentic artificial intelligence to help investors maximize profits in the meme coin market. By offering AI-driven trading signals and automated trading capabilities, Codename:Pepe crypto provides valuable tools for navigating market fluctuations. Its community-focused approach and capped token supply present a compelling opportunity for those seeking significant returns in the evolving crypto arena.

This big move puts SEI up by 65% in the past week and by 28% in the past month, with the altcoin – the 70th-biggest in the market – gaining plenty of traction prior to the US bombing of Iran over the weekend. SEI has gradually been building momentum over the past few months, with the coin’s network having grown its TVL by 159% since the start of the year, and by nearly 1,200% in 12 months. This makes it one of the fastest-growing layer ones in the ecosystem, and if the global economy and geopolitical situation can become more stable, SEI is on track to hit new record highs later in the year. SEI Price Prediction: Will the SEI Pump Continue to $0.50? Probably the most bullish thing about SEI right now is that it’s still in an undervalued position, given that it remains 75% down from its ATH of $1.14, set back in March of last year. As such, we can expect it to continue rising in the near term, with its chart today signalling some big momentum and buying pressure. For instance, its RSI (purple) has just topped 70, a sign of a coin in the ascendancy. Source: TradingView And what’s particularly encouraging is that SEI’s MACD (orange, blue) has only just flipped bullish, again indicating that it’s still some way from being overbought. Also positive is the coin’s trading volume, which at $850 million today has risen by just over 2,000% in a month, and by 865% in a week. This is a clear sign of a very hot meme token, and now may be a good time to buy the token before it overheats. Indeed, given the shaky nature of the apparent ceasefire between Iran and Israel , it may not be too long before SEI suffers another dip. But in the longer term, the Sei price should continue climbing upwards, especially given Sei’s growing stature as a layer-one blockchain network. $SEI just pumped 45% — and it's still one of the most undervalued chains out there. If you understand the tech, you’re already betting on SEI. This move isn’t done — SEI’s going higher. #SEI #Layer1 #CryptoGems #Altseason pic.twitter.com/ziKlkFkAkB — Skull (@Crypto_Skull1) June 24, 2025 The platform recently became the second-biggest Ethereum-compatible chain (after Base) in terms of users. The past few weeks have also witnessed the emergence of the first filings for an SEI ETF , a sign that institutions are becoming increasingly interested in the token. Because of this, the SEI price should return to $0.30 in a few weeks, before hitting $0.40 by August. Snorter Bot Could Be Next Altcoin to Watch After Raising More Than $1.2 Million in Presale SEI is one of the top-100 altcoins to watch over the next few months, but it certainly isn’t the only new token that’s showing lots of potential at the moment. There are also numerous presale coins in the market that are looking good right now, with one of the most interesting being Snorter (SNORT), an Ethereum- and Solana-based trading bot . It has raised $1.2 million in the ongoing presale for its SNORT token, with investors becoming increasingly excited by its plans to launch an automated sniping bot. Here to change how sniping’s done. Snorter Bot lets you snipe new tokens within seconds of liquidity appearing, before normies have even refreshed the page. pic.twitter.com/fdlShFMsgW — Snorter (@SnorterToken) June 24, 2025 As a sniping bot, it enables users to buy up new tokens just as they hit the market, and before they begin to rally, beating other traders to the punch. It can therefore help investors to maximize their returns, with other features including copy trading, limit orders, atomic swaps, and rugpull protection. It’s therefore shaping up to be one of the most effective and powerful trading bots out there, with its existence on both Solana and (later) Ethereum giving it a wide reach. Investors can buy its native token SNORT early by going to the project’s official website , with SNORT also open to staking. The coin will have a max supply of 500 million SNORT, and is currently available at $0.0961. This will rise tomorrow, so traders should act sooner rather than later if they want to lock in the biggest possible gains.

Bitcoin has traded largely sideways since its ATH over a month ago, and most of the top 10 cryptos by market cap have experienced declines over the same timeframe: $XRP: –4.5% $ETH: –3.5% $BNB: –3.3% $SOL: –16% $TRX: –0.4% $DOGE: –25% $ADA: –21% But while most blue-chip cryptos have slid to the netherworld, the companies behind some of them have taken off. Circle Takes Off, Coinbase Profits Over Past Month Take Circle (Circle Internet Group, $CRCL): the company behind the stablecoin $USDC is having a decent month after its IPO. $CRCL stock has risen a cool 750% in the past thirty days. That gives Circle a market cap of almost $64B, larger than the market cap of its top-10 stablecoin $USDC – market cap, $61B. Circle stock closed the last session at $263.45. Circle isn’t the only crypto company seeing major gains. Coinbase didn’t have an IPO, but it did post a solid 16% gain over the past month, closing at $307.59. Both companies, major players in the crypto economy, are prime examples of how crypto continues to attract TradFi investors despite temporary market decline. GENIUS Bill Fuels Circle Frenzy, Sets Stage for New Crypto Success IPO aside, the passing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act may have set the stage for Circle’s success. The bill cleared the US Senate and is now bound for the House. Should it pass there, the largest economy in the world would have a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill did more than set up stablecoins; it provided a clear indication that sensible and workable regulation is coming, one way or another. That gives much-needed stability, setting up new crypto projects to launch in a favorable environment. Here are three such projects poised to achieve their own double, triple, or even 10x in the months to come. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Fastest Layer in Bitcoin History Ready to Take Off $2T market cap, $105K token price – Bitcoin has everything, right? Not quite. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to give Bitcoin the one thing it lacks – a fully functional, SVM-powered Layer 2. The Bitcoin Relay Program allows users to send and receive $BTC nearly instantly. By monitoring a designated address as a Canonical Bridge, Bitcoin Hyper unlocks the full power of everything from zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to staking and DeFi with the world’s largest crypto. Staking $HYPER doesn’t have to wait until the Layer 2 is fully launched, though; presale investors can stake now, earning 493% APY during the presale. $HYPER currently costs $0.012, but our price prediction shows the token could reach $0.08625 by the end of next year for 619% gains. Bitcoin Hyper has already raised $1.5M in a matter of weeks and looks set to ride the bullish momentum to new heights. You can learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper here. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Find and Trade the Best Solana Meme Coins on Telegram Meme coins are funny things. Sometimes they become big $DOGEs, mentioned glowingly by Elon Musk, and are part of common parlance. More commonly, they spend their entire life cycle out of the limelight, trading underground on platforms like Telegram. Average traders may never even hear about them, and by the time they do, the best trading opportunities are long gone. No more! With Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Snorter Bot, Solana’s best-kept secret meme coins are brought to light, and fantastic trading opportunities uncovered. Snorter Bot offers: Fast, safe swaps Automated sniping tools Limit orders Honeypot detection Rugpull protection Copy trading What is Snorter ? It’s the bot that gives any trader the tools they need to successfully trade low-cap Solana meme coins – and find those 100x opportunities before anyone else. $SNORT currently costs $0.0961 with $1.2M raised in the presale so far. 3. Memereum ($MEME) – DeFi, Memes, Insurance Combined $MEME tokens power an innovative DeFi platform that leverages comprehensive asset protection for your crypto investments. It’s a unique approach, but gives both seasoned investors and crypto newbies a way to protect their investments. Despite the addition of insurance options, Memereum provides all the benefits of an advanced DeFi platform, including a DEX and crypto card. The presale is in its final stages, and has raised $2M so far. Money Flows In, Token Prices Go Up? As Circle and Coinbase see bright days ahead, will corporate earnings lead to token price increases?

The rebound was triggered by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, ending what he called “The 12 Day War.” According to Trump, Iran initiated a 12-hour ceasefire , followed by Israel’s compliance, signaling a coordinated effort to avoid further escalation. JUST IN: Israel and Iran agree to a 'complete and total ceasefire starting in 6 hours! BULLISH FOR THE MARKETS #XRP pic.twitter.com/48JIkzaJX3 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 23, 2025 Investors responded swiftly, reversing the selloff sparked by U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. With no reported casualties, thanks to Iran allegedly alerting the U.S. ahead of time, the market perceived this as a sign of de-escalation. Risk appetite returned, with Bitcoin leading a broad crypto recovery alongside Ethereum and XRP. Overall market sentiment improved significantly, helping BTC reclaim key technical support. Bitcoin Technical Structure Points Toward $120K On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price prediction seems bullish as BTC has cleared both the 50-period EMA ($103,954) and horizontal resistance at $104,723. Price action is now approaching a descending trendline near $106,500, a level that has consistently rejected bulls since early June. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If BTC manages a clean breakout above this zone, analysts are setting their sights on $109,041 and even $110,522 in the short term. Current BTC Price: $105,209 Market Cap: $2.09 trillion 24-Hour Volume: $67.5 billion Key Support: $98,253 Resistance Ahead: $106,539, $109,041, $110,522 Momentum indicators support this outlook. The MACD has printed a bullish crossover, and histogram bars are strengthening. Additionally, BTC has formed a higher low, and no bearish candlestick formations are present near the current resistance level. If $106.5K breaks, the path toward $120,000 becomes technically viable especially if volume continues to increase. Fed Policy, Geopolitics Boost BTC’s Case Beyond the charts, macro and geopolitical events are also helping the bull case. The US Federal Reserve’s dovish comments and rising rate cut expectations have weakened the dollar, making Bitcoin a more attractive inflation hedge. CME FedWatch shows an 80% chance of a rate cut in September, up from 70% last week. And investors are treating Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. The Middle East ceasefire is holding for now, and US macro policy is getting softer, so Bitcoin should see capital flowing into non-correlated assets. Conclusion Bitcoin’s quick bounce after the Trump ceasefire deal and dovish Fed expectations has brought back the bulls. A breakout above $106,500 could take us to $120,000 in the next few weeks. Watch volume and price action at this level, if we get confirmation here the next leg of the macro rally should unlock. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.5M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1.5 million milestone in its public presale, raising $1,566,427 out of a $1,763,403 target. With just hours left before the next price tier, buyers can still secure HYPER at $0.012 per token. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC network. It combines Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with ultra-low gas fees and seamless BTC bridging. Audited by Consult, Bitcoin Hyper is built for trust, scale, and performance. Over 91 million $HYPER are already staked, with projected post-launch staking rewards of up to 577% APY. The token fuels gas fees, dApp access, and decentralized governance. The presale accepts both crypto and cards, and through Web3Payments, no wallet is required. Meme culture meets utility, Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as Layer 2’s potential breakout star of 2025.

The growing reach is likely to boost its annual business volume beyond the 175 trillion yuan (over $24 trillion) already registered last year. Following the latest wave of expansion, the central bank in Beijing is now offering clearing and settlement services in cross-border payments and trade using its fiat currency to financial institutions in almost 190 countries around the world. Central Asia’s Kyrgyzstan joins Chinese SWIFT alternative The Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan has recently connected to China’s Cross-border Interbank Payment System ( CIPS ), seen as an alternative to the well-established global system for international payments known as SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication). In an interview with the TASS news agency on Monday, the First Deputy Prime Minister of the former Soviet Republic, Daniyar Amangeldiev, noted his country is taking into account new trends and highlighted that CIPS is offering faster payments. Speaking after his participation in the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), which gathered politicians and business leaders from almost 140 countries in Russia’s second largest city last week, the Kyrgyz official elaborated: “We have just recently connected to the CIPS. This is the Chinese system that will enable us to make payments in a more expedited way.” At the beginning of June, Kyrgyzstan’s finance minister and central bank governor met with Chinese Minister of Finance Lan Foan in Beijing. The two sides discussed cross-border payments and the linking of Bishkek’s state-owned banks to China’s infrastructure in the field. “This step will create a secure and stable channel for bilateral settlements in yuan, reduce transaction costs, and decrease dependence on settlements through third currencies,” the Kyrgyz finance ministry insisted in a statement at the time. China pushes CIPS expansion in Africa and the Middle East Kyrgyzstan revealed it is joining the CIPS after earlier this month, the People’s Republic announced it had added another six banks to its cross-border payment system, noting these are the first direct participants from Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Among the newly connected financial institutions is Standard Bank, Africa’s biggest lender in terms of assets. The news came out during this year’s edition of China International Finance Exhibition which gathered over 300 financial institutions in Shanghai, including around 40 foreign firms. According to local media, the event highlighted the financial hub’s role in spreading the use of the renminbi (RMB), as the Chinese yuan (CNY) is also called. Beijing remains committed to the global expansion of its digital version as well, the digital yuan (e-CNY), as recently indicated by the head of China’s monetary authority. “It will be quicker, and it will be less expensive,” commented Anne Aliker, head of corporate and investment banking client coverage at Standard Bank Group, who attended the expo held as part of the Lujiazui Forum . The latter was devoted to fostering international financial cooperation. Connecting to CIPS shortens cross-border remittance time from 3 to 5 days to around 2 hours, noted Li Zijian, chief representative of Uzbekistan’s Octobank in China, quoted by ShanghaiEye. Kyrgyzstan’s neighbor is another Central Asian nation where Beijing has been increasing its presence. The People’s Bank of China launched its cross-border payments system within a policy aimed at “internationalizing” the use of the yuan. According to its website, the CIPS currently has 174 direct participants and over 1,500 indirect participants. More than 4,900 banking institutions in 187 countries are already using its services. This month alone, the system has processed 38,246 transactions for more than 754 billion yuan ($105 billion), as of June 23. Its total annual business volume in 2024 reached ¥175 trillion (almost $24.4 trillion).

It’s designed to make recovering access to assets simple, the team says. Users will be able to create an offline spare key alongside their 24 words, as well as the PIN code for it. The key connects directly to the Ledger device via NFC communication, with no intermediary. To recover access, they will tap the card and enter the PIN. “There is no limit to the number of spare keys that can be created,” the announcement says. “Creating a spare key is always optional, and can only be created by you with confirmation on your Ledger.” Source: Ledger Moreover, the novel product features a Secure Element at its core, the technology behind Ledger’s security. Also, anyone can review the Ledger Recovery Key code. A whitepaper will be available upon launch, while info is available on the Ledger GitHub . Charles Guillemet, Chief Technology Officer at Ledger, says that Ledger Recovery Key “has gone through extensive security testing internally at the hands of the Donjon,” the company’s team of white hat hackers. He claims that it also underwent “a comprehensive internal testing and external security audits,” receiving “extremely positive feedback from security researchers and industry leaders.” Meanwhile, the Ledger Recover service and the physical Recovery Key are “complementary.” The users can use one, both, or just the 24 words. The team will launch the new product “in the near future,” the team says.

Ledger Recovery Key: Copy of ‘Master Secret’ Per the whitepaper shared with Cryptonews , Ledger Recovery Key is not a hardware wallet. It’s not a tool to manage assets or sign transactions. Instead, the team explains, it’s a smart card that stores a copy of the “master secret” – from which stems the Secret Recovery Phrase – from the Ledger wallet. The only condition is that the wallet supports the NFC protocol, as this is how the key and the wallet communicate. Source: Ledger Meanwhile, Ledger launched its touchscreen Ledger Stax and Ledger Flex in 2024. The announcement says that these devices have “contributed to a new sales milestone of over 7.5 million Ledger devices sold worldwide.” However, the team argues that traditional backup methods are becoming less practical with time. In response, they launched Ledger Recover in 2023 as an optional paid service. It allows users to create encrypted fragments of their recovery phrase. “Since launching, Ledger Recover adoption has been strong, showing a clear demand for more recovery options,” it argues. Therefore, Ledger Recovery Key is another option in the recovery suite. All these features remain optional. Ledger provides the “fullest set of choices around recovery,” says Ian Rogers, Chief Experience Officer at Ledger. “With Ledger Recovery Key, we are making secure self-custody easy-to-use for everyone.” You may also like: Ledger Starts Shipping its New Ledger Stax Hardware Wallet After 18 Months French startup Ledger has finally begun shipping its latest Ledger Stax devices, nearly 18 months after their initial announcement.

It happened because Trump’s announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran reawakened investors ’ morale. Even institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, with BTC ETFs recording $350.43 million in net inflows on Monday. In addition, exchange reserves this week fell from $2.491 million to $2.485 million, pointing to declining selling pressure in the short term, per cryptoquant. Moreover, bullish interest seems to be high as the “taker buy to sell ratio” on the Bybit exchange has displayed significant spikes, and several expert bullish posts are flooded on social platforms where targets are aimed as high as $130K to $135K in Q3 2025. Keep reading to know more. Bybit Exchange Reveals Investors Eyeing Opportunities in Bitcoin Dip A recent analysis from Cryptoquant reveals that when market interest wanes in BTC, all data appears stagnant, making things easier to evaluate. In this scenario, a sudden footprint of smart money is easily tracked. The activity starts revealing sudden spikes in the data of Bitcoin’s taker buy-to-sell ratio chart on the Bybit exchange, which were nearly stagnant before. Source: cryptoquant This highlights a significant pattern when overall market attention is drawn to a negative factor, and involvement becomes low due to rising fear. The whale accumulation has been seen to accelerate. In many cases, smart money-loading bags have preceded with the upward trends. The same pattern is repeating now, and spikes in the data amid the recent war uncertainty are evident. It highlights that the odds of a price rise are much higher. Analyst Suggest Short Squeeze Incoming In Bitcoin Price Recently, Daan Crypto highlighted that from May to June, the Bitcoin price was in a severe range between the month’s swing low support at $100K and near ATH around $109K. The recent breach of swing low support during the heightened conflict, followed by a recovery from range lows, has built a big liquidity grab, which has hit many traders’ “stop-loss” orders. Now, experts believe the de-escalation could pump more gains ahead in the short term. Aligning with the bullish sentiment, another expert has revealed that the Binance BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap on coin glass suggests that the current price is exchanging hands in the middle of two major liquidity leverage clusters. Still, the topside liquidity cluster is piling up strongly per the 24-hour chart. He suggests that a short-term short-squeeze is coming, and the bull run is not over yet. Liquidity is piling up on the topside.

Instead, this dip has ensured that room for more upside is clear; he believes that $130K to $135K BTC price in Q3 is possible. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Holding $AGNT will unlock access to an exclusive decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)—a private club where investors can manage their portfolios, vote on strategies, and receive insider analytics. Beyond governance and staking rewards, $AGNT holders will gain access to premium AI-trading tools exclusive reports the AI-powered launchpad for launching new tokens. $AGNT tokens are currently sold for pennies.

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals Pi Network Price Declines Amid Market Uncertainty Pi Network (PI) is experiencing a price decline. Currently, the price ranges between $0.45 and $0.58. Over the past week, it decreased by 15.90%. The past month saw a drop of 32.75%. Over six months, the price fell by 27.47%. These declines point to a bearish trend. The nearest support is at $0.39. If the price keeps falling, it might reach this level. The nearest resistance is at $0.66. Breaking this resistance is needed to reverse the trend. The RSI stands at 53.73. An RSI near 50 shows a neutral market. This suggests the price could rise or fall. Given recent declines, further drops are possible. Watching support and resistance levels is important. If the price rebounds from $0.39 support, a recovery may occur. Falling below this support could lead to more decline. Breaking above $0.66 resistance could signal a price rise. Conclusion In conclusion, the Pi Network's recent drop below $0.60 underscores its current challenges, and anticipated catalysts have yet to boost its value. Other coins like PI are also showing less potential in the short term. Amidst this landscape, Codename:Pepe crypto is emerging as a remarkable contender that unleashes true intelligence for maximum profits. It sets itself apart by providing practical tools to help investors navigate the meme coin market effectively.

About 720,000 BTC, sold mainly by recent buyers since mid-April, has been met with an equally strong demand, preventing a more resounding crash despite a $66 billion surge in the Realized Cap of coins held for less than one month. Profit-Taking Meets Fresh Demand According to on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr., the $66 billion increase in Realized Cap for the 0-1 month cohort since April 13 is definitive proof of large-scale profit realization by short-term holders. While such aggressive selling pressure would typically trigger significant downside, Adler highlighted a critical counterforce: new buyers entering the market have been steadily absorbing this massive supply. In his opinion , this offsetting has kept Bitcoin trading within a relatively narrow range in the last few weeks. However, his UTXO Block Profit/Loss Count Ratio Model indicates the profit-taking frenzy may have subsided, dropping from an extreme 34,000 points near BTC’s all-time high in May to just 216 points today. “Profitable sales have almost disappeared,” noted Adler, while the proportion of loss-realizing transactions has increased. The likeliest explanation is that the wave of eager sellers has largely passed, replaced by buyers accumulating at lower levels, reducing the immediate risk of a sharp crash. Meanwhile, the global markets are experiencing a sense of relief thanks to an unexpected ceasefire between Israel and Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed a “Complete and Total” cessation of hostilities, quelling fears of a deeper conflict. Following that, investors like Daan Crypto Trades and Michaël van de Poppe echoed cautious optimism on X, pointing out that reduced geopolitical risk could ease headline-driven volatility and help Bitcoin regain upward momentum. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Indeed, BTC has staged a noticeable recovery since dipping below the symbolic $100,000 mark after the U.S. unleashed airstrikes against several Iranian nuclear installations last week. As of this writing, the king cryptocurrency had climbed 3.8% in the last 24 hours to hover around $105,400 after going as high as $105,927 during the Asian trading session. On a weekly scale, it remains slightly underwater, down about 1.1%, which is a modest underperformance compared to the broader crypto market’s 0.4% gain over the same period. The asset also experienced a slight 1.7% dip over the last 30 days, reflecting recent liquidation cascades and historical Q3 headwinds. As analyst Benjamin Cowen previously highlighted , Bitcoin often struggles through the summer months. Past bull cycles saw steep drops of 25–35% between June and July before roaring back in late Q4.

Realized volatility refers to the actual historical movement of an asset's price over a specific period, in this case ten days. It is calculated using past price data and indicates how much the price has fluctuated in reality, as opposed to how much it is expected to fluctuate in the future. In addition to subdued historical price swings, MSTR’s implied volatility (IV) currently sits at 48.33 percent , which is among the lowest levels recorded for the stock in recent years. Implied volatility reflects the market’s forecast of a stock’s future volatility, derived from options prices. A lower IV suggests the options market is anticipating smaller price movements going forward. For comparison, MSTR’s IV peaked at 225% in November 2024, during a sharp rally in bitcoin prices following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory. At that time, bitcoin traded above $95,000 and MSTR’s share price surged from $350 to a high of $525. As of now, MSTR shares are trading at $367. MSTR currently holds 592,345 BTC , but last week added just 245 BTC, marking its smallest weekly purchase since March. This slowdown in accumulation may suggest a saturation point, particularly as other public companies globally begin to adopt bitcoin treasury strategies. Furthermore, capital flows appear to be rotating from MSTR to smaller bitcoin-holding companies, many of which are experiencing strong performance in both share price and trading volume. Among them are Canada's LQWD Technologies Corp, which has risen about three-fold in recent days on its BTC treasury strategy. Notably, this marks the fourth consecutive week in which MSTR has not utilized its at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program. As a result, the company now trades at a 1.83x multiple to its net asset value (NAV) in bitcoin terms, known as mNAV. This multiple is calculated by dividing the company's enterprise value by the market value of its bitcoin holdings. Is MSTR yesterday's news? Led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, Strategy has benefited significantly in recent years from the company’s status as a high-beta, high-volatility proxy for bitcoin. This elevated volatility made MSTR particularly attractive to options traders and speculators, enabling outsized gains on both the upside and downside compared to BTC itself. However, as MSTR’s volatility compresses, that appeal may diminish. With less price movement, traders, investors, and speculators could begin reallocating capital to other, more volatile bitcoin-linked equities or assets that offer greater trading opportunities.

In a significant development for the digital asset space, Texas has taken a decisive step, enacting a new law that empowers the state to seize digital assets connected to criminal activities. This move marks a pivotal moment for the Texas crypto law landscape, sending a clear message about the state’s approach to illicit financial flows within the blockchain ecosystem. What Does the New Texas Crypto Law Entail? On June 20, 2023, Texas Senate Bill SB1498 officially became law, set to take effect on September 1. This legislation is not just another bureaucratic update; it represents a fundamental shift in how the state addresses financial crimes involving digital currencies. At its core, SB1498 grants law enforcement agencies and the state attorney the authority for crypto seizure when these assets are linked to specific criminal offenses. Wu Blockchain, a prominent crypto news source, highlighted on X (formerly Twitter) that a key provision mandates the storage of these seized digital assets in secure offline wallets. This detail underscores a commitment to safeguarding the assets once they are in state custody, a critical concern given the volatile and often irreversible nature of blockchain transactions. The implications of this law are far-reaching, touching upon aspects of privacy, property rights, and the very future of digital finance within the state. Why is Digital Asset Forfeiture Becoming a Global Priority? Texas’s recent legislative action isn’t an isolated event but rather part of a growing global trend. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption, they have also, unfortunately, become tools for various illicit activities, ranging from ransomware attacks and drug trafficking to money laundering and terrorist financing. Governments worldwide are grappling with how to effectively combat cryptocurrency crime without stifling innovation. The concept of digital asset forfeiture provides a powerful mechanism for authorities to disrupt criminal enterprises by stripping them of their ill-gotten gains. Historically, asset forfeiture has been a staple in fighting traditional crime, targeting everything from cash and real estate to vehicles and luxury goods. Applying this principle to the digital realm presents unique challenges but also significant opportunities. Nations like the United States, through agencies such as the IRS and FBI, have already demonstrated success in seizing large sums of crypto from darknet markets and criminal networks. Texas is now solidifying its own legal framework to join these efforts, aiming to enhance its capabilities in this evolving frontier of law enforcement. How Will Crypto Seizure Practically Unfold in Texas? The operational specifics of how crypto seizure will be executed under SB1498 are crucial for both law enforcement and the public to understand. The law specifies that seized assets must be held in ‘secure offline wallets.’ This implies a rigorous protocol for custody, likely involving multi-signature wallets, hardware security modules (HSMs), and stringent access controls to prevent unauthorized access or loss. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the potential process: Identification and Tracing: Law enforcement agencies, often in collaboration with blockchain analytics firms, will first identify and trace cryptocurrency transactions linked to criminal activity. This involves sophisticated tools to de-anonymize transactions and link them to real-world identities. Legal Order: A court order, similar to those used for traditional asset seizures, will be required to legally confiscate the digital assets. This ensures due process and protects against arbitrary seizures. Seizure and Transfer: Once the order is obtained, the identified cryptocurrency will be transferred from the suspect’s control to a state-controlled, secure offline wallet. This step is technically complex and requires expertise in handling various blockchain protocols. Custody and Management: The state, likely through a designated agency or a specialized unit, will be responsible for the long-term custody and management of these seized assets. This includes monitoring their value, potentially liquidating them at appropriate times, and ensuring their security until a final legal disposition. Disposition: Post-conviction, the forfeited assets will typically be sold, with the proceeds often directed back into law enforcement budgets or victim compensation funds, similar to traditional asset forfeiture programs. This process highlights the need for specialized training for law enforcement personnel and a robust technical infrastructure to manage these digital assets effectively and securely. What are the Potential Benefits of This Texas Crypto Law? The enactment of this Texas crypto law carries several potential benefits, primarily aimed at enhancing public safety and the integrity of the financial system. Deterring Cryptocurrency Crime: By creating a clear legal pathway for seizure, the law acts as a powerful deterrent to criminals who might otherwise view cryptocurrencies as a safe haven for illicit gains. The knowledge that their digital wealth can be confiscated could significantly reduce the appeal of using crypto for illegal activities. Funding Law Enforcement: Proceeds from digital asset forfeiture can provide valuable resources to law enforcement agencies, enabling them to invest further in training, technology, and personnel needed to combat complex cybercrimes and financial fraud. Protecting Victims: In cases where victims have lost funds due to crypto-related scams or hacks, the ability to seize and liquidate stolen digital assets offers a potential avenue for restitution and recovery, providing a measure of justice. Enhancing Financial Security: By actively targeting illicit crypto flows, the law contributes to a more secure and transparent financial ecosystem, fostering greater trust in digital assets for legitimate use cases. Setting a Precedent: Texas’s proactive stance could serve as a model for other states and jurisdictions, encouraging a more unified and effective approach to blockchain regulation and enforcement across the country and globally. These benefits underscore the state’s commitment to adapting its legal tools to the evolving digital landscape, ensuring that justice can be served regardless of the medium used for criminal enterprise. Navigating the Challenges: What Hurdles Lie Ahead for Digital Asset Forfeiture? While the intentions behind the new Texas crypto law are clear, its implementation and long-term impact will undoubtedly face several challenges. The unique characteristics of digital assets present complexities not typically encountered with traditional forms of property. Technical Expertise: Law enforcement agencies will require significant investment in training and technology to effectively trace, seize, and manage a wide array of cryptocurrencies. This includes understanding different blockchain protocols, wallet types, and transaction mechanisms. Custody and Security: Storing seized digital assets in ‘secure offline wallets’ is a good start, but maintaining the security of these assets over long periods, especially given the constant evolution of cyber threats, will be a continuous challenge. The risk of hacks, accidental loss, or insider threats remains. Valuation Volatility: The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies poses a challenge for valuation and disposition. An asset seized today could be worth significantly less (or more) by the time it is legally forfeited and ready for sale, impacting the ultimate recovery value. Legal and Jurisdictional Complexities: Blockchain transactions often cross international borders, creating jurisdictional challenges. Furthermore, establishing clear legal ownership and proving a direct link to criminal activity can be more complex with digital assets than with physical ones. Privacy Concerns and Civil Liberties: Critics often raise concerns about potential overreach and the erosion of privacy. Ensuring that the law is applied judiciously, with robust checks and balances to protect the civil liberties of innocent individuals, will be paramount. The distinction between legitimate privacy and illicit anonymity is a fine line that needs careful navigation. Maintaining Public Trust: For the law to be truly effective, it must maintain public trust. This means transparent processes, clear guidelines, and accountability to prevent abuses of power and ensure that legitimate crypto users are not unduly targeted. Addressing these challenges will require ongoing collaboration between legal experts, technologists, and law enforcement, along with continuous adaptation of policies as the crypto landscape evolves. How Will This Law Impact Cryptocurrency Crime and Legitimate Users? The primary target of SB1498 is undoubtedly cryptocurrency crime . By empowering the state to seize illicit crypto, Texas aims to make the state a less attractive hub for criminals attempting to launder money, conduct ransomware attacks, or engage in other illegal activities using digital assets. For those involved in such activities, the risk profile has significantly increased. The law underscores that anonymity, while often associated with crypto, does not equate to impunity. Law enforcement is increasingly sophisticated in tracing transactions and identifying perpetrators. For legitimate cryptocurrency users and businesses in Texas, the impact should ideally be minimal, provided they operate within the bounds of the law. However, there could be indirect effects: Increased Scrutiny: Law enforcement’s enhanced capabilities might lead to increased scrutiny of suspicious transactions, which could inadvertently affect some legitimate users if their activities are misconstrued or if they interact with compromised wallets. Enhanced Compliance: Businesses dealing with crypto in Texas might face increased pressure to implement robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures to avoid inadvertently facilitating criminal activity. Clarity vs. Uncertainty: While the law provides clarity on the state’s power, it also introduces a new layer of legal complexity. Users should be aware of the implications, especially regarding the provenance of their digital assets. Ultimately, the goal is to create a safer environment for legitimate crypto adoption by making it harder for criminals to exploit the technology. This is a crucial step towards mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Actionable Insights for Texas Crypto Holders: Navigating New Blockchain Regulation? For anyone holding cryptocurrencies in Texas, understanding the implications of this new blockchain regulation is key. While the law targets criminal activity, being informed is always beneficial. Here are some actionable insights: Understand the Source of Your Funds: Always be aware of where your cryptocurrencies come from. If you are receiving funds from unknown sources or engaging in peer-to-peer transactions, exercise extreme caution and conduct due diligence. Use Reputable Platforms: When buying, selling, or storing crypto, use well-regulated and reputable exchanges and wallets that comply with AML/KYC regulations. These platforms often have better security and audit trails. Secure Your Private Keys: This remains paramount. Whether you use a hardware wallet, a software wallet, or an exchange, ensure your private keys are secure and never shared. The state’s ability to seize assets is predicated on identifying and accessing them; robust personal security practices reduce risk. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of evolving regulations and legal interpretations concerning digital assets. Laws can change, and staying informed helps you navigate the landscape responsibly. Consult Legal Counsel if Necessary: If you find yourself in a situation where your digital assets are questioned or implicated in an investigation, seek legal advice immediately from an attorney specializing in cryptocurrency law. This proactive approach can help legitimate users navigate the evolving legal landscape with confidence and ensure their assets remain secure and compliant. Looking Ahead: The Future of Blockchain Regulation in Texas and Beyond. The passage of SB1498 is more than just a single piece of legislation; it’s a clear signal of Texas’s intent to be a significant player in the evolving landscape of blockchain regulation . This law, focusing on digital asset forfeiture and crypto seizure , demonstrates a pragmatic approach to integrating digital assets into existing legal frameworks. We can anticipate several trends emerging from this development: Increased Collaboration: Expect greater collaboration between state and federal law enforcement agencies, as well as with private blockchain analytics firms, to enhance capabilities in tracing and seizing illicit crypto. Evolving Legal Precedents: As cases involving crypto seizure move through the courts, new legal precedents will be set, further refining the application of these laws. Technological Arms Race: The cat-and-mouse game between criminals using sophisticated anonymizing techniques and law enforcement employing advanced tracing tools will continue to escalate, driving innovation on both sides. Harmonization of Laws: Texas’s move could spur other states to develop similar legislation, potentially leading to a more harmonized approach to crypto regulation across the U.S. Focus on DeFi and NFTs: While the current law broadly covers ‘digital assets,’ future legislative efforts might specifically target emerging areas like decentralized finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) as their use in illicit activities potentially grows. Texas is positioning itself at the forefront of a crucial regulatory shift, acknowledging that the digital frontier requires robust legal tools to ensure security and uphold justice. The implications of this law will ripple through the crypto community, influencing how digital assets are perceived, used, and regulated for years to come. Texas’s new law to seize cryptocurrencies tied to crimes marks a significant milestone in the ongoing effort to bring the digital asset world under a clear legal umbrella. Senate Bill SB1498, effective September 1, empowers the state to conduct crypto seizure , store assets securely, and actively combat cryptocurrency crime . While presenting clear benefits in deterring illicit activities and providing resources for law enforcement, it also brings forth challenges related to technical expertise, asset volatility, and civil liberties. This proactive step in blockchain regulation signifies a growing trend where states are adapting their legal frameworks to the complexities of the digital age. For legitimate crypto users, understanding this evolving Texas crypto law and practicing strong digital security are more important than ever. As the landscape continues to evolve, the balance between innovation, security, and individual rights will remain a critical point of discussion, shaping the future of digital asset adoption and enforcement.

Far from the simple amusement of previous frog-themed coins, this project has laid out a thoughtful roadmap for growth, liquidity, and broad community participation. The presale is currently in its third stage, priced attractively at $0.0012 per token, and has already generated energy equivalent to many established protocols, evidenced by the more than $1.7 million raised so far. Little Pepe is committed to fee-free, frictionless trading on a blockchain optimized for speed and resistance to predatory bots. Users won’t encounter sniping scripts preempting liquidity pools; instead, they’ll enjoy near-instant transactions and minimal network costs. The developers have also allocated resources to secure listings on top centralized exchanges at launch, ensuring ample market depth and easy access for newcomers. Another key reason Little Pepe is attracting savvy investors is its allocation model, which avoids excessive taxation and opaque reserves. Moreover, the team’s roadmap reads like a launchpad for continuous innovation. Early phases focus on building a thriving presale community, followed by strategic exchange listings and marketing campaigns designed to spark wider awareness. In later stages, the plan is to roll out a dedicated meme launchpad, enabling creators to issue their tokens on Little Pepe’s chain. This fusion of entertainment and utility positions the network for sustained interest long after the initial buzz. Riding the next wave of meme innovation Little Pepe embraces the humor of internet culture while providing utility to the crypto space. In markets where the giants have paused, this fresh ecosystem offers both a playground for meme enthusiasts and a utility-rich framework for DeFi pioneers. Investing $400 into Little Pepe today could secure more than 333,000 tokens at the current presale price. Should the project execute its exchange listing plans and ecosystem rollouts smoothly, even a modest bump in visibility could produce exponential returns for participants. That sort of potential return is precisely what investors seek when BTC and ETH charts flatten out amid global turmoil. Conclusion Predicting the market’s reaction to heightened tensions is a fool’s errand. Still, history has proven that the biggest wins often happen when fear is at its peak. By allocating a portfolio for Little Pepe, investors are taking a shot at history, leaving room to ride the next big wave. Little Pepe isn’t just another meme token; it’s built on solid Layer-2 tech and has already received over $1.7 million in presale funding. Those curious about where meme culture and serious blockchain innovation intersect, this is one worth watching. As headlines turn to the latest Israel–Iran tensions, remember that resilience and creativity tend to outpace legacy credentials. Sometimes, the projects born in uncertainty are the ones that redefine an entire market. Little Pepe may just be the token that proves how agility, humor, and thoughtful design can thrive when the market’s biggest names take a breather.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-exchange-traded-funds-etf-passed-critical-level-in-11th-month-here-are-the-details/,"Spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) traded in the United States have surpassed the $4 billion cumulative net inflow threshold in the 11th month of their launch. US Spot Ethereum ETFs Surpass $4 Billion Net Inflow Threshold This milestone was surpassed on Monday, June 23, with daily inflows of $100.7 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024. Despite recent geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the high daily inflows indicate continued investor confidence. Fidelity Takes Lead, BlackRock Second Fidelity’s FETH fund had the biggest inflow on Monday, with $60.5 million. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF, which usually leads, came in second with $25.8 million inflows. Grayscale’s ETHE fund saw $9 million inflows, while its ETH mini product saw $5.4 million. Other ETFs saw no movement. Spot Ethereum ETFs, like Bitcoin ETFs, have achieved a positive balance sheet overall despite the large outflows from the high-fee Grayscale ETHE fund. Grayscale ETHE fund alone has seen $4.3 billion in outflows to date. Without these outflows, total net inflows could have reached $8.3 billion. Following these exits, the Grayscale ETHE fund's market share fell from 89.7% to 30.2%, while BlackRock's ETHA fund rose to the lead with a share of 31.8%. Fidelity FETH ranked third with 18%, and Grayscale ETH ranked fourth with 15.5%. “$4 billion net inflow including Grayscale outflows, I think that’s quite a feat. If you recall, some experts suggested that Bitcoin ETFs could raise a maximum of $5 billion in the first year. Expectations are constantly being updated,” ETF Store President Nate Geraci said in an assessment on the social media platform X. Total trading volume of spot Ethereum ETFs reached $89 billion, with daily volume on June 23 at $840 million. While this figure is still below the $1.5 billion daily peak in February, it remains above average. Bitcoin ETFs Still Ahead For comparison, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $34.7 billion in the first 11 months since their launch in January 2024. That figure has now reached $47.3 billion. On June 23, there was a net inflow of $350.8 million into Bitcoin ETFs. This means a total inflow of $2.8 billion in the last 10 days. BlackRock’s IBIT product was again prominent in the inflows. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) Passed Critical Level in 11th Month!

While Ethereum has long held the spotlight, analysts are now eyeing a new breed of digital assets that promise staggering returns by 2025. Leading the charge are coins like BONK, PEPE, SHIB, and TURBO. Yet, a new contender, Codename:Pepe crypto, emerges with a bold mission, harnessing true AI potential for unprecedented gains. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, two of the most prominent trends today. Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use ""AI"" as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility, while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices. The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market: AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Bonk (BONK): The Solana Meme Coin That Defied Expectations Bonk (BONK) emerged in late 2022 as a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, aiming to provide a fast and low-cost alternative to Ethereum-based tokens. Unlike Solana's native token SOL, which is also used for governance, BONK focuses solely on facilitating transactions and enhancing liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. Its simplicity and meme appeal quickly caught the attention of the crypto community. When BONK was released in December 2022, its price skyrocketed alongside SOL, reflecting strong market enthusiasm. By 2025, BONK had weathered the volatile crypto landscape, demonstrating resilience compared to other meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Its association with Solana's high-speed network helped maintain user interest and transactional utility. Experts had mixed opinions on BONK's long-term potential. Subhash Chandra, founder of Crowdwisdom360, was bullish, citing upcoming bull markets and the token's ongoing promotions as catalysts for growth. In contrast, analysts like Peter Henn expressed skepticism due to the anonymity of BONK's founders and a lackluster white paper, raising concerns about transparency and long-term viability. Price predictions from various analysts in 2023 suggested cautious optimism. By 2025, forecasts estimated BONK could reach highs ranging from $0.000043 to $0.00009368. Looking further ahead, projections for 2030 varied, with some expecting the price to exceed $0.0025. These predictions indicated potential growth but also underscored the uncertainties inherent in the crypto market. As BONK continues to navigate the evolving blockchain landscape, its focus on transaction efficiency and community engagement positions it uniquely among meme coins. While it faces challenges, particularly regarding transparency and competition, BONK's integration with Solana's technology could support its appeal in future market cycles. From Meme to Mainstream: The Leap of PEPE Coin PEPE started as a simple internet meme—a cartoon frog created by Matt Furie in the early 2000s. Now, it's a cryptocurrency sensation. Based on that famous frog, PEPE coin is a deflationary token on the Ethereum blockchain. It's known for its simplicity and the strong community behind it. PEPE keeps things straightforward with three phases: Meme, Vibe and HODL, and Meme Takeover. Unlike projects with complex promises, PEPE embraces its meme roots. It aims to grow through community support and fun. Being a deflationary coin means its supply decreases over time, which could boost its value. In 2025, PEPE has seen both highs and lows. It reached an all-time high of $0.00002825 in December 2024, then dipped about 68%. This kind of volatility is common in meme coins. But with a dedicated community and growing interest, PEPE might be ready for another leap. Analysts have mixed views. Some predict PEPE could rise to $0.000055 or even higher by the end of 2025. Looking further ahead, forecasts for 2030 suggest prices ranging from $0.000014 to $0.0182. There's even a prediction of PEPE reaching $1.53 by 2050. Whether PEPE will soar or stumble depends on market sentiment and community support. Its simple approach and meme appeal make it stand out. For those who believe in the power of internet culture, PEPE could be an exciting part of the crypto market's future. Shiba Inu: From Meme Coin to Market Marvel - What Lies Ahead? Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in 2020 as a meme coin aiming to ride the wave of Dogecoin's popularity. Originally intended as a playful digital currency for payments, SHIB quickly gained traction thanks to buzz from figures like Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-20 standard, it offered a familiar yet fresh option for crypto enthusiasts. As SHIB's popularity soared, its creators seized the opportunity to expand its utility. They launched a decentralized exchange (DEX) and introduced an NFT project, drawing even more users into the fold. These developments helped Shiba Inu stand out from other meme coins by providing real-world applications beyond internet humor. The coin's potential lies in its growing ecosystem, which includes ventures into gaming, a metaverse, and even merchandise. While these projects have found favor with its active community, broader adoption could hinge on external factors like market trends and renewed interest in cryptocurrency innovations. Historically, SHIB experienced a meteoric rise in 2020 and 2021 before settling into a more stable price range. This period of consolidation might position it for future growth, especially if new users are drawn to its expanding offerings during the next market upswing. In the long term, Shiba Inu's success may depend on its ability to continue differentiating itself and adapting in an ever-evolving crypto landscape. With a strong community and an ambitious roadmap, SHIB could be poised for significant developments in the years to come. Turbo Token: The AI-Made Memecoin Captivating the Crypto World In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, Turbo Token stands out as a marvel. Born from GPT-4, it's the first memecoin created by artificial intelligence. This coin isn't just another digital currency; it's a symbol of innovation, blending technology and community spirit. The founder had a bold idea: ask an AI to create the next big memecoin. GPT-4 rose to the challenge, designing Turbo Token as a coin for the people. It's a testament to what's possible when AI and human ambition come together. Turbo Token's potential lies in its AI origins. It embodies a fresh approach to technology and decentralization. It appeals to tech enthusiasts and meme lovers alike. Its simplicity and community focus make it accessible to everyone. Since its launch, Turbo Token has seen remarkable growth. Over the past years, it has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts, becoming a staple in the crypto market. As of 2025, its journey reflects a promising future. Looking ahead, Turbo Token seems poised to continue upward. Its unique creation story and strong community support suggest it could play a role in the market's evolution. For those seeking innovation in crypto, Turbo Token is an exciting prospect. Conclusion In conclusion, while BONK, PEPE, SHIB, and TURBO may show less potential for short-term growth, Codename:Pepe crypto stands out with a unique approach. By harnessing genuine artificial intelligence, it aims to guide investors through the meme coin market and maximize profits. Holding Codename:Pepe crypto grants access to an exclusive DAO with special strategies, insider analytics, and voting rights on key decisions. With its limited token supply and community-driven mission, early participation could offer significant opportunities before others take notice.

Table of Contents Neo Pepe Coin’s presale mania ignites investor enthusiasm Unique mechanics are amplifying interest LINK’s stability vs. Neo Pepe’s cultural momentum BITGIRL CRYPTO pulls no punches on Neo Pepe Why NEOP is considered this year’s leading crypto presale Maximize presale opportunities Chainlink ( LINK ) is gaining a substantial amount of bullish momentum as traders set their sights on a critical resistance level at $14.45. Technical analysts have pinpointed a clear ascending triangle formation, which could resolve upwards and deliver an explosive breakout if strong volume accompanies it. Increased institutional interest flooding back into the crypto space has re-established Chainlink as a top-tier, high-utility digital asset. As investors hungry for stable, infrastructure-based tokens search for meaningful growth and use-case certainty, they seem to have found a safe harbor in Chainlink. Neo Pepe Coin’s presale mania ignites investor enthusiasm At present, investors seeking the most lucrative opportunities in crypto presales have set their sights firmly on Neo Pepe Coin (NEOP). Now in Stage 4, the presale for Neo Pepe has astonishingly pulled in over $1.3 million, with tokens currently priced at $0.07. What really makes Neo Pepe stand out, though, is its carefully curated approach to community and its structure that is all too reminiscent of some of the most successful memecoins, like Dogecoin, for instance. Unique mechanics are amplifying interest Neo Pepe’s structured presale strategy and robust community-driven model are generating consistent excitement. The staged presale approach rewards early participation, with clearly defined token price increments at each stage. As early investors snap up tokens quickly, later-stage participants experience intensifying FOMO, driving demand and subsequent buying pressure. The parallels to major past memecoin successes are evident, positioning Neo Pepe as possibly the best Pepe coin currently available for presale. With its built-in incentives like referral rewards and meme-based engagement bonuses, Neo Pepe’s structured but culturally driven approach uniquely combines virality with security, an attractive proposition for early investors. Additionally, Neo Pepe introduces an innovative automatic liquidity mechanism, where every transaction incurs a 2.5% fee added directly to the liquidity pool. Liquidity pool tokens are subsequently burned, providing permanent liquidity and further reassuring investors about the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Both tokens’ parallel ascent highlights the diversified approaches of crypto investors in 2025, revealing how vastly different strategies can succeed concurrently in a bullish market environment. BITGIRL CRYPTO pulls no punches on Neo Pepe BITGIRL CRYPTO’s latest analysis video takes an unfiltered and refreshingly candid look at the presale dynamics of Neo Pepe. Unlike the usual crypto chitchat, their commentary of Neo Pepe navigates the project’s strengths and vulnerabilities with the kind of clear-eyed, forthrightness we seldom see in the space. They highlight the Neo Pepe presale structure as a new kind of driver for community engagement, not as a gimmick. They especially like this auto-liquidity feature of the presale, and for good reason: It’s something a project would put in place if it were trying to be seen as a clear, commonsensical, and long-term stable crypto alternative to the short-term speculating typical in the space of late. BITGIRL CRYPTO’s video does a fair job of balancing praise with a necessary dose of reality.

But what if we told you that sometimes, the earliest signals come from an unexpected corner – the everyday retail trader? A fascinating development recently unfolded on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, where a surge in Bitcoin retail inflows preceded a significant price correction. This isn’t just a quirky data point; it’s a potential game-changer in how we understand market dynamics. What Triggered This Unusual Bitcoin Retail Inflows Surge? On June 15, something remarkable happened: Bitcoin retail inflows to Binance skyrocketed to over 25%. This wasn’t just a minor blip; it was the highest level seen since May 2023. What followed was even more intriguing. Shortly after this massive influx, BTC experienced a sharp decline, plummeting from approximately $105,000 to $98,200. Just a few days later, on June 19, another notable spike occurred, with inflows reaching 19%, as reported by CryptoQuant contributor Maartunn. Traditionally, retail traders are often seen as reactive, jumping into the market during a bull run (FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out) or panic-selling during a downturn (FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). However, this recent data paints a different picture. It suggests that a segment of retail traders was unusually early in reacting to impending market shifts. They weren’t just following the crowd; they were, in some sense, leading it. This proactive trading behavior challenges conventional wisdom about market participation. Consider these key observations from the data: First Spike (June 15): Inflows surged past 25%, marking a two-year high for retail deposits on Binance. This was immediately followed by a significant BTC price drop . Second Spike (June 19): A follow-up surge of 19% occurred, indicating continued unusual activity from retail wallets. The Anomaly: Retail traders typically buy into strength or sell into weakness. Here, they were depositing Bitcoin before a price drop, suggesting a strategic positioning or an early read on the market. This raises a crucial question: were these retail traders privy to information, or were they simply exhibiting a heightened sense of market intuition? The answer could have profound implications for how we analyze market sentiment and predict future movements. Decoding Proactive Retail Trader Behavior on Binance BTC The concept of retail trader behavior being “proactive” is a fascinating deviation from the norm. What could explain this unusual foresight among a group often perceived as the last to react? Several theories emerge when looking at Binance BTC activity: Sophisticated On-Chain Analysis: A growing number of retail traders are now equipped with advanced tools and knowledge to analyze on-chain data, exchange flows, and whale movements. They might have spotted early signs of institutional selling or large whale deposits that often precede price corrections. Network Effects and Information Spread: In the age of social media and crypto communities, information (and sometimes misinformation) spreads rapidly. Perhaps early signals were shared within private groups or communities, allowing a segment of retail traders to act swiftly. Accumulation for Shorting/Hedging: It’s possible some retail traders were depositing BTC onto the exchange not to sell immediately, but to prepare for shorting opportunities or to hedge existing long positions. This would require foresight into a potential downturn. Coincidence or Lucky Guess: While less glamorous, it’s also possible that these spikes were a confluence of individual decisions that, by chance, aligned with the market’s direction. However, the timing and magnitude make this less likely to be purely random. The fact that this occurred on Binance, a behemoth in the crypto space, adds another layer of significance. Binance’s sheer volume and user base mean that even slight shifts in retail trader behavior on its platform can serve as a powerful barometer for broader market sentiment. The exchange’s liquidity and range of trading options also make it a prime location for both immediate transactions and strategic positioning. Retail Bitcoin inflows to Binance preceded a notable price correction. Understanding Broader Crypto Market Trends: A Retail Perspective These recent events highlight the evolving role of retail participants in shaping crypto market trends . While institutional money often drives large, sustained movements, the cumulative effect of millions of retail decisions can create significant short-term volatility and provide early signals. Historically, market analysis often focused on institutional flows, derivatives data, and macroeconomic indicators. However, the Binance retail inflow data suggests that retail activity, when observed keenly, can offer unique insights. This particular incident underscores: The Power of Aggregated Retail Data: Individual retail actions might seem small, but when aggregated, they can reveal powerful trends. Tools that track exchange inflows/outflows are becoming indispensable for market analysts. Decentralization of Information: With more data available to the public, the line between “smart money” and “dumb money” is blurring. Sophisticated analysis is no longer exclusive to large institutions. Early Warning Systems: A sudden surge in deposits to exchanges, especially from retail addresses, could be an early warning sign of impending selling pressure or profit-taking, influencing crypto market trends . However, it’s crucial to approach such data with caution. Not every retail inflow surge will lead to a price drop, and market dynamics are influenced by countless factors. These events serve as a reminder that the crypto market is a complex adaptive system, where various participants interact in unpredictable ways. Navigating the BTC Price Drop: Actionable Insights for Traders The recent BTC price drop after significant retail inflows offers valuable lessons for any trader looking to navigate the volatile crypto landscape. How can you leverage such insights and protect your portfolio? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Pay attention to exchange inflow/outflow data, especially for major exchanges like Binance. Tools like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and others provide real-time insights that can help you anticipate market shifts. Look for unusual spikes in deposits or withdrawals. Understand the “Why”: Don’t just react to data; try to understand the potential reasons behind it. Are these new buyers, or are existing holders moving assets to exchanges, possibly to sell or use in derivatives trading? Implement Robust Risk Management: Regardless of market signals, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses during sudden downturns like the recent BTC price drop . Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin is a dominant asset, a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden price movements in a single asset. Avoid Emotional Trading: The crypto market thrives on fear and greed. Data points like these are useful, but they should inform your strategy, not dictate impulsive decisions. Stick to your trading plan. Stay Informed, But Verify: Follow reputable analysts and news sources, but always cross-reference information. The crypto space is rife with speculation and misinformation. The proactive nature of these retail traders, whether by design or fortunate timing, serves as a powerful reminder that vigilance and informed decision-making are paramount. The market is always speaking; the challenge lies in learning to listen. A New Dawn for Retail Influence? The recent surge in Bitcoin retail inflows to Binance, preceding a notable BTC price drop , marks a compelling chapter in the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency markets. It challenges the long-held perception of retail traders as merely reactive participants, suggesting a growing sophistication and perhaps even a leading role in signaling future movements. This isn’t just about a couple of data points; it’s about the potential for retail trader behavior to become a more significant indicator for broader crypto market trends . As more individuals gain access to advanced analytical tools and communities, the collective wisdom of the crowd, particularly on platforms like Binance BTC , could become an increasingly vital component of market analysis. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this serves as a powerful reminder: keep your eyes on the data, for the whispers of the market might just come from the most unexpected voices.

According to a press release received by crypto.news, the collaboration will integrate the Avail Stack infrastructure into the RWA chain to unlock more liquidity and interoperability and ensure data-level secure verification for tokenized real-world assets. The Avail Stack is a full-stack blockchain infrastructure solution designed to address scalability, interoperability, and liquidity challenges in the blockchain space. It combines three core components, which includes data availability, cross-chain layering, and Avail’s security mechanism. Its Avail Nexus provides multichain messaging and secure asset movement, laying out the foundation for cross‑chain RWA liquidity. With access to Nexus, Lumia can support multi-chain RWA liquidity as part of its efforts to expand on cross-chain operations. The partnership marks a shift in the infrastructure built on Lumia as it moves away from the traditional siloed blockchains to a more modular and interoperable infrastructure. It equips the RWA Chain with Avail’s scalable data‑availability layer, which features KZG polynomial commitments, Data Availability Sampling, erasure coding, and light‑client architecture. The Avail and Lumia integration is scheduled to debut along with major other functionalities and upgrades, such as Lumia Hub, which will launch with Avail DA integration. The upgrade will allow users and builders to issue tokenized RWAs with light-node NFT functionalities.

He also stated multiple sources cite a growth of more than 60% in terms of Compound Annual Growth Rate. “This means more people are becoming crypto-literate, more are discovering new investment vehicles, and demand for RWA tokenization is higher than ever,” said Ali. Echoing Ali’s sentiments, Avail co-founder Anurag Arjun said the potential of tokenization will fully be realized once assets can be liquified, programmable, and globally verifiable on a data-level. “We need infrastructure that guarantees a composable and interoperable environment; one where tokenized assets aren’t locked into singular ecosystems, but can move freely across chains with compliance, security and scalability embedded at the base layer,” said Arjun. According to a joint study by Ripple ( XRP ) and Boston Consulting Group, the global market size for tokenized assets could reach as high as $18.9 trillion by 2033. This rapid growth in adoption is mostly due to the rise in institutional demand for blockchain technology and tokenization of assets.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been on an upward trend over the past 24 hours, posting an approximate 4% gain that saw the crypto giant reclaim the $105,000 mark .

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Amid memecoin volatility, Angry Pepe Fork stands out as a newcomer showing verifiable traction and investor interest. When talking about memecoins, many of them come from similar ideas, but no two coins offer the expected end results. Take DOGE and SHIB as examples. Although being widely talked about and Elon Musk-backed, they still experience their fair share of dips and bad days. Amidst such volatility, tangibility comes from newer contenders that promise verifiable upticks. Angry Pepe Fork is one such recent anomaly. Let’s explore how. You might also like: ADA short positions spike; experts double down on Dogecoin, Angry Pepe Fork Why are big investors buying SHIB? Shiba Inu’s largest holders just showed how fast normal price changes. On 19 June, wallets controlling at least 0.1% of the supply accumulated about 1.3 trillion SHIB in a day, the heaviest whale inflow this month. Such bulk orders soak up order-book liquidity and can nudge prices beyond what retail traders expect. The buying spree hit while SHIB traded at $0.0000108 on 23 June, down roughly 11% on the week yet still clearing more than $265 million in daily volume, hinting that deep-pocketed investors see value near the $0.000011 band. Could SHIB really go up 194%? Analysts are watching a textbook double-bottom that has been forming since April. A double bottom appears when sellers fail twice to break the same floor; the second rebound often invites algorithmic bids because downward momentum is fading. If SHIB defends $0.0000113 and later clears the neckline at $0.0000173, the measured-move target sits near $0.000033, a potential 194% rally from today’s price. Short-term models echo that bias, flagging $0.000012 by 26 June as a nearer waypoint, but any close below support would void the setup. For newcomers: whale demand plus a bullish pattern improves odds, not guarantees. What makes Angry Pepe Fork different? While SHIB veterans debate resistance lines, a new frog-themed contender called Angry Pepe Fork (APORK) is gathering early-stage capital. The presale started at $0.0269 per token, with the trackers showing about $244,562.34 of the $893,408 first-stage target already filled, and ten days left before the price increases. Supply is capped at $1.9b, and only 380 million (20%) are on sale now, locking the meme into true micro-cap territory. Early contributors pocket tiered bonuses of 5 to 20%, and the roadmap includes bridges to Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, promising wider liquidity and cheaper fees once trading begins. How does Angry Pepe Fork keep its value? APORK brands itself as “the meme coin that pays.” One driver is called CommunityFi: every tweet, video, or referral that drives new traffic earns micro-payments in APORK, turning the community into a 24/7 marketing team. Second is GambleFi: an on-chain arcade where players wager tokens for jackpots. A slice of every pot is automatically burned, shrinking the supply just like ETH’s fee-burning logic. In addition to these, purchasers can stake their allocation for 10,000%+ APY yields, though rates drop as the pool fills and after launch. With fixed supply, routine burns, paid engagement, and staking lock-ups, APORK fields four demand loops that many older memes lack. Which coin to buy?

This Nasdaq-listed company has revealed plans to acquire up to $1 billion worth of BNB, setting the stage for what could become one of the largest institutional holdings of the token. Could this be the start of a multi-asset treasury strategy for companies once focused solely on Bitcoin? $500M Deal Marks the Start To kickstart the plan, Nano Labs has entered into a $500 million convertible note agreement.

This development highlights a growing trend among industry players to strengthen their balance sheets with the leading cryptocurrency. What is Vinanz’s Latest Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy? Vinanz , known for its operations within the burgeoning digital asset space, made waves with its recent announcement on X (formerly Twitter). The firm revealed it has added an impressive 37.72 more Bitcoin to its holdings. This significant acquisition brings their total treasury to a formidable 58.68 BTC, showcasing a clear commitment to their ongoing BTC accumulation strategy. For many, this isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver. By consistently adding Bitcoin to their treasury, Vinanz is effectively: Hedging Against Inflation: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against traditional fiat currency inflation, providing a store of value. Long-Term Value Proposition: The firm likely believes in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential, making it a valuable asset for future growth. Operational Stability: Holding a significant amount of BTC can provide a strong financial backbone, offering flexibility and resilience against market fluctuations. Industry Leadership: By publicly committing to BTC accumulation, Vinanz reinforces its position as a serious player in the crypto ecosystem. Why is BTC Accumulation a Key Trend for Crypto Mining Firms? The decision by Vinanz to boost its Bitcoin holdings isn’t isolated. Many crypto mining companies globally are adopting similar strategies. This approach stems from several compelling factors: Direct Exposure to Asset Appreciation: Miners earn BTC directly from their operations. By holding onto a portion of their mined Bitcoin rather than immediately selling it, they gain direct exposure to any future price increases. Enhanced Balance Sheet Strength: A robust Bitcoin treasury can significantly enhance a company’s balance sheet, making it more attractive to investors and potentially easing access to capital markets. Operational Flexibility: Holding BTC provides liquidity that can be deployed for various purposes, such as funding expansion, covering operational costs during market downturns, or even investing in new technologies. Market Confidence Signal: When a mining firm, which intimately understands the economics and technology behind Bitcoin, chooses to accumulate it, it sends a strong signal of confidence to the broader market. This strategy aligns with a broader industry trend where companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as a currency to be sold for operational expenses, but as a core treasury asset. What Does This Mean for the UK Crypto Landscape? The actions of firms like Vinanz have a significant ripple effect, particularly within the UK Crypto scene. As a UK-listed entity, Vinanz’s strategic moves contribute to the growing legitimacy and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies within the United Kingdom. This is crucial for several reasons: Regulatory Confidence: As more regulated, publicly listed companies engage with crypto assets, it can foster greater confidence among regulators, potentially leading to more favorable and clear regulatory frameworks. Investor Interest: Such announcements can pique the interest of traditional investors who might be hesitant to enter the crypto market directly but are comfortable investing in a publicly traded company with crypto exposure. Innovation Hub: The UK aims to be a global hub for crypto innovation. Companies demonstrating strong, transparent strategies involving digital assets contribute directly to this goal, attracting talent and investment. Economic Contribution: Successful crypto mining and accumulation strategies can contribute to the national economy through job creation, technological advancement, and tax revenues. The UK has been navigating its stance on crypto, balancing innovation with consumer protection. Vinanz’s actions demonstrate that robust, legitimate crypto operations are thriving within this environment, potentially influencing future policy decisions positively. How Does Vinanz’s Strategy Compare to Other Major Players in Crypto Mining? While Vinanz ‘s recent BTC accumulation is notable, it’s part of a larger narrative unfolding across the global crypto mining industry. Many of the largest publicly traded miners, especially those in North America, have also adopted aggressive Bitcoin holding strategies. For instance: Company Primary Strategy Impact Marathon Digital Hold significant portion of mined BTC Large BTC treasury, high market cap volatility Riot Platforms Strategic BTC sales balanced with accumulation Flexibility in operations, strong balance sheet CleanSpark Aggressive BTC holding, rapid expansion Growing BTC reserves, significant operational scale Vinanz Consistent BTC accumulation, UK focus Building a strong UK-based crypto asset base While the scale of operations may differ, the underlying principle of leveraging mined Bitcoin for long-term value creation remains consistent. This collective strategy underscores a bullish outlook from those most intimately involved in the Bitcoin network’s security and issuance. What are the Challenges and Opportunities in this Strategic Bitcoin Play? While the decision by Vinanz to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings presents clear advantages, it also comes with inherent challenges and opportunities that define the landscape of crypto mining and asset management: Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile. A sudden downturn could significantly impact the value of the firm’s treasury, affecting its balance sheet and investor sentiment. Operational Costs: Mining operations require substantial capital expenditure and ongoing energy costs. Balancing BTC accumulation with the need to cover these expenses can be a delicate act. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the UK is exploring crypto regulation, future policy changes could impact the legality or taxation of holding large crypto treasuries. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin necessitates robust security measures to protect against hacks or theft. Opportunities: Significant Upside Potential: If Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, the accumulated BTC could yield substantial returns, far outweighing traditional investment options. Enhanced Investor Confidence: A strong BTC treasury can signal financial stability and a long-term vision, attracting more institutional and retail investors. Flexibility for Future Growth: The accumulated Bitcoin can serve as collateral for loans, be used for strategic acquisitions, or fund further expansion into new mining ventures or other crypto-related services. Pioneering Position: By being an early and aggressive accumulator among UK-listed firms, Vinanz can solidify its pioneering position in the evolving digital economy. Navigating these aspects requires astute financial management and a deep understanding of both the cryptocurrency market and traditional corporate finance. Conclusion: Vinanz’s Bold Step in the UK Crypto Landscape Vinanz ‘s latest announcement of adding 37.72 more Bitcoin to its treasury, bringing its total to 58.68 BTC, is more than just a routine update; it’s a powerful statement of confidence in the long-term value of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic BTC accumulation by a UK Crypto mining firm underscores a broader industry trend where miners are evolving from mere sellers of their output to strategic holders of a key digital asset. As the crypto mining industry continues to mature, firms like Vinanz are demonstrating a sophisticated approach to treasury management, leveraging their unique position to build substantial Bitcoin reserves. This move not only strengthens Vinanz’s financial standing but also contributes to the overall legitimization and growth of the digital asset economy within the United Kingdom. It signals a future where digital assets play an increasingly central role in corporate balance sheets, driven by a vision of sustained growth and value creation.

YouTube publicly pushed back a recommendation from eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant to reverse the government’s earlier decision to exempt YouTube from the Social Media Minimum Age Act. The act , which is meant to take effect this December, will ensure that children under 16 cannot access platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, and Meta-owned Instagram, with penalties for erring platforms. During an address at the National Press Club in Sydney, Inman Grant said, “This is not a fair fight where our kids are concerned, vis-a-vis social media sites.” Inman Grant doubled down, warning that YouTube’s design features, especially its recommendation algorithms, are engineered to keep users hooked and can expose children to inappropriate content. Grant cited internal research that 37% of children aged 10 to 15 had encountered harmful material on YouTube, more than on any other major platform. “ I’m more concerned about the safety of children, ” she said, even in the face of widespread support for YouTube’s exemption. YouTube claps back YouTube didn’t let the criticism slide. In a blog post , the platform accused the commissioner of dismissing evidence, community sentiment, and professional opinion. Rachel Lord, YouTube’s Senior Public Policy and Government Relations Manager for Australia and New Zealand, called Inman Grant’s recommendation “inconsistent and contradictory,” especially when viewed against months of alignment between government, educators, and parents. “The eSafety Commissioner chose to ignore this data, the decision of the Australian Government and other clear evidence from teachers and parents that YouTube is suitable for younger users,” Lord wrote. The blog highlighted a 2024 survey showing that 84% of Australian teachers use YouTube in the classroom at least once a month, with the same number saying it helps extend learning beyond school hours. Additional government-backed research found that 85% of children and nearly 69% of parents see YouTube as appropriate for users under 15, a clear contrast to the public perception of platforms like TikTok and Instagram. For YouTube, the real distinction lies in function. It sees itself not as a social media platform, but as a video library that increasingly lives on TV screens, not just smartphones. The Australian government is in a difficult position Now, the Australian government is caught in a tough position after previously committing to keeping YouTube off the ban list. A spokesperson for Communications Minister Anika Wells confirmed that her office had received the eSafety Commissioner’s updated advice and is weighing the next steps. “The Minister’s top priority is making sure the draft rules fulfill the objective of the Act and protect children from the harms of social media,” the spokesperson said. Rival platforms like TikTok, Snap, and Meta have previously argued that any exemptions would be unfair. With the commissioner’s latest push, those arguments may start to gain more traction. Globally, all eyes are on Australia. Its social media age restriction law is the first of its kind, and other countries are watching closely to see how it plays out, particularly how regulators draw lines between platforms and how those lines hold up under scrutiny. As the December deadline looms, the government faces a critical choice: uphold its original plan to exempt YouTube or side with the eSafety Commissioner’s call for consistency across all platforms.

The deal, which was announced Monday, will see ProCap Financial go public on Nasdaq with a plan to rapidly buy and hold up to $1 billion of Bitcoin—about an eighth of Michael Saylor's legendary hoard—making it among the biggest BTC treasuries to list on public markets in history. Deal Structure: How ProCap Is Going Public ProCap's route to the public markets is a conventional SPAC play with a cryptocurrency twist. The $750 million financing consists of $516.5 million in equity and $235 million of convertible notes, with U.S. Bank as collateral agent and trustee. Unusually, ProCap is investing $516.5 million to buy Bitcoin within 15 days of signing, giving investors immediate BTC exposure even before the closing of the merger. The convertible notes are 130% convertible and 2x collateralized in cash or Bitcoin, giving institutional backers downside protection. Upon merging, ProCap Financial will be led by Pompliano, offering not just a humongous Bitcoin reserve but also a series of BTC-denominated financial products—lending, trading, and capital markets—to generate yield and profits off its balance sheet. Why SPACs Are Back—And Why Crypto Loves Them SPACs, or Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, are making a comeback in 2025 after a two-year absence, with the help of a better regulatory climate and a slowdown in traditional IPOs. SPACs offer crypto firms a short-cut to the public markets, sidestepping the lengthy and costly IPO route. ProCap's transaction is the largest initial raise for a publicly listed Bitcoin treasury business thus far, demonstrating Wall Street's appetites for risk and digital assets once more. The property is also a testament to the growing ”Bitcoin treasury” trend, spearheaded by MicroStrategy (now Strategy) and holding over 592,000 BTC. ProCap's $1 billion target would represent about 12.5% of Saylor's stack and be among the largest corporate BTC holders globally. Regulatory Hurdles and Listing-Day Pricing Even with the hype, the deal is under quite high regulatory scrutiny. The transaction is expected to be finalized in 2025, pending shareholder approval and SEC approval. According to experts, although the SPAC framework allows for speed, it also brings scrutiny—especially for crypto firms that are grappling with evolving custody, accounting, and reporting requirements. ProCap's hiring of U.S. Bank as collateral agent and its spot BTC buying initiative are meant to appease regulators and investors both. Valuation will be done on the final closing price of BTC bought, but with Bitcoin above $100,000, the market capitalization of ProCap can equal or even surpass some traditional financial institutions. Listing will come with the ticker $CCCM and provides shareholders with near-immediate exposure to BTC. SPACs, Bitcoin Treasuries, and Wall Street's Crypto Pivot ProCap's flashy entrance is symptomatic of a broader phenomenon: public companies vying to be ”Bitcoin proxies” for investors who would like exposure to digital currencies without the hassle of wallets or exchanges. More than 70 public companies collectively now hold over $67 billion in BTC, and 30+ new crypto treasury transactions have been announced since April. The SPAC route is specially attractive with Wall Street banks and institutional investors becoming friendly to the space and the Trump administration's light regulatory touch inviting new listings. While the SPAC renaissance and ProCap's aggressive listing have sparked the market, some experts warn against forces of a bubble and savvy risk management. ”There's an old George Soros quote: When I see a bubble, I buy,” Pompliano joked, ”because the trend works.” However, ProCap's successful listing will be contingent upon regulatory openness, timing in the markets, and learning how to generate yield from its BTC stack—something even Saylor's Strategy now attempts to accomplish. Bottom Line Pompliano's ProCap SPAC is a landmark for Bitcoin public market adoption and the return of SPACs to Wall Street's main stage. With $750 million in capital and a $1 billion BTC target, ProCap stands poised to raise the bar for corporate crypto treasuries—if it can clear the regulatory hurdle and fulfill its bold vision.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-24 15:36:37

So is this consolidation just a pause before the breakout—or a sign of deeper stagnation? Investors are watching closely as the charts tighten and narratives shift. This analysis is powered by Outset PR —the go-to agency for crypto projects ready to turn strategic milestones into market-moving visibility. With timing, media targeting, and performance analytics at its core, Outset PR ensures your project gets the attention it deserves. Ondo (ONDO): Undervalued Setup or Just Waiting for the Spark? Source: tradingview Ondo is trading between the high $0.50s and $0.80 range, holding steady despite a broader market dip and a 50% drop over the past six months. While current price action sits below key moving averages—signaling bearish pressure—the Relative Strength Index is approaching recovery territory, suggesting a shift may be forming. A breakout past $0.93 could unlock a push toward $1.15, offering 40% to 70% upside from current levels. With Ondo positioned at the center of the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization trend, it may only need a modest spark—like increased investor confidence or follow-through from recent alliances—to launch its next leg upward.

In a recent post on X, he outlined a time-based analysis centered on a triangle pattern that has been forming on the XRP chart for nearly a year. His projection, backed by historical data, identifies a specific window during which XRP could break out and begin its next significant move. Timing the Breakout: The Triangle Formation Triangle formations are well-known in technical analysis for signaling impending price action. Whether symmetrical, ascending, or descending, these patterns typically resolve between 75% and 95% of their total formation duration. According to EGRAG, XRP’s current triangle formation spans approximately 334 days. Applying the historical breakout window: 75% of 334 days is 251 days — pointing to early July 2025. 95% of 334 days is 317 days — suggesting mid-September 2025. This puts the likely breakout timeframe between early July and mid-September 2025. EGRAG describes this period as a “critical zone,” urging traders to stay alert as XRP approaches the apex of the formation. #XRP – The Breakout Is Coming – Base On Math : Based on historical patterns, breakouts from triangle formations (symmetrical, ascending, or descending) typically happen around 75% to 95% of the total pattern duration. Calculations for a 334-day pattern: 75% of 334… pic.twitter.com/64hhEK0J0A — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 24, 2025 XRP at $2.20: A Crucial Price Level As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.20, a key resistance level. The asset has tested this zone several times without managing a full daily candle close above it. This repeated rejection confirms $2.20 as a significant barrier, while also highlighting the building pressure beneath the surface. If XRP can secure a strong close above $2.20, the next resistance levels lie at $2.30, $2.34, and $2.48. A breakout through this range would likely trigger accelerated upward momentum, consistent with how triangle formations typically resolve after prolonged consolidation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Strength and Market Sentiment EGRAG’s projection aligns with broader technical signals currently visible on higher timeframes. Momentum indicators suggest growing bullish divergence, while XRP continues to print higher lows, a classic sign of strengthening structure. Volume has also been steadily declining, which often precedes breakout events as traders wait for confirmation before re-entering. Market psychology plays a role here as well. As many traders remain cautious, a confirmed breakout could spark renewed interest and a sharp price rally, especially given XRP’s high-profile status in the crypto market. EGRAG Crypto’s time-based analysis offers a compelling and data-driven case for an XRP breakout between July and mid-September 2025. With XRP currently holding at $2.20 and nearing the end of a year-long triangle formation, the setup is nearing completion. History suggests that when these patterns break, they do so with speed and force. All eyes now turn to the chart and the calendar, as XRP inches closer to what could be its next major move.

The rally gained traction after a sharp bounce from $133.55 to $144.10, supported by above-average trading volumes during the 17:00 and 22:00 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Per a post on X earlier today by crypto analytics firm Glassnode, CME futures volume for SOL hit an all-time high of 1.75 million contracts, reflecting an increase in institutional interest. This marked the highest volume level since the exchange introduced SOL futures in March, signaling aggressive positioning by sophisticated market participants as price approached the $145 zone. In a separate development with longer-term significance, Kazakhstan's government issued a press release on May 30 announcing the creation of the Solana Economic Zone Kazakhstan (SEZ KZ), the first such initiative in Central Asia built on Solana’s blockchain. The launch event took place in Astana with support from the Solana Foundation and government agencies. According to the Ministry of Digital Development, Innovation and Aerospace Industry, the SEZ will serve as a testbed for asset tokenization, blockchain engineering education, and foreign startup onboarding. The SEZ initiative includes three strategic pillars: Tokenized Capital Markets: A pilot program with AIX, Solana Foundation, Jupiter, and Intebix aims to introduce tokenized financial instruments into Kazakhstan’s infrastructure. Web3 Talent Development: A nationwide blockchain education initiative will be launched in partnership with universities and Astana Hub. Startup Onboarding: With support from Forma, the country plans to attract international Web3 firms through infrastructure access, regulatory clarity, and business incentives. Technical Analysis Highlights SOL gained 7.63%, climbing from $133.55 to $145.47 within a $15.94 range. The sharpest rally occurred at 22:00, when price spiked to $146.90 on 3.92M volume. A high-volume support level was established at $132.43 during the 17:00 hour. SOL entered a consolidation zone between $143 and $146 with resistance at $146.55. A V-shaped recovery followed a dip from $144.88 to $143.59. Strong support emerged at $143.60 with 38,097 SOL volume at 13:53. A short-term support band formed between $143.60 and $143.80. Immediate resistance was observed at $144.30.

Crypto Insiders Now Point to Bitcoin Solaris as the Ultimate Wealth Vehicle,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-xrp-a-good-investment-crypto-insiders-now-point-to-bitcoin-solaris-as-the-ultimate-wealth-vehicle/,"For years, XRP has stood as a staple in crypto portfolios. Its association with Ripple Labs and its institutional focus gave it a unique positioning in the market. But in 2025, the conversation is shifting. Crypto insiders, influencers, and developers are now turning their attention to Bitcoin Solaris. Why? Because what XRP once represented—low-cost, scalable finance—BTC-S is now executing with stronger technology, deeper decentralization, and actual wealth creation potential. In the race toward the next wave of generational crypto wealth, Bitcoin Solaris is no longer an alternative. It’s becoming the main path forward. XRP’s Legacy and Its Limit There’s no denying XRP played a significant role in bringing blockchain to financial institutions. Its speed and cost-efficiency were ahead of their time. But today, innovation moves faster than regulation. XRP is still navigating legal turbulence and battling for utility adoption outside centralized banking. Meanwhile, the crypto world is evolving in a direction that values openness, mobility, and grassroots scalability—precisely where Bitcoin Solaris thrives. XRP is still a good investment to some. It has stability and a loyal base. But investors seeking serious upside in today’s cycle are watching something else rise. Meet the Ultimate Wealth Vehicle: Bitcoin Solaris Bitcoin Solaris was engineered for long-term dominance. It’s not a meme, nor is it another clone with a flashy name. It is a dual-layer blockchain built for real scalability, user-first accessibility, and mobile-first wealth generation. And most importantly, it’s working. • A hybrid architecture merges Proof-of-Work with Delegated Proof-of-Stake for unmatched security and speed • The testnet already delivered 10,000 transactions per second with just two seconds of finality • Its energy usage is 99.95% lower than traditional mining chains • Smart contract compatibility ensures Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just fast, but also programmable for real-world value And through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, mining is entering the pocket of the average user. No rigs, no rent, no tech stress. Just open the app and start mining directly from your phone, or check your projected earnings using the BTC-S mining calculator . It’s wealth generation without barriers. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions Discover BTC-S Technical Advantages That Are Turning Heads Beyond marketing buzz, Bitcoin Solaris is rooted in forward-thinking development. Here’s what makes it stand apart: • Validator rotation every 4 hours keeping the network fair and tamper-proof • Dual-layer design separates heavy lifting and validation, reducing congestion • Smart contract deployment supports DeFi, gaming, enterprise, and real-world integration • Cross-chain bridge development is underway, ensuring seamless asset movement • Energy-efficient algorithms support consistent mobile mining without draining devices • A dedicated Power Marketplace is being built, allowing users to trade mining capacity through smart contracts And let’s not ignore the audit stamps that confirm all this is real. The code has passed security checks from both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and the buzz across Telegram and X is growing daily. Even top influencers like Crypto Vlog are covering its rise in detailed breakdowns, highlighting why this isn’t just another coin—it’s a new class of digital asset. This Presale Is Setting Records The Bitcoin Solaris presale is approaching its final stretch. Less than six weeks remain. With a current price of $9 and a confirmed launch price of $20, the potential 150% return is more than speculation. It’s engineered into the structure. Over 12,300+ users have already joined, pushing the presale total past 5 million dollars and counting. This isn’t just hype. It’s math. This may be the shortest presale in crypto history to gain this level of adoption, and it’s still accelerating. Join now through Bitcoin Solaris to avoid watching another opportunity slip away. And yes, one of those crucial Bitcoin Solaris links belongs right here—because that’s where the future is being minted. The 2025 Roadmap Changes Everything Bitcoin Solaris isn’t stopping at fast TPS or flashy apps. Its 2025 roadmap includes: • A full mainnet release with the Solaris Layer fully functional • Live developer access to smart contract environments • Wallet security upgrades for both mobile and desktop • Public launch of the Solaris Power Marketplace for mining rentals • Expansion of cross-chain bridges and utility partners These aren’t whitepaper dreams. Development is active, timelines are public, and the dev community is already contributing. Final Verdict XRP helped define what blockchain could do. Bitcoin Solaris is defining what it must do next. As crypto insiders pivot their attention, BTC-S is positioning itself not just as a contender, but as the ultimate wealth-building vehicle for this cycle. Mobile mining, real scalability, and a rapidly growing ecosystem make this more than just a presale opportunity. It’s the new standard.

On one end of the ring, Solana (SOL) keeps banging into stubborn resistance lines, while Hedera (HBAR) signs up new partners almost under the radar. A grin-popping newcomer called Little Pepe (LILPEPE) suddenly shows up on traders' screens, collecting headlines like a toddler collects stickers. Meme coins have a knack for exploding during the quietest weeks, and plenty of voices online say this cartoon frog is ready to hop. Settle in as we break down the latest Solana resistance chatter, map Hedera's real-world wins, and figure out why one digital amphibian might deserve a spot on your watchlist. Solana (SOL): Mood Turns Cautious On June 22, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at around $133.15, down roughly 4.10% in a single day and 14.33% over the last week. Traders are scratching their heads because the coin keeps bumping into an invisible ceiling near $160. Chart watchers point to the 50-day and 200-day moving averages; both are sloping downward, suggesting that the upward momentum may be losing steam. Adding to the jitters, the decentralized exchange Jupiter hit the brakes on all DAO votes until 2026, claiming a breakdown in trust that has some investors uneasy. A handful of speedy forecasts now say the price could dip near $138.93 by the time the New Year's ball drops. Flip ahead to 2026, and a few daring voices are already whispering $248.70. By 2030, one wild estimate even suggests a figure of $1,004. Expect the usual price fluctuations, yet the big upside story isn't over yet. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A Meme Coin Born To Run While Solana deals with headwinds, a fresh contender named Little Pepe is leaping across the screen. The coin reached Stage 3 of its presale quickly and has already raised $1.6 million, a figure that continues to surprise onlookers. Most meme projects lean on chatter and fireworks; Little Pepe quietly strapped a Layer 2 blockchain to its name. Creators, traders, and everyday fans can use the tech instead of just waving at it. Buzz spreads fast when a community feels electric. The Little Pepe gang is handing out $777,000 in prizes, splitting $77,000 in tokens between ten lucky players. Folks who want a piece better move quickly, because listings on the bigger exchanges are just around the corner. Early sales indicate a strong appetite, and demand hasn't cooled off since the giveaway began. By mixing joke culture with something that works, Little Pepe is giving investors a rare two-for-one deal. Little Pepe is getting everybody talking. The project comes with a tight-knit community, fresh blockchain tricks, and a jaw-dropping giveaway that feels more like a party than a launch. 2025 is appearing on the radar, and that means investors are starting to peek over the fence at this rising star. If the coin maintains its pace, it might not just sit beside Dogecoin and Shiba Inu —it could outpace them. Hedera (HBAR): A Serious Blockchain for Serious Businesses While the internet buzzes over the latest meme coins, Hedera (HBAR) quietly continues to stack its advantages in the enterprise arena. Currently, coins are changing hands for around USD 0.1375, down about 4.34% since yesterday, yet the charts still hint at a possible bounce. What sets Hedera apart is the Hashgraph consensus its engineers built from the ground up, promising both low energy use and big-room scalability that corporate America craves. Toss in backers like Google, Boeing, and IBM on the governing council, and you can see why boardrooms are taking meetings about HBAR. Recent headlines reveal that the project has more than just pedigree; it also boasts speed. Community plans for more profound decentralization are already being implemented, and traders have taken notice, driving the price up by almost 15% in a single day. Technical signals flash a bold green, hinting at a possible leap toward $0.30 USD, a gain that would represent nearly 50% from the current level. Enterprise interest in blockchains continues to surge, and Hedera sits squarely at the center of the demand curve. Provided the decentralization work sticks and the team looks serious about it, HBAR could ride that momentum for many quarters to come. Hedera is a name to watch moving forward for investors seeking a layer-one chain designed for business. Conclusion: Little Pepe Set to Outshine the Competition Solana (SOL) keeps hitting a ceiling, and Hedera (HBAR) is moving up at a steady-but-quiet clip, yet all the buzz today lands squarely on Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . With its Layer 2 blockchain capabilities, a large fan base, and a giveaway that has the community talking, this token appears poised to make a significant leap. Even as heavyweights like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu seem to be catching their breath, many insiders are whispering that Little Pepe might just steal the spotlight. This quirky but surprisingly valuable coin stands out for anyone itching to surf the next big meme-coin wave. The upside for early believers in 2025 could be nothing short of explosive.

After these approvals, ETF applications for altcoins such as XRP and Solana (SOL) are also expected to be approved. While the ETF movement in the USA has become an example for other countries, Japan has also opened the doors to ETFs. Japan's Financial Services Agency has published a proposal today to include cryptocurrencies under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, local news agency Coinpost reported. At this point, the proposal proposes that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin be recognized as “financial products” under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA), which regulates securities and traditional financial products. The proposal, which will be reviewed by the Financial System Council tomorrow, June 25, could pave the way for spot Bitcoin ETFs in Japan and allow crypto gains to be taxed at a flat 20% rate instead of the current graduated tax rate of up to 55%. It was stated that this change could make BTC and crypto investments more attractive to both retail and institutional investors. Finally, experts predict that if the proposal submitted in Japan is accepted and cryptocurrencies are treated as a financial product, it will pave the way for regulated crypto investment vehicles. It was stated that this could mean that spot Bitcoin ETFs, something that Japan has been holding back for years, could finally get approval. *This is not investment advice.

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Pi Network (PI) are all showing signs of life—whether through technical strength, market narratives, or shifting sentiment. For investors ready to look beyond the usual suspects, these tokens could offer the next wave of opportunity. This feature is brought to you by Outset PR —the crypto-native agency that turns strategic timing, media precision, and market trend alignment into visibility that sticks. XRP Faces Resistance But Shows Growth Potential Source: tradingview XRP is currently bouncing between $1.84 and $2.27. It's just below a resistance level at $2.52. The bulls might be facing some challenges as the coin's price has dropped a bit recently. Over the past month, XRP's value decreased by more than 6%. However, there's still potential for growth. If XRP breaks $2.52, it could target the next resistance level at $2.94, which is a significant possible rise from its current range. With the 10-day moving average slightly above the 100-day, it suggests a short-term upward trend. The RSI score shows the coin isn't overbought yet, hinting at more room to grow. Cardano (ADA) Faces Bearish Pressure, Hints at Potential Gains Source: tradingview Cardano's price hovers between $0.48 and $0.63, reflecting a bearish outlook with a drop of over 7% in just one week. The nearest support is at $0.42, a critical level to watch. While the bears seem strong, the bulls aren't entirely out of the game. If momentum shifts, ADA could aim for the $0.72 resistance, a rise of approximately 20% from its lower range. Longer-term, breaking past $0.86 represents nearly 80% growth from $0.48, though that seems challenging given the current market conditions. Though it faces bearish trends, any upward shift could offer substantial gains. Pi Network (PI) on the Edge: Will Bulls or Bears Prevail? Source: tradingview Pi Network's price moves in a tight window, from around 45 to 58 cents. The coin faces some hurdles like a resistance at 66 cents, but it also has a safety net at 39 cents. While short-term averages suggest a gentle uptrend, the decline over the past week and month shows bears may still have some upper hand. However, with a current RSI close to 58, it hints at the possibility of growth. If bulls gather strength, PI could challenge the 80-cent mark. This would mean a solid increase from its current price, offering potential gain of more than 30% if momentum shifts.

Some are based on real use, others on momentum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) hopes rest on a sudden 112,000% spike in token burns, removing 116 million SHIB from circulation, though its price stays near $0.0000119. Ethereum (ETH) shows possible strength if it holds the $2,490 to $2,550 support zone, but dropping under $2,440 might lead to sharper declines. On the other hand, Cold Wallet (CWT) already brings working tools to users. With a chat-based interface, support for many blockchains, and built-in privacy, it stands apart. At a presale price of $0.00906, CWT is setting itself up as the best performing crypto today, not just another future plan. Shiba Inu Burn Surge Raises Questions About a Possible Price Move This week, Shiba Inu’s burn rate jumped by 112,000%, wiping out about 116 million tokens. Despite that, its price held steady near $0.0000119, down 2% over the week. SHIB has stayed above an important support around $0.000012. If it climbs toward $0.000016, there could be short-term upside. The Shibarium launch and more developer activity point to added usefulness. Still, the long-term gain depends on keeping that progress. If you’re looking for burn-driven value and can handle risk, SHIB might be worth a closer look, but only after careful research. Ethereum Tries to Hold $2,500 Support as Next Move Develops Ethereum (ETH) has dropped to about $2,507, the lowest since it failed to stay above the $2,740 to $2,760 resistance. The recent dip moved ETH below some key technical levels. RSI and MACD readings suggest the coin may be oversold. The $2,490 to $2,550 range is important now. Staying above that could lead to a bounce up to $2,674 or higher. Falling under $2,440 might mean more downside. For those following ETH closely, this may be a good time to watch for signs of recovery. If the price rises back over $2,550 to $2,580, it could signal a stronger move ahead. This could be a key moment for long-term holders. Cold Wallet’s ROI Window Nears Close as Adoption Grows Cold Wallet is drawing more attention, and it’s not just talk. This wallet already brings real features. Users can send and receive crypto using a chat-style interface, manage assets on several blockchains, and view their whole portfolio in one place. It’s easy to use, secure, and built for privacy, protecting users from data leaks, tracking, and surveillance. Now in stage 14 of its presale, Cold Wallet’s token (CWT) is priced at just $0.00906, aiming for a $0.35 launch price. That’s close to 4,900% in possible ROI. The product works, users are growing, and every stage adds a price jump. This isn’t just a plan on paper. Cold Wallet already has a working prototype, letting people try out its interface and features today. While other crypto projects still share ideas, Cold Wallet is moving forward. The presale is closing fast, and prices won’t stay this low for long. If you’re seeking a high-reward chance backed by real tech, not hype, Cold Wallet remains one of the strongest options this month. Early users are gaining access and future value. Waiting could mean missing out. Cold Wallet Outpaces SHIB and ETH in Real-Time Progress Comparing Shiba Inu’s rally buzz, Ethereum (ETH) market setups, and Cold Wallet’s working tech, one stands out. SHIB’s burn-led rise is still based on guesswork, and Ethereum (ETH) market swings remain uncertain. Cold Wallet, however, offers working tools and a growing presale at $0.00906 in stage 14, still far from its $0.35 launch price. With privacy built in, multi-chain support, and more people using it, CWT is becoming the best performing crypto today when it comes to real value and progress. While others chase price charts, Cold Wallet is already working and moving forward.

The company’s Stablecoin-as-a-Service (SCaaS) solutions include custom development and advisory services as well as integration support with leading industry partners like Bridge and Frax. The global stablecoin industry is growing rapidly, surpassing $250 billion in total market capitalization during the first half of 2025. Positive US regulatory tailwinds, such as the STABLE and GENIUS Acts, are boosting confidence among institutions and traditional businesses—opening the floodgate for mainstream adoption and corporate innovation. Amazon, Walmart, and JD.com, among others, have already announced their private stablecoin plans, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently commented that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade. With faster, cheaper, borderless transactions, stablecoins help reduce payment friction, improve global market access, and unlock valuable opportunities. Cost savings and new revenue streams could even enable unique ecosystem benefits or lower the cost of credit—increasing user demand and retention while expanding brand power and reach for stablecoin issuers. Stably leverages over seven years of industry experience and infrastructure to provide end-to-end support for launching compliant, fiat-backed stablecoins. Through a combination of in-house expertise, technology, and strategic partnerships, Stably offers chain-agnostic issuance, traditional orchestration, DeFi integrations, fiat on/off-ramps, product development, business strategy, and market operation support—including peg stability, liquidity, and risk management. These services are tailored for a wide range of potential stablecoin issuers—from banks, brokerages, asset managers, MSBs, and FinTechs, to non-financial enterprises like large retailers, F&B chains, e-commerce platforms, telecoms, social media networks, and more. “We typically ask our client two questions to determine whether or not there’s a fit,” said Kory Hoang, Stably’s Co-founder and CEO. “(1) Do you have a large user base with strong network effects? (2) Do you hold user balances, facilitate credit, and/or process transaction volume at scale? If you answered yes to both questions then your business is ready to advance into the Stablecoin Age.” Stably is among the earliest stablecoin issuers and SCaaS providers since 2018, having supported the launch of over 15 stablecoin projects across multiple networks—with clients and partners including financial institutions, Web3 projects, and blockchain foundations such as Ripple, VeChain, and Stellar. Stably also helped pioneer the world’s first subsidized stablecoin in collaboration with dTRINITY, a DeFi protocol designed to transform credit markets by paying interest rebates to stablecoin borrowers. More recently, Stably started working with Lit Financial, a fast-growing mortgage lender from Michigan, to assist the company with its stablecoin product strategy. For organizations seeking turnkey SCaaS solutions, Stably works with regulated partners to enable the launch of branded stablecoins in just a few weeks. For institutions looking to build and operate their own in-house stablecoin infrastructure with long-term scalability, Stably offers a battle-tested stablecoin engine with full custom development and integration support. More broadly, Stably provides both technical and non-technical stablecoin advisory services no matter where the client is in their product lifecycle—whether it’s early-stage exploration or go-to-market execution. About Stably Founded in 2018, Stably is a leading stablecoin development and advisory firm from Seattle, Washington. It is among the earliest issuers and Stablecoin-as-a-Service solution providers in the world, operating the 7th largest stablecoin at one point in 2019. Stably has launched over 15 stablecoins since 2020, with clients and partners ranging from financial institutions to Web3 organizations. The company helps B2B clients adopt stablecoin technology and launch compliant products for their own ecosystems—unlocking new user benefits and market opportunities from branded digital money.

This year, key projects are launching new tools, gaining traction, and raising large amounts of capital. Among them, four names are emerging with strong direction and proven growth strategies. It’s not just about flashy updates anymore. It’s about who’s building, delivering results, and offering the early advantage. Here’s a closer look at the best crypto to buy right now: BlockDAG, Filecoin, NEAR Protocol, and Algorand. These four bring a mix of strong communities, clear goals, and active development. Whether you’re watching for the next big move or planning smart entries, this guide breaks down what matters. BlockDAG: $320.5M Raised in Presale & Just 16 Presale Batches Left BlockDAG continues to lead the race among the best crypto to buy right now. It’s in Batch 29 of its presale with a price of $0.0020 until June 24, after which it jumps to $0.0030. The project has already sold 23.2 billion coins and raised over $320.5 million. The 2,660% return since Batch 1 speaks volumes about its performance. BlockDAG’s edge lies in its real-world rollout and community traction. The X1 miner app is already in use, with over 2 million users mining daily. Hardware mining gear, including the X10, X30, and X100, will be shipped starting in July. Recent audits from Halborn and CertiK confirm that the project is secure and focused on transparency. BlockDAG (BDAG) plans to list on MEXC, BitMart, CoinStore, LBANK, and more. With a target launch price of $0.05, this suggests a possible 25× gain from current levels. With 18,170 miners sold and only 16 presale batches left, BlockDAG is one of the best cryptos to buy right now for those looking at real use, not just hype. Filecoin: Hot Storage Rollout Sparks Bullish Sentiment Filecoin is showing why it’s still one of the best cryptos to buy right now. As of June 22, FIL trades near $2.18. After dipping earlier this year, the price is attempting a recovery. Its introduction of PDP or hot storage boosts its appeal. Fast access and better scalability mean more use in real-time apps. Analysts are watching a potential breakout from a falling wedge. If this plays out, FIL could hit $4.85. With key resistance at $2.75 and $3.30, pressure is building. The long-term sentiment is improving as Filecoin’s use cases expand. Infrastructure projects like this tend to perform well over time, making FIL a strong part of the best crypto to buy right now. NEAR Protocol: Fast Transactions and Developer Growth NEAR Protocol trades around $1.94 and stands out with fast transactions and cross-chain compatibility. Despite a small drop, it holds support between $2.08 and $2.12. Buyers appear to be stepping in, keeping the price level. The NEAR Foundation has done well in building real-world apps and multi-chain support. That’s turning NEAR into a developer favorite. Short-term moves may be small, but 2025 targets stretch to $9, and longer-term forecasts even mention $71 by 2030. This potential comes from solid fundamentals and usability. NEAR clearly ranks among the best cryptos to buy right now for those watching ecosystem growth. Algorand: Building Quietly with Strong Institutional Ties At $0.1605, Algorand seems quiet but strong. It may not make headlines often, but it’s moving steadily. Over 2 billion ALGO are staked. Projects like tokenizing U.S. bonds and partnerships with Mastercard and Nubank give ALGO institutional relevance. Resistance lies between $0.17 and $0.19, with risk down to $0.14. Still, adoption is rising, and staking remains rewarding. With regulatory clarity improving in the U.S., Algorand’s focus on compliance and speed makes it a serious option. For anyone searching for the best crypto to buy right now that delivers steady growth, ALGO fits well. Summing It Up From high-growth presales to infrastructure-backed coins, these four: BlockDAG, Filecoin, NEAR, and Algorand, are worth watching. BlockDAG stands out for its active community, early delivery, and strong exchange plans. FIL and NEAR bring solid developer demand, while ALGO continues to grow quietly with real partnerships. If you’re narrowing down your watchlist of the best crypto to buy right now , these picks have clear signals. Don’t forget, the $0.0020 price for BlockDAG ends June 24. With a $0.05 listing ahead, that window could close fast.

On Sunday, Tesla opened its self-driving taxi service in Austin to a limited number of riders, charging a flat fee of $4.20 per trip. Although employees accompanied each ride for safety, the service, years in the making and heavily promoted by Musk, boosted Tesla’s shares. Tesla’s stock climbed as much as 11% in Monday trading before closing up 8% at $348.68, cutting its losses for the year to just under 7%. That single-day surge added $19 billion to Musk’s fortune according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index , raising his net worth to about $385 billion and helping offset a $47.5 billion decline since the start of 2025. Source: Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index By Tuesday morning, Musk’s wealth outstripped Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg by $139 billion and surpassed Amazon founder Jeff Bezos by $155 billion. In a post on X on Sunday, Musk praised Tesla’s internal AI and chip design teams, calling the launch the “culmination of a decade of hard work.” Still, analysts urged caution. In a Monday note, UBS raised its price target on Tesla shares by $25 to $215 but kept a “Sell” rating, warning that much of the robotaxi optimism may already be priced in. Other experts warn Tesla faces major hurdles in safety, infrastructure, sensor performance, and real-world operations. Tesla faces scrutiny on robotaxi safety The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Tesla for more information after viewing online videos that appeared to show a robotaxi in the wrong lane and another one speeding. The safety agency said it is “aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information”, as mentioned in a Reuters report . NHTSA routinely seeks data from automakers when advanced driver assistance or automated driving systems display questionable behavior. Tesla said it would avoid bad weather and tricky intersections and would not carry any riders under 18 for robotaxi rides. NHTSA noted that it does not pre-approve new technologies or vehicle systems. Instead, manufacturers certify that each vehicle meets safety standards, and the agency investigates possible defects. Tesla has told NHTSA that its safety reports on the Texas robotaxi rollout, including how it performs in bad weather, are confidential and shouldn’t be made public. NHTSA is now reviewing those responses. Since October, the agency has been investigating crashes involving Tesla’s Full Self-Driving cars in low-visibility conditions. That probe covers about 2.4 million vehicles, prompted by four non-fatal crashes and one fatal crash in 2023. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The company’s Stablecoin-as-a-Service (SCaaS) solutions include custom development and advisory services as well as integration support with leading industry partners like Bridge and Frax. The global stablecoin industry is growing rapidly, surpassing $250 billion in total market capitalization during the first half of 2025. Positive US regulatory tailwinds, such as the STABLE and GENIUS Acts, are boosting confidence among institutions and traditional businesses—opening the floodgate for mainstream adoption and corporate innovation. Amazon, Walmart, and JD.com, among others, have already announced their private stablecoin plans, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently commented that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade. With faster, cheaper, borderless transactions, stablecoins help reduce payment friction, improve global market access, and unlock valuable opportunities. Cost savings and new revenue streams could even enable unique ecosystem benefits or lower the cost of credit—increasing user demand and retention while expanding brand power and reach for stablecoin issuers. Stably leverages over seven years of industry experience and infrastructure to provide end-to-end support for launching compliant, fiat-backed stablecoins. Through a combination of in-house expertise, technology, and strategic partnerships, Stably offers chain-agnostic issuance, traditional orchestration, DeFi integrations, fiat on/off-ramps, product development, business strategy, and market operation support—including peg stability, liquidity, and risk management. These services are tailored for a wide range of potential stablecoin issuers—from banks, brokerages, asset managers, MSBs, and FinTechs, to non-financial enterprises like large retailers, F&B chains, e-commerce platforms, telecoms, social media networks, and more. ""We typically ask our client two questions to determine whether or not there’s a fit,"" said Kory Hoang, Stably’s Co-founder and CEO. ""(1) Do you have a large user base with strong network effects? (2) Do you hold user balances, facilitate credit, and/or process transaction volume at scale? If you answered yes to both questions then your business is ready to advance into the Stablecoin Age."" Stably is among the earliest stablecoin issuers and SCaaS providers since 2018, having supported the launch of over 15 stablecoin projects across multiple networks—with clients and partners including financial institutions, Web3 projects, and blockchain foundations such as Ripple, VeChain, and Stellar. Stably also helped pioneer the world’s first subsidized stablecoin in collaboration with dTRINITY, a DeFi protocol designed to transform credit markets by paying interest rebates to stablecoin borrowers. More recently, Stably started working with Lit Financial, a fast-growing mortgage lender from Michigan, to assist the company with its stablecoin product strategy. For organizations seeking turnkey SCaaS solutions, Stably works with regulated partners to enable the launch of branded stablecoins in just a few weeks. For institutions looking to build and operate their own in-house stablecoin infrastructure with long-term scalability, Stably offers a battle-tested stablecoin engine with full custom development and integration support. More broadly, Stably provides both technical and non-technical stablecoin advisory services no matter where the client is in their product lifecycle—whether it’s early-stage exploration or go-to-market execution. About Stably Founded in 2018, Stably is a leading stablecoin development and advisory firm from Seattle, Washington. It is among the earliest issuers and Stablecoin-as-a-Service solution providers in the world, operating the 7th largest stablecoin at one point in 2019. Stably has launched over 15 stablecoins since 2020, with clients and partners ranging from financial institutions to Web3 organizations. The company helps B2B clients adopt stablecoin technology and launch compliant products for their own ecosystems—unlocking new user benefits and market opportunities from branded digital money.

While hype-driven pumps often dominate headlines, it’s the coins with strong fundamentals, resilient ecosystems, and technical setups that tend to lead the next major rally. In this article, we spotlight three such digital assets—each showing early indicators of a breakout and backed by real technological or adoption potential. Sui (SUI): Quiet Before the Surge? Layer-1 Potential Still Intact Source: tradingview Sui is currently trading between $2.00 and just under $3.00, reflecting consolidation after recent corrections. While the weekly and monthly trends show declines of over 6% and 23% respectively, the short-term moving average now sits above the long-term—a potential early signal of bullish reversal. The key resistance lies at $3.50, and a breakout could unlock a 24%+ move from current levels. With its high-performance Layer-1 architecture and growing ecosystem of dApps and NFTs, SUI still has the structural strength to stage a significant comeback. Once market sentiment flips, this may be one of the fastest movers in the next leg up. Avalanche (AVAX): Rebound Setup Forming Beneath the Surface Source: tradingview Avalanche is consolidating in the $15–$19 range after months of downward pressure, losing 21% over the past month and over 54% across six months. Despite this, the RSI is tilting positive and the MACD remains in the green, hinting at a potential turnaround. If AVAX clears resistance at $22, the next logical target sits near $26—a 35% upside from current levels. As a leading Layer-1 with rapid finality and an expanding multichain network, AVAX has the infrastructure to bounce back hard when buyers return. This dip might just be a reset before a major breakout. Stellar (XLM): Eyeing Higher Ground as Technicals Tighten Source: tradingview Stellar is trading between $0.21 and $0.26, with resistance looming near $0.29—but bullish signals are starting to emerge. The RSI nearing 70 and a Stochastic reading above 75 suggest strong interest, possibly overheated short-term but pointing to buyer momentum. A move toward $0.35 would represent a gain of around 35% from the lower end of the current range. Backed by institutional partnerships and a clear mission in cross-border payments, Stellar has long-term fundamentals that remain sound. If the crypto market strengthens, XLM could easily outperform in the next bullish wave. Conclusion In a market driven by both sentiment and substance, these three cryptocurrencies—Sui, Avalanche, and Stellar—offer a compelling mix of solid fundamentals and emerging bullish setups. Whether you're tracking Layer-1 innovations or seeking undervalued plays with institutional ties, each coin presents a strong case for renewed upward movement. As the market gears up for its next phase, these assets could be among the top performers in the coming rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As major players quietly accumulate, savvy investors are scanning the horizon for undervalued assets with breakout potential. In this article, we spotlight three crypto projects that mirror the “smart money” logic: fundamentally solid, technically oversold, and primed for explosive upside once momentum shifts. Worldcoin (WLD): Oversold and Ready for a Reversal? Source: tradingview Worldcoin is currently trading between $0.73 and $0.98, reflecting sustained downward pressure—but also creating a potential entry zone for bold investors. While the coin is down over 34% this past month and nearly 60% across six months, the RSI is starting to hint at early buyer interest. A breakout above the $1.13 resistance could trigger a rally toward $1.38, offering a gain of nearly 40% from current levels. As Worldcoin continues pushing its identity-based crypto vision and gains media visibility, a momentum shift could quickly flip the narrative. Oversold assets often make the loudest comebacks—and WLD might just be setting the stage. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET): AI Sector Favorite Eyes Next Leg Up Source: tradingview FET is currently trading between $0.51 and $0.70, showing consolidation after a prolonged pullback. Although down over 20% this month and nearly 50% over six months, the RSI at 58 suggests mild bullish momentum building. A push past $0.82 resistance could unlock a move toward $1.01, offering potential upside of up to 60%. As AI continues to dominate both tech and crypto narratives, FET stands out as a leader in decentralized superintelligence. For investors tracking ""smart money"" sectors, AI tokens like FET remain at the top of the watchlist. Ethena (ENA): Deep Discount with High-Reward Potential Source: tradingview Ethena is hovering in a tight band between $0.20 and $0.30 after dropping more than 70% over six months—but this might present a strong accumulation zone. The RSI remains low, hinting at oversold conditions and growing buyer interest. A breakout past $0.35 could spark a rally to $0.45, representing a 50% upside from current prices. As a synthetic dollar project with strong fundamentals and a growing DeFi presence, ENA could be poised for a sharp recovery when market sentiment turns. For those who follow big-picture fundamentals, this may be a low-risk, high-reward setup. Conclusion While Metaplanet sets the tone with bold Bitcoin accumulation, the real alpha may lie in assets still flying under the radar. Worldcoin, FET, and Ethena each offer compelling setups—steep discounts, improving indicators, and alignment with major crypto narratives like AI, identity, and DeFi. As the market shifts from fear to opportunity, these tokens could be next in line for aggressive moves. Smart money isn’t just watching Bitcoin—it’s hunting for the next breakout story.

A wave of projects is reaching real milestones, shipping products, and attracting serious attention from developers and capital alike. The focus is shifting away from hype and back onto fundamentals. In this cycle, only a few standouts are separating themselves through execution. Infrastructure strength, user activity, and smart token design are now driving the conversation. The race for the top cryptos of 2025 is becoming a matter of who delivers, not just who promises. This article highlights four projects leading the charge: BlockDAG (BDAG) , Filecoin, NEAR Protocol, and Algorand. Each brings something distinct, but all are backed by real momentum, growing ecosystems, and price targets worth watching. If strategy matters to you, this list is your signal to get in ahead of the crowd. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Powers Ahead with $320.5M Raised and Miner Rollout Locked In BlockDAG is making its mark as one of the top cryptos of 2025 with a clear plan, rapid rollout, and strong user traction. Currently in Batch 29 of its presale, BDAG is priced at $0.0020 until June 24 before increasing to $0.0030. Over 23.2 billion coins have already been sold, raising $320.5 million. Early buyers are already seeing returns of more than 2,660% compared to initial pricing, highlighting the strength of its launch strategy. What gives BlockDAG an edge is real infrastructure already in play. The X1 mobile mining app has onboarded over 2 million users globally, and hardware miners like the X30, X100, and X10 are set to ship between July and August. The project is also backed by successful audits from Halborn and CertiK, reinforcing trust in its security and delivery timeline. Listings on major exchanges, including MEXC, LBANK, BitMart, and CoinStore, are locked in after the presale ends. With a target listing price of $0.05 and just 16 batches remaining, BlockDAG is not just promising upside; it is building it in real time. This presale is one of the most actively watched in the market today. 2. Filecoin (FIL): Expands Into Hot Storage as Price Eyes Breakout Filecoin is evolving fast and showing that its decentralised storage model is more than just a niche utility. With FIL trading around $2.18 as of June 22, its recent correction appears to be stabilising, and attention is shifting to its tech stack. Filecoin is now rolling out PDP, or “hot storage,” offering real-time access and scalability. This opens doors for developers building dApps that need fast, secure data handling. On the charts, analysts are tracking a falling wedge pattern that could push FIL up to $4.85 if confirmed. Key levels at $2.75 and $3.30 are now in play. With on-chain growth and storage demand rising, long-term sentiment is building quickly. As use cases expand and infrastructure improves, Filecoin easily earns its place among the top cryptos of 2025 for those seeking both utility and upside. 3. NEAR Protocol: Gains Developer Trust as 2025 Forecasts Climb NEAR Protocol is currently priced near $1.94 and continues to gain recognition for its fast, scalable smart contract capabilities. Support has held between $2.08 and $2.12, signalling resilience even during recent pullbacks. What fuels NEAR’s momentum is its ease of deployment and growing app ecosystem, thanks to well-executed cross-chain integrations from the NEAR Foundation. While short-term price targets remain conservative, long-term projections are catching fire. Analysts see potential highs of $9 by 2025 and even $71 by 2030 under favourable market conditions. That kind of growth outlook, backed by real usability and developer confidence, places NEAR among the top cryptos of 2025 for anyone focused on scalable platforms with staying power. 4. Algorand (ALGO): Quietly Builds Strength Behind Institutional Moves Algorand is trading around $0.1605, showing signs of steady consolidation while the network quietly builds strength behind the scenes. Over 2 billion ALGO are currently staked, and the project is making serious moves with tokenised U.S. bonds and partnerships with names like Mastercard and Nubank. These developments hint at deeper institutional relevance coming soon. Technically, ALGO is testing resistance near $0.17 to $0.19, though a break could push it briefly toward $0.14. Still, strong staking rewards, regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act, and fast transaction speeds give it a solid long-term setup. Algorand might not move fast, but for those eyeing infrastructure projects with serious potential, it is firmly in the conversation as one of the top cryptos of 2025. The Final Take Whether you are focused on early-stage gains or real-world use cases, BlockDAG, Filecoin, NEAR, and Algorand all offer strong setups. BlockDAG leads with a structured rollout, an active mobile mining base, and security audits already complete. FIL and NEAR are expanding infrastructure that developers want, while Algorand continues to stack long-term value through partnerships and smart positioning. As the search for the top cryptos of 2025 narrows, these four stand out for substance over hype. BlockDAG’s $0.0020 price expires after June 24, and with a $0.05 target, the 25x window is closing fast. The next cycle may belong to the ones already building.

The model showed that strong support has been established around the $2.24-$2.25 zone, confirmed by multiple tests with price bouncing higher each time. In recent trading, FIL was 13.6% higher over 24 hours at around $2.35. The broader market gauge, the CoinDesk 20, was up 8.7% at publication time. Technical Analysis: Price action formed a clear uptrend with higher lows and higher highs, particularly notable during the 22:00 hour on June 23rd when price broke above $2.27 on significantly above-average volume (7.58M) Strong support has established around $2.24-$2.25, confirmed by multiple tests with price bouncing higher each time. The 4-hour consolidation between $2.27-$2.30 suggests accumulation before the next potential move higher, with the $2.31 level now serving as immediate resistance. In the last 60 minutes, FIL-USD exhibited notable volatility with a clear pattern of consolidation followed by a significant price movement. The token traded within a tight range between $2.29-$2.30 for most of the period before experiencing a sharp decline to $2.28 around 15:41, establishing a new support level at $2.285.

Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins see big gains",https://crypto.news/why-is-crypto-up-today-bitcoin-ethereum-altcoins-see-big-gains/,"The overall crypto market cap rose 2.3% as traders hoped for de-escalation in the Middle East. Crypto markets saw notable gains on Tuesday, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the rally. On Tuesday, June 24, Bitcoin climbed 5.3%, rising back above $105,000. Altcoins performed even better, posting double-digit gains, with the total crypto market cap up 5.19%. Ethereum (ETH) was among the strongest performers, up 11.33%. Altcoins also saw big gains, with XRP (XRP) up 10.15%, Solana (SOL) rising 9.61%, and Cardano (ADA) up 9.4%. Memecoins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu also saw strong growth, nearing double digits. The most likely catalyst for this rally was growing optimism that tensions in the Middle East are easing. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel be stricly respected on both sides. You might also like: Stablecoins and oil are Trump’s macro weapons, says DeVere CEO The ceasefire came after U.S. bombers targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities, prompting a symbolic response from Iran via strikes on U.S. bases in Qatar. Iran reportedly gave ample warning, allowing U.S. personnel to evacuate and avoid escalation. This development brought relief to traders, as a prolonged war, especially one involving the U.S., threatened to destabilize the global economy. In particular, heightened tensions had driven up oil prices, stoking fears of rising global inflation. In particular, at one point, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of global oil production flows every day. In this environment, central banks are forced to raise interest rates, which hurts risk assets like crypto. You might also like: Oil, inflation, and Bitcoin are now locked in the same trade Where will Bitcoin and Ethereum go next? The ceasefire between Iran and Israel is fragile, as seen by Israeli strikes on Iran soon after Trump announced the deal. Still, an irate response from Trump seems to have caused Israel to back down. In any case, the risk of further escalation is lower now than it was two weeks ago. Traders, both retail and institutional, will now likely take a more risk-on approach. Future catalysts for growth include the GENIUS Act , which will bring the first regulatory framework for stablecoins to the U.S. Institutions will also likely continue to buy up Bitcoin for their treasuries.

In 2025, both MAGACOIN FINANCE and Aptos have emerged as top picks among those holding XRP , Ethereum , and Bitcoin , thanks to their strong fundamentals and early-stage growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Standing Out in a Crowded Market MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly establishing itself as a frontrunner in the altcoin space this year. With a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens , its scarcity-focused approach helps protect value and reduce inflation risk.

However, as its growth rate matures, many ETH investors are looking for new projects that echo Ethereum’s own early momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE , with its strong community backing and integration potential, is emerging as a natural choice for those seeking the next big opportunity. Bitcoin: Seeking Growth Beyond Stability While Bitcoin continues to serve as the market’s benchmark and a reliable store of value, its sheer size now limits the explosive growth seen in earlier cycles.

Speaking before the House Financial Services Committee during his required semiannual testimony, Powell said the US economy remains “solid” but emphasized the need for more data before making any policy changes. In his prepared remarks, Powell had pointed to the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs as a lingering inflation risk. He warned that while the economy continues to show strength, inflation readings could push higher. The Fed’s preferred measure of inflation is expected to climb to 2.3% in May, up from 2.1% in April. The core index, which removes food and energy prices, is projected to hit 2.6%, a slight uptick from 2.5% the month before. Fed officials push cuts while Powell resists Despite Powell’s stance, two key members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are now openly supporting rate reductions. Michelle Bowman, speaking in Prague this week, said she would support a cut at the Fed’s upcoming July meeting if inflation data “doesn’t spike.” Her position follows similar comments made by Christopher Waller, who said he favors a careful approach to easing policy. Both were appointed by Trump during his first term and are currently seen as possible successors to Powell. The divide became clearer after the release of the Fed’s latest “dot plot,” which anonymously records each member’s policy forecast. The internal outlook showed that nine of the nineteen officials want either no cut or one cut in 2025. Eight support two cuts, while two see the need for three. Although the vote to hold rates steady last week was unanimous, the longer-term views show a central bank that’s far from aligned. Powell made clear that he sees no urgency. He said the Fed is watching how tariffs are affecting prices and wants to avoid reacting to what might just be a temporary bump. “The FOMC’s obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored,” he told lawmakers. He stressed that the Fed cannot let short-term shocks lead to lasting policy shifts. “Without price stability,” he added, “we cannot achieve the long periods of strong labor market conditions that benefit all Americans.” Markets pull back expectations as Trump slams Powell again The futures market has started to cool off on the idea of a July cut. Traders are now pricing in only a 23% chance that the Fed will ease policy at the July 29-30 meeting. There’s more confidence around September, but even that remains uncertain unless new inflation data supports the case. May’s consumer price index rose by just 0.1%, suggesting inflation is still tame for now. But the Fed is staying cautious, especially as Powell continues to prioritize a longer view over political or market pressure. The political pressure hasn’t slowed down. Early Tuesday, Trump used his Truth Social platform to lash out again. Referring directly to Powell, he wrote: “Congress needs to work this very dumb, hardheaded person over.” It’s not the first time Trump has attacked the Fed Chair, but this latest insult comes as the White House continues to blame the central bank for not supporting growth through cuts. Bowman and Waller’s break from Powell has created friction inside the Fed, but it’s also reshaping market expectations fast. Investors and analysts are now watching every speech and every data release closely. The sudden support for cuts by people in Powell’s own circle has raised fresh doubts about how much control he really has over the committee’s direction, and whether Trump might act on growing speculation to replace him next year. At this point, the Fed is split. The chair says hold. Some governors say cut. The market is hedging. And Trump, once again, is shouting from the digital rooftop.

The move seems to have largely erased recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment. Markets Gain As Tensions Ease Relief from the Middle East conflict in the form of a surprise ceasefire spurred a crypto and risk-asset rally. President Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. “Officially, Iran will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 12th Hour, Israel will start the CEASEFIRE and, upon the 24th Hour, an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” Trump wrote. Crypto markets have turned nicely higher, with Bitcoin (BTC) now up by 5.1% over the past 24 hours to $106,017 after the brutal Sunday-Monday crash. The premier crypto had plummeted below the psychologically important $100,000 level on Sunday before staging its recovery. Bitcoin has historically trended positively during times of global unrest. During major events like the US–Iran conflict in 2020, Russia’s attack on Ukraine in 2022, and now the Iran–Israel war of 2025, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable price stability. While it does not act like a traditional safe haven, it usually behaves like an uncorrelated hedge in systemic uncertainty. Ether (ETH), the industry’s second-largest crypto by market cap, is ahead 10.6% to trade back above $2,455. Ripple-promoted cryptocurrency XRP surged 11.2% in the past 24 hours. The crypto’s double-digit spike comes after Arthur Britto, co-founder of Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL), posted on X for the first time in nearly 14 years. According to market data, Solana’s SOL, Cardano’s ADA, and Dogecoin (DOGE) also rose between 9.6%-10% following the news of a possible ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-24 17:11:31

Over the weekend, as tensions flared between Iran and Israel, Ripple’s native token dipped below the $2 mark. Trading volume surged over 40% in just 24 hours as worried investors rushed to adjust their positions. What’s Been Happening With XRP? XRP had a strong start to the year, climbing near its previous highs back in January. Legal wins against the U.S. SEC and Ripple’s growing partnerships had fueled hopes for a breakout above previous highs. However, the recent selloff triggered by geopolitical tensions knocked the token off its path. XRP briefly fell to $1.91 before bouncing back, but it’s now facing a tough resistance level around $2.28. What’s Next For XRP Price? However, now that XRP and majority of the altcoins have bounced back, altcoin season speculations are back. Popular analyst Dark Defender said that XRP is gearing up for a big move, with the price approaching an important point on the weekly charts. According to his analysis, XRP is about to break out of a descending triangle pattern, a formation that often signals a big price shift.

Such a pattern points to a deepening long-term conviction among investors. Data reveals a dramatic reversal in behavior that began after the 2021 cycle peak. Between 2015 and 2021, the number of unique addresses depositing BTC to exchanges steadily increased, averaging 180,000 annually. However, since 2022, that trend has not only stalled, but it has declined consistently. BTC Exchange Deposit Trend Reverses According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , the 10-year average now stands at approximately 90,000, while the current 30-day moving average is just 48,000. On a daily basis, the number of depositing addresses has dropped to around 37,000, recording a multi-year low. Analysts say that this indicates a growing preference for holding Bitcoin rather than trading it. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs has played a key role, which gave institutional and retail investors access to BTC’s price performance without needing to move or manage the asset directly. Additionally, lower retail trading activity in the current cycle has reduced active deposit behavior. At the same time, an increasing number of investors, and even corporations , are adopting a savings-oriented approach, treating Bitcoin as a long-term reserve rather than a speculative instrument. The report said, “These shifts, which have emerged gradually over time, are precisely what drive Bitcoin’s evolving identity in financial markets. It may well be this transformation that ultimately solidifies BTC’s role as a store of value.” This sentiment in investor behavior is echoed on a macro scale. Bitcoin As Modern Reserve Asset Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a strategic asset for nations seeking to strengthen economic resilience in the current global landscape, according to a recent report by CoinShares. The cryptocurrency’s potential to hedge inflation, diversify sovereign portfolios, and offer protection against geopolitical instability positions it as a modern complement to gold and foreign exchange reserves. While the US decision in 2025 to add Bitcoin to its reserves is a crucial moment, CoinShares noted that the ongoing skepticism among economists who highlight its volatility and speculative nature. Despite this, with rising global debt, inflation, and mounting geopolitical tensions, more governments are exploring alternatives. Brazil’s RESBit proposal and Russia’s reported interest in Bitcoin reserves suggest a competitive push to secure a share of the asset’s fixed supply. With a $2 trillion market cap and growing institutional presence, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a credible reserve option alongside traditional holdings.

Stellar, meanwhile, faces headwinds after falling below key support levels at $0.2537, despite maintaining a TVL above $97 million. These developments have sparked new interest in assets that can ride the next major cycle. But while both Ethereum and Stellar remain critical to the overall ecosystem, an under-the-radar presale may be stealing the real spotlight. Qubetics , a Layer 1 Web3 aggregator with an integrated asset tokenization marketplace, is preparing for its listing on a top 10 global exchange, with a 20% price surge projected at launch. Already, more than $18.1 million has been raised, positioning it as a front-runner in the next bull run crypto conversation. With real-world applications and a capped supply model, Qubetics is being studied not just by early adopters but by institutions ready to reposition capital toward tangible blockchain solutions. Qubetics and Real-World Asset Tokenization: Laying the Groundwork for the Next Bull Run Crypto Tokenization of real-world assets has long been promised but rarely delivered. Qubetics changes that by offering a tokenized asset marketplace directly embedded within its Web3 aggregator protocol. This isn’t another abstraction layer; it’s a working infrastructure that allows businesses and institutions to tokenize real estate, commodities, carbon credits, invoices, and more on-chain, with multichain liquidity routing and compliance tools included. That kind of product design positions Qubetics as a serious contender among the next bull run crypto assets. Consider a logistics company in Texas issuing warehouse receipts as digital tokens or a green energy project in Germany tokenizing verified emission reductions for sale to cross-border buyers. In both cases, the assets are not speculative; they’re real, and Qubetics enables instant settlement and secondary market visibility without relying on Ethereum congestion or Stellar’s throughput limits. Retail users also benefit. A creator or contractor can tokenize work-based deliverables or fractional ownership stakes, opening new revenue paths and liquidity options without legal complexity. This all-in-one asset platform is why analysts have begun categorizing Qubetics not just as another presale but as a foundational tool for the next phase of digital finance, one that merges compliance, speed, and value creation in a single ecosystem. It’s utility-first, and that’s rare in presale narratives today. Why the Qubetics Presale Offers Short-Term Gains With Long-Term Depth The Qubetics presale is now in Stage 37, pricing each $TICS token at $0.3370. So far, more than 28,200 participants have secured allocations, bringing the total raised to $18.1 million. With only 10 million tokens left at the current price point and no plan for minting beyond the capped 1.36 billion supply, demand is beginning to outstrip availability. And once this stage closes, only secondary market access remains, at market-determined pricing. A participant contributing $9,000 today would receive approximately 26,706 $TICS tokens. At a $1 price post-listing, the position would be worth $26,706, a 197% gain. If $TICS hits $5, that same amount could yield $133,530. A move to $10 or $15 would drive the value to $267,060 or $400,590, respectively. Given the upcoming top-tier exchange listing and projected 20% price bump, the window for these gains is narrowing fast. This Qubetics presale is being called the best crypto presale currently active, not only because of its ROI math but because of its real-world deployment potential. Once the presale ends, pricing dynamics change completely, and those late to the table will need to compete for liquidity on open markets. Qubetics Exchange Listing Could Trigger the First Big Breakout Qubetics is set to list on one of the top 10 global cryptocurrency exchanges, an event that analysts say could catalyze a 20% price jump immediately upon debut. Historically, listings of this scale tend to attract large retail inflows and programmatic interest from institutional desks. Qubetics, with over 516 million tokens sold, is already primed for heavy volume, and exchange infrastructure is being optimized to ensure high-speed execution and minimal slippage at launch. This event, combined with the scheduled mainnet launch in Q2 2025, has created anticipation not just in trading circles but in application-layer developers looking to build directly on Qubetics’ tokenized framework. For early participants, the listing represents a timed entry point with compressed risk and expansive upside, a formula not often seen in current market conditions. Stellar Slides Below Support as On-Chain Metrics Signal Short-Term Weakness Stellar (XLM) fell below its $0.2537 support level, prompting caution in short-term outlooks. Analysts observed that XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped to 37, suggesting weakened momentum and potentially deeper retracements ahead. The Awesome Oscillator also remained negative, underscoring the lack of short-term bullish pressure. Despite this decline, Stellar’s total value locked (TVL) remained above $97.7 million, offering some optimism from a fundamentals perspective. However, the lack of an immediate technical recovery leaves Stellar exposed to further dips unless broader market sentiment turns quickly. The projected downside target was identified at $0.2378, marking a critical level to watch. While Stellar has institutional credibility and a long-standing reputation in cross-border payment rails, its current price action does not reflect short-term breakout readiness. With Qubetics stepping into similar territory but offering more modular and interoperable tools, some participants are beginning to reallocate toward newer, more nimble frameworks positioned for the next bull run crypto cycle. Ethereum Gains 9% Following Ceasefire, Shows Resilience Across Majors Ethereum saw a 9% price increase, rising to $2,420, following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, according to Decrypt’s June 24 coverage. The broader crypto market reacted sharply to the geopolitical development, with Ether leading major altcoins in percentage gains. Analysts attribute this movement to renewed risk appetite and capital rotation from sidelined liquidity back into blue-chip digital assets. Ethereum’s rebound also saw correlated activity in the ETH derivatives market, as open interest climbed and funding rates normalized. This shift hints at a more sustained move rather than a short-term volatility spike. Still, the price remains below recent cycle highs, and the market is watching to see whether Ethereum can hold support and continue its upward trajectory in tandem with Bitcoin’s push beyond $106,000. That said, Ethereum’s gas fees and scaling limitations remain critical concerns. While Ethereum continues to perform under favorable macro conditions, its technical bottlenecks open the door for emerging platforms like Qubetics to claim share in high-frequency transaction sectors and tokenized economies, two areas central to the next bull run crypto narrative. Final Verdict: Which Projects Are Primed for the Next Bull Run Crypto Cycle? Ethereum is riding geopolitical momentum, Stellar is facing a correction amid weak technicals, and Qubetics is preparing for a high-profile listing with a 20% surge expected. All three play important roles in the current market, but Qubetics presents the strongest near-term upside, especially for participants entering during its final presale stage. With a capped supply model, real-world tokenization tools, and a full-stack aggregator that merges multiple blockchain layers, Qubetics is building the rails for what comes next. For early adopters seeking the next bull run crypto, Qubetics is quickly becoming the most strategic play among all active opportunities. Those looking for the best crypto presale should be watching this closely, because once those final 10 million tokens sell, the opportunity window closes fast.

Qubetics is emerging as the top next bull run crypto due to its real-world application, upcoming exchange listing, and high-growth tokenomics. How much has Qubetics raised in its presale? Qubetics has raised over $18.1 million, selling more than 516 million $TICS tokens with only 10 million left at the current price. Why is Ethereum spiking right now? Ethereum gained 9% following the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, reflecting improved risk sentiment and a rebound in major altcoins. Summary Ethereum gained 9% following the Iran-Israel ceasefire, while Stellar slipped below key support at $0.2537 despite maintaining a $97.7M TVL. Meanwhile, Qubetics has surged into the spotlight as the next bull run crypto, nearing a listing on a top 10 exchange with a projected 20% price jump. With over $18.1 million raised and 516 million tokens sold, Qubetics’ real-world asset tokenization marketplace and capped supply are drawing significant interest. Early participants in the Qubetics presale can still secure tokens before the final 10 million sell out, making it one of the most promising opportunities in today’s altcoin market.

This news has caused the company’s value, once a small UK-based web design business, to jump from £3.7 million to over £1 billion. This dramatic rise followed its decision to buy large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a new business strategy. Smarter Web Makes A Big Move into Bitcoin Treasury On Tuesday, Smarter Web announced it bought 196.9 more BTC for £15.2 million, equivalent to $20.3 million. The company now owns 543.52 Bitcoins. They paid an average price of £77,988 for each coin, about $104,450. So far, Smarter Web has invested £42.4 million, or $56.8 million, in Bitcoin. At the same time, the company continues to provide web design, development, and online marketing services. It also earns money through setup fees, yearly hosting charges, and optional monthly plans. However, since April, the company, like many others, has also focused on building a Bitcoin treasury . In 2023, Smarter Web started accepting Bitcoin payments, believing it would be necessary for the future financial system. Confidence Fueled By Long-Term Gains with BTC The Smarter Web Company shared a 10-year growth plan to expand its customer base through web services and buy more Bitcoin when the time is right. The goal is to increase the company’s value and deliver long-term returns to shareholders. Since starting this plan, the company has become the UK’s largest Bitcoin holder. After a reverse takeover, it began trading on the Aquis Stock Exchange on April 25 with a value of about £3.7 million ($5 million). After announcing its Bitcoin strategy, its stock price soared nearly 20,000%, pushing its company value above £1 billion, equivalent to $1.4 billion. Even after a recent drop, Smarter Web remains the top company listed on Aquis. Smarter Web Backed By Bitcoin Heavyweights The Smarter Web Company is not making these moves alone. It is working with UTXO Management, a Bitcoin-focused investment firm led by David Bailey. David Bailey also runs Bitcoin Magazine and founded Nakamoto, a company that recently secured $51.5 million through a private deal. Bailey and UTXO’s Chief Investment Officer, Tyler Evans, are on the company’s board. UTXO also invested in Smarter Web before it went public and is involved in other Bitcoin firms like Metaplanet and The Blockchain Group. While Smarter Web believes in Bitcoin’s long-term value, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is unconvinced. The agency has warned that this kind of investment is high risk due to Bitcoin’s price swings. Coinbase’s David Duong also warned that companies using borrowed money to buy crypto could pose financial risks. However, he noted that the danger is still relatively limited.

Just one day after announcing a $1 billion SPAC deal, ProCap scooped up 3,724 Bitcoin, locking in exposure for investors before markets could blink. According to a June 24 press release , Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap BTC, LLC purchased 3,724 Bitcoins (BTC) at a time-weighted average price of $103,785 per BTC on Tuesday, less than 24 hours after announcing its $1 billion SPAC merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp. The aggressive initial purchase, worth roughly $387 million, was funded directly from a $750 million capital raise disclosed as part of the SPAC deal. The newly created company plans to hold the full amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet and is expected to continue accumulating after it transitions into ProCap Financial, Inc., a publicly traded entity focused on institutional-grade Bitcoin services. You might also like: Chainlink and Mastercard partner to enable onchain crypto purchases Anthony Pompliano’s billion-dollar bet on the new institutional standard For Pompliano and his team, the decision to buy and hold $387 million worth of Bitcoin as part of a long-term accumulation strategy is less about optics and more about conviction. In public remarks and SEC filings, ProCap has made it clear that it views BTC not just as an asset, but as a benchmark. “Bitcoin is the new hurdle rate,” the company stated—underscoring its belief that the cryptocurrency is no longer speculative, but rather the minimum acceptable performance standard for capital deployment. By frontloading its BTC treasury with millions worth of the original cryptocurrency instead of holding idle dollars post-raise, ProCap is signaling a departure from traditional finance’s risk-averse playbook and leaning into Bitcoin as a base-layer financial asset. This isn’t just theory. Since 2020, public companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets have outperformed their cash-heavy peers by staggering margins. Strategy, the most aggressive corporate adopter, saw its stock surge more than 3,000% at one point, not because of its core software business, but because of its Bitcoin treasury. Now, ProCap is doubling down on the same playbook, but with a twist: It’s not just hoarding BTC: it’s building financial infrastructure around it.

He believes that reducing or eliminating the EU’s regulations could re-establish its growth in the global economy. “If you want an applied example of regulating, killing increasing yields, and exterminating economic growth; look no further, just look around for Europe is the best example where regulations are killing economic growth.” – Javier Milei , President of Argentina. He also hopes EU officials will roll back regulations that have prevented balanced growth in capital markets and consolidation in the sector. The bank’s official believes more fiscal action in the bloc would benefit growth. Solomon’s remarks come as initial European public offerings trail the U.S. due to weaker valuations and patchy investor demand. He argued that member states must play their part in building pools of long-term capital to channel financing more forcefully into both public and private markets. According to data from Dealogic, Goldman Sachs earned the highest fees in the first quarter from advising clients on deals in Europe. The financial institution was ranked second by revenue earned in the bloc’s investment banking league tables. In the firm’s first-quarter earnings report, Solomon warned that this second quarter has seen a different operating environment. On the subsequent earnings call, he urged people to go slow and take a pause until there’s more clarity around geopolitical issues. In the wake of the upcoming tariff deadline in July, Solomon warned in April that the current level of policy uncertainty wasn’t healthy. Goldman Sachs ’ CEO argued that the policy actions to date have raised the level of uncertainty to a degree he doesn’t think is healthy for investment and growth.

The bloc aims to gather data on both senders and recipients of funds, expanding transparency within crypto asset service providers. The bloc revealed that, from 1 July 2027, crypto exchanges and custodial services will be prohibited from engaging with anonymous wallets and privacy coins. The regulations also mandate regular checks for self-hosted wallets, requiring verification for transactions over 1,000 euros. Monero developer Riccardo Spagni argued that the regulations could drive privacy-focused firms to relocate to jurisdictions that support privacy rights. He also warned that the bloc’s approach could hinder innovation and push parts of the crypto economy into the black market. The European Commission has recently adopted several regulations supplementing the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation ( MiCAR ), which introduce obligations for Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). The two regulations include the Delegated Regulation on Complaints Handling by CASPs and the Delegated Regulation on Business Continuity and Regularity in Crypto-Asset Services. The Commission Delegated Regulation on Complaints Handling by CASPs establishes procedures for handling client complaints to enhance transparency and fairness. CASPs are now required to implement a structured and transparent system that allows clients to submit complaints free of charge. Complaints must also be accepted in the languages used to market services and in the official languages of the CASP’s home and host EU Member States. The Commission Delegated Regulation on Continuity and Regularity in the Performance of Crypto-Asset Services aims to enhance operational resilience by ensuring that CASPs have robust continuity measures in place. The management entity of each CASP is responsible for designing, endorsing, and annually reviewing the business continuity plan to ensure its effectiveness.

Shared by Amelie on X, this announcement represents one of the most significant shifts in U.S. financial policy toward digital assets, clearing the path for deeper institutional involvement in crypto, including XRP. A Clear Green Light from Powell Powell has made it unmistakably clear: “Banks are now free to serve crypto customers, provided they understand and manage the risks.” This was a live and official directive to provide banks with the regulatory confidence they’ve long needed. BREAKING NEWS: FED CHAIR JEROME POWELL SAID BANKS ARE NOW FREE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE CRYPTO INDUSTRY! HUGE FOR #XRP AND CRYPTO! pic.twitter.com/nOsYeaSZou — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 24, 2025 For years, “reputational risk” was used by regulators as a vague rationale to discourage banks from servicing the crypto sector. That’s now over. The Federal Reserve has formally removed reputational risk as a factor in its supervisory framework. This means that banks can no longer be penalized or pressured for serving crypto clients simply because of the industry’s controversial past. Building on April’s Regulatory Reforms Today’s announcement builds directly on the sweeping reforms initiated in April 2025, when the Fed, FDIC, and OCC rescinded prior guidance that required banks to seek pre-approval before engaging in crypto or stablecoin activities. That move eliminated key bureaucratic obstacles. Now, with reputational risk also off the table, banks are free to develop crypto-related services without fear of regulatory retaliation. Powell emphasized that the Fed is not against innovation. Instead, the central bank wants to ensure that any crypto activity pursued by banks is done “safely and soundly.” Importantly, he reiterated that crypto companies operating within legal bounds should never be debanked simply due to optics or external pressure.

Senator Cynthia Lummis called it a victory for financial fairness and innovation. Analysts are already labeling the policy shift as the official end of what was widely dubbed “Operation Choke Point 2.0”, a coordinated effort that had cut off banking access to dozens of legitimate crypto firms. Many assets rose sharply following the news , but the broader implications may favor assets like XRP, which are built for institutional and cross-border use. With banks now able to custody digital assets, provide crypto payment rails, and support tokenized financial products, XRP could benefit from enhanced liquidity, regulatory legitimacy, and widespread adoption. A New Era of Crypto-Banking Integration Amelie’s X post captured the magnitude of this moment. This isn’t speculative hype, it’s the official position of the most powerful central bank in the world. With supervisory handcuffs removed and the Fed signaling openness to crypto, U.S. banks now have both the authority and the incentive to enter the digital asset arena . For XRP and the wider crypto ecosystem, the message is clear: the door to traditional finance is no longer just open, it’s been thrown wide. And with it, a new era of mainstream adoption begins.

With Bitcoin consolidating and large-cap momentum slowing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly climbing early-stage watchlists, positioning itself as a potential strategic play for those seeking outsized returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining remarkable traction among both retail and institutional investors. With over $10 million raised and every pre-sale phase selling out quickly, it is emerging as one of the most talked-about crypto assets of 2025 . The capped supply of 170 billion tokens helps avoid inflation risk, while a full smart contract audit and transparent governance model boost investor confidence. Its scarcity-based tokenomics, staking incentives, and 100% community ownership are seen as major tailwinds. Analysts suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE could replicate the exponential rise of early Solana and XRP phases. Solana: Technical Strength, But Traders Seek More Solana remains a technical leader in blockchain, with high throughput and strong engagement across DeFi and NFTs. Despite long-term growth potential—particularly with ETF discussions gaining traction—some traders are rotating profits into projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that may offer more aggressive near-term upside. XRP: Regulatory Clarity and Capital Rotation XRP is inching closer to final regulatory clarity as the SEC lawsuit nears conclusion, a development that could lead to more mainstream adoption. Yet with expectations of steadier growth post-verdict, many XRP traders are diversifying into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater short-term ROI. Chainlink: Strong Fundamentals, But Eyes on Newcomers Chainlink is holding strong above $15, backed by continued development and oracle integration across DeFi platforms. Still, some LINK holders are exploring newer plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE that combine strong fundamentals with fast-rising momentum, making them appealing alternatives in this cycle. Conclusion With Solana, XRP, and Chainlink traders increasingly seeking early entry into the next major altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the standout pick for 2025. Between its strong fundamentals, rising investor demand, and community-first structure, it’s gaining momentum as a leading contender for outsized returns.

The prediction site is reportedly close to a $200M financing deal that will put its value at $1B. Polymarket is on the verge of a $200M financing round that will give the company a unicorn valuation of $1B . According to reports by The Information and Reuters, Polymarket will finally enter price discovery after years of existing as a tokenless platform. The round will be led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and will be one of the larger raises in the past few months. Thiel is already involved with Polymarket and has mentioned prediction platforms in relation to his data analytics company, Palantir. Thiel first invested in the platform in May 2024, along with Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin. Thiel has also mentioned prediction markets as a source of data and accurate information on current events. The new funding round will follow a previous raise of $74M led by Polychain Capital. The Polymarket fundraising round follows the recent preparation for a Pump.fun token sale, which aims to raise $1B at $4B valuation. For some, Polymarket has a bigger potential than the meme platform and may achieve an even higher valuation if it launches a token. The announcement may increase Polymarket volumes, in expectation of tying token allocation to activity. Polymarket, however, remains even more valuable as the go-to platform for current events, breaking news, and political predictions. Polymarket has also announced a partnership with X, giving the platform even larger mainstream exposure. Polymarket mindshare peaks Polymarket became the talk of social media, especially crypto-affiliated yappers. Based on the Kaito leaderboard, the platform was the most rapidly trending among tokenless protocols. Polymarket received the most talk and social media messaging among pre-TGE projects. Polymarket rapidly rose to the top on social media, as the hottest pre-token platform. | Source: Kaito Polymarket surpassed other projects that are yet to announce a token generation event. Previously, the platform has hinted that it would reward its customers. The prediction site saw an outflow of users following the end of the US elections in November 2024, but briefly posted a message to users not to leave the site. Months later, Polymarket is still undecided about an eventual token or an airdrop. In the past few months, Polymarket users retained a lower baseline, mostly hinging on small bets under $100. Despite this, the platform gained wider mainstream acceptance, with quotes on event resolution appearing in mainstream media. The betting market also immediately reacts to current news, evolving its most active markets. While sports bets remain a staple, the Polymarket influence is mostly tied to current news and events. For some, Polymarket is a crowdsourcing mechanism, while others are skeptical and point to some of the illiquid, easy-to-manipulate prediction pairs. Some of the markets remain extremely volatile, fluctuating by up to 50% in minutes depending on current events. The prediction market on whether Iran would close the Straits of Hormuz was one of the pairs closely watched to determine the direction of oil prices. Within hours, the probability was down from 50% to 2%, reflecting the rapidly changing conditions. However, Polymarket has shown itself to be more reliable compared to other on-chain betting sites. The platform has few competitors, including the much less liquid Kalshi. Google Trends reveals a general interest in Polymarket, boosting searches from virtually non-existent to 100 points in the span of two weeks.

Gold is the collateral. XRP is the endgame.” While cryptic on the surface, this statement captures a sweeping view of an emerging global financial reset, where geopolitical conflict, hard assets, and digital technology are converging to reshape the future of money. War as a Distraction for Financial Restructuring According to Versan, war is not merely a geopolitical event but a distraction—“the cover”—for a deeper shift taking place in the global monetary system. Recent years have seen a surge in armed conflict and rising international tension, from the Russia-Ukraine war to unrest in the Middle East and increasing friction in the Asia-Pacific region. While headlines focus on battles and diplomacy , many believe these conflicts are accelerating behind-the-scenes efforts to break away from the U.S.-led, dollar-dominated financial order. For decades, the U.S. dollar has served as the world’s reserve currency, underpinning international trade and central bank reserves. War Is the Cover. Gold Is the Collateral. #XRP Is the Endgame. — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) June 24, 2025 However, this dominance has increasingly been challenged by countries seeking to reduce their reliance on the dollar, especially in response to U.S. sanctions and the weaponization of the SWIFT payment system. Nations like China, Russia, and Brazil are exploring alternative settlement mechanisms and currencies, all while preparing for a shift away from fiat reliance. Gold’s Quiet Return as Monetary Collateral The second part of Versan’s message—“Gold is the collateral”—highlights gold’s reemergence as a foundational asset in a time of economic uncertainty. Central banks have been accumulating gold at record levels, especially across the BRICS bloc . The People’s Bank of China has expanded its gold holdings almost every month since late 2022, signaling a strategic pivot toward a more asset-backed approach to monetary reserves. Unlike fiat currencies, gold is not subject to inflation, political manipulation, or trust erosion. In a future system where credibility matters more than policy promises, gold is increasingly being viewed as a neutral, universally accepted form of collateral, especially as countries prepare for a post-dollar world. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP: The Technological Backbone of the New Financial System Finally, Versan concludes: “XRP is the endgame.” This bold claim reflects growing belief in XRP’s role as a bridge asset in the evolving financial landscape. Designed for speed, efficiency, and interoperability, XRP enables instant cross-border transactions at minimal cost. Ripple, the developer behind the XRP Ledger, continues to secure partnerships with financial institutions and central banks around the world, further strengthening XRP’s utility in global finance. Unlike traditional currencies or even gold, XRP can serve as the liquidity solution for a digitized, tokenized economy. Its decentralized structure, rapid settlement capability, and ability to bridge multiple currencies position it as an ideal backbone for a world of interoperable digital assets, including tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Versan’s post may be brief, but its implications are profound. In a world increasingly shaped by conflict, currency realignment, and digital transformation, a quiet revolution is unfolding. War may serve as the cover story. Gold may provide the financial foundation. And XRP—purpose-built for global liquidity—may ultimately prove to be the endgame.

Per data shared by on-chain and financial metrics platform Glassnode, Solana ( SOL ) CME Futures volume has hit 1.75 million contracts. The milestone, reached in the past 24 hours, coincided with a notable reversal for the SOL token. Its price bounced off lows of $125 in the wake of the Middle East conflict to hit highs of $146.

But the benchmark digital asset has since bounced to above $105k, fueling gains across the crypto market . Solana’s gains have cut weekly losses for SOL price to under 1% as at the time of writing. CME Group announced the launch of SOL futures in March 2025, offering access to micro-sized contracts and larger-sized contracts. Market participants can choose between the 25 SOL micro-sized contract or the larger 500 SOL contract. “With the launch of our new SOL futures contracts, we are responding to increasing client demand for a broader set of regulated products to manage cryptocurrency price risk,” Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group’s global head of cryptocurrency products, said. After a slow start, with less than 400k in volume in April and May, the metric picked up and surpassed 1 million contracts this week. Analysts have opined that notable CME futures volume could be a signal for demand for Solana exchange-traded funds. Recently, experts gave SOL spot ETFs a 95% chance of approval in 2025.

The company built and operates more than 30 sites across Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Wyoming. A vertically integrated setup gives CleanSpark control over energy procurement and operations, helping reduce costs and boost uptime. “It reflects years of focused strategy, disciplined execution, and a relentless commitment to doing things the right way,” said CEO Zach Bradford. Hashrate is a metric used to measure the computing power behind the Bitcoin network. The higher a given company’s hashrate, the higher its chances of earning bitcoin rewards. The firm is now preparing to scale up to 60 EH/s, with Bradford stating the company was in “escape velocity” mode.

Beijing might finally be warming up to stablecoins , but not without hesitation. In a sign that China may be rethinking its digital currency strategy, a state media article this week reportedly urged policymakers to stop delaying and focus on “adapting to the trend of stablecoins,” the South China Morning Post reports , referring to the piece, published by Securities Times, a financial publication under the People’s Daily. The piece called on Chinese authorities to begin developing yuan-backed stablecoins and start laying out regulations as the U.S. just passed a stablecoin bill, giving regulated issuers the green light to mint dollar-pegged digital tokens. Chinese analysts and officials seem concerned this U.S. head start could deepen the greenback’s dominance in digital trade, and leave the yuan playing catch-up. The article described stablecoins as an “emerging payment tool” that, while carrying risks, offer too many advantages to ignore. “The development of yuan-backed stablecoins should be sooner rather than later,” it said, citing a broad consensus among industry insiders. No direct competition That’s precisely where China’s anxiety lies. “For China, which is promoting the global use of the yuan, proactively regulating stablecoins and therefore facilitating the internationalisation of the yuan might be a better solution,” the Securities Times piece said. The article adds to a flurry of voices in recent months urging Beijing to act, especially as trade tensions with Washington continue to escalate. Liu Xiaochun, a deputy director at the Shanghai Finance Institute, told the outlet that yuan-based stablecoins could help China strike a balance between innovation and financial security. But he reportedly emphasized they shouldn’t try to “compete directly” with dollar-backed versions. Instead, the focus should be on “supporting emerging economies” and expanding yuan use in a more organic way. You might also like: Fortune 500 firm Fiserv to launch stablecoin on Solana Hong Kong, meanwhile, has already moved ahead. It’s set to launch a licensing regime for stablecoin issuers in August. But on the mainland, crypto trading remains banned and regulators haven’t shown much appetite for changing that anytime soon. The U.S., by contrast, is pushing forward. Last week, the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill that sets the ground rules for stablecoin issuance, requiring reserves and compliance with anti-money laundering laws. The vote passed with bipartisan support, though some Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, warned the bill was too soft on potential conflicts of interest, particularly those tied to Trump-affiliated crypto ventures. Growing concerns Still, industry voices cheered the move. Supporting the GENIUS Act, Christian Catalini, founder of MIT’s Cryptoeconomics Lab, told ABC News it “opens the floodgates” for competition and innovation, with consumers seeing real benefits. Analysts at China International Capital Corporation didn’t miss the implications. In a note this week, they pointed out that most stablecoins are still pegged to the U.S. dollar. That alone helps reinforce the dollar’s status, they wrote. It reduces costs and makes greenback transactions easier, which, in turn, encourages more international use of U.S. currency. You might also like: Every bank will issue a stablecoin after GENIUS Act passage: Alchemy CTO The growing popularity of these digital dollars could even increase global demand for U.S. Treasuries, the CICC note said. But they also flagged potential downsides: rising geopolitical tensions and concerns over U.S. debt levels may eventually undercut confidence in the dollar. That could create an opening for other digital currencies, including, perhaps, a yuan-backed stablecoin. Zhou Xiaochuan, former head of China’s central bank, echoed that concern last week at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai. The rise of stablecoins, he warned, could accelerate “dollarization” in parts of the global economy. Multi-polar currency As of press time, stablecoins represent a $261 billion market, according to CoinGecko. Of that, about 97% are dollar-pegged, with more than $1.4 billion backed by U.S. Treasuries. Zhu Taihui, a senior fellow at the National Institution for Finance and Development under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the SCMP that offshore yuan-based stablecoins should be issued in Hong Kong “as soon as possible” and eventually expanded into China’s free trade zones. Meanwhile, China is ramping up efforts on a parallel front: the digital yuan, or e-CNY. At the same Lujiazui Forum, the central bank’s current governor Pan Gongsheng pledged to establish an international operation center for the currency in Shanghai, reiteratting Beijing’s vision of a “multi-polar” global currency system that isn’t overly reliant on the dollar. “Developing a multi-polar international monetary system will help strengthen policy constraints on sovereign currency countries, enhance the resilience of the system, and better safeguard global financial stability.” Pan Gongsheng But getting the yuan to compete globally still faces obstacles. As Morgan Stanley analysts noted in a research note, any meaningful rise of yuan-backed stablecoins will require easing capital controls and broader acceptance of the Chinese currency as their development “has been constrained by Beijing’s ban on domestic use, lingering capital controls, and insufficient global recognition given the dominance of USD-pegged stablecoins.” Read more: Shanghai’s new e-CNY hub marks China’s subtle play for global monetary influence",Follow-up|China|Regulation|Stablecoin|United States,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-24 17:47:01

Pi Network (PI) Pi Network ‘s PI token has seen significant price declines recently. Over the past week, the price dropped 15.90%. In the past month, it fell 32.75%, and over six months, it decreased 27.47%. Currently, the price ranges between $0.45 and $0.58. This downward trend indicates bearish market sentiment. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index is 53.73, suggesting the token is neither overbought nor oversold. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.51, slightly below the 100-day average of $0.53. The MACD is negative at -0.0004118, indicating potential for further decline. However, the stochastic oscillator at 66.85 could signal an upcoming reversal. If PI breaks through resistance at $0.66, it might rally to $0.80, a potential increase of over 20%. If the price falls below support at $0.39, it could drop to $0.25, a decline of about 36%. Traders should watch these levels to gauge the coin’s next move. Conclusion Pi’s technical indicators suggest a bullish reversal to $1. While PI is promising, XYZVerse uniquely merges meme culture with sports, aiming for significant growth and community engagement. To learn more about XYZVerse, visit the website , Telegram , and X .

The delay was confirmed in an order dated June 24, 2025, published on the SEC’s official release. According to the filing, Nasdaq originally submitted the proposed rule change on March 17, 2025, seeking to list and trade commodity-based trust shares of the 21Shares Polkadot Trust under Nasdaq . The proposed rule was later published in the Federal Register on March 26, 2025, when the formal comment period officially began. SEC pushes Polkadot ETF decision forward for ‘more comments’ The SEC stated that on May 8, 2025, the Commission exercised its authority under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to designate a longer period for reviewing the proposal. Under this provision, the SEC is permitted to take up to 240 days from the date of publication to approve, disapprove, or institute proceedings on the proposed rule change. The new deadline for a final decision has now been set for July 26, 2025. As of now, no public comments have been submitted regarding the proposed Polkadot ETF, according to a release cited in the SEC’s filing. The Switzerland-based crypto asset manager has applied for several exchange-traded fund applications over the course of 2025. 21Shares has submitted spot crypto ETFs proposals for assets like Solana and Chainlink. In March 2025, the SEC also acknowledged the filing of a 21Shares application for a Solana-based ETF. That acknowledgment kicked off the 45-day review period typically granted under SEC rules. The initial countdown began earlier this year, but the regulator has yet to approve or deny the application, leaving the door open for further extensions. Similarly, the firm collaborated with Ark Invest for a Bitcoin ETF that was officially approved earlier this year. Each filing now appears to be moving through the regulatory pipeline at a measured pace. The SEC has shown a willingness to engage, but continues to invoke procedural delays allowed under its legal mandate. XRP ETF also delayed for similar reasons The SEC’s handling of the 21Shares Polkadot Trust application adds to the statements of delay the financial regulator has made this year, on multiple crypto ETF proposals. In late May, the Commission postponed its decision on two separate applications submitted by Grayscale Investments and Bitwise for a spot XRP ETF. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said the SEC’s delays were “expected,” noting that “the SEC takes the full time to respond to a 19b-4 filing.” He added that “an early decision would be ‘out of the norm,’ as almost all the submissions had a review deadline in October. “ No matter how crypto-friendly this SEC is. There’s no conspiracy here ,” Seyffart wrote on X. Like the Polkadot ETF, the SEC invoked its authority to extend the review period, stating that additional time was needed to consider the application more thoroughly. A final decision could now be pushed as far as mid-October, depending on how many extensions are used. Asset management giant Franklin Templeton also submitted a filing for a spot XRP ETF just days after the SEC made its announcement on Bitwise and Grayscale. Market analysts are optimistic about the outcome for many of the pending crypto ETF applications. Bloomberg’s Seyffart and Eric Balchunas raised their approval odds last Friday for several spot crypto ETFs to 90% or higher. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

One is holding strong at a crucial level, while the other is approaching a significant trendline. These coins could be primed for breakout moves. Dive into this analysis to discover which assets show promise for growth. Ondo Price Snapshot Amid Key Levels and Steep Decline Ondo ’s price history over the past month shows a decline of nearly 20%, while over the last six months the coin has dropped over 50%. This significant downward movement has tested investor confidence, with price volatility marking a tough trading period. Recent losses illustrate the challenging environment and highlight the pressure on Ondo’s market value, making it a subject of caution for those watching altcoin performances closely. Currently, Ondo struggles to break through key price levels in a market marked by uncertainty. The price today lies between $0.70 and $1.05, with immediate resistance at $1.27 and a second resistance at $1.62. Nearest support is at $0.57, with deeper support at $0.21. The Awesome Oscillator is at -0.116, and the Momentum Indicator is -0.035, indicating a slowing market. The Relative Strength Index around 43.12 suggests insufficient buying pressure to reverse the trend. Bears maintain control, and trading strategies could involve waiting for a bounce from $0.57 or testing resistance at $1.27 while managing risks under bearish conditions. Polymesh Market Trends: Past Declines and Current Support Levels Over the last month, POLYX saw a drop of 22.38%, while the half-year performance eroded over half of its value with a 54.64% loss. Weekly activity reflects a decline of 3.36%. Price action during these periods suggests persistent sell pressure amid a generally subdued market environment. Price momentum has lagged, and technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index at 42.67, indicate neither oversold nor strongly overbought conditions. The overall behavior in recent periods points to a lack of bullish strength, with declines observed on multiple timeframes. Current trading conditions center on a price that trades between $0.113 and $0.1847. The nearest resistance is set at $0.23, while a support level is found near $0.0868. A second resistance at $0.30 and an additional support zone as low as $0.0151 are noteworthy. The oscillators and moving averages suggest that momentum remains low, with summary recommendations pointing to bearish signals. Without a clear directional trend, traders might consider range-bound strategies between the key support and resistance levels. Caution is advised when setting stop losses and take profit targets, as bears currently seem to control market dynamics. Conclusion ONDO is holding steady at its current support level. This stability could point to potential upward movement if demand increases. On the other hand, Polymesh , denoted as POLYX, is approaching an important trendline. This key level will be crucial for determining its next move. Observing these levels will be essential for future market predictions.

This strategic capital rotation is fueling surging demand for early-stage tokens, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the year’s most watched new entries. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Pre-Sale of 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become a magnet for traders seeking high-return potential, securing over $10 million and selling out each round with remarkable speed. Its capped token supply, verified HashEx audit, and transparent rollout have positioned it as a standout project among early-stage assets . Rather than relying on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on a structured, community-first approach. The combination of scarcity-based tokenomics, strong governance, and growing demand has led many to view it as one of the few altcoin projects with the infrastructure and investor backing to thrive in a post-cycle environment. Bitcoin and Ethereum: Rotation Fuels New Opportunities With Bitcoin crossing $111,000 and Ethereum holding between $2,800 and $3,000, both are widely seen as market leaders with more modest near-term upside. As institutional inflows stabilize and ETF-driven sentiment matures, some investors are now redirecting a portion of their capital toward alternative assets with asymmetric return profiles. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a leading destination for those seeking that kind of opportunity, gaining traction among both early adopters and traditional holders. Litecoin: Reliable Performer with Fresh Momentum Often referred to as “digital silver,” Litecoin is reemerging in 2025 as a strong performer with renewed attention. As Litecoin benefits from reduced fees, strong transactional history, and ETF-related interest, it’s also clear that many traders are simultaneously turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its early-stage appeal. The dual interest highlights a broader trend: investors are looking for both reliability and upside potential in the same portfolio. Conclusion The reallocation of capital from Bitcoin and Ethereum into Litecoin and MAGACOIN FINANCE marks a shift in how investors approach the 2025 market. With MAGACOIN FINANCE leading in early-stage demand and Litecoin showing signs of resurgence, many are positioning themselves now in anticipation of the next altcoin rally.

The geopolitical relief provided a strong tailwind for risk assets, and BTC responded with a powerful surge, regaining a critical psychological level that had previously flipped into resistance. Now, as bulls regain momentum, Bitcoin is flirting with a potential breakout above the $110,000 mark — a key level that capped rallies throughout June. Related Reading: Bitcoin Battles Key Support: Daily EMA-100 Must Hold to Prevent Deep Correction This renewed strength comes after several days of volatility and fear, where BTC dipped to as low as $98,200 amid escalating conflict in the Middle East. However, the swift recovery has shifted sentiment back in favor of the bulls. According to on-chain data from CryptoQuant, there has been a heavy spike in Taker Buy Volume over the past 48 hours — a strong signal that aggressive market participants are stepping in with conviction. These buy-side imbalances suggest that institutional and high-conviction traders are positioning for further upside. As the market heats up and risk appetite grows, a breakout above the $110K resistance could confirm the start of a new bullish impulse. For now, all eyes are on whether BTC can hold and extend above current levels. Bitcoin Faces Uncertainty As Bulls Defend Structure Bitcoin is currently facing a critical test, trading in a tight range after failing to break above its all-time high. Although bulls have managed to defend the overall structure and keep BTC above key moving averages, the price action has not provided a clear directional signal. The asset is roughly 6% down from its $112K peak, and while some traders expect an imminent breakout toward new highs, others warn of a potential retrace below the $100K psychological level. This divide among analysts stems from ongoing geopolitical instability — particularly in the Middle East — and tightening macroeconomic conditions. The Fed’s commitment to elevated interest rates and rising US Treasury yields continues to weigh on risk sentiment, making it difficult for BTC to build sustained momentum. Despite the uncertainty, buyers have shown signs of strength, with many looking to confirm the recent bounce as a solid bottom. Top analyst Maartunn highlighted one key bullish signal: heavy spikes in Taker Buy Volume, which indicate aggressive market orders being filled on the buy side. This suggests that high-conviction buyers are stepping in at current levels, potentially front-running a larger move to the upside. While this is a positive sign for short-term sentiment, Bitcoin must still reclaim the $109K–$112K range to invalidate the risk of a broader correction. Until then, traders remain cautious. If BTC closes a daily candle below the $103.6K support or loses the $100K level again, it could trigger a wave of liquidations and send prices lower. On the other hand, holding above $105K and building volume could set the stage for the next leg up. The coming days will be crucial in defining Bitcoin’s path forward. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Critical Support – $2,350 Level Could Define The Next Move BTC Surges Above Key Support As Buyers Step In The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin reveals a strong bullish reaction after a brief dip below the $103,600 support level. The price rebounded sharply, reclaiming both the 100 and 50-period moving averages (green and blue lines, respectively), with BTC now trading around $105,357. This move confirms the importance of the $103,600 zone as a high-demand area, which has acted as a launchpad multiple times since early May. Volume surged on the recent bounce, indicating aggressive buying activity. The spike suggests whales and institutional buyers likely absorbed the panic selling triggered by geopolitical events earlier in the week. Price is now approaching the $109,300 resistance level, a key ceiling that capped multiple rallies in May and June.

However, a rejection near $109K could confirm a broader consolidation range between $103K and $109K. If bulls manage to flip $109,300 into support, the path to retest the all-time highs around $112K opens up.

In a new interview with CNBC’s Squawk on the Street, McInerney says Visa has long been preparing for the greater adoption of stablecoins. “We’ve been embracing and building for years, preparing for this moment. The GENIUS Act has now passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House. I think that will give regulatory clarity [for] stablecoins. And we’ve been embracing stablecoins. We’ve been enabling people to issue Visa credentials on top of stablecoins, we’ve been modernizing our own settlement infrastructure with stablecoins and we have a whole host of innovations that we plan to deploy around the world embracing stablecoins.” While Visa’s stock declined after the U.S. Senate approved the GENIUS Act, McInerney says that Visa could enable stablecoin use across its payments network if there’s a demand for it. “For payments, you need three things. You need trust, you need ease of use and you need scale. And the reason why we have close to 5 billion Visa credentials around the world, the reason why we have 14 billion Visa tokens around the world and the reason why 150 million merchants around the world depend on Visa to grow their businesses is because nobody does that better than Visa. And if stablecoins become a mode of currency that people want to embrace around the world we will enable that on the Visa system and scale that to those billions of end points. That’s what you need to do well in payments, that’s what Visa does better than anybody in the world.” Visa is trading for $350 at time of writing, down from its 52-week high of $375.

Zerohash provides the on-chain service and liquidity required to convert fiat into crypto with seamless smart contract execution. Chainlink operates on a trusted interoperability infrastructure, while Mastercard is a trusted global payment network that blends to offer mainstream users access to the on-chain economy. The partnership gears toward converging TradFi with the DeFi world Sergey Nazarov, Co-Founder of Chainlink, said that the partnership was a type of traditional finance and decentralized finance convergence that Chainlink was built to make possible. He was excited about Chainlink’s ability to enable the critical connection between the conventional payment world and the over three billion cardholders in the Mastercard user base into environments of on-chain decentralized exchanges. Nazarov acknowledged it was great connecting with the Mastercard team on the innovative implementation with Swapper Finance, XSwap, Shift4, and Zerohash. He added that it was a complex and multilayered collaboration, which he was excited to see Chainlink make happen. Raj Dhamodharan, vice president of Blockchain and Digital Assets at Mastercard, noted that there was zero doubt that people wanted to connect to the digital assets ecosystem easily. He added that Mastercard is tapping into its proven expertise and global payment network to close the gap between on-chain commerce and off-chain transactions. He revealed that the partnership with Chainlink unlocks a secure and innovative way to revolutionize on-chain commerce and drive the broader adoption of crypto assets. Zerohash will provide the core compliance, custody, and transaction infrastructure to allow conversion of fiat to crypto in a regulated manner. Shift4 will enable card processing, while XSwap sources liquidity from decentralized exchanges such as the Uniswap protocol, supporting final execution of swaps on-chain. The collaboration of the technologies makes a unified, compliant, and seamless user experience while bringing crypto assets access to payment cardholders. During a fireside chat at Blokworks’ Digital Asset Summit in April, Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov sat with Guy Young, Ethena Labs Founder, to discuss the convergence of TradFi and DeFi via stablecoins and real-world assets. Nazarov agreed that DeFi and TradFi will eventually converge by combining DeFi’s superior distribution channel with TradFi’s risk management and custody guarantees. He added that the increasing adoption of blockchain will ultimately kill the distinction between private and public chains. Young revealed that bringing institutions on-chain is an inevitable yet long-term goal. He added that disappointment may present with the speed at which the shift will occur. The collaboration helps to drive user-centric solutions Edward Woodford, CEO and CO-Founder of Zerohash, revealed his excitement for Zerohash being the infrastructure partner alongside Chainlink and Mastercard on the Swapper Finance platform. He said Zerohash is a flexible crypto and stablecoin infrastructure that powers compliant crypto-to-crypto swaps. According to Woodfird, the company offers simple access to decentralized exchanges through seamless, compliant onboarding, removing the complexities of smart contracts and low-latency on-chain transactions. Drew Turchin, Head of Business Development at Uniswap Labs, said that the Uniswap protocol has become the foundation for on-chain markets, enabling developers worldwide to build new tools for a wide range of users. He was excited to see Swapper Finance use the protocol and shared it as an example of how it continues to serve as critical infrastructure in the financial stack. According to Chainlink, collaboration helps drive a new wave of user-centric solutions that bridge the gap between crypto-native technology and real-world usability.

For example, the social-finance platform Friendtech, which was launched in 2023 and attracted great attention in a short time, lost its impact after its token launch in 2024 due to technical problems and slowness. Unlike previous decentralized storage solutions, Shelby promises near-instant response times with its “hot” data processing infrastructure.

The token briefly surged near that level late on June 23, gaining nearly 3% during a high-volume spike, but was subsequently rejected twice more, reinforcing the significance of that barrier. A descending trendline formed during the corrective pullback, with lower highs establishing a bearish short-term tone. On the regulatory front, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that U.S. banks now have the freedom to determine their digital asset customer base without prior regulatory pre-approval.

Technical Analysis Highlights BCH traded in a $19.76 range (4.4%) from $449.61 to $469.63 over 24 hours. At 22:00 on June 23, BCH surged nearly 3% on 79,485 volume units, setting resistance at $467. The $467 level was tested and rejected two more times, confirming strong overhead resistance. Support formed around $450 with significant volume accumulation between 15:00–16:00. A descending trendline of lower highs emerged following the initial spike, signaling bearish momentum. A V-shaped micro-trend formed during the final hour, with a bounce from $449.94 to $451.31.

The company, known for its Truth Social platform, is embarking on a substantial share buyback program while reaffirming its ambitious Bitcoin strategy. What does this mean for the future of DJT stock, and what are the broader implications for corporate crypto adoption? Understanding Trump Media’s Financial Maneuver Trump Media , trading under the ticker DJT, recently unveiled plans to repurchase up to $400 million of its own shares. This move, often seen as a vote of confidence from a company’s management, signals a belief that the stock is undervalued and that buying back shares will ultimately benefit existing shareholders by reducing the number of outstanding shares, thus increasing earnings per share. What is a Share Buyback and Why Do Companies Do It? A share buyback, or share repurchase, is a strategy used by companies to reacquire their own outstanding shares from the open market. Here’s why companies typically engage in them: Boosting Shareholder Value: By reducing the number of shares in circulation, each remaining share represents a larger percentage of the company’s ownership, potentially increasing its value. Signaling Confidence: It sends a strong message to investors that the company believes its stock is undervalued, and management is confident in future prospects. Improving Financial Metrics: Key metrics like earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE) can improve as the denominator (number of shares) decreases. Returning Capital to Shareholders: It’s an alternative to dividends for distributing profits to investors, often preferred by companies that want to maintain financial flexibility. Offsetting Dilution: Can counteract the dilutive effect of stock options or restricted stock units granted to employees. For Trump Media , this $400 million buyback is a significant financial commitment, especially for a relatively young publicly traded entity. It suggests the company is looking to stabilize its valuation and perhaps reward long-term investors. The Ambitious Bitcoin Strategy: A $2.3 Billion Vision Perhaps even more intriguing than the buyback is Trump Media’s unwavering commitment to its previously announced Bitcoin strategy . The company confirmed that the share repurchase program will not impact its ambitious plan to establish a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury. This strategy, which recently received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), positions DJT as a notable player in the growing trend of corporate crypto adoption. Why a Media Company Needs a Bitcoin Treasury? The decision for a media company like Trump Media to hold such a substantial amount of Bitcoin in its treasury is unconventional, yet it aligns with a broader, albeit nascent, trend among forward-thinking corporations. Here are some potential motivations: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation, particularly given its decentralized nature and fixed supply, which stands in contrast to fiat currencies. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s commitment to innovation and its readiness to participate in the evolving digital economy. This could attract tech-savvy investors and users. Diversification of Assets: Holding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet beyond traditional cash and equivalents, potentially offering higher returns, albeit with higher risk. Attracting a Specific Demographic: For a platform like Truth Social, appealing to users who are already interested in cryptocurrencies could be a strategic move to grow its user base and foster a vibrant community. Potential for Future Integration: While not explicitly stated, a significant Bitcoin treasury could pave the way for future crypto-related services, such as accepting Bitcoin for payments, integrating NFTs, or exploring Web3 functionalities on the Truth Social platform. SEC Approval: A Milestone for Corporate Crypto Adoption? The U.S. SEC’s approval of Trump Media’s Bitcoin treasury plan is a significant development. It suggests a degree of regulatory acceptance for large-scale corporate holdings of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. While the SEC’s stance on various crypto assets remains complex, this approval could set a precedent or at least provide some clarity for other companies considering similar moves. It highlights that with proper disclosures and adherence to regulatory frameworks, even substantial crypto strategies can pass muster with financial regulators. The Volatile Ride of DJT Stock Despite these strategic announcements, the journey for DJT stock has been anything but smooth. Reports indicate that DJT shares have seen a significant decline, down approximately 30% since the announcement of its crypto initiative. This volatility raises important questions: What’s Driving the DJT Stock Performance? Market Reaction to Crypto Exposure: While some investors view Bitcoin favorably, others may be wary of the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. A large Bitcoin treasury introduces a new layer of risk that traditional investors might find unappealing, leading to sell-offs. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment towards growth stocks and speculative assets can also influence DJT’s performance. Company Fundamentals: Beyond crypto, investors scrutinize the company’s core business performance, user growth, revenue generation, and profitability. Initial enthusiasm might wane if these fundamentals don’t meet expectations. Post-SPAC Volatility: DJT went public via a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) merger, which often results in significant price swings in the initial months as the market tries to find a stable valuation. Public Perception and Political Affiliation: As a company associated with a prominent political figure, DJT’s stock can be subject to unique market dynamics influenced by political events and public sentiment, which might not always align with traditional financial metrics. The 30% drop, as reported by The Block, underscores the market’s mixed reactions to the company’s bold strategic direction. It’s a reminder that while innovation can be rewarded, it also comes with increased scrutiny and potential for short-term price fluctuations. Challenges and Opportunities for Corporate Crypto Adoption Trump Media’s strategy serves as a case study for the broader landscape of corporate crypto adoption . While the potential benefits are clear, there are significant hurdles: Key Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price can swing wildly, directly impacting the value of a company’s treasury and potentially its balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite SEC approval for this specific plan, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and evolving across different jurisdictions. Accounting and Tax Complexities: Handling crypto assets on a corporate balance sheet introduces complex accounting and tax implications that require specialized expertise. Security Concerns: Storing and managing large amounts of digital assets requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Public and Investor Perception: Some traditional investors may view crypto holdings as speculative or risky, impacting investor confidence and stock valuation. Emerging Opportunities: Pioneering New Business Models: Companies embracing crypto early can explore new revenue streams, payment methods, and user engagement models. Attracting Talent: Being at the forefront of crypto innovation can attract top talent interested in working with cutting-edge technologies. Enhanced Brand Image: For certain brands, adopting crypto can enhance their image as innovative, forward-thinking, and technologically advanced. Access to New Capital Pools: The crypto market represents a vast pool of capital and a distinct investor base that companies can tap into. Actionable Insights for Investors and Businesses For investors considering DJT stock or any company with significant crypto exposure, due diligence is paramount. Understand not just the company’s core business, but also its crypto strategy, risk management protocols, and how these assets are accounted for. For businesses contemplating their own foray into corporate crypto adoption, Trump Media’s experience offers valuable lessons: Start Small and Scale: Unless you’re a major player, consider a phased approach to crypto integration. Understand Regulatory Landscape: Consult legal and financial experts familiar with crypto regulations in your operating regions. Robust Security is Non-Negotiable: Invest heavily in secure storage solutions (cold storage, multi-signature wallets) and cybersecurity protocols. Communicate Clearly: Transparently communicate your crypto strategy to investors and stakeholders, explaining the rationale and risk mitigation. Align with Business Goals: Ensure your crypto strategy genuinely supports your overall business objectives and isn’t just a speculative bet. The Road Ahead for Trump Media and Corporate Crypto Trump Media’s dual strategy of a substantial share buyback and an unwavering commitment to its Bitcoin strategy positions it at a unique and potentially pivotal point. The $400 million buyback signals confidence in its traditional valuation, while the $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury approved by the SEC underscores a bold vision for the future, embracing digital assets as a core component of its financial health. While the recent 30% dip in DJT stock highlights the market’s cautious reaction to its crypto exposure, it also sets the stage for a compelling narrative. Will Trump Media’s gamble on Bitcoin pay off, leading to long-term value creation and pioneering a new path for media companies? Or will the volatility of the crypto market continue to challenge its share performance? Regardless of the outcome, Trump Media’s approach serves as a fascinating case study in the evolving landscape of corporate crypto adoption . It pushes the boundaries of how traditional businesses interact with digital assets, offering valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for companies brave enough to integrate cryptocurrencies into their core strategies. The coming months will undoubtedly reveal more about the wisdom of this bold financial and strategic play.

The Hong Kong-based firm, known for designing crypto mining chips, is targeting up to $1 billion worth of BNB, which will eventually put its holding at between 5% and 10% of the token’s entire circulating supply. BNB Ecosystem Integration The company’s aggressive move represents a major strategic pivot. It previously focused on Bitcoin (BTC), adopting it as a reserve asset and buying $5.5 million worth of the cryptocurrency late last year. According to a press release , funding for the BNB accumulation will be provided through convertible notes that mature in 360 days. After that, they’ll be converted into Nano Labs shares at $20 each. Applauding the initiative, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao clarified that none of his “affiliated entities” participated in the fundraiser, though he remains “extremely supportive.” Nano Labs is also planning to apply for Hong Kong stablecoin licenses and has specifically mentioned building frameworks for Bitcoin and BNB. The two developments suggest a cohesive strategy by the firm to position itself at the heart of Hong Kong’s burgeoning regulated crypto market, leveraging the recently passed Stablecoins Bill, which is set to become effective at the beginning of August. Market Reaction Since the announcement, Nano Labs’ stock has skyrocketed 163% in pre-market trading according to Google Finance, signaling intense investor interest. However, the immediate impact on the price of BNB has been more measured. As of this writing, the token had seen a 3.3% increase in the 24 hours following the disclosure, to trade around $638. Nonetheless, this uptick occurred against a backdrop of recent weakness. BNB has been down 2.5% over the past seven days and 3.5% in the last month, underperforming the global crypto market, which is up a slight 0.10% weekly. Furthermore, technical analysis prior to the news breaking indicated BNB was in a downtrend since being rejected at the $692 resistance in late May, with critical support levels at $630 and $600. While the Nano Labs commitment provides fundamental support, BNB may still face an uphill battle to reclaim its bullish momentum and challenge its all-time high of $788.84, reached just seven months ago in December 2024.

For many, discovering a strong project before it reaches critical adoption is the difference between marginal gains and life-changing returns. Stellar offers a case study in this regard. Those who bought early in its journey witnessed exponential growth, turning modest investments into significant portfolios. Today, Qubetics emerges as an ideal alternative, a presale-stage crypto that combines technical innovation with broad utility across chains. The following analysis is grounded in blockchain fundamentals and enriched with comparative data to help readers understand why these two projects may belong to the top altcoins for massive return potential. Qubetics: A Non-Custodial Multichain Wallet Unlike conventional wallet providers that prioritize only one chain or rely on custodial setups, Qubetics offers a non-custodial, open-source multichain wallet. It grants users full control over their digital assets across Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and multiple other chains, without compromising security. The design of the Qubetics wallet reflects a deep understanding of user demands in decentralized ecosystems. It supports mobile (iOS and Android) and desktop platforms, ensuring accessibility for various user groups. Moreover, it integrates asset tracking, cross-chain swaps, staking, and private key management within one streamlined interface. By offering a secure, user-controlled gateway into the broader blockchain universe, Qubetics delivers infrastructure that could power more decentralized applications and financial tools. Qubetics Crypto Presale: The Final Opportunity Before a CEX Debut At the time of writing, Qubetics is in its 37th and final presale phase. The token powering the ecosystem, $TICS, is priced at $0.3370, fixed for this round. With fewer than 9 million tokens left before the sale closes, the time is limited for adopters hoping to participate prior to its public exchange debut. To date, the Qubetics crypto presale has raised over $18.1 million from a growing base of over 28,200 wallet holders. The presale has already seen more than 516 million $TICS tokens sold, reflecting strong confidence from early-stage backers. Upon listing on a major top-10 global exchange, Qubetics anticipates a price increase of at least 20%. Buyers are also keenly aware that once the token goes live, future buy-ins will be subject to market volatility and higher entry costs. In other words, the current fixed price offers clarity. In a market where presale access can provide significant upside, Qubetics is capturing attention as one of the top altcoins for massive return potential due to both its technical strength and its timing. What Could a $20,000 Allocation in Qubetics Look Like? At the fixed presale price of $0.3370, $20,000 secures approximately 59,345 $TICS tokens. With projections tied to platform rollout, exchange listings, and ecosystem growth, several hypothetical return projections are worth considering: At $0.40 (post-listing bump): The holding grows to roughly $23,738. At $1.00: The investment would be worth $59,345, a nearly 196% increase. At $5.00: Returns could soar to $296,725, marking a 1,383% ROI. At $10.00: The value grows to $593,450. At $15.00 (after mainnet launch): The return reaches an impressive $890,175, representing a 4,349% ROI. These projections are, of course, speculative. However, they are based on realistic market patterns observed in similar ecosystem-driven tokens. If adoption metrics track with expectations and Qubetics becomes the go-to multichain wallet across platforms, such price targets are not beyond reach. Stellar: The ICO That Launched Billions in Value Stellar, one of the earliest altcoin giants, serves as an instructive benchmark for evaluating new projects. It launched in August 2014 with an ICO price of $0.0581. By January 2018, it had reached an all-time high of approximately $0.80. For those who entered during the presale or early trading, the returns were exponential. Even more interesting is the listing price itself. While the ICO price was $0.0581, tokens traded at around $0.0031 shortly after the public launch. Early participants who bought at or around this price could have seen returns of over 25,000%, depending on their entry point. The Stellar Foundation structured its initial token distribution with a long-term vision. Fifty percent of the tokens were earmarked for sign-up programs and educational incentives, while 25% went to partnerships. Twenty percent supported Bitcoin bridge integrations, and 3% was allocated for development. Today, Stellar remains a top-20 asset by market capitalization. It remains a case study in how early-stage blockchain investments can generate sustained value over time. Conclusion: Top Altcoins for Massive Return Potential Stellar and Qubetics illustrate the core thesis of this article: capturing exponential returns in crypto requires early identification of utility-driven, scalable projects. Stellar proved that high returns are possible when innovation meets execution. Qubetics now offers a similar blend of real-world use, developer adoption potential, and strong buyer interest. While nothing in this article constitutes investment advice, the data-driven approach shows why Qubetics deserves attention as one of the top altcoins for massive return potential . Its presale is nearing completion. The exchange listing is imminent. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs 1. What makes Qubetics a non‑custodial wallet? It stores private keys on user devices without third‑party control. This secures assets across chains and gives users full oversight. 2. Can Qubetics manage tokens across multiple blockchains? Yes. It supports Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and others. Users track and swap assets seamlessly in one interface. 3. What ROI projections exist for Qubetics? If $TICS rises from $0.3370 to $1, the return is ~196%. At $5, ROI can reach ~1,383%, and post‑mainnet at $15, ROI may hit ~4,349%. 4. Why is Stellar considered a missed ICO opportunity? Stellar’s ICO price ($0.0581) later surged to ~$0.80. That represented approximately 14x gains for early buyers. 5. What risks apply to these altcoins? Risks include price volatility, regulatory scrutiny, smart contract bugs, and market adoption uncertainties. This is not trading advice. Summary: This article explores Qubetics and Stellar as two standout projects among the top altcoins for massive return potential. Stellar serves as a proven example of exponential ROI through early adoption and strategic partnerships. Meanwhile, Qubetics, currently in its final presale phase, offers a cutting-edge multichain, non-custodial wallet. With over $18 million raised and a fixed token price, Qubetics presents a limited-time opportunity before exchange listing. For adopters seeking outsized gains, the combination of strong tokenomics and network utility positions Qubetics as a promising candidate to follow in Stellar’s historic footsteps.

The decision comes nearly one year after a $234 million hack and months of silence that left users waiting for clarity on fund recovery. Court Grants Moratorium Extension Amid WazirX Restructuring Struggles Today, WazirX confirmed via its official X account that the Singapore High Court had accepted its request to present further arguments in support of its restructuring plan. The same ruling extended the moratorium on legal claims, which originally expired on June 6, 2025, until the court hears and rules on the new arguments. Update on Proposed Scheme of Arrangement The Singapore Court has granted our request to present further arguments in our application for the Court's sanction of the proposed Scheme of Arrangement. Additionally, the Court has extended the moratorium granted in HC/OA 1284/2024… pic.twitter.com/QdozZHnWVX — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) June 24, 2025 The moratorium shields WazirX from legal action while it restructures. The extension offers the exchange one more opportunity to gain formal court approval for its Scheme of Arrangement, a legal process to reorganize operations and settle obligations. The court had previously declined to sanction WazirX’s proposal, citing transparency concerns about its parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd. In response, WazirX proposed relocating operations to Panama under a newly formed entity called Zensui Corporation. Singapore High Court rejects WazirX’s restructuring plan after parent company secretly rebrands and moves to Panama. This paves the way for Indian users to pursue legal action for their lost funds. What’s next for the hacked exchange? #WazirX #Zettai https://t.co/HDEmrYzdf6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 4, 2025 Meanwhile, the July 18, 2024, breach was one of the largest crypto exchange hacks of the year, resulting in the loss of $234 million in digital assets. Since then, WazirX users have remained without access to their funds. The company initially pledged to return 85% of user balances, but progress has been stalled by legal challenges, vague communication, and investor objections. In its latest post, WazirX stated, “We are currently awaiting directions from the Court on the next steps and will keep you informed as soon as we have more clarity.” The update offered no concrete timelines for hearings, rulings, or user repayments. As part of its restructuring plan, WazirX plans to issue recovery tokens, on-chain IOUs representing unrecovered funds. “We will issue RT tokens and use them to distribute any future recovered funds to token holders,” WazirX CEO said. #WazirX #CryptoHack #AssetRecovery https://t.co/5YoXtIppwX — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 11, 2025 These tokens are designed to help users claim between 75% and 80% of their hacked balances, depending on market conditions. However, the tokens remain speculative, and user confidence is waning. Legal and Community Pressures Mount Although more than 93% of voting creditors approved the restructuring plan in April 2025, legal complications and resistance from Zettai Pte Ltd have delayed implementation. Users and crypto community members have increasingly voiced frustration over the lack of transparency. Meanwhile, WazirX has not provided updates since the court’s earlier rejection, and many expected a final decision on the restructuring by June 20. With that date passed and no verdict announced, the latest extension feels like another pause rather than progress for affected users. In February, WazirX had earlier outlined two possible repayment outcomes , depending on whether its proposed restructuring plan is approved or rejected. The exchange warned that repayments could be delayed until 2030 if the court rejects the plan, potentially forcing the company into liquidation. A successful restructuring would allow for a faster, structured repayment process, possibly including profit-sharing benefits. In contrast, liquidation would involve lengthy legal proceedings, higher costs, and reduced payouts.

The amended agreement also comes with a fixed interest rate of 9% versus the previous floating rate of between 10.5% and 11.5%. The maturity of the facility was extended to July 16, 2026. “This facility has been an efficient source of capital on our balance sheet,” said Sean Glennan, Hut 8’s chief financial officer. “The combination of improved terms and collateral and borrower protections reflects our conviction that risk discipline is essential to building a resilient and efficient capital structure.” Unlike many traditional loans, this one is secured by bitcoin holdings. Coinbase, however, is restricted from rehypothecating the collateral, a measure that limits counterparty risk. The credit line also includes a limited recourse clause, further shielding Hut 8.

The shares have fallen by about 60%, but a prospectus filed on Monday shows that there is more offloading to be done, as buyers have signaled they want to offload 35.97 million common shares plus 7.89 million shares tied to pre-funded warrants. UPXI stocks are down ~60% as markets opened on Tuesday, June 24. Source: Google Finance Upexi will not profit from the share sales The prospectus filed on Monday states that Upexi will collect only $7,890 if holders exercise the warrants and take home from the share sales. “We are not selling any shares of Common Stock in this offering, and we will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders,” documents sent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) read. The Florida-based e-commerce startup made headlines in the past for raising $100 million after outlining a plan to establish a corporate Solana treasury, hoping it would mirror the success from Strategy’s Bitcoin playbook. 🚨 NEW: Upexi CEO says the company is doubling down on crypto “With the change in Administration, it seemed like there was an opportunity in crypto after a lot of headwinds.” Full quote from @theflynews 👇 pic.twitter.com/B96XUL1Tmt — Upexi (@UpexiTreasury) June 5, 2025 The company purchased its first set of Solana coins on April 29, a total of 45,733 tokens, a few days after completing its public fundraising effort, and one month later, its holdings had reached 679,677 SOL following multiple purchases of discounted vested coins. Investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald shared a $16 price target for Upexi shares in June after it became one of the largest publicly traded Solana holders. The high price target aligns with Cantor’s bias towards Solana, as Cantor analysts see SOL as superior to ETH, its main competitor. Cantor is betting on Upexi and other Solana treasury companies Cantor analysts believe Solana “makes sense” as a treasury asset because it has adequate room for growth based on its market cap, buzzing developer activity, and viral meme culture. Last week, Matthew Sigel shared Cantor Fitzgerald’s initiation of coverage on three major Solana (SOL) treasury businesses: DeFi Development Corp, Upexi, and Sol Strategies, suggesting a bullish outlook.

Then he added that those at Cantor believe “Solana-oriented balance sheets deserve bigger premiums than BTC co’s due to native revenue opportunities & higher volatility.” He shared an excerpt from a report that highlighted Solana as a layer-1 blockchain with superior throughput and lower transaction fees compared to its main rival, Ethereum (ETH). The report compares Bitcoin and Solana, acknowledging that BTC is well-suited as a strategic reserve asset with established market acceptance. It also confirmed Solana’s potential as the technological backbone for transactions and marketplaces in the digital economy. This suggests that analysts at Cantor may see Solana as a utility-driven blockchain rather than a store of value like BTC or a memecoin chain like many degens. The report goes on to argue that Solana treasury companies are betting on a future where financial transactions and applications will predominantly be on-chain, with Solana as the preferred blockchain.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and tech innovators, this news could redefine how we interact with digital assets and productivity tools. A recent revelation points to Grok AI soon gaining advanced file editing capabilities, including direct spreadsheet support. This development positions xAI as a formidable challenger in the competitive AI productivity arena. What’s Next for Grok AI: Integrated Productivity? The leak, shared by reverse engineer Nima Owji, indicates xAI is developing an advanced file editor for Grok. This editor is expected to allow users to interact with Grok while simultaneously working on files, including spreadsheets. Owji’s finding, which included a screenshot, sparked immediate interest across the tech community. This integration signifies a strategic move by xAI to embed its AI capabilities directly into daily workflow tools, aiming to streamline tasks and enhance user efficiency. Imagine asking Grok to assist you with a report while you are still typing, or getting real-time insights as you adjust figures in a financial model. How is xAI Productivity Building an Ecosystem? While xAI has not officially detailed an interactive, multimodal AI workspace strategy, recent announcements provide clues. In April 2025, xAI launched Grok Studio, a split-screen environment for collaborating with Grok on documents, code, and reports. The introduction of “Workspaces” also allowed users to organize files and conversations in a single place. These existing features lay the groundwork for a more integrated Grok experience, where xAI productivity tools become central to user operations.

Bad actors among Solana validators have long posed a challenge, but native protocols are stepping up efforts to address the issue. On Tuesday, June 24, Marinade Finance rolled out a suite of tools designed to detect and block validators engaging in sandwich attacks against users. Marinade’s Statement on SAM Delegation to Negative MEV Validators (Sandwichers): 1/ We’ve reviewed the research shared by the @0xGhostLogs and @0x7cf teams, which highlighted the importance of strengthening our blacklisting efforts. pic.twitter.com/gMsw4LmjDp — Marinade 🛡️ (@MarinadeFinance) June 24, 2025 Sandwich attacks occur when validators strategically place a transaction both before and after a user’s trade. Because validators can control transaction sequencing, they exploit this advantage to extract profit — at the trader’s expense. Marinade identified such behavior in SOL delegated through its Stake Auction Marketplace. In response, the team developed more effective blacklisting mechanisms and added slashing tools that penalize malicious validators by cutting their rewards.

The move has already gained notable support, including from Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, particularly in the context of liquid staking. This is an awesome outcome and was my dream for stake pools. We need LSTs to be used as collateral in DeFi, and for those DeFi apps to give feedback to the LSTs on what kind of validators are best for DeFi. If this loop works I have no worries about long term ecosystem… https://t.co/Q2LMDypxuR — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) June 24, 2025 Yakovenko emphasized that liquid staking protocols like Marinade, Jito, and Lido should provide feedback on validator performance. This feedback loop, he argued, can help insulate the broader ecosystem from bad actors.

In April, the Foundation announced that it would start cutting small validators from its delegation program . Namely, the organization gives some of its SOL tokens to validators to boost their earnings. Still, challenges for Solana’s validator ecosystem remain. Due to high fixed costs associated with running a node, many validators struggle to break even. This is why some of them resort to operations such as sandwich attacks.

Specifically, BlackRock withdrew over 11,000 ETH, worth approximately $27.2 million, from Coinbase Prime, according to blockchain data from Arkham Intel on June 24. The transfers came in two parts. The first one emerged at 10:43 UTC and involved 4,224 ETH worth $10.28 million, followed 15 minutes later by 6,961 ETH valued at $16.92 million. Both transactions originated from Coinbase Prime’s hot wallet and were sent to a wallet tied to BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA). BlackRock Ethereum transaction. Source: Arkham Intel BlackRock’s initial signal to sell ETH The move is especially noteworthy given that just a day earlier, on June 23, BlackRock transferred 9,928 ETH worth around $24.15 million from its ETF wallet to Coinbase Prime, sparking speculation of profit-taking or rebalancing. However, the swift reversal suggests a renewed accumulation strategy. This marks one of BlackRock’s largest Ethereum purchases in recent weeks. Just days earlier, on June 20, the firm’s spot Ethereum ETF recorded a $19.7 million outflow , the first after 30 consecutive days of inflows. That outflow was also the largest among all Ethereum ETFs, contributing to a net market outflow of $11.3 million. BlackRock’s renewed buying comes amid a broader rebound in institutional crypto activity, following a market-wide selloff driven by Middle East geopolitical tensions. However, markets turned bullish on Monday after President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, helping Bitcoin ( BTC ) reclaim the $105,000 level.

The asset is trading below its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2,526.24, indicating short-term weakness but still above the 200-day SMA at $2,364.00, signaling a longer-term bullish bias. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 46.58, reflecting neutral momentum in line with overall market sentiment.

Is Ethereum Classic A Good Investment? Ethereum Classic has long been a more affordable alternative to ETH. With Ether transitioning to a Proof-of-Stake model, those favoring Proof-of-Work networks could shift their interest to Ethereum Classic. Despite an increase in value in 2023, Ethereum Classic did not meet market expectations, signaling potential concerns. However, Ethereum Classic is not viewed as an unregistered security, which is positive for its market standing. As a result, ETC is a good investment option in the long term. Why is the ETC Price up today? Following the overall buying pressure in the market, ETC price triggered strong push and surged toward $17. Will ETC Recover? If buyers defend the immediate support at $16, we might see a strong recovery toward $20. Will ETC Price Reach $100? ETC price might soon reach the $100 mark in 2028 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ethereum Classic attracts altcoin investors. Will ETC Price Reach $1000? Due to the effort of the Ethereum community, Ethereum Classic Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Coin will reach $1000 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is ETC a Good Long-Term Investment? ETC has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. Recent ETC News/Opinions Arbitrum has activated Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade through ArbOS 40 “Callisto,” introducing powerful features like EIP-7702 for enhanced account abstraction, EIP-2537 for BLS precompiles, and EIP-2935 for improved block hash access.

Bullish Setup Hints At Big Jump, Experts Say",https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/shiba-inu-breakout-incoming-bullish-setup-hints-at-big-jump-experts-say/,"Shiba Inu tumbled to an intraday bottom of $0.000010 on Sunday, marking its weakest point in 16 months. According to market analyst Tom Tucker, that low could set the stage for a sharp turnaround. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets The meme coin has slipped 14% since June began and is off 37% from its May high of $0.00001764. Big holders are growing cautious too, with whale wallets down about 80% and open interest in Shiba Inu futures falling to $123 million—a level last seen in early April. Double Bottom Pattern Offers Hope Based on reports from Tucker’s June 22 chart examination, the meme coin appears to be forming a classic double bottom on its daily price graph. That pattern often signals that a sell-off has run its course. SHIB first bounced off roughly $0.00001028 on April 7, climbing 70% to reach $0.00001765 by May 12. Now that the coin has revisited that support zone at around $0.00001030, traders will be watching closely to see if history repeats itself. $SHIB crashed 7.5% to $0.000011 as geopolitical tensions spooked markets.

The token has already climbed 7.7% from Sunday’s trough to trade around $0.00001081 today. If the support holds firm, he predicts a 62% rally that would lift SHIB to about $0.00001752—practically matching last month’s peak. Whales Exit As Risk Appetite Fades The most recent decline in major holder balances suggests that there could be a shift in market sentiment among Shiba Inu biggest fan base. Whale positions have been 80% lower from its May high, and the decline in open interest hints that leveraged speculators are not taking as much risk. Those moves suggest caution is likely to persist until the buyers return en masse. Shiba Inu Team Urges Patience Meanwhile, the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s marketing lead, Lucie, has asked the community to stay calm. Based on statements from the team, the rally to $0.01 is still the long-term goal, but reaching that milestone means to not “panic” and stay resilient. Panic is not an option. If we haven’t won yet, it’s because it’s not over. — 𝐋𝐔𝐂𝐈𝐄 (@LucieSHIB) June 22, 2025 Related Reading: Bitcoin Wobbles?

Investors seeking a clear entry point might find the present price action appealing. If SHIB manages to hold above that $0.000010 support, a rapid recovery is in the cards. But if the coin goes below that line, the next move down might take it to even lower levels. Traders should be observing volume, whale actions, and the larger crypto market sentiment before making their next move.

Recent reports from CNN have brought to light a significant declaration from former U.S. President Donald Trump: his disinclination towards further military engagement in the Middle East. This assertion, if it were to guide future policy, marks a potentially pivotal moment, one that warrants careful examination for anyone navigating the complexities of global markets and assessing the role of assets like Bitcoin. What Does Trump’s Middle East Stance Truly Mean? The recent CNN report, citing former U.S. President Donald Trump, indicates a clear preference: a move away from increased military intervention in the Middle East. This isn’t merely a casual remark; it signals a potential re-evaluation of a cornerstone of Trump Middle East policy that has defined American foreign relations for decades. Historically, the U.S. has maintained a significant military footprint in the region, driven by various factors including oil interests, counter-terrorism efforts, and regional stability. Trump’s statement suggests a desire to significantly alter this paradigm. But what does ‘no more military engagement’ truly entail? Reduced Military Presence: It could mean a significant draw-down of troops and military assets, focusing instead on strategic partnerships and intelligence sharing rather than direct combat roles. Shift in Strategic Priorities: Less emphasis on nation-building or regime change, and more on protecting core U.S. interests, potentially through economic leverage or targeted operations. Emphasis on Diplomatic Solutions: A greater reliance on negotiation, mediation, and multilateral efforts to resolve conflicts, rather than military force as a primary tool. Empowerment of Regional Powers: A scenario where regional allies are encouraged, or even compelled, to take greater responsibility for their own security and regional stability. This approach stands in contrast to the interventionist policies often seen in post-Cold War American history, raising questions about the long-term implications for the region and for America’s global standing. How Might This Reshape US Foreign Policy? For generations, US foreign policy in the Middle East has been characterized by active involvement, often military, to safeguard interests and maintain a delicate balance of power. Trump’s expressed desire to pull back could represent a dramatic departure from this established approach. It raises crucial questions about America’s role as a global superpower and its commitment to long-standing alliances. Such a shift could redefine alliances, create new diplomatic challenges, and alter the global balance of power. Consider the potential contrasts: Feature Traditional US Foreign Policy in Middle East Potential Trump Approach (as per CNN report) Military Footprint Active, significant ground forces, air power, naval presence Reduced, selective, potentially limited to special operations or advisory roles Regional Focus Interventionist, nation-building, maintaining regional order More isolationist, prioritizing domestic concerns, transactional relationships Alliances Strong, supportive of long-term partners, multilateral engagements Transactional, re-evaluated based on perceived direct benefit to U.S., bilateral focus Energy Security Direct military protection of oil routes and production Reliance on global market forces, reduced direct military role This reorientation could necessitate a complete overhaul of diplomatic strategies and intelligence-sharing protocols with key allies like Saudi Arabia, Israel, and other Gulf states, potentially leading to new regional alignments. What are the Geopolitical Stability Implications? The pursuit of geopolitical stability is a complex dance, and any significant change in the choreography can lead to unpredictable outcomes. On one hand, a reduced U.S. military presence could alleviate tensions stemming from perceived foreign interference, potentially fostering greater regional autonomy and self-reliance. This might lead to: Reduced Financial Burden: A substantial decrease in the billions of dollars spent annually on military operations and maintenance in the region, freeing up resources for domestic priorities. Decreased Anti-American Sentiment: Fewer reasons for resentment or backlash linked to foreign military presence, potentially improving public perception in some areas. Empowerment of Regional Actors: Local powers taking greater ownership of their own security and diplomatic initiatives, fostering a more self-reliant regional order. However, the vacuum created by a U.S. withdrawal could also be filled by other ambitious state or non-state actors, potentially leading to increased regional rivalries, proxy conflicts, or a resurgence of extremist groups. This presents significant challenges to long-term stability. The absence of a strong U.S. deterrent could embolden revisionist powers or lead to an arms race, complicating an already volatile landscape. How Do Global Markets React to Such Shifts? Whenever there’s a significant shift in foreign policy or a rise in geopolitical tensions, global markets often react with immediate volatility. The Middle East, being a crucial hub for energy production and trade routes, holds particular sway. A perceived de-escalation of military involvement could initially be viewed positively, reducing ‘risk premiums’ associated with conflict. However, the uncertainty surrounding the long-term effects of such a policy could also introduce new forms of market anxiety. Key areas of market reaction typically include: Oil Prices: The Middle East is central to global oil supply. A stable, predictable environment could lead to stable or lower oil prices. Conversely, increased regional instability due to a power vacuum could send prices soaring, impacting energy costs worldwide. Stock Markets: Major indices often prefer predictability and stability. A clear, consistent policy, even one of withdrawal, might be welcomed more than prolonged uncertainty. However, sectors tied to defense or international trade could see re-evaluations. Safe-Haven Assets (Gold, Yen, Franc): These traditional safe havens typically see increased demand during times of uncertainty. If Trump’s policy leads to perceived de-escalation, demand might lessen. If it leads to new forms of instability, demand could surge. Currency Markets: The U.S. dollar’s strength is often linked to its role as a global reserve currency and the stability of U.S. foreign policy. Any perceived weakening of U.S. influence could affect its value relative to other major currencies. Investors closely monitor these developments, adjusting their portfolios based on their assessment of risk and opportunity in a changing geopolitical climate. Could Bitcoin Emerge as a True Bitcoin Safe Haven? In times of geopolitical flux, investors often seek refuge in ‘safe-haven’ assets – those expected to retain or increase in value during market turmoil. Traditionally, gold has filled this role. However, in the digital age, the narrative of Bitcoin safe haven has gained considerable traction. The argument is that Bitcoin, being decentralized, borderless, and outside the direct control of any single government or central bank, offers a unique hedge against traditional financial instability and geopolitical risks. During past geopolitical events, Bitcoin’s performance has been a subject of intense debate: Correlation vs. Decoupling: Sometimes, Bitcoin has shown correlation with traditional risk assets (like tech stocks), falling during broader market downturns. At other times, particularly during localized currency crises or heightened geopolitical tensions, it has demonstrated a degree of decoupling, acting as a flight-to-safety asset. For example, during certain phases of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Bitcoin saw increased adoption in affected regions. Censorship Resistance: Its ability to bypass traditional financial systems makes it attractive in regions facing sanctions or capital controls. Volatility Concerns: Despite its potential, Bitcoin’s inherent volatility remains a significant factor. Its price can swing wildly, which can deter some traditional investors seeking absolute stability. For crypto investors, this shifting geopolitical landscape offers actionable insights: Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin holds potential, it should be considered as part of a diversified portfolio, not a sole safe haven. Monitor Geopolitical News: Stay informed about global events, as they can directly influence market sentiment and crypto prices. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid panic selling during short-term volatility. The long-term narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional system failures might strengthen with continued geopolitical uncertainty. Understand Regional Dynamics: Geopolitical shifts in one region can have unique impacts on crypto adoption and use cases in those specific areas. Donald Trump’s stated desire to reduce military intervention in the Middle East is more than just a political talking point; it’s a potential harbinger of significant shifts in US foreign policy and geopolitical stability . These shifts, in turn, have profound implications for global markets , prompting investors to re-evaluate their strategies and consider the evolving role of assets like Bitcoin. While the concept of Bitcoin safe haven is still maturing, its performance during times of uncertainty will continue to be a focal point for the cryptocurrency community, underscoring the interconnectedness of world events and digital finance.

This continued commitment from prominent venture capital entities, especially those with deep expertise in technology and AI, signals a robust endorsement of Harvey AI’s strategy and execution. For a company founded just three years ago, reaching such a financial milestone so quickly speaks volumes about the market’s hunger for efficient, AI-powered solutions in traditionally labor-intensive sectors. Why is This AI Startup Attracting Such Massive Investment? The legal sector, historically resistant to rapid technological shifts, is now experiencing a profound transformation, and Harvey AI is at the forefront of this change. The immense investment pouring into this AI startup is not arbitrary; it stems from the critical problems Harvey solves for legal professionals. Lawyers routinely grapple with time-consuming tasks such as document review, contract drafting, legal research, and due diligence. These tasks, while essential, are often repetitive and prone to human error, consuming countless billable hours and contributing to high legal costs. Harvey AI’s solutions are designed to automate and streamline these processes, offering a compelling value proposition: Efficiency Gains: AI models can analyze vast amounts of legal data and documents in minutes, a task that would take human lawyers days or weeks. This drastically reduces the time spent on mundane tasks, allowing legal professionals to focus on higher-value strategic work. Cost Reduction: By automating repetitive tasks, law firms can significantly lower operational costs, potentially leading to more affordable legal services for clients. Accuracy and Consistency: AI systems can identify patterns and extract information with a level of precision and consistency that is challenging for human review, minimizing errors and improving the quality of legal output. Scalability: AI tools can handle an ever-increasing volume of work without proportional increases in headcount, making them ideal for growing firms or large corporate legal departments. Unlike many AI companies that prioritize lean teams, Harvey AI is taking a distinctive approach by rapidly expanding its workforce. The company currently employs 340 people and plans to double that number with the fresh capital. This aggressive hiring strategy suggests a dual focus: not only refining its core legal AI offerings but also strategically diversifying. A significant portion of the new hires will be dedicated to developing AI products for professional services beyond legal, specifically mentioning tax accounting. This expansion signals Harvey AI’s ambition to become a broader AI solutions provider for professional services, tapping into even larger markets and reinforcing its long-term growth potential. The Impact of Legal AI on Traditional Professional Services The rise of Legal AI is not merely an incremental improvement; it represents a fundamental shift in how professional services operate. For centuries, legal work has been synonymous with extensive manual research, meticulous document scrutiny, and intricate drafting. Harvey AI, along with other innovators in the space, is fundamentally altering this paradigm. Its AI solutions are already assisting 337 legal clients, empowering lawyers to perform their duties with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Imagine the time saved when an AI can instantly cross-reference thousands of precedents or draft initial versions of complex contracts based on specific parameters. The applications of AI in legal and other professional services are vast and transformative: Document Review and Discovery: AI can rapidly sift through millions of documents to identify relevant information for litigation, mergers, or compliance, significantly reducing discovery costs and time. Contract Analysis and Management: AI can analyze contracts for specific clauses, risks, or compliance issues, and even automate the generation of contract drafts, ensuring consistency and adherence to legal standards. Legal Research: Advanced AI models can process and summarize vast legal databases, providing lawyers with precise answers to complex legal questions much faster than traditional methods. Predictive Analytics: AI can analyze past case outcomes and judicial behaviors to provide insights into potential litigation outcomes, helping firms strategize more effectively. Harvey AI’s strategic move to extend its AI capabilities to areas like tax accounting further highlights the pervasive impact of AI on professional services. Tax accounting, like law, is heavily reliant on processing large volumes of data, interpreting complex regulations, and ensuring compliance. By applying its AI expertise to this domain, Harvey AI is poised to replicate its success in legal tech, potentially revolutionizing how financial professionals manage intricate tax laws and financial records. This expansion strategy positions Harvey AI not just as a legal tech leader but as a significant player in the broader professional services automation market, offering a glimpse into a future where AI is an indispensable tool across all specialized industries. Navigating the Competitive Landscape: Insights from Venture Capital The rapid ascent of Harvey AI naturally brings its competitive landscape into focus. While Harvey is a relatively young company at three years old, it operates alongside established players in the legal tech sector. Competitors like 10-year-old Ironclad and 17-year-old Clio have already carved out significant market shares, with Clio itself having raised a substantial $300 million round at a $3 billion valuation last year. These older startups demonstrate the long-term viability and growth potential within legal technology. However, Harvey AI’s accelerated growth trajectory suggests it possesses a distinct competitive edge, likely rooted in its cutting-edge application of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) to legal challenges. The role of Venture Capital in this dynamic environment is crucial. Firms like Kleiner Perkins, Coatue, and Sequoia are not just providing capital; they are offering strategic guidance, industry connections, and validation. Their investment decisions are based on rigorous due diligence, evaluating a startup’s technological innovation, market fit, scalability, and leadership team. For Harvey AI, the successive funding rounds from such prestigious investors indicate strong confidence in its ability to outperform or differentiate itself in a competitive market. Venture capitalists are actively seeking out companies that can disrupt traditional industries, and Harvey AI clearly fits this profile. Despite the immense opportunities, the legal tech sector, like any rapidly evolving industry, faces its share of challenges. These include: Data Privacy and Security: Handling sensitive legal and financial data requires robust security measures and strict adherence to privacy regulations. Ethical AI Development: Ensuring AI models are unbiased, transparent, and used ethically in critical legal contexts is paramount. Integration with Legacy Systems: Many established law firms and corporations use outdated systems, making seamless integration of new AI tools a complex task. User Adoption: Overcoming resistance to change among legal professionals and ensuring intuitive user interfaces are essential for widespread adoption. Harvey AI’s ability to secure substantial funding and rapidly expand its client base suggests it is effectively navigating these challenges, building trust, and delivering tangible value to its users. Understanding the Dynamics of AI Valuation in Today’s Market The astonishing jump in AI valuation , from $3 billion to $5 billion in just four months for Harvey AI, is a clear indicator of the current market’s fervent appetite for artificial intelligence companies. This rapid appreciation reflects several key factors driving valuations in the contemporary AI landscape. Firstly, the sheer transformative potential of AI across virtually every industry is undeniable. Investors are betting on technologies that can fundamentally reshape workflows, create new markets, and unlock unprecedented efficiencies. Harvey AI’s annualized run-rate revenue reaching $75 million in April, up from $50 million earlier in the year, further validates its strong product-market fit and revenue-generating capabilities, providing a tangible basis for its soaring valuation. What drives such high valuations in the AI sector? Disruptive Innovation: Companies that introduce genuinely novel approaches to long-standing problems, like automating complex legal tasks, command premium valuations. Scalability: AI solutions, once developed, often have immense scalability, meaning they can serve a vast number of clients with relatively low marginal costs. Talent Acquisition: The ability to attract and retain top AI talent is a significant competitive advantage, and high valuations provide the capital to do so. First-Mover Advantage/Market Leadership: Being a leader or early innovator in a nascent but high-potential market segment can lead to outsized returns. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborations with major industry players or technology providers (like the implicit connection to OpenAI through its Startup Fund investment) can significantly boost a company’s perceived value. The current investment climate is characterized by an ‘AI gold rush,’ where venture capital firms are aggressively deploying capital into promising AI ventures. This environment, while exciting, also brings scrutiny. High valuations place immense pressure on companies to continue delivering exponential growth and to demonstrate a clear path to profitability. For Harvey AI, the path forward involves not only deepening its presence in legal tech but also successfully executing its expansion into new professional service verticals like tax accounting. The company’s ability to attract top-tier talent and consistently increase its revenue run-rate suggests it is well-positioned to meet these expectations and continue to shape the future of AI in professional services. The ongoing success of companies like Harvey AI serves as a powerful testament to the transformative power of AI and the strategic foresight of the investors backing this technological revolution. Harvey AI’s remarkable journey from a $3 billion to a $5 billion valuation in just four months stands as a compelling narrative of success in the burgeoning AI sector. Fuelled by significant investments from leading venture capital firms, the company is rapidly expanding its footprint, not only solidifying its position in legal automation but also strategically venturing into new professional service domains like tax accounting. Its aggressive headcount growth and impressive revenue run-rate underscore a robust business model and a clear vision for the future.

Apart from the two networks, Solana, Cardano, Basic Attention Token, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Ethereum users will also get the token. The zero-knowledge proofs privacy blockchain with connections to Cardano disclosed this in a post , stating that the distribution process is designed to be fair and inclusive. Those who have held at least $100 worth of the native tokens across the listed blockchain network before Midnight’s snapshot can claim the tokens. Interestingly, Cardano has already taken some snapshots of random wallets across the eight different blockchain networks on the 11th of June, 2025, ensuring a wide distribution. This was confirmed in a short video on X by Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who said, “The snapshot’s already been taken.” This marks the beginning of arguably one of the most significant multi-chain airdrops in crypto history, with over 37 million wallets expected to benefit from this largesse. The token prices will be based on the rates displayed on CoinMarketCap when the snapshots are taken. This is a security measure to prevent unwanted bot activities and Sybil attacks, ensuring a fair distribution and the safety of the process. According to the whitepaper, the NIGHT tokens will be shared gradually in 3 stages. The first stage, the Glacier drop, will see qualified users claim their full tokens within a 60-day window. Then, there will be a 30-day period when those people can claim the rest of the tokens by engaging in small computing tasks such as validating transactions or participating in the network’s consensus mechanism. Lastly, the Scavenger Mine is the final phase, where those who missed out on earlier claims but are eligible can get back a fraction of their original allocation. Participants can reclaim their tokens in this phase by performing specific tasks, similar to small computing tasks, within a given timeframe. Unclaimed tokens after this phase will go to the Midnight treasury. Cardano holders to get most of the airdrop supply According to information from the released whitepaper, there is a cumulative supply of 24 billion NIGHT tokens. Out of the 24 billion tokens, Cardano participants will receive 50% or 12 billion NIGHT. Bitcoin holders will also get 20% of the supply, totaling 4.8 billion tokens. Meanwhile, the rest of the supply will be distributed equally (according to CoinMarketCap Data) among holders of the remaining eligible assets, including XRP, ETH, BAT, BNB, SOL, and AVAX. This means XRP users will get 1.4 billion NIGHT tokens. What individuals will get will depend on their holdings during the snapshot. Thus, ADA and Bitcoin whales eligible for the airdrop will likely get the most NIGHT tokens. Unsurprisingly, ADA and other altcoins have seen a sizable jump in value over the last 24 hours. Eligible airdrop participants will start getting tokens in July Meanwhile, Midnight stated that participants can claim their NIGHT token allocation for the next two months, starting in July. Once this phase has ended, the second phase, Scavenger Mine, will start immediately and last for 30 days, while the Lost and Found phase is set to last for four years. However, all claimed tokens in the first two phases will be locked for a period, with vesting happening at 25% per unlock every 90 days for 360 days. This scheduled unlock has been classified as a Thawing and Redemption Period, and likely implemented to prevent immediate dumping on the part of the claimants. In the next four years, 25% of the claimed tokens will be released across four installments for claimants. Interestingly, claimants can either claim all their allotted tokens using the vesting schedule or wait till the end of the 360 days and claim at once. The claim portal will remain open for another 90 days after the last vesting to allow for redemptions for three extra months. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to a new press release , ProCap Financial, renamed ProCap BTC after it merged with Columbus Circle Capital I, has acquired $387 million in Bitcoin to actively manage a new digital asset treasury. The firm aims to raise as much as $1 billion to deploy the funds into various crypto-related revenue strategies that include lending, derivatives, and structured finance. According to the announcement, the Bitcoin purchase is part of an ongoing program that aims to provide investors with immediate exposure to the flagship crypto asset. In a new interview with CNBC, Pompliano, an outspoken BTC bull, lays out his vision for the firm. “We want to build the leading bitcoin-native financial services company – like a traditional Wall Street firm, but on top of a Bitcoin balance sheet instead of dollars… The goal is to look and feel like a traditional financial institution. That resonates very differently with capital allocators… Many companies don’t care about the cost of capital. We do. We’re traditional capital allocators — we care about building a sustainable business that generates cash flow.” BTC is worth $105,329 at time of writing, up 4% on the day.

According to the firm’s data, the majority of the supply of some leading cryptocurrencies is currently in the money. According to Santiment's data, the percentage of total supply that is in profit is as follows: Bitcoin (BTC): 94.5% Ethereum (ETH): 88.7% XRP: 65.1% Dogecoin (DOGE): 64.7% Chainlink (LINK): 59.4% Cardano (ADA): 46.5% Related News: This Altcoin's Price Experienced a Sudden Surge Today Following the Latest News - It Stood Out Positively in the Market Santiment notes that this metric shows how much of each asset’s circulating supply is currently in profit relative to the average on-chain purchase price. With 94.5% of Bitcoin’s supply in profit, it suggests that the majority of investors are currently in positive territory. According to Santiment, this indicates that market confidence is quite high, but it also points to a short-term risk of “overvaluation.” “When 19 out of every 20 BTC is in profit, the probability of investors realizing profits increases,” the company warned. On the other hand, the situation is reversed for coins like Cardano. Only 46.5% of ADA is in profit, meaning more than half of investors are currently at a loss. According to the analytics company, this shows that current prices are not satisfactory for the majority of investors, while at the same time it suggests that ADA may be relatively undervalued. *This is not investment advice.

Among the intriguing options, three coins stand out with potential for growth: SEI , JasmyCoin , and Jupiter . These digital assets offer unique opportunities and could be key players in the next market surge. Sei (SEI) Price Surge vs. Long-Term Decline: Key Support and Resistance Sei recorded a sharp 54.21% gain over the past week and a 20.44% rise in the last month. A 40.62% drop over six months highlights pronounced volatility in its price action. The coin’s performance reflects a mix of short-term momentum clashing with longer-term bearish trends, revealing a market that has shifted rapidly between bullish bursts and extended periods of decline. Trading within a price range of $0.162 to $0.251, Sei faces immediate resistance near $0.307 and a higher hurdle at $0.396, while its nearest support is positioned at $0.130 with a second support at $0.042. Technical indicators suggest buyers are in control in the short term as the strong weekly surge contrasts with longer-term losses. An RSI reading of 71.73 shows overbought conditions, hinting that gains might need to consolidate. The moving average recommendation indicates bullish sentiment, though traders should look for entry points within established support and resistance levels, watching for potential pullbacks. JasmyCoin: Past Downturn with Key Levels for Trading Strategies JasmyCoin experienced a marked decline in recent periods, with a nearly 25% drop over the past month and a staggering 66% decrease in value over the last six months. Price movements have been choppy, reflecting significant volatility and a persistent bearish sentiment. The downward trend indicates limited momentum, with the market showing caution as the asset struggled to maintain its value. Historical performance highlights a pattern of steep losses, where even small recoveries are quickly followed by renewed pressures. This situation illustrates a market sentiment that has not fully recovered, emphasizing the need for careful risk management when considering positions in this coin. The current price trades between $0.01282 and $0.01968, with critical technical levels in view. A solid support level stands near $0.01, while resistance is around $0.02396 and $0.03, with a deeper support at $0.00338. The RSI at 46.091 indicates limited bullish strength, and momentum indicators reveal subdued buying pressure. A slight drop of 0.60% over the past week suggests bears remain in control, making a breakout above resistance levels a potential signal for bullish investors. Traders might consider buying near the support level with strict stop-losses while waiting for confirmation of a reversal before targeting the nearest resistance. Jupiter (JUP): Recent Downtrend and Key Level Insights Over the last month, Jupiter experienced a sharp drop of about 26.04%, reflecting a period of downside pressure. Over the past six months, the decline reached nearly 55.11%, marking a prolonged bearish phase. The price action oscillated between a high close to $0.6540 and a dip touching as low as $0.0173. These swings emphasize the volatile nature of investor sentiment, with recent behavior carving a challenging landscape for momentum. Price adjustments indicate that enthusiasm has cooled, and traders appear cautious amid broader market uncertainty. Currently, Jupiter trades within a range from approximately $0.3987 to $0.6540, with key resistance near $0.7832 and support around $0.2726. A secondary resistance level at $1.0385 and a second support at $0.0173 help define a broader trading channel. The Relative Strength Index at 43.37 shows a market that is neither overbought nor oversold. Bearish indicators imply that sellers have a slight edge in influencing price movement. Recent minor declines further underscore trader caution. Trading ideas may focus on positions between support and resistance levels, with bullish players seeking reversal above immediate resistance and bearish traders considering short positions near support. Conclusion SEI , JASMY , and JUP present interesting opportunities for investors as the market seeks stability. SEI stands out with its focus on efficiency and security. JASMY aims to give users control over their data, making it attractive for privacy-conscious investors. JUP focuses on decentralization and aims to offer a more inclusive ecosystem.

MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly being recognized by analysts as a hidden gem, drawing the attention of Ethereum and XRP holders while Polkadot faces technical hurdles. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity Meets Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is distinguishing itself with a fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, a fully audited smart contract, and a community-first, VC-free structure. The project’s presale has already raised over $10 million, with every stage selling out quickly—clear signs of surging demand and investor conviction. Early backers have seen gains exceeding 5,500%, and analysts now project that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver some of the highest returns in this cycle , thanks to its blend of meme appeal and disciplined economics. Ethereum and XRP: Rotating Toward Early-Stage Upside Ethereum continues to anchor DeFi and smart contracts, but as its growth matures, ETH investors are seeking new opportunities that mirror its early momentum. XRP, meanwhile, is consolidating between $2.15 and $2.50, with traders watching for a breakout but increasingly diversifying into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper gains. Polkadot: On Watch, But Facing Resistance Polkadot’s ecosystem remains robust, yet DOT is currently battling resistance and slower price action. As a result, some Polkadot holders are reallocating to projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, attracted by its rapid adoption and ground-floor potential. Conclusion With its transparent governance, viral momentum, and analyst-backed upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stepping into the spotlight as crypto’s hidden gem for 2025—making it a must-watch for those seeking the next major altcoin breakout.

According to popular XRP advocate JackTheRippler, the next major move for XRP is between $5 and $10. In a recent post on X, he confidently stated, “Next stop: $5–$10 per XRP,” reinforcing optimism that the asset is nearing a major breakout. Technical Indicators Point to a Breakout JackTheRippler’s projection is grounded in technical analysis. XRP has just completed a multi-year triangle formation, a well-known pattern that often signals the start of a strong price movement. This triangle, which has been forming since 2021, reflects tightening price action and growing buying pressure. Now that XRP has broken out of the pattern, the stage is set for a bullish continuation, with short-term targets in the $3–$5 range and extended projections approaching $10. Other analysts support this view . If the price breaks above key resistance at $2.99, technical indicators suggest upside potential to $5.85 or even $8, based on Fibonacci extensions. Meanwhile, a daily close above $2.34 could confirm the breakout and unlock further gains. Next stop $5-$10 per #XRP . pic.twitter.com/rdKGYbsHml — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 24, 2025 Institutional Demand and Legal Clarity Fuel Optimism Beyond the charts, XRP’s bullish outlook is supported by growing institutional interest and improving regulatory clarity. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service continues to gain traction globally, boosting real-world utility for XRP. On the legal front, both Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are currently awaiting Judge Analisa Torres’ decision on a proposed settlement. While the case has cast a long shadow over XRP’s price for years, a favorable ruling could remove one of the final obstacles to broader institutional adoption. Adding to the momentum is growing speculation around a spot XRP ETF . If approved, such a fund would open the door for institutional capital to flow into XRP at scale. Analysts believe an ETF approval could significantly accelerate XRP’s price movement and help realize JackTheRippler’s $5–$10 prediction. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Positioning and Near-Term Outlook XRP’s current price action suggests strong accumulation. Key support levels sit between $2.22 and $2.26, while $2.34 marks the next critical resistance. A clear breakout above this level would likely confirm the beginning of a new bullish phase. The broader landscape also favors XRP. Ripple’s alignment with global ISO 20022 payment standards, set to take effect in July 2025, positions XRP as a key player in the evolving financial system. As regulatory clarity improves and real-world use cases expand, XRP continues to transition from a speculative token to a cornerstone of digital finance. While the path to $10 will require strong follow-through and ideal conditions, JackTheRippler’s forecast is not unfounded. It reflects a growing consensus that XRP is on the verge of a major move, one that could redefine its position in the market. If key resistance levels fall, XRP’s next stop may indeed be the $5–$10 zone. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Amazon’s latest stride, the Alexa Plus , is demonstrating the incredible pace of AI adoption, now reaching over a million users in its early access phase. For those tracking the forefront of digital transformation, this development signals a pivotal moment in how we interact with technology daily, potentially paving the way for more integrated and intelligent digital ecosystems. What is Alexa Plus and Why Does it Matter? Amazon has steadily expanded invites to its upgraded digital assistant, Alexa Plus , a service powered by advanced generative AI . Initially announced in February, this enhanced assistant has now reached an impressive milestone, with over a million users gaining access. While not yet publicly available, Amazon is meticulously working through its waitlist, providing early access to customers who signed up to test this innovative service. This broad rollout signifies Amazon’s serious commitment to redefining consumer AI experiences, aiming to make digital interactions more natural and personalized. The Evolution of Amazon AI: From Clunky to Conversational For years, Amazon’s original Alexa-powered Echo devices pioneered the smart home market. However, despite its widespread adoption, Alexa struggled to evolve into a significant revenue-generating business. More recently, with the emergence of sophisticated generative AI services like ChatGPT, the original Alexa began to feel limited and less intuitive. Amazon AI recognized this gap and developed Alexa Plus to address these shortcomings. This new iteration aims to overcome the previous constraints, offering a more natural, personalized, and robust interaction experience. It represents a strategic pivot for Amazon, striving to create a monetizable consumer AI experience that truly stands out in the competitive landscape. Transforming Your Smart Home with Alexa Plus One of the core strengths of the new Alexa Plus lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate with and enhance your smart home AI experience. Gone are the days of rigid commands; users can now interact with the digital assistant using more natural language. Imagine simply saying, “It’s too cold in here,” and having Alexa intuitively adjust your smart thermostat. This intuitive interaction extends to various functionalities: Effortless Routine Creation: Simplify your daily tasks by easily setting up complex routines. Enhanced Security: Search across your Ring camera footage with simple voice commands. Dynamic Conversations: Interrupt or pivot the conversation with the assistant without breaking the flow. Personalized Preferences: Alexa Plus remembers your likes, from favorite songs to recipes, tailoring interactions to your unique preferences. Beyond Commands: The Power of Your New Digital Assistant The generative AI component elevates Alexa Plus far beyond a simple voice command device, transforming it into a truly intelligent digital assistant . It can perform a wide array of complex tasks that previously required manual effort or specialized applications. For instance, Alexa Plus can: Summarize long emails you share with the service. Create unique bedtime stories on demand. Generate quizzes from study guides. Develop personalized travel itineraries. Provide concise summaries of your smart home activity. Answer complex questions, much like a sophisticated AI chatbot. Beyond information retrieval, the assistant can also help you take direct actions. Initial partners like OpenTable, Ticketmaster, Uber Eats, Tripadvisor, Grubhub, Yelp, Priceline, Viator, Thumbtack, Atom, and Fodor’s enable Alexa Plus to assist with buying concert tickets, booking dinner reservations, and notifying you when items you are watching go on sale. Early Access and Future Outlook During its early access phase, Alexa Plus is available for free. After its public launch, it will remain free for Prime customers, while non-Prime users can access the service for $19.99 per month. Initially, Alexa Plus is accessible on Echo Show 8, 10, 15, or 21 devices in the U.S., with plans to expand to more Echo, Fire TV, and Fire tablet users over time. As of May 2025, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reported over 100,000 users, a number that has since surged to over a million. Early user reviews are mixed, with some praising its advanced capabilities compared to competitors like Siri, while others note it is still undergoing refinement. The rapid expansion of Alexa Plus to over a million users marks a significant stride for Amazon in the consumer AI space. By leveraging powerful generative AI , Amazon is not only attempting to reclaim its position in the smart assistant market but also to create a truly monetizable AI experience. As this innovative digital assistant continues to evolve, it promises to reshape how we interact with our technology, making our homes smarter and our daily lives more efficient. The journey from a basic voice assistant to a comprehensive, intelligent companion highlights the transformative potential of AI, impacting everything from simple daily tasks to complex personal management.

In an interview on the WTFinance podcast, Zeberg says the markets are primed for an explosive rally over the short term. “I think the blow-off top is still going and you see it in various markets around the world… actually [markets] have seen new all-time highs after everybody kind of dismissed that in April, we could see that. Now we are seeing it.” According to the economist and macro strategist, the S&P 500 index could go up by around 13% from the current level. “I still think that things will be moving on like what I’ve been expecting in terms of a 6,800 top in the S&P [500] as a minimum.” As of Tuesday’s market close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,025 points. Although Zeberg forecasts rallies in the stock market, he cautions that a recession is likely to follow as the economy shows signs of gradual erosion. “We’re getting closer and closer [to a recession]. There are more and more signs now that the deterioration is going through. It’s really in the housing market that is the worst in the US. And we’re starting to see some signs as well in the real economy and in the labor market as well.

Stage 1 price: $0.00355, with an expected listing price of $0.03. Early investors can earn 10x returns just by participating in the presale. In addition, staking rewards are set to be highly attractive, with early-bird staking bonuses for the first three months, including dynamic APYs reaching up to 50% for committed investors. Anso’s tiered staking program ensures long-term value for those who lock up their tokens. Real-World Utility: Not Just a Speculative Asset Unlike speculative assets, Anso Finance is rooted in real-world applications. The upcoming Anso Card will enable seamless spending of $ANSO tokens for everyday purchases through Apple Pay and Google Pay, offering a real use-case beyond just holding a token. Anso’s ecosystem also includes crypto-backed loans, savings (staking), and asset tokenization, allowing users to invest in real estate and luxury goods by owning tokenized shares of these assets. This Real-World Asset (RWA) integration makes Anso a true utility coin, unlike XRP, which serves primarily as a payment bridge for financial institutions and Solana, which is more focused on high-speed DeFi transactions but lacks a fully integrated, user-focused ecosystem. Anso, on the other hand, allows everyday users to earn rewards, make payments, and invest in real-world assets – all within one ecosystem. Security and Transparency Anso Finance is built with investor protection as a priority. Key security measures include locked liquidity to prevent rug pulls, an immutable smart contract ensuring no changes to tokenomics, and multi-signature governance for fund control. These efforts ensure a transparent, secure platform that builds trust within its community. With open-source code and third-party audits, Anso guarantees that no hidden surprises will undermine its growth. XRP and Solana: Great, but Anso Has a Unique Advantage XRP is a payment-focused network with limited adoption for retail users. While it excels in cross-border payments, it doesn’t provide significant opportunities for everyday use or passive income like Anso does with staking and real-world applications. Solana, although renowned for high throughput and low fees, is mainly focused on the tech infrastructure. Anso, built on Solana, leverages its speed and scalability but adds a user-driven ecosystem designed for real-world financial services payments, staking, and tokenized assets creating a deeper value proposition. Anso also offers significant early-stage growth potential: while XRP and Solana have already reached substantial market caps, Anso remains a micro-cap poised to capture the attention of investors as it develops its platform. Conclusion: A Bullish Outlook for Anso Finance Anso Finance isn’t just another crypto project. It’s a comprehensive financial ecosystem built for real-world utility, security, and long-term growth. With a promising presale, strong staking rewards, and groundbreaking real-world applications such as the Anso Card and RWA integration, Anso is positioned to outperform giants like XRP and Solana in the coming years. Retail investors looking for a utility-driven, secure, and high-growth cryptocurrency should pay attention to Anso Finance as it emerges as a major player in the next crypto bull run.

During early June, Aave achieved the $300 milestone for the first time in four months, leading market participants to anticipate a potential push toward $350. However, Aave experienced weakening momentum that drove the token to a session low of $213 on June 22. Source: Cryptonews This latest recovery above $250, reinforced by a substantial 53% increase in trading volume, has restored market confidence in Aave’s trajectory. Aave Growing Dominance Sees It Command $24B of $110B Total DeFi Market Share Beyond renewed trading interest, Aave’s expanding dominance within the DeFi ecosystem has strengthened investor conviction in the protocol’s fundamentals. According to DeFiLlama , Aave commands $24 billion of the total $110 billion in assets secured across DeFi protocols, representing over 20% of the entire DeFi total value locked (TVL). Aave’s lending operations alone account for approximately 40% of all DeFi activity on the flagship blockchain network. Source: DeFiLlama Excluding stablecoin providers Tether and Circle, Aave stands among Ethereum’s top revenue-generating protocols, generating over $586 million in annualized fees and $84.8 million in annual revenue. Aave maintains clear market leadership within the lending protocol category with more than $16 billion in outstanding borrowed assets. Recently, Stani Kulechov, founder of Aave Labs, disclosed that Aave’s comprehensive on-chain liquidity infrastructure, which delivers transparent lending rates for stablecoins, has been embraced as the industry standard for lending and borrowing operations in traditional finance (TradFi). These developments have driven both retail and institutional adoption of the Aave protocol ecosystem. For instance, Base, the prominent Ethereum Layer-2 blockchain operated by Coinbase, achieved a major milestone of 500,000 depositors on the Aave platform. Aave reached 500k users on @base . https://t.co/StezTG7hFh — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) June 16, 2025 Additionally, Veda Labs, a DeFi infrastructure provider for financial applications, exceeded $1 billion in deposited capital through Aave protocol integration. Aave Unleashes V4 Architecture as it becomes the Only DeFi Protocol with $1B+ on four Major Chains Aave has strategically positioned its technology for universal accessibility and adoption. The recently unveiled Aave V4 architecture allows developers to access the primary Liquidity Hub through established credit facilities. Aave V4 is the next-generation onchain lending infrastructure with a unique hub-and-spoke architecture. https://t.co/bm8P0I64Lw — Stani.eth (@StaniKulechov) June 16, 2025 This framework empowers builders to construct specialized lending markets while leveraging DeFi’s most substantial liquidity network effects. This innovation has expanded Aave’s presence across multiple blockchain ecosystems. The lending protocol is now the sole DeFi platform maintaining at least $1 billion TVL across four major networks: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Avalanche. Prominent cryptocurrency key opinion leader Ansem demonstrated via social media that Aave ranks among the strongest performing cryptocurrencies in Q2 2025, delivering a 62% gain during this period. Q2 crypto top performers $HYPE : 180% Fartcoin: 137% $WIF : 97% $AAVE : 62% $SEI : 59% pic.twitter.com/0oNq548suw — Ansem (@blknoiz06) June 24, 2025 He shared a comparative analysis demonstrating this growth relative to other high-performers, including Hyperliquid and FARTCOIN, which achieved triple-digit returns. A seasoned altcoin investor with over a decade of market experience observed that Aave’s current price action mirrors the 200% rally the token experienced in 2024. This analyst projected a potential 168% breakout targeting $600, contingent upon favorable alignment of bullish technical patterns. Technical Analysis: AAVE $271 Resistance Could Trigger 35% Rally to $364 The AAVE/USDT daily chart analysis reveals a recent recovery from key support at $244, with current price action stabilizing around $259.48. This rebound is developing just above the 9-day Simple Moving Average ($253.65), suggesting renewed short-term bullish momentum is emerging. However, immediate resistance exists at $271, a key level requiring penetration to validate uptrend continuation. The MACD indicator remains positioned below the zero line but displays early upward curvature, indicating diminishing bearish momentum with potential for an imminent bullish crossover indicator. Source: TradingView Should bulls successfully breach the $271 resistance barrier, the subsequent target zone ranges between $350.47 and $364.68, representing approximately 35% upside potential from current price levels. Failure to overcome the $271 threshold could trigger another pullback toward the $244 support area for retesting. Overall, the technical setup maintains cautious bullish characteristics, dependent upon a decisive breakout above the $271 resistance level.

A recent statement from Chicago Federal Reserve Chair Austan Goolsbee has sent ripples through the economic landscape, suggesting a potential shift in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy . He indicated that if the influence of trade policy on the economy begins to fade, the U.S. central bank should consider continuing its path of interest rate cuts . This insight from a key Fed official offers a glimpse into the complex considerations guiding future economic decisions and could significantly impact everything from your mortgage rates to the broader market sentiment, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Let’s dive deeper into what this means for you and the broader economic picture. Federal Reserve’s Guiding Hand: Decoding Goolsbee’s Insights Austan Goolsbee, as the Chair of the Chicago Federal Reserve, holds a significant position within the central bank’s decision-making framework, particularly as a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). His comments are not just casual observations; they often reflect internal discussions and potential directions the Federal Reserve might take. Goolsbee’s recent statement, as reported by JinSe Finance, hinges on a crucial condition: the diminishing impact of trade policy. But what exactly does ‘trade policy impact’ entail? Historically, trade policies, such as tariffs, import quotas, and international trade agreements, have a profound effect on global supply chains, manufacturing costs, and ultimately, consumer prices. When Goolsbee speaks of their impact fading, he’s likely referring to a scenario where: Reduced Supply Chain Disruptions: Fewer bottlenecks and more efficient movement of goods globally, leading to lower input costs for businesses. Stabilized Trade Relations: Less uncertainty from trade disputes between major economies, encouraging more predictable international commerce. Lower Inflationary Pressures: As import costs decrease and supply becomes more abundant, the upward pressure on prices from trade-related factors lessens. This nuanced view suggests that the Fed is keenly observing external factors beyond traditional domestic economic indicators. A stable global trade environment could provide the necessary room for the Fed to focus more on its dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and stable prices, potentially paving the way for more accommodative monetary conditions. The Path to Interest Rate Cuts: Why Now? The prospect of further interest rate cuts is always a hot topic, especially for investors and consumers alike. The Federal Reserve uses interest rates as a primary tool to manage economic growth and inflation. When rates are cut, borrowing becomes cheaper, encouraging businesses to invest and expand, and consumers to spend, thereby stimulating economic activity. Goolsbee’s suggestion links this directly to the fading influence of trade policy, indicating a potential shift in the primary drivers of inflation. For the Fed to consider cutting rates, it typically looks for signs that inflation is sustainably moving towards its 2% target, and that the labor market remains robust. If trade-related inflationary pressures, which might have been seen as temporary or external, are indeed receding, it provides a clearer picture for the Fed’s policymakers. Here’s why the timing could be opportune: Inflation Moderation: If global trade normalization leads to lower import costs and reduced price pressures, it helps bring overall inflation down towards the Fed’s target. Economic Soft Landing: Rate cuts can help the economy achieve a ‘soft landing’ – slowing inflation without triggering a recession – by providing a boost to demand. Addressing Restrictive Policy: The Fed has maintained relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. If the inflation fight is showing progress, these rates might be considered overly restrictive, risking an unnecessary slowdown. The decision to cut rates is never taken lightly and involves a careful assessment of a multitude of economic data points. The emphasis on trade policy highlights the intricate web of global and domestic factors that influence the Fed’s strategy. Navigating Monetary Policy: A Balancing Act Understanding the Monetary Policy of the Federal Reserve is key to grasping the broader economic landscape. The Fed’s primary tools include setting the federal funds rate, conducting open market operations, and influencing reserve requirements. Each decision is a delicate balancing act, aiming to steer the economy without causing undue volatility. Goolsbee’s comments underscore the dynamic nature of this policy-making process. The challenge for the Fed lies in anticipating future economic conditions while reacting to current data. A premature rate cut could reignite inflation, while delaying too long could stifle economic growth. This is where external factors like trade policy become critical. If these factors are no longer exerting significant inflationary pressure, the Fed can adjust its focus to domestic demand and labor market conditions more directly. Consider the key factors that typically influence the Fed’s monetary policy decisions: Factor Description Implication for Rate Cuts Inflation Data Consumer Price Index (CPI), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Sustained decline towards 2% target supports cuts. Labor Market Unemployment rate, job growth, wage inflation Strong but cooling labor market could allow cuts without overheating. Economic Growth GDP figures, consumer spending, business investment Signs of slowdown without inflation could prompt cuts. Global Economic Conditions International trade, geopolitical events, foreign central bank actions Stable global environment, fading trade impact, supports cuts. Financial Stability Market volatility, credit conditions, asset bubbles Ensuring cuts don’t create new financial risks. The Fed’s communication is equally important. Forward guidance and speeches from officials like Goolsbee help prepare markets and the public for potential shifts, reducing uncertainty and volatility. What This Means for the US Economy A shift towards interest rate cuts , influenced by easing trade policy impacts, carries significant implications for the broader US Economy . Lower interest rates generally translate to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, acting as a stimulus for economic activity. Let’s break down the potential effects: For Consumers: Mortgages and Loans: Expect potentially lower interest rates on new mortgages, auto loans, and personal loans, making borrowing more affordable. This could stimulate housing markets and big-ticket purchases. Credit Card Debt: While less direct, lower benchmark rates can eventually lead to slightly lower variable rates on credit cards, offering some relief to those carrying balances. Savings Accounts: The flip side is that interest earned on savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) might also decrease, prompting savers to seek alternative investments. For Businesses: Investment and Expansion: Cheaper credit encourages companies to borrow for capital expenditures, research and development, and expansion projects, potentially leading to job creation. Stock Market: Lower interest rates can make equities more attractive compared to bonds, potentially boosting stock valuations as corporate earnings prospects improve and discount rates fall. Small Businesses: Easier access to affordable loans can be a lifeline for small and medium-sized enterprises, fostering local economic growth. Potential Challenges: Renewed Inflationary Pressures: If rate cuts are too aggressive or the economy proves more resilient than expected, there’s a risk of reigniting inflation, undoing the Fed’s hard-won progress. Asset Bubbles: Prolonged periods of low interest rates can sometimes lead to excessive speculation and asset bubbles in real estate or financial markets. Dollar Depreciation: Lower interest rates can weaken the U.S. dollar, making imports more expensive but U.S. exports more competitive. Overall, the scenario Goolsbee outlined points towards a potentially more favorable environment for growth, provided the inflation outlook remains contained and trade-related pressures continue to ease. This could translate into a more stable and predictable economic climate, which is generally positive for all market participants, including those in the crypto space who often look for macroeconomic stability. Inflation Outlook: A Crucial Variable At the heart of the Federal Reserve’s decision-making process is the Inflation Outlook . The Fed aims for a 2% average inflation target, believing this level supports healthy economic growth without eroding purchasing power too quickly. Goolsbee’s focus on fading trade policy impact directly relates to this, as trade dynamics can significantly influence the cost of goods and services. How does trade policy influence inflation? When tariffs are imposed, or supply chains are disrupted, the cost of imported goods increases, which can then be passed on to consumers. Conversely, if these pressures subside, the cost of inputs for businesses decreases, potentially leading to lower consumer prices or at least alleviating upward pressure. The Fed’s assessment of whether current inflation trends are ‘transitory’ (temporary) or ‘persistent’ is critical. Currently, the Fed has seen progress in bringing down inflation from its multi-decade highs. However, the path has been bumpy, and service sector inflation, particularly, has remained sticky. Goolsbee’s comments suggest that if the external, trade-related components of inflation continue to moderate, it gives the Fed more confidence that overall inflation is on a sustainable downward trajectory towards its target. This confidence is paramount for justifying future rate cuts. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Inflation Outlook: For Businesses: Monitor global supply chain indicators and trade policy developments. A stable trade environment could mean more predictable input costs and better long-term planning. For Consumers: Keep an eye on the Fed’s preferred inflation gauges (like the PCE index). Sustained declines could signal a more favorable borrowing environment for big purchases. For Investors: Understand that the Fed’s actions are heavily data-dependent. Positive inflation reports could reinforce the case for rate cuts, potentially boosting market sentiment. The interplay between trade policy, inflation, and the Fed’s response is complex, but Goolsbee’s remarks offer a hopeful sign that some of the external headwinds that contributed to recent inflationary spikes may be dissipating, clearing a path for more growth-oriented monetary policy. A Compelling Summary: What Lies Ahead? Chicago Federal Reserve Chair Austan Goolsbee’s recent statement provides a crucial insight into the evolving thought process within the Federal Reserve . His emphasis on the potential for interest rate cuts , contingent on the fading impact of trade policy, highlights a nuanced approach to managing the US economy . This perspective suggests that if external inflationary pressures, particularly those stemming from global trade dynamics, continue to wane, the Fed gains greater flexibility to ease its monetary policy . Such a move would aim to stimulate economic growth and support a ‘soft landing’ while still ensuring the inflation outlook remains firmly on track towards the 2% target. The implications are far-reaching. For consumers, it could mean more affordable borrowing. For businesses, it might unlock new opportunities for investment and expansion. For markets, including the dynamic cryptocurrency space, a more predictable and growth-supportive economic environment could foster greater stability and investor confidence. While challenges like the risk of renewed inflation or market volatility remain, Goolsbee’s comments inject a degree of cautious optimism. The path forward for the Federal Reserve will undoubtedly remain data-dependent, with close scrutiny on inflation trends, labor market conditions, and the ever-present influence of global trade. Keeping abreast of these developments will be essential for anyone looking to navigate the financial landscape effectively.

The service will cover roughly 65 square miles (168 square kilometers) and run from downtown through Buckhead to Capitol View. Uber plans to extend that range further as more of Waymo’s self-driving Jaguar I-PACE vehicles arrive on the platform. Earlier this year, Uber added an option in its app so riders could flag their interest in an autonomous ride. Even after choosing driverless cars, passengers will still see a prompt and can switch to a human-driven vehicle at any point before their trip begins. Uber and Waymo first teamed up in Phoenix in 2023 to offer both passenger trips and deliveries. In Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, Waymo also runs a direct-to-consumer app. B ut in Austin and now Atlanta, Uber is the exclusive way to summon Waymo’s all-electric SUVs. Outside the U.S., Uber also partners with China’s WeRide Inc. in Abu Dhabi, helping it reach an annual pace of about 1.5 million driverless trips for both riders and deliveries. Riders there have given Waymo trips an average score of 4.9 out of 5 stars, reflecting smooth pick-ups and safe drop-offs according to user reviews. Uber is testing its market potential amidst robotaxis competition Shares of Uber Technologies rose 8% on Tuesday after the company launched its first Waymo robotaxi service in Atlanta. For Uber, the success of this Atlanta launch could influence investor opinion. The company has forged more than a dozen autonomous-vehicle alliances around the globe. Uber says its popular app and its skill at matching riders with cars will bring in enough customers and money to cover the cost of self-driving cars. Waymo currently operates about 1,500 self-driving cars, but it will take time before that number rivals the pool of human drivers Uber can draw on in its biggest markets. Some analysts worry that if Waymo does not expand beyond Austin and Atlanta, Uber’s ambitions in the autonomous space could stall. As of now, around 100 Waymo vehicles are active on Uber in Austin. The companies expect to scale up to several hundred robotaxis serving both Austin and Atlanta over the next few years. This robotaxis competition is rising in Atlanta. Lyft Inc. plans to start its own autonomous service, with safety operators onboard, in partnership with Toyota-backed May Mobility Inc. as soon as this summer. Amazon’s Zoox Inc. has also been testing driverless vehicles around downtown streets. Meanwhile, rival Tesla opened its own self-driving taxi service in Austin on Sunday, charging a flat fee of $4.20 per trip. Each ride included an employee onboard for safety. Promoted heavily by CEO Elon Musk, the service is limited for now but marks Tesla’s entry into robotaxi hailing. Tesla’s stock jumped on the launch, climbing as much as 11% in Monday trading before closing up 8% at $348.68, trimming its losses for the year to just under 7%. Moreover, the launch has added 19 billion to Musk’s net worth, making him top the billionaires list.

ProCap joins a growing list of companies on the Nasdaq stockpiling the world’s largest and oldest cryptocurrency. ProCap’s Billion-Dollar Bet On Bitcoin According to a Tuesday announcement, ProCap bought 3,724 Bitcoins at an average price of $103,785. The Bitcoin stack, worth around $384 million as of press time, sits on the company’s balance sheet, offering future shareholders immediate exposure to the price of the alpha crypto. ProCap aims to invest up to $1 billion in Bitcoin once the special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction closes. On Monday, ProCap announced it had proposed a $1 billion merger with Columbus Circle Capital Corp, with the combined company to be called ProCap Financial, listing on Nasdaq. The move is part of an increasing trend of so-called crypto treasury firms that finance Bitcoin acquisitions through equity and debt sales, inspired by the success of Michael Saylor’s Strategy. The company revealed it raised over $750 million, pulling in roughly $517 million by offering preferred equity and an additional $225 million by selling convertible notes, in what was described as “the largest initial fundraise in history for a public bitcoin treasury company,” according to a press release on Monday. ProCap Joins Growing List Of Bitcoin-Buying Companies ProCap’s announcement comes amid a sharp rise in public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, including President Donald Trump’s media conglomerate, Trump Media’s $2.3 billion raise to purchase Bitcoin last month, and GameStop’s recent adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Globally, 136 public companies have bought 835,053 Bitcoin worth $85 billion, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. Strategy currently has the largest Bitcoin holdings of any company at 592,345 BTC worth $62.8 billion.

Shelby is designed to tap into Aptos ( APT ) to address the gap in existing decentralized infrastructure protocols, with its chain-agnostic architecture offering sub-second reads. Apart from millisecond settlement, Shelby ensures ease of access and monetization. On why they are building the new cloud-grade storage protocol, Jump Crypto wrote on X: “While blockchains today have mostly solved the ability to execute code, they cannot access large datasets. More importantly, they cannot SERVE large datasets at scale and speed. Hence, we are building Shelby.” You might also like: Chainlink and Mastercard partner to enable onchain crypto purchases web3’s value creation engine Shelby will power real-time web3 applications, with notable use cases including streaming, artificial intelligence inference, composable in-game assets, social dynamic NFTs, and decentralized physical infrastructure networks. “There is a large opportunity to unbundle large parts of the AWS bundle,” said Kyle Samani, managing partner at Multicoin Capital. “Ambitious swing here,” he added on X. Early contributors and collaborators include Metaplex, an NFT platform on Solana ( SOL ), Pipe Network, a decentralized content delivery network on Solana, and Story, the world’s IP blockchain. Others include Myco, DoubleZero, and Flashback Labs, across streaming, infra, and AI respectively. David Rhodus, founder of Permissionless Labs, a core contributor to the Pipe Network, also commented on the upcoming launch. “We’re proud to be among the first builders on Shelby because its global high performance storage network makes more data available for the Pipe Network to serve at high throughput. Our Point of Presence nodes will ensure a smoother user experience because our DePIN enabled footprint provides large coverage of last mile endpoints in the areas where Shelby doesn’t have connectivity.” Aptos will be Shelby’s early settlement layer, allowing for sub-second finality and high-throughput coordination, with real-time data access across any chain.

Just as a ceasefire between Iran and Israel was reportedly in effect, news emerged of Iran’s alleged firing of missiles at Israel, prompting an immediate and severe reaction from the Israeli defense minister. This development marks a perilous turn in an already volatile region, demanding the attention of policymakers, analysts, and global citizens alike. What does this mean for regional stability, and how might this latest escalation impact the broader geopolitical landscape? Understanding the Recent Iran Ceasefire Violations The very concept of a ceasefire is built on mutual agreement and the cessation of hostilities, offering a glimmer of hope for de-escalation. However, the recent reports from Jin10.com indicate that this fragile understanding was short-lived. Earlier today, it was widely believed that a ceasefire between Iran and Israel had come into effect, a development that would have been welcomed by international observers eager for a pause in the long-standing tensions. Yet, almost immediately, these hopes were dashed with allegations of Iran firing missiles towards Israel. Such an act, if confirmed, constitutes a direct and blatant disregard for the agreed-upon terms, transforming a potential pathway to peace into a trigger for renewed conflict. The implications of these alleged Iran ceasefire violations are profound, as they undermine the credibility of future diplomatic efforts and significantly raise the stakes for all parties involved. It signals a dangerous willingness to escalate, rather than de-escalate, at a moment when restraint is critically needed. Israel Military Response : A Decisive Directive In the face of what Israel perceives as a direct provocation, the response has been swift and uncompromising. The Israeli defense minister has reportedly issued explicit instructions to the military: respond strongly. This isn’t merely a rhetorical warning; it signifies a concrete directive for aggressive military action. The phrase “respond strongly” suggests a calibrated but forceful retaliation, designed to deter further aggression and reassert Israel’s security posture. The nature of this directive implies a multi-faceted approach, potentially involving air strikes, missile defense activations, and other defensive or offensive measures. For Israel, national security is paramount, and any perceived threat to its sovereignty or its citizens will likely be met with an unequivocal demonstration of force. This immediate and resolute Israel military response highlights the gravity with which Jerusalem views the alleged ceasefire breach, signaling that such violations will not be tolerated. The Strategic Implications of Targeted Tehran Strikes Perhaps the most alarming aspect of the defense minister’s instructions is the mention of “delivering high-intensity strikes against targets in the core area of Tehran.” This statement introduces an entirely new and dangerous dimension to the conflict. Striking the capital city of an adversary, especially its “core area,” carries immense strategic and symbolic weight. It moves beyond retaliatory strikes on military installations in border regions and suggests a willingness to target the very heart of Iranian power. Why is targeting Tehran strikes so significant? Symbolic Impact: Striking the capital sends a clear message of capability and resolve, directly challenging the adversary’s perceived invulnerability. Escalation Risk: Such an action dramatically increases the risk of a full-scale war, potentially drawing in regional and international powers. Political Pressure: It puts immense pressure on the targeted government, potentially leading to a more aggressive counter-response or, conversely, a reconsideration of their actions. Civilian Casualties: Strikes in urban centers inherently carry a higher risk of civilian casualties, which could trigger widespread condemnation and humanitarian crises. The potential for high-intensity strikes on Tehran transforms this incident from a localized flare-up into a potential regional conflagration, demanding immediate international attention and de-escalation efforts. Navigating the Escalating Middle East Conflict The alleged ceasefire violation and Israel’s subsequent strong directive threaten to plunge the already tumultuous Middle East into deeper turmoil. The region is a complex web of alliances, rivalries, and proxy wars, and any significant escalation between two major players like Iran and Israel has ripple effects far beyond their immediate borders. This isn’t just a bilateral dispute; it’s a potential catalyst for a wider Middle East conflict . Key concerns include: Concern Potential Impact Regional Spillover Neighboring countries and non-state actors (e.g., Hezbollah, Hamas) could be drawn into the hostilities, creating new fronts. Global Economic Instability Increased oil prices, disrupted trade routes, and investor uncertainty in global markets. Humanitarian Crisis Displacement of populations, increased civilian casualties, and strain on aid organizations. International Diplomacy Failure Further erosion of trust in international mediation efforts and agreements. The international community is now faced with the urgent task of preventing a full-blown war, which would have devastating consequences for millions and reverberate across the global economy and political landscape. Assessing Future Geopolitical Tensions and Regional Stability The current situation underscores the inherent fragility of peace in the Middle East and highlights the enduring nature of geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel. These two nations have been locked in a shadow war for decades, characterized by proxy conflicts, cyberattacks, and covert operations. A direct, overt military confrontation of this magnitude would represent a dramatic and dangerous shift. What are the immediate challenges and potential future scenarios? De-escalation or Retaliation Cycle? The primary challenge is to break the cycle of action and counter-action. Will international pressure lead to de-escalation, or will both sides feel compelled to respond in kind, leading to an uncontrollable spiral? The Role of Major Powers: How will global powers like the United States, Russia, China, and European nations react? Their diplomatic interventions, or lack thereof, could significantly influence the trajectory of the conflict. Domestic Pressures: Leaders in both Iran and Israel face domestic pressures to appear strong and decisive, which can complicate efforts towards moderation and compromise. Impact on Nuclear Ambitions: This conflict could also reignite concerns about Iran’s nuclear program, potentially pushing it further out of international oversight. The coming days will be critical in determining whether the region descends into widespread conflict or if diplomatic efforts can somehow pull it back from the brink. The world watches with bated breath as the stakes could not be higher. Conclusion: A Perilous Crossroads The news of Iran’s alleged ceasefire violation and Israel’s resolute directive for a strong military response, including potential high-intensity strikes on Tehran, paints a grim picture for the Middle East. This escalation underscores the deeply entrenched mistrust and the inherent volatility of the region. What began as a hopeful ceasefire has quickly transformed into a dangerous flashpoint, pushing both nations, and indeed the entire world, to a perilous crossroads. The implications for regional stability, global markets, and human lives are immense. Preventing a full-scale war now rests on the shoulders of diplomatic ingenuity and a profound commitment to de-escalation from all involved parties.

Now the bulls seek to go higher. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to rise towards the $335 mark after brief consolidation below the $325 mark.

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR up today? Monero rapidly recovered after the price broke down below the descending trend’s bottom line with the bulls seeking to go past $320. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-24 20:50:00

When major currencies like the US Dollar decline , it sends ripples across all asset classes, including digital assets. Recent developments, fueled by unexpected optimism for a global ceasefire, have seen the greenback retreat significantly, prompting a closer look at how these macroeconomic shifts influence the broader financial landscape. Understanding these movements is crucial for anyone navigating the complex world of investments, from traditional stocks to decentralized finance. US Dollar Decline: Why is the Greenback Retreating? The recent and notable US Dollar decline is a direct reflection of shifting global dynamics. For years, the dollar has held its ground as the premier safe-haven currency, a preferred asset during times of uncertainty and geopolitical turmoil. However, news of potential ceasefires and de-escalation in conflict zones has triggered a significant reassessment of risk among investors. When global tensions ease, the immediate need for a safe haven diminishes, leading capital to flow out of the dollar and into assets perceived as offering higher returns or growth potential in a more stable environment. Several factors contribute to this retreat: Reduced Safe-Haven Demand: Optimism regarding a ceasefire reduces the perceived risk in global markets, lessening the demand for the dollar as a protective asset. Investors become more willing to take on riskier, growth-oriented investments. Interest Rate Expectations: While the Federal Reserve has maintained a hawkish stance, market participants are increasingly pricing in potential rate cuts later in the year, especially if inflation continues to cool and economic growth shows signs of slowing. This expectation can weaken the dollar as it reduces the yield advantage it might offer over other currencies. Global Economic Rebalancing: As other major economies show signs of recovery or resilience, their respective currencies gain strength against the dollar. This rebalancing act is a natural consequence of improving global economic conditions outside the United States. This retreat is not necessarily a sign of weakness in the U.S. economy itself, but rather a reflection of a changing global risk appetite and a recalibration of currency valuations in response to evolving geopolitical and economic landscapes. Navigating the Forex Market Trends: What’s Shifting? The foreign exchange (Forex) market, the largest financial market globally, is currently experiencing significant shifts. The dollar’s retreat has created a ripple effect, strengthening other major currencies and altering established trading patterns. These Forex market trends are critical for international trade, corporate earnings, and investment strategies. Here’s a look at some key shifts: Euro’s Resilience: The Euro has shown surprising resilience, benefiting from the dollar’s weakness and signs of modest economic recovery within the Eurozone. While challenges remain, reduced energy price volatility and improving business sentiment have provided support. Yen’s Volatility: The Japanese Yen, often another safe-haven currency, has seen mixed movements. While it can benefit from a weaker dollar, its own domestic economic challenges and the Bank of Japan’s ultra-loose monetary policy continue to exert downward pressure. Commodity Currencies’ Strength: Currencies of commodity-exporting nations (like the Australian Dollar or Canadian Dollar) tend to strengthen when global optimism rises, as demand for raw materials increases. This trend is amplified by a weaker dollar, making commodities cheaper for non-dollar buyers. Understanding these interconnected movements is essential. For businesses engaged in international trade, favorable exchange rates can boost profitability, while unfavorable ones can erode margins. For investors, these trends open opportunities in foreign bond markets or equity markets, potentially enhancing portfolio diversification and returns. Impact on Global Trade and Investment The current Forex market trends have direct implications for the global economy. A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports more competitive, potentially boosting American industries. Conversely, it makes imports more expensive, which could contribute to domestic inflation. For countries holding large dollar reserves, a decline can reduce the value of those holdings, influencing their investment decisions. Table: Key Currency Pair Movements (Illustrative) Currency Pair Recent Trend Underlying Factor EUR/USD Upward USD Weakness, Eurozone Resilience GBP/USD Strong Upward USD Weakness, UK Economic Optimism USD/JPY Downward USD Weakness, BoJ Policy AUD/USD Upward USD Weakness, Commodity Demand This dynamic interplay underscores the importance of staying informed about global economic indicators and geopolitical developments. Sterling Surge: Is the British Pound Leading the Charge? Amidst the dollar’s retreat, the Sterling surge has been a standout performer in the Forex market. The British Pound has shown remarkable strength against the greenback, reaching multi-month highs. This robust performance is not solely a function of dollar weakness; it also reflects specific positive developments within the United Kingdom. Key drivers behind the Sterling’s strength include: Bank of England (BoE) Stance: The Bank of England has maintained a relatively hawkish stance compared to some other central banks, signaling a willingness to keep interest rates higher for longer to combat inflation. This provides a yield advantage for the pound, attracting foreign capital. Improving Economic Outlook: While the UK economy has faced headwinds, recent data points, including easing inflation and more resilient growth figures than initially feared, have painted a more optimistic picture. This renewed confidence encourages investment into UK assets. Reduced Political Uncertainty: Relative political stability in the UK, compared to previous periods of Brexit-related turmoil, also contributes to investor confidence, making the pound a more attractive holding. The Sterling surge has implications for both UK citizens and international entities. For UK consumers, a stronger pound makes imports cheaper and international travel more affordable. For businesses, it can reduce the cost of imported goods and raw materials, but it can also make UK exports less competitive on the global stage. This balance of trade effects is constantly monitored by policymakers and economists. Geopolitical Stability: A Catalyst for Market Reassessment? The underlying driver for much of the recent currency movement is the prospect of increased geopolitical stability . News of potential ceasefires and de-escalation in global conflicts has a profound impact on financial markets. For years, geopolitical tensions have fueled uncertainty, prompting investors to seek safety in assets like the US Dollar and gold. How does improved geopolitical stability influence markets? Reduced Risk Premium: When the threat of conflict diminishes, the “risk premium” associated with investing in growth assets (like equities or emerging market currencies) decreases. This encourages a shift from safe havens to riskier, higher-yielding assets. Increased Confidence: Stability fosters a more predictable environment for businesses and investors. It encourages long-term planning, foreign direct investment, and cross-border trade, all of which contribute to global economic growth. Capital Repatriation: As confidence grows, capital that had fled to safe havens during periods of instability may begin to return to its home markets or seek out new opportunities in regions previously deemed too risky. This can strengthen local currencies and boost domestic economies. While complete global peace remains an aspirational goal, any step towards de-escalation is viewed positively by markets. The anticipation of greater geopolitical stability can unlock significant capital flows and reshape the landscape of currency valuations, favoring currencies of economies poised for growth over traditional safe havens. Investor Sentiment: How Does Optimism Shape Your Portfolio? Ultimately, currency movements, like all financial market dynamics, are heavily influenced by investor sentiment . The collective mood of market participants – whether optimistic or pessimistic – can drive significant shifts in asset prices. The current wave of optimism, stemming from ceasefire hopes, illustrates this perfectly. When optimism prevails: Risk-On Behavior: Investors become more willing to take on risk. This often means selling traditional safe-haven assets (like the dollar or government bonds) and buying riskier assets such as equities, commodities, and even cryptocurrencies. Growth Expectations: Positive sentiment is often linked to expectations of stronger economic growth, which can lead to higher corporate earnings and improved job markets. This fuels a virtuous cycle of investment. Currency Preferences Shift: Currencies of countries with stronger growth prospects or higher interest rates become more attractive, while those perceived as safe havens may weaken. For individual investors, understanding investor sentiment is key to making informed decisions. While it’s unwise to solely trade on emotion, recognizing the prevailing market mood can help you anticipate broader trends. For instance, if optimism is leading to a weaker dollar, it might be a good time to consider diversifying into international assets or commodities. Actionable Insights for Investors In a dynamic market influenced by shifting sentiment, here are some actionable insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and even a portion in cryptocurrencies) and geographies can help mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments, central bank policies, and key economic indicators. These factors directly influence currency movements. Consider Hedging: For businesses with significant international transactions, or investors with large foreign asset holdings, currency hedging strategies can protect against adverse exchange rate movements. Long-Term Perspective: While daily fluctuations are common, focusing on long-term trends and your financial goals can help you avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market noise. Summary: Navigating a Shifting Financial Landscape The recent retreat of the US Dollar decline , driven by renewed optimism for global ceasefires, marks a significant moment in the financial markets. This shift has propelled the Sterling surge and reshaped Forex market trends , highlighting the profound impact of geopolitical stability on currency valuations and overall investor sentiment . As the demand for safe-haven assets diminishes, capital is flowing towards currencies and assets poised for growth in a more stable global environment. For investors, these dynamics underscore the importance of adaptability and informed decision-making. Whether you’re tracking the strength of the British Pound or assessing the broader implications for your cryptocurrency holdings, understanding these interconnected forces is paramount. The financial world is constantly evolving, and staying ahead of these trends is key to navigating its complexities successfully.

Discover why the savvy eye these digital assets amidst the economic uncertainty surrounding Iran's situation. Bitcoin Price Dynamics and Strategies Bitcoin experienced a minor decline over the past month with a 2.56% drop, while showing a modest gain of 5.72% over the past six months. Price action in the last week also slipped by 1.59%, reflecting a period of mixed performance that saw the coin test its short-term limits without drastic swings. Bitcoin currently trades within a defined price range between $94,832 and $113,326.8, with key levels guiding trading focus. A near-term resistance is observed at roughly $121,869.42 while support holds at around $84,880.08. A second resistance emerges at about $140,364.09, and a lower support layer is near $66,385.41, which could serve as a pivotal point for further price action. Short-term indicators suggest a slightly bearish sentiment, with the momentum indicator at -394.88 and the Awesome Oscillator at -2,787. The Relative Strength Index of 50.72 indicates a neutral stance, suggesting cautious trading opportunities around these levels. Ethereum Update: Observing Recent Dips and Key Price Milestones Ethereum recorded a 5.33% drop over the past month, along with a significant 31.55% decline over the last six months. Price movements indicated a period of consistent downward pressure and volatility. The gradual decrease in value during these time frames reflects a market struggling to regain its footing, hinting at cautious sentiment among traders and investors. Ethereum trades between approximately $1,923 and $2,962. Immediate resistance is at around $3,395, with support near $1,319. A higher resistance level exists at roughly $4,434, while deeper support is at around $280. Several technical indicators point to a bearish outlook, with the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator in the negative, and an RSI close to 45 suggesting near-neutral conditions. Price action hasn't confirmed a clear uptrend, allowing for potential further declines. Trading strategies may include watching for breaks above $3,395 or considering entries near $1,319 if prices dip. XRP Faces Challenges: Recent Trends and Current Trading Dynamics XRP showed a weakening price action with a 1 week decline of -4.63% and a 1 month drop of -8.33%. Over the past six months, the coin experienced an overall decline of -7.08%, indicating market uncertainty. Price movements reflect XRP being squeezed between falling support levels and diminishing momentum while trading near its average range. Recent behavior highlights a balance between short-term corrections and longer-term adjustments in sentiment, with technical indicators leaning towards downside pressure. The challenges faced by XRP in maintaining upward momentum illustrate a cautious market environment despite its underlying potential. XRP is trading within a range of $1.95 to $2.53, with resistance near $2.88 and secondary resistance at $3.45. Support levels are identified at $1.73 and $1.15. Technical signals show mixed cues, suggesting bearish sentiment without a clear downward trend. If bulls push XRP decisively above the $2.88 level, momentum could accelerate towards higher resistance. Conversely, failure at the $1.73 support may lead to lower targets. Traders might consider dip buying near the lower range with tight stops while being cautious of reversals. Monitoring momentum shifts and volume changes is crucial, as rising volumes may confirm possible breakouts. A disciplined approach with defined risk limits remains essential. Conclusion Amid market panic, experienced investors are focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , and XRP . Bitcoin continues to show resilience and has a strong track record. Ethereum's ecosystem is expanding, providing more use cases. XRP remains active in financial sector developments. These coins attract attention from those who see long-term potential.

Speaking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, McInerney said Visa has been developing infrastructure for stablecoins for years and this new regulation will bring clarity to the industry. Visa CEO stated that the passage of the GENIUS Act will provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. “We have been embracing stablecoins for a long time. We have built stablecoin-based solutions on Visa infrastructure and are working to develop new use cases on a global scale,” he said. McInerney countered concerns that the prospect of large companies issuing their own stablecoins would displace traditional payment systems. “Visa offers trust, ease of use and scale. When there are 5 billion Visa cards, 14 billion tokens and 150 million businesses choosing Visa today around the world, that’s where we stand out,” he said. Related News: After the Recent Surge, What Percentage of Users Are Profitable in Each Altcoin? Bitcoin Has Reached Its Peak, Here's the Latest on Altcoins According to McInerney, the real potential of stablecoins lies in countries outside the U.S. He said they would allow users in countries with currency shortages to spend through the Visa network using stablecoins. Recalling that Visa has been collaborating with stablecoin issuer Circle for a long time, McInerney stated that these collaborations will continue to increase. Is it a threat to Visa if giants like Amazon or Walmart issue their own stablecoins? McInerney is clear on this issue: “Even today, you can make payments with digital dollars on these platforms. Different payment methods are already in the system. The real opportunity is in geographies where these opportunities have not yet reached.” *This is not investment advice.

The analyst points out that XRP is now approaching the critical support level at $1.90, which could signal a potential bullish reversal if the price manages to hold above it. XRP Eyes $1.90 As Key Reversal Zone Crypto market expert CasiTrades believes that the XRP price behavior is moving exactly as predicted following its recent price drop below $2. According to the chart and analysis published on X (formerly Twitter), XRP’s retracement toward the $1.90 region is not a sign of weakness but a textbook setup for a potential reversal. Related Reading: Daily Timeframe Says XRP Price Is On The Verge Of Breakout The $1.90 level represents a major Fibonacci Retracement zone, specifically the 0.5 retracement from the macro correction, which the analyst has been closely watching for a possible price reaction. According to CasiTrades, this zone is more than just a random support level—it aligns with a pattern that the analyst described in earlier updates. In these previous reports, CasiTrades was watching out for distinct price movements during XRP’s decline, including a bounce off a key Fibonacci level, a short-term fakeout upward to trap late buyers, and a final drop back into the support zone, where Bullish Divergence can develop. This distinct price pattern now appears to be playing out exactly as expected on the XRP price chart. If XRP holds above the $1.90 level while forming a Bullish Divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI), it could confirm a textbook bottom setup and potentially signal the start of a new impulsive rally. XRP And Bitcoin Display Synchronized Patterns CasiTrades’ price chart shows XRP forming a Descending Triangle, with its latest move dipping just into a high-demand zone marked by previous price reactions. In line with the Elliott Wave Theory, this pattern suggests the upcoming completion of Wave 2 with a massive breakout in Wave 3 potentially taking shape if the $1.90 support level holds. Additional support from key Fibonacci levels, such as the 0.618 and 2.136 extensions at $2.0 and $2.1, respectively, reinforces strength in XRP’s potential for a rebound. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Perfect Setup After Buy Retest – Next Stop $3.7 Interestingly, the analyst points to the Bitcoin price action mirroring this exact behavior—bouncing from just under its own 0.236 retracement near $97,000, and potentially setting up for a final dip into support. This synchronized structure across both XRP and BTC adds heavy confluence. CasiTrades notes that this current downturn is not a breakdown, but rather a final calculated shakeout before a broader rally. If both Bitcoin and XRP reach as expected while positioned at $0.19 and $97,000 respectively, the analyst believes it could trigger a new bullish leg in the crypto cycle.

One name keeps emerging across investor forums and private trading groups: MAGACOIN FINANCE . What started as a quiet presale is now turning into a major movement, with even veteran Bitcoin Cash holders beginning to shift their attention. Why? Because while Ethereum refines its infrastructure and XRP continues its legal recovery, MAGACOIN FINANCE is doing something different: building raw momentum, fast. With strong presale traction, a growing community, and meme appeal backed by strategic structure, it’s now being seen as a high-upside contender that could surprise the entire market in 2025. Bitcoin Cash Investors Are Watching Something New Longtime Bitcoin Cash holders understand what it means to bet on fundamentals and speed—but they also recognize when something fresh is gaining traction. For many, MAGACOIN FINANCE is presenting that exact kind of early signal. Unlike legacy altcoins that have already gone through their breakout phases, MAGACOIN FINANCE is still in launch mode—and that’s where the opportunity lies. The token’s capped supply of 170 billion creates natural scarcity, while its meme branding injects viral energy that’s resonating with a broad audience. For Bitcoin Cash investors used to fast-moving plays, the timing here is impossible to ignore. Ethereum and XRP Hold Value—But the Growth Is Slower Ethereum and XRP continue to serve critical roles in the crypto economy. Ethereum leads the smart contract space, and XRP maintains utility in cross-border payments. But their market caps are high, and explosive growth is harder to come by. For investors seeking maximum upside potential, these coins may no longer offer the acceleration they once did. MAGACOIN FINANCE , by contrast, is still undervalued and underexposed—the ideal conditions for high-return positioning. Bitcoin Cash holders know the importance of timing, and that’s why MAGACOIN FINANCE is now on their radar. Presale Demand Is Driving Market-Wide FOMO MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale has become a headline story on its own. Each new wave of buyers is driving stronger price pressure, while community growth explodes across Twitter, Telegram, and YouTube. What’s adding fuel to the fire? Fixed supply of 100B tokens Explosive early-stage growth Thousands of holders already joined Meme appeal with serious backing Analysts are beginning to echo the sentiment: this isn’t just a viral moment it’s the beginning of a it’s the beginning of a larger movement. For a limited time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering a token bonus during its presale. This incentive is attracting serious capital and pushing the token’s visibility higher each day. Conclusion As Bitcoin Cash investors begin reallocating their attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the breakout token of the cycle. With unmatched presale momentum, smart tokenomics, and the ability to capture the attention of seasoned and new investors alike, it’s quickly becoming more than just a memecoin—it’s a serious altcoin contender. For those looking to get in early, the window is open—but it’s closing fast.

This isn’t just another funding announcement; it’s a significant vote of confidence from major financial powerhouses in the burgeoning world of Real-World Assets (RWA) and the privacy-centric Canton Network . What does this monumental investment mean for the future of finance, and how will it accelerate the integration of traditional assets into the blockchain ecosystem? Unpacking the Power Behind Digital Asset and the Canton Network At its core, Digital Asset is more than just a software company; it’s a pioneer shaping the very infrastructure of tomorrow’s financial markets. Known for developing DAML (Digital Asset Modeling Language), their technology enables institutions to build and deploy complex, privacy-enabled multi-party workflows with unprecedented efficiency and security. This is where the Canton Network comes into play. The Canton Network stands out as a privacy-focused, interoperable blockchain network designed specifically for institutional use. Unlike public blockchains, Canton offers a permissioned environment where participants can interact and transact with the assurance of privacy and compliance. This unique architecture makes it ideal for handling sensitive financial data and complex operations, ensuring that only authorized parties can view specific transaction details while maintaining the integrity and immutability of a distributed ledger. The network’s design allows for atomic swaps and seamless integration across various financial applications, making it a critical piece of infrastructure for the future of finance. Why are Real-World Assets (RWA) the Next Frontier? The concept of Real-World Assets (RWA) refers to tangible or intangible assets that exist outside the blockchain, such as real estate, commodities, private equity, intellectual property, and even traditional financial instruments like bonds and money market funds. Bringing these assets onto the blockchain through tokenization is widely considered the next major leap for digital finance. The traditional markets for these assets often suffer from inefficiencies: Illiquidity: Many assets, like real estate or private debt, are hard to buy and sell quickly. High Transaction Costs: Manual processes, intermediaries, and legal complexities drive up expenses. Lack of Transparency: Opaque ownership structures and slow record-keeping can hinder trust. Limited Accessibility: High minimum investment thresholds often exclude smaller investors. By leveraging blockchain technology, RWA can be transformed, unlocking new levels of liquidity, fractional ownership, and global accessibility. This transformation promises to democratize investment opportunities and streamline cumbersome processes that have long plagued traditional finance. The Transformative Power of Tokenization: Unlocking Efficiency Tokenization is the process of converting rights to an asset into a digital token on a blockchain. This digital representation can then be easily traded, managed, and verified. For RWA , tokenization offers a suite of compelling benefits: Fractional Ownership: A single asset, like a building, can be divided into thousands of tokens, allowing multiple investors to own a piece. Increased Liquidity: Tokens can be traded 24/7 on global digital marketplaces, dramatically increasing an asset’s liquidity. Reduced Settlement Times: Transactions can settle in minutes, not days, thanks to blockchain’s inherent speed. Enhanced Transparency and Auditability: All token movements are recorded on an immutable ledger, providing a clear audit trail. Lower Costs: Automation reduces the need for intermediaries, cutting down fees and administrative burdens. Digital Asset’s focus on expanding RWA capabilities on the Canton Network specifically targets these benefits. Their existing work already encompasses a wide array of products, including bonds, money market funds, repurchase agreements (repos), mortgages, and insurance products. A notable success story includes the U.S. Treasury tokenization pilot project completed last year in collaboration with financial giants like Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon, demonstrating the tangible application and immense potential of their technology in real-world scenarios. Driving Institutional Blockchain Adoption: A Collaborative Vision The $135 million funding round is not just about capital; it’s a powerful endorsement from some of the most influential players in global finance. The list of participants reads like a who’s who of the financial world: DRW Venture Capital, Tradeweb Markets, BNP Paribas, Circle Ventures, Citadel Securities, DTCC, Virtu Financial, and Paxos. This broad coalition signifies a collective belief in the transformative potential of Institutional Blockchain solutions. These strategic investors aren’t just looking for financial returns; they are actively seeking to integrate distributed ledger technology into their core operations.

33767162,[object Object],1750798823,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Palau Wraps XRP Ledger Stablecoin Audit: Here’s What Ripple Paid,https://bitcoinist.com/palau-xrp-ledger-stablecoin-audit-what-ripple-paid/,"Palau’s Office of the Public Auditor (OPA) has released the long-awaited performance audit of the government’s XRP-Ledger-based stablecoin pilot, confirming that Ripple Services Inc. funded the 25-month experiment with a single $25,000 payment and that just over half of that grant has been spent. The 12-page report closes the accounting on the Palau Stablecoin (PSC) project , which ran from 26 October 2021 to 27 November 2023. Ripple’s $25K Grant Confirmed In Palau Stablecoin Audit The audit documents show Ripple wired $25,000 into the National Treasury on 10 March 2023. Of that amount the Ministry of Finance (MOF) disbursed $14,035, mainly to reimburse three participating merchants—Surangel & Sons, Penthouse Hotel and King’s Minute Mart—for redeeming PSC tokens spent by 154 volunteer government employees, each of whom received an allocation of 100 PSC (one-to-one with the US dollar). The unspent balance of $10,965 remains in the Treasury pending a political decision on a potential second phase. Ripple’s contribution was properly booked under the FY 2023 budget law (RPPL 11-24) and, in OPA’s words, “was properly accounted for and deposited into the National Treasury,” a finding that dispels earlier speculation that the grant bypassed normal budget channels. OPA opened the probe at the request of Senator Mark Rudimch, whose Resources, Commerce, Trade & Development Committee raised questions in July 2023 about the programme’s constitutionality and financial controls. The audit therefore set two narrow objectives: whether the MOF had legal authority to partner with a private company and whether it followed Palauan law in doing so. On substance, the auditors concluded the MOF “acted within its broad authority and did not violate its mandate,” but they flagged two procedural breaches. First, neither the original October 2021 memorandum of understanding nor the December 2022 Ripple Master Hosted Stablecoin Services Agreement was certified “for form and legality” by the Attorney General, as required by 40 PNC § 612. Second, the National Director of Program, Budget & Management did not certify fund availability when the services agreement was signed, a step mandated by 40 PNC § 401(b). “The Republic of Palau cannot ascertain the form and legality of the agreements as intended by law,” OPA wrote, urging the MOF in a formal recommendation “to ensure that every government contract…is certified by the Attorney General before execution.” The Ministry accepted the admonition, but in its written reply stressed that “agreements that do not bind the Republic are often acceptable without AG review,” adding that it had “consistently relied upon legal advice provided by the Office of the President’s legal staff.” On the budget-certification lapse, officials noted that certification did occur at the time of each disbursement and argued the grant was already covered under annual outside-assistance provisions. “Thank you for the findings, which are accepted as presented,” the MOF told auditors. XRP Ledger Pilot Ended: What’s Next? Beyond the procedural fixes, OPA offered a nuanced verdict on the policy experiment itself. It praised the pilot’s design for exploring “technological solutions enabling the Ministry of Finance to manage the minting, distribution, redemption and destruction of PSC…recorded on the public XRP Ledger,” and it highlighted potential benefits for financial inclusion and lower transaction costs. Yet the report also cautioned that rolling out a circulating national stablecoin would require explicit legislation by the Olbiil Era Kelulau (Palau’s Congress); without such an act, any expansion “would be unlawful.” For Ripple, the audit caps a three-year engagement whose cash outlay—$25,000—was modest compared with typical central-bank-digital-currency pilots. While the report makes no judgement on technical performance, it confirms that the XRP Ledger handled mint-and-burn cycles and retailer redemptions. For Palau’s policymakers, the next decision is whether to draft the legislation that would turn PSC from a proof-of-concept into legal tender —or to leave the remaining grant dollars unspent and the project on the shelf.

The principles were released by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Cynthia Lummis, Senator Bill Hagerty, and Senator Thom Tillis. The principles suggest considering existing law to provide predictability, enhanced legal precision, and much-needed regulatory certainty. Senator Tillis said their priority must be providing legal clarity and certainty without stifling innovation as Congress considers a regulatory framework for digital assets. Principles seek to define the legal status of digital assets 🚨NEW: @SenatorTimScott , @SenLummis , @SenThomTillis , & @SenatorHagerty unveiled principles for digital asset market structure legislation. These will guide bipartisan efforts to bring regulatory clarity, foster innovation, & protect investors. Read more: https://t.co/5NVwlsUvlZ — U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP (@BankingGOP) June 24, 2025 The senators revealed that the guidelines aim to direct discussions and negotiations with industry participants, legal and academic experts, and government stakeholders regarding the legislative text. The principles also emphasize the need for legislation to clearly define the legal status of digital assets. Senator Lummis argued that America desperately needs digital asset legislation that promotes responsible innovation and protects consumers. She also noted that while the European Union and Singapore have established clear regulations, the U.S. is left behind while the crypto sector seeks greener pastures. The officials believe there must be a clear rationale distinguishing digital asset securities from digital asset commodities. According to the Senators, the distinction should also be fixed in statute, contemplating existing law and providing predictability, enhanced legal precision, and regulatory certainty. “For too long, a lack of clear regulatory authority has forced digital asset innovation beyond our borders and subjected issuers, exchanges, and developers to crippling uncertainty. By working towards a reasonable, light-touch market structure framework, we can help bolster our nation’s economy and protect American consumers.” – Bill Hagerty , U.S. Senator of Tennessee. The Senate also advocates for a clear delineation of jurisdiction among regulatory agencies, preventing an all-encompassing regulator from emerging. The principles recognize that not all distributed ledger technologies should fall under the regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The U.S. officials proposed a new SEC exemption for certain digital asset fundraising to be included in the legislation. They also want the agency to revisit its registration requirements for digital asset issuers and instead provide a clear pathway to compliance for innovative actors. According to the Senate, legislation should recognize the different risks and benefits between centralized firms, decentralized finance protocols, and non-custodial software platforms. They proposed that legislation should not apply principles designed for centralized firms to decentralized protocols. The principles also suggest that using distributed ledger technology and smart contracts for other, non-financial purposes, such as managing health data, should not be regulated like financial products. The Senate recommended that centralized crypto asset intermediaries be subject to innovation-friendly registration and risk management requirements similar to those of centralized intermediaries. They also want the legislation to ensure customer funds are protected during bankruptcy. Senator Scott eyes progressing the GENIUS Act Chairman Scott acknowledged that he has led a new approach to digital assets regulation and delivered results for the crypto industry and the American people. He said he’s looking forward to building on the success of the GENIUS Act. Scott revealed that the principles will serve as an important baseline for negotiations on the bill. He hopes his colleagues will put politics aside and provide clarity for digital asset regulation. The Senate passed the GENIUS Act on June 17, which creates a regulated pathway for private firms to issue digital dollars with the federal government’s permission. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act passed with a 68-30 vote. The bill sets guardrails for the crypto industry, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. It also opens the door to a flurry of issuers, including banks, fintech, and major retailers, looking to launch their stablecoins or integrate them into existing payment systems. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Senate appropriation subcommittee in a hearing in early June that the U.S. stablecoin market could grow nearly eightfold to over $2 trillion in the next few years.

This declaration, reported by Jin10.com, asserts that Israel has been compelled to unilaterally acknowledge its defeat and cease its aggressive actions. For anyone monitoring global events and their potential ripple effects, particularly on economic and financial markets, understanding this firm stance from Iran is crucial. The SNSC emphasized that the Iranian armed forces maintain a vigilant posture, trusting neither the adversary’s words nor their intentions, and remain fully prepared to respond to any future aggression. This readiness underscores the ongoing volatility in the region and highlights the critical importance of regional security. What Fuels the Iran Israel Conflict ? The relationship between Iran and Israel has long been characterized by deep-seated animosity and proxy conflicts, making the Iran Israel conflict one of the most persistent and volatile geopolitical flashpoints. Decades of ideological differences, territorial disputes, and strategic competition have shaped this complex dynamic. Recent events have only served to escalate these tensions, with direct exchanges and retaliatory actions becoming more frequent. Iran’s latest statement from the SNSC reflects a perceived shift in this power balance, where Tehran believes its actions have forced a cessation of Israeli aggression. This perspective is critical for understanding Iran’s confidence in its military and strategic deterrence capabilities. Historical Roots: A history of political and ideological clashes dating back to the Iranian Revolution. Regional Influence: Competition for dominance and influence across the Middle East, often playing out through proxy groups. Nuclear Program: Israel’s concerns over Iran’s nuclear ambitions, which Tehran insists are for peaceful purposes. Recent Escalations: Direct military confrontations and cyber warfare adding new layers to the conflict. Understanding Iran’s Stance on Middle East Tensions Iran’s declaration that Israel has been ‘forced to unilaterally accept its defeat’ is a bold assertion designed to project strength and deter further aggression. This statement is not merely rhetorical; it aims to signal a new phase in the ongoing Middle East tensions , where Iran feels it has gained the upper hand in a recent exchange. The SNSC’s emphasis on distrusting the ‘words of the enemy’ reflects a deeply ingrained skepticism towards diplomatic assurances from adversaries, particularly given the long history of mistrust. This highlights Iran’s reliance on its own military readiness as the primary guarantor of its security and interests in a volatile region. Such pronouncements often precede or follow significant strategic moves, making them vital for analysts to dissect. The Preparedness of the Iranian Armed Forces At the heart of Iran’s deterrence strategy lies the formidable strength and unwavering preparedness of the Iranian armed forces . The SNSC’s statement unequivocally underscores this readiness, affirming that they are ‘always geared to respond to any further aggression.’ This isn’t just about having advanced weaponry; it’s about a comprehensive strategy that includes intelligence gathering, rapid deployment capabilities, and a deep understanding of the regional operational environment. The Iranian military doctrine often emphasizes asymmetric warfare and the ability to inflict significant costs on any aggressor, leveraging its geographical advantages and network of regional allies. This constant state of alert is a key factor in Iran’s ability to project power and maintain its perceived strategic advantage in the face of external threats. Implications for Geopolitical Stability The ongoing dynamics between Iran and Israel, coupled with Iran’s firm declarations, have profound implications for overall geopolitical stability , not just in the Middle East but globally. Any escalation in this conflict could trigger a wider regional conflagration, drawing in other state and non-state actors. The economic repercussions, particularly concerning energy markets and global trade routes, could be severe. Moreover, heightened tensions could divert international attention and resources from other pressing global challenges. The international community often walks a tightrope, attempting to de-escalate tensions through diplomacy while acknowledging the complex security dilemmas faced by all parties involved. Maintaining open channels of communication, however strained, becomes paramount in preventing miscalculation and unintended escalation. Navigating the Future of Regional Security The path forward for regional security in the Middle East remains fraught with challenges. Iran’s steadfast commitment to responding to perceived aggression means that the region will likely continue to experience periods of heightened alert. For policymakers and observers, several key aspects demand close attention: Deterrence vs. Escalation: How can deterrence be maintained without inadvertently triggering a wider conflict? Role of International Actors: What role can global powers play in mediating disputes and fostering de-escalation? Economic Impact: The potential for disruption to global supply chains and energy markets remains a constant concern. Cyber Warfare: The increasing prominence of cyberattacks as a tool of statecraft adds another layer of complexity to regional security. Internal Dynamics: How do domestic political considerations within Iran and Israel influence their external policies? The emphasis on constant vigilance by the Iranian armed forces highlights a belief that peace can only be secured through strength and readiness. This approach, while aiming for deterrence, also carries the inherent risk of miscalculation, which could have devastating consequences for the region and beyond. Conclusion: A Vigilant Watch on a Volatile Horizon The Supreme National Security Council of Iran’s declaration serves as a stark reminder of the volatile geopolitical landscape in the Middle East. Their assertion of Israel’s forced retreat and the unwavering readiness of the Iranian armed forces paint a picture of a nation prepared to defend its interests with resolve. As the global community watches these developments closely, the emphasis remains on understanding the intricate balance of power, the historical grievances, and the potential for any spark to ignite a wider conflict. For investors and market watchers, these geopolitical shifts are not mere headlines but critical indicators that can influence market sentiment and asset prices. The call for constant vigilance from Tehran ensures that the international community will remain on high alert regarding the future of regional security.

This aims to support Bill Pulte’s BTC-backed mortgage lending initiative. The BTC Credit Framework The offer came shortly after Pulte publicly expressed interest in evaluating how digital assets like Bitcoin might be used in mortgage underwriting. “We will study the usage of cryptocurrency holdings as it relates to qualifying for mortgages,” said the U.S. Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Saylor responded by proposing Strategy’s BTC Credit model to support the FHFA’s efforts. The model is a Bitcoin-based system created by the company to assess the creditworthiness of its debt and preferred stock using its crypto holdings. Instead of relying on traditional financial ratios, the framework looks at how many times the firm’s Bitcoin reserves cover its liabilities (BTC Rating), the credit risk based on volatility (BTC Risk), and a possible credit spread (BTC Credit). Meanwhile, the business intelligence firm continues to grow its Bitcoin holdings. It recently revealed that it had bought an additional 245 BTC for $26 million, taking its position to 592,345 BTC, worth over $62 billion. This translates to more than $20 billion in unrealized profits, with the flagship cryptocurrency currently trading above $105,000. FHFA Considers Crypto as Mortgage Collateral The FHFA regulates the United States housing finance system and is considering whether crypto can count as assets during mortgage reviews. This could lead to a major change in the country’s housing policy. Until now, digital assets have mostly been excluded from mortgage applications because of their price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the lack of a standard way to value them. The idea has gained attention across the crypto industry, with Tristan Yver, co-founder of the BackPack crypto exchange, calling it very bullish. He explained that many crypto holders usually need to convert their assets to fiat and move the money to a traditional bank before lenders accept it. In the past, mortgage underwriters have typically only dealt with assets like cash savings, retirement accounts, and publicly traded stocks. Including crypto could benefit borrowers who hold large digital asset portfolios but prefer not to liquidate their stash to meet loan application requirements. However, some critics pointed to the existing Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 (H.R. 3633), which already classifies crypto as legitimate collateral under federal lending standards. One X user argued that adding more layers of risk assessment would be redundant and potentially stop innovation. “The market’s adapting faster than regulators—let’s streamline, not suffocate progress with more studies,” said the poster.

The token has an elevated volume of 711 million tokens , and RSI approaching oversold territory at 39.52 , suggesting a potential inflection point amid speculation over X platform payment integration. Source: TradingView Dogecoin , trading within a tight $0.16167 – $0.16767 range, faces resistance at all major EMAs, with the 20-day EMA at $0.17477 representing 6.2% overhead pressure. The market cap reached $24.62 billion, with 24-hour volume surging 12.94% to $1.45 billion despite the continued bearish trend structure. The following analysis was conducted using ChatGPT’s o3 AI model, synthesizing 35 real-time technical indicators, whale accumulation patterns, Elon Musk’s X platform developments, and social sentiment metrics to assess DOGE’s 90-day price trajectory. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Minor Recovery Within Established Downtrend Structure Dogecoin’s current price of $0.16463 reflects a modest +0.53% daily gain from an opening price of $0.16377 . This establishes a narrow trading range between $0.16767 (high) and $0.16167 (low), a 3.7% intraday spread indicating moderate volatility compression. Source: TradingView The RSI, at 39.04 , approaches oversold conditions while remaining in neutral territory, suggesting potential for a short-term relief bounce despite broader bearish momentum. This reading places DOGE closer to oversold levels than during previous consolidation phases, historically preceding tactical rebounds when combined with volume expansion. MACD indicators show persistent bearish momentum with the MACD line at -0.01063 trading below the signal line at -0.00973 , though the negative histogram at -0.00090 suggests momentum deceleration. The narrow MACD divergence indicates potential for trend stabilization if buying pressure emerges. Source: TradingView Moving averages create formidable overhead resistance across all timeframes. The 20-day EMA at $0.17477 sits 6.2% above the current price, while the 50-day EMA at $0.18650 represents 13.3% overhead resistance. The 100-day EMA at $0.19687 and the 200-day EMA at $0.20877 cluster between 19.6% and 26.8% above current levels. All major EMAs trading above the current price confirm a strong bearish trend structure, requiring strong momentum expansion and fundamental catalysts to reclaim these technical levels. The 20-day EMA represents the most accessible resistance target for any recovery attempt. Volume analysis shows exceptional activity of 711 million DOGE traded daily, representing a 12.94% increase and indicating heightened market participation.

Historical Price Context: Six-Month Decline from Musk-Driven Highs Dogecoin’s 2025 performance reflects a systematic decline from January peaks near $0.33 following post-election speculation around DOGE . February witnessed a sharp correction to $0.20 , followed by a stabilization of around $0.17 in March-April. Source: TradingView May’s minor recovery to $0.19 provided temporary relief before June’s further decline to near $0.16 . This six-month bear trend has established key support around $0.15 – $0.16 , representing a 51.5% decline from January highs. The broader range between $0.15 and $0.33 defines DOGE’s major trading corridor, with current prices testing the lower boundary of this established range. Historical analysis shows DOGE’s current price represents a 77.74% decline from the May 2021 all-time high of $0.7376 . Despite substantial retracement from peak levels, DOGE maintains extraordinary long-term gains of 191,964% from its May 2015 all-time low of $0.00008547 . Support & Resistance: Key Levels Define Range-Bound Trading Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $0.16167 , reinforced by the psychological $0.16 level where buying interest historically appears. The key support zone extends from $0.15000 to $0.15500 , representing major technical levels and potential accumulation areas. Major support lies within the $0.13000 – $0.14000 historical zone, corresponding to previous cycle lows and institutional buying levels. A breakdown below $0.155 would indicate a potential deeper correction toward these key support thresholds. Source: TradingView Resistance begins immediately at $0.16767 (today’s high), followed by the critical 20-day EMA at $0.17477 . This EMA represents the first major resistance hurdle, requiring sustained volume and momentum to overcome. The key resistance zone spans $0.18500 – $0.20000 , encompassing the EMA cluster where multiple moving averages converge. Breaking this level would indicate a potential trend reversal and open pathways toward higher resistance zones. Major resistance lies within the $0.24000 – $0.25000 range, representing previous cycle highs and substantial supply levels that would require substantial fundamental catalysts and sustained buying pressure to overcome.

When people’s saving are involved, extreme care must be taken."" — MartyParty (@martypartymusic) May 27, 2025 While cryptocurrency integration remains unconfirmed, speculation centers on potential Dogecoin inclusion given Musk’s historical support. The X platform commands an estimated 600-611 million monthly active users, representing a massive potential adoption scale for any integrated payment solution. The company has secured money transmitter licenses in 39 U.S. states , positioning for nationwide rollout once regulatory approvals are complete. Historical precedent shows Musk’s Dogecoin-related announcements have triggered large price movements, including 46% gains when X temporarily replaced its logo with the Doge meme in 2023. Current X Money development represents a potentially more substantial integration than previous symbolic gestures. Tesla continues accepting Dogecoin for merchandise payments while holding $1.1 billion in Bitcoin. Market Metrics: Fundamental Resilience Despite Technical Weakness Dogecoin maintains a market capitalization of $24.62 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $1.45 billion , representing a volume-to-market cap ratio of 5.94% . Due to the unlimited supply mechanism, the fully diluted valuation matches the market cap at $24.62 billion. Current trading activity shows a 12.94% volume increase, indicating heightened interest despite price consolidation. Circulating supply reaches 149.82 billion DOGE, with total supply at 149.82 billion . Despite recent underperformance, market dominance stands at 0.76% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, maintaining DOGE’s position among the top 10 digital assets. The wide gap between the current price and all-time highs suggests substantial upside potential during favorable market conditions. Volume-weighted metrics show sustained institutional participation, with daily trading volumes consistently exceeding $1 billion despite broader market uncertainty. This liquidity depth provides a foundation for strong price movements when catalysts emerge. Social Sentiment: Community Strength Amid Musk Speculation LunarCrush data reveals Dogecoin’s AltRank at 158 with a Galaxy Score of 69 , indicating strong social engagement relative to market performance. Engagement metrics total 2.36 million interactions with 41.51K mentions and 8.88K creators contributing to discussions. Sentiment is 81% positive, reflecting sustained community optimism despite recent price weakness. DOGE’s social dominance of 3.5% demonstrates its ability to capture attention relative to its market position. Dogecoin is seeing increased attention and potential for growth, with some analysts predicting a sharp price surge and a possible breakout above its current consolidation zone.

RSI divergence patterns on multiple timeframes suggest potential trend reversal, particularly if DOGE can establish support above $0.16 and begin forming higher lows. MACD histogram flattening indicates momentum deceleration that often precedes trend changes. Three-Month DOGE Price Forecast Scenarios Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case – 45% Probability) DOGE may continue trading within the $0.15 – $0.18 range pending X Money developments and broader market direction. The 20-day EMA at $0.17477 provides near-term resistance while $0.155 support offers downside protection. Source: TradingView This scenario requires sustained community engagement, moderate whale accumulation, and stable broader crypto market conditions without major Musk-related catalysts. Without substantial expansion, volume would likely remain elevated around current levels. Risk management involves monitoring daily closes above $0.17 for bullish momentum confirmation or below $0.155 for bearish breakdown warnings toward deeper support levels. Musk Catalyst Breakout (Bull Case – 35% Probability) The X Money cryptocurrency integration announcement could catalyze rapid price appreciation toward $0.25–$0.30, representing a 52–82% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView Historical precedent shows Musk’s announcements generating 40-200% gains within short timeframes. This scenario requires confirmed Dogecoin integration into X platform payments, sustained whale accumulation, and broader altcoin market recovery. Daily volume would need expansion above 1.5 billion DOGE to support sustained upward momentum. Key resistance levels at $0.175 , $0.20 , and $0.24 would need sequential clearing with volume confirmation for full bull case realization, potentially targeting the $0.30 – $0.35 range. Technical Breakdown (Bear Case – 20% Probability) Failure to hold $0.155 support could trigger selling toward $0.13 – $0.14 historical support levels. This scenario would require X Money developments, excluding DOGE, continued whale distribution, or broader crypto market weakness. Source: TradingView A breakdown below $0.155 with volume expansion would indicate a potential deeper correction toward major support zones. Risk management requires stop-loss placement below $0.15 for position protection. Recovery would depend on renewed Musk support, successful X platform developments, or broader market stabilization, which would provide fundamental support for price recovery. DOGE Price Forecast: Community Strength Meets Technical Inflection Dogecoin’s current position reflects the convergence of technical oversold conditions, strategic whale accumulation, and potential revolutionary catalyst through X platform integration. The 35-signal analysis reveals a cryptocurrency at a key juncture where fundamental developments could override technical bearishness. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, combined with the short but marked whale accumulation, suggests sophisticated investors anticipate catalyst-driven appreciation. Current price levels near $0.16 offer attractive risk-reward dynamics for investors seeking exposure to Musk-related developments. Critical Levels to Monitor Support defense at $0.155 – $0.16 remains essential for maintaining bullish structure potential, while resistance clearing above $0.175 could indicate momentum expansion toward X Money catalyst targets. Daily closes above the 20-day EMA at $0.18648 would confirm short-term trend reversal. Source: TradingView Over the next 90 days, investors should monitor X Money development announcements, continued possible whale accumulation patterns, broader altcoin sentiment, and Musk’s social media activity.

The partnership will see the launch of a dedicated Dogwifhat validator on the Solana blockchain. The collaboration brings together institutional-level infrastructure and one of the most active memecoin communities on Solana. DeFi Dev Corp and WIF Unite for Solana Validator Push According to the company, it will handle all technical operations, infrastructure, and performance management. Both parties will jointly promote the validator and seek stake delegations, including through an application to the Solana Foundation Delegation Program. 1/ The hat stays on! Today, we're announcing our newest validator partnership with the one and only @dogwifcoin . A dedicated $WIF validator – operated by DFDV, owned by the dogwifhat community. Institutional infrastructure meets one of $SOL 's most iconic communities. pic.twitter.com/VQK9SU1eOm — DeFi Dev Corp. (@defidevcorp) June 24, 2025 The validator will be operated by DeFi Dev Corp, but owned by the Dogwifhat community. Parker White, CIO and COO of DeFi Dev Corp, said the collaboration merges high-level infrastructure with one of the most active communities in crypto. “Our goal is simple: maximize performance, maximize visibility, and help secure Solana, all while deepening our alignment with WIF and the broader community it represents,” he said. The validator will follow a performance-based model. After covering expenses such as infrastructure and vote fees, the remaining rewards, staking income, block rewards, and MEV will be split equally between DeFi Dev Corp and the WIF community. The move is part of DeFi Dev Corp’s larger strategy to grow its “SOL per Share” metric, a figure that tracks how much SOL backs each share of DFDV. The company has been expanding this metric through Solana acquisitions, staking, and validator operations. DeFi Dev Corp, formerly known as Janover , shifted its focus to Solana in April 2024 after being acquired by former Kraken executives. The company has since positioned itself as a Solana-first public firm, drawing comparisons to MicroStrategy’s approach with Bitcoin. It currently holds around 609,000 SOL , valued at approximately $107 million. Dogwifhat (WIF), the Solana-based memecoin at the center of the validator partnership, traded at $0.86 at press time, with a 24-hour price increase of over 22%. The token saw over $711 million in trading volume in the past day, according to CoinGecko . WIF launched in November 2023 and quickly gained traction, in part due to support from prominent trader Ansem. DeFi Dev Corp previously secured a staking deal with Kraken, under which the exchange delegated a portion of its 4.5 million SOL holdings, worth about $500 million at the time, to DeFi Dev Corp’s validators. DeFi Dev Corp Expands Solana Strategy with Tokenized Shares and On-chain Capital Plans Following its launch of a Dogwifhat validator and community staking rewards, DeFi Development Corp is pushing deeper into the Solana ecosystem, despite regulatory friction in the U.S. Yesterday, the firm announced it would tokenize its shares through xStocks, a Solana-based platform developed by Backed. $DFDVx is coming to Solana very SOON thanks to @BackedFi & @xStocksFi ! Who is ready?! https://t.co/nwAFjjSKiE — DeFi Dev Corp. (@defidevcorp) June 24, 2025 The move is in collaboration with Kraken, which partnered with xStocks in May to offer tokenized shares of major U.S. companies like Apple and Tesla to global investors. @krakenfx will launch tokenized versions of over 50 U.S. stocks and ETFs for non-U.S. users, offering 24/7 trading via Solana. #kraken #solana #stocks https://t.co/j2QJ7K0hLs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 22, 2025 DeFi Dev Corp’s shares will soon join that lineup, available in token form and ready to integrate into DeFi protocols. “We view the tokenization of our stock as a DeFi Lego block,” said CEO Joseph Onorati, a former Kraken executive who took over leadership earlier this year. The initiative aligns with the company’s broader plan to make traditional equity more programmable and accessible within the Solana ecosystem. However, the company hit a regulatory snag. On June 13, it withdrew a $1 billion SEC filing after the regulator flagged its ineligibility for a streamlined S-3 registration , citing a missing internal controls report in its latest 10-K filing. The filing was intended to raise funds to purchase and stake Solana (SOL), an effort to mirror MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury strategy . While that plan is now in limbo, DeFi Dev Corp previously raised $42 million in April via convertible notes tied to Solana. The company has also made it clear that SOL is now its primary reserve asset, with staking rewards central to its future yield model. Despite setbacks, the company continues to build, bringing equity, staking, and community rewards closer together through Solana.

Yet, the challenge of securely managing and recovering these critical private keys remains a significant hurdle for many. Enter the Ledger Recovery Key , a groundbreaking development from Ledger, a leading name in crypto hardware wallets. This new tool promises to redefine how users safeguard their digital assets, offering an offline, ID-free solution for private key recovery. It’s a pivotal step towards truly empowering self-custody, addressing long-standing concerns about security, privacy, and user control in the crypto space. What is the Revolutionary Ledger Recovery Key? For years, Ledger has been at the forefront of providing robust hardware wallet security . Their devices are designed to keep your private keys isolated from internet-connected devices, drastically reducing the risk of cyber theft. However, the process of recovering access to your funds if your device is lost or damaged has always presented a unique challenge. Traditionally, this relies on a 24-word seed phrase, which, while secure, requires meticulous offline storage and careful handling. The newly launched Ledger Recovery Key (distinct from the earlier, cloud-based ‘Ledger Recover’ service which faced community backlash) is an innovative, NFC-based offline tool specifically designed for users of Ledger Flex or Stax wallets. Here’s how it works at a high level: Offline Operation: Crucially, this device operates entirely offline. It does not connect to the internet, eliminating vulnerabilities associated with online data exposure. NFC-Based Interaction: Users simply tap a smart card (which presumably holds an encrypted shard of their private key) to the NFC-enabled Ledger device. PIN Verification: A personal identification number (PIN) is then entered on the Ledger device to complete the recovery process. No ID or Cloud Required: Unlike many conventional recovery services or even Ledger’s previous iteration, this system explicitly requires no identity verification (KYC) and no reliance on cloud storage. This is a massive win for privacy and decentralization advocates. Open-Sourced for Transparency: To foster trust and allow for community auditing, Ledger has committed to open-sourcing aspects of this new technology. Transparency is paramount in security tools, especially after past controversies. This approach marks a significant evolution in private key recovery mechanisms, offering a highly secure and user-friendly alternative to traditional seed phrase backups, without compromising the core tenets of self-custody. Why is Offline Crypto Storage Absolutely Critical? The digital realm, for all its convenience, is fraught with risks. Centralized exchanges, while convenient, are honey pots for hackers. Software wallets, while better than exchanges, are still vulnerable to malware on your computer or phone. This is where offline crypto storage , particularly through hardware wallets, becomes indispensable. Think of it this way: your private keys are the actual ownership deeds to your digital assets. If they are exposed online, even for a moment, they can be stolen. Cloud storage, while convenient for photos and documents, introduces a centralized point of failure and potential vulnerability when it comes to highly sensitive cryptographic keys. A data breach on a cloud server could compromise millions of users. The Ledger Recovery Key’s commitment to remaining entirely offline for the recovery process significantly bolsters security. It means: Aspect Traditional Online/Cloud Recovery Ledger Recovery Key (Offline) Exposure Risk High (internet connection, server vulnerabilities) Minimal (no internet connection during recovery) Privacy Potentially compromised (KYC, data retention) Enhanced (no ID, no third-party data) Control Shared with service provider Solely with the user Censorship Resistance Lower (can be influenced by regulations/providers) Higher (independent of centralized entities) By keeping the recovery process air-gapped, Ledger empowers users to maintain complete sovereignty over their assets, aligning perfectly with the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency. How Does This Impact Private Key Recovery and User Control? Understanding private key recovery is fundamental to secure crypto ownership. A private key is a secret number that allows you to spend your cryptocurrencies. Lose it, and your funds are gone forever. Traditionally, the seed phrase (a series of 12 or 24 words) is the master key for recovery. While effective, it presents its own challenges: Physical Security: The seed phrase must be stored physically in a secure location, protected from fire, water, and theft. Human Error: Miswriting a single word can render the seed phrase useless. Complexity for New Users: Explaining the importance and proper handling of a seed phrase can be daunting for crypto newcomers. The Ledger Recovery Key offers an alternative or supplementary method. While Ledger has not explicitly stated it replaces the seed phrase entirely, it provides a different recovery vector. By utilizing a smart card and PIN, it simplifies the user experience while maintaining a high level of security. This method is particularly appealing because it: Reduces Single Point of Failure: Instead of relying solely on one physical piece of paper, the recovery process involves a smart card and a PIN, potentially distributed or managed in a multi-factor way. Enhances User Experience: Tapping a card and entering a PIN can be less intimidating than manually re-entering a long seed phrase. Promotes Broader Adoption: A more user-friendly recovery mechanism can lower the barrier to entry for mainstream users hesitant about the complexities of self-custody. This development is a testament to the ongoing innovation in making self-custody tools more accessible and robust, without sacrificing the core principles of security and decentralization. The Evolution of Hardware Wallet Security: Addressing Past Concerns The journey of hardware wallet security has been marked by continuous innovation and, at times, public scrutiny. Ledger, like any prominent player, has faced its share of challenges. The most notable recent example was the ‘Ledger Recover’ service, which proposed a sharded seed phrase recovery solution involving identity verification and cloud storage with third-party custodians. While the intention behind ‘Ledger Recover’ was to offer a convenient recovery option, it sparked significant controversy within the crypto community. Users expressed concerns about: Centralization: The involvement of third-party custodians and cloud storage raised fears of centralization and potential government access to recovery data. Trust and Transparency: The community felt that the feature was not clearly communicated, leading to a perceived breach of trust regarding the immutable nature of hardware wallet private keys. KYC Requirements: The need for identity verification went against the privacy-preserving ethos many crypto users value. The launch of the Ledger Recovery Key appears to be a direct response to these concerns. By making the new tool entirely offline, requiring no ID, and committing to open-sourcing, Ledger is actively listening to its community and pivoting towards solutions that prioritize decentralization, privacy, and user control. This iterative improvement demonstrates a commitment to evolving security standards and rebuilding trust. Leveraging Self-Custody Tools for Ultimate Control The ultimate goal of cryptocurrency is financial sovereignty, and self-custody tools like hardware wallets are the bedrock of this principle. They empower individuals to be their own bank, free from the risks associated with third-party intermediaries. The Ledger Recovery Key enhances this empowerment by providing a resilient and private recovery mechanism. Benefits of Enhanced Self-Custody: Unparalleled Security: Your keys are isolated, significantly reducing attack vectors. True Ownership: You have direct control over your assets, not a third party. Privacy: No KYC for holding or recovering your funds with the new tool. Censorship Resistance: Your funds cannot be frozen or seized by external entities. Challenges and Actionable Insights: While self-custody offers immense benefits, it also places significant responsibility on the user. The challenges often revolve around proper management and education. Actionable Insights for Users: Diversify Recovery Methods: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Use your seed phrase backup securely, and consider if the Ledger Recovery Key fits into your personal security strategy. Educate Yourself: Understand how your hardware wallet works, the importance of your private keys, and the nuances of different recovery methods. Test Your Recovery: Periodically practice recovering a small amount of funds to ensure your recovery method works as expected. Stay Informed: Follow reputable sources for updates on hardware wallet security and best practices. Layer Your Security: Use strong PINs, enable passphrases if your device supports them, and store your physical backups in secure, geographically dispersed locations. The Ledger Recovery Key represents a significant step forward in making advanced security more accessible, but user vigilance remains the most crucial component of any robust crypto security strategy. The Future of Crypto Security: A More User-Centric Approach The introduction of the Ledger Recovery Key signals a clear direction for the future of crypto security: one that prioritizes user control, privacy, and robust offline solutions. This development, coupled with Ledger’s commitment to open-sourcing, can help rebuild trust and set a new standard for how hardware wallet manufacturers approach key recovery. As the crypto ecosystem matures, the demand for sophisticated yet user-friendly security tools will only grow. Solutions that empower individuals to truly own and manage their digital wealth, without relying on centralized intermediaries or compromising their privacy, will be the ones that drive mainstream adoption. Ledger’s latest offering is a powerful testament to this evolving landscape, promising a more secure and autonomous future for crypto holders worldwide.

The announcement , made Tuesday morning, comes as lawmakers prepare for a new round of discussions seeking to build a legislative framework for crypto in the U.S. Senator Tim Scott, GOP Allies Lay Groundwork for Crypto Regulation Framework The principles were put forward by Senator Tim Scott, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, along with Senators Thom Tillis, Bill Hagerty, and Cynthia Lummis. Their proposal marks the Senate’s clearest indicator yet that it is ready to engage with the House in shaping broad crypto market structure laws. “These principles will serve as an important baseline for negotiations on this bill, and I’m hopeful my colleagues will put politics aside and provide long-overdue clarity for digital asset regulation,” Senator Scott said. NEW: Here are @BankingGOP ’s newly released market structure principles signed by @SenatorTimScott , @SenLummis , @SenatorHagerty and @SenThomTillis .

It also includes targeted anti-money laundering rules described as “pro-innovation” and encourages federal regulators to use tools like no-action letters, sandboxes, and safe harbors to work more closely with crypto projects. Tuesday’s announcement comes ahead of a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee’s subcommittee on digital assets. Senator Lummis, who chairs the subcommittee, said the U.S. has been falling behind global peers. “While the European Union and Singapore have established clear regulations, the U.S. continues to sit on the sidelines while the digital asset industry seeks greener pastures,” she said. “That changes today.” NEW: @SenatorTimScott , @SenLummis , @SenThomTillis , & @SenatorHagerty unveiled principles for digital asset market structure legislation. These will guide bipartisan efforts to bring regulatory clarity, foster innovation, & protect investors. Read more: https://t.co/5NVwlsUvlZ — U.S. Senate Banking Committee GOP (@BankingGOP) June 24, 2025 A Senate hearing was held Tuesday afternoon to begin examining market structure policy in greater detail. Witnesses included legal representatives from Coinbase and Multicoin Capital, as well as a digital finance expert from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. The discussion was billed as one of the Senate’s first major steps following its recent passage of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act . That bill passed the Senate on June 17 in a 68–30 vote , drawing support from nearly all Republicans and 18 Democrats. The legislation is now with the House of Representatives, where lawmakers are weighing how to proceed. Options under consideration include passing the bill unchanged, merging it with the House’s version of stablecoin legislation, or combining it with the market structure bill in a broader package. Trump Demands Fast-Track for Stablecoin Bill as House Weighs Broader Crypto Package President Donald Trump has urged the House to move “LIGHTNING FAST” and send the stablecoin bill to his desk without changes . “The Senate just passed an incredible Bill that is going to make America the UNDISPUTED Leader in Digital Assets,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “Get it to my desk, ASAP—NO DELAYS, NO ADD ONS.” Trump has urged the House to pass the GENIUS bill without delay or amendments, calling for it to be sent to his desk immediately after approval. #GENIUS #Stablecoins https://t.co/Oat2MMoJyq — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 However, House Financial Services Chairman French Hill has said he wants to move the stablecoin and market structure bills together. That could complicate things, especially if the Senate introduces its own version of the market structure legislation rather than adopting the House’s CLARITY Act. The House has already made progress on the CLARITY Act , which passed through both the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees earlier this month. The bill is expected to head to the House floor soon. Lawmakers on the US @HouseAgGOP have voted 47-6 to advance the CLARITY Act. #CryptoRegulation #Clarity https://t.co/qJvKBIHl50 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 10, 2025 As both chambers weigh their options, questions remain over how much bipartisan agreement can be reached, especially with Democrats raising concerns about crypto’s role in illicit finance and the personal ties between the Trump family and the industry. Several lawmakers have expressed skepticism about how the legislation could benefit Trump or his allies, citing memecoins, digital asset donations, and connections to the World Liberty Financial platform. Still, Senator Lummis emphasized that last week’s vote was just the beginning. “The stablecoin bill is only the first step,” she said on the Senate floor. “Now we must finish what we started and pass a strong market structure bill before the year ends.” For now, both chambers are continuing on separate but parallel tracks. Whether they can align before the November elections is still unclear. But Tuesday’s hearing and the release of formal Senate principles suggest the groundwork for compromise is now in place.

What was once considered a niche, volatile asset is rapidly solidifying its position as a cornerstone of digital wealth, especially for sophisticated players. A recent report by Bybit, highlighted by Cointelegraph, reveals a truly compelling trend: the share of Bitcoin portfolio holdings has seen a remarkable surge, climbing from 25.4% in November last year to an impressive 30.9% as of May. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a profound change in how investors, particularly large institutions, view and integrate the world’s leading cryptocurrency into their financial strategies. The Ascendance of Bitcoin in Investor Portfolios: What Does it Mean? This notable increase in Bitcoin’s allocation within crypto investor portfolios isn’t happening in a vacuum. It reflects a growing confidence and maturation of the asset class. For years, Bitcoin has been lauded as ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against inflation, but its journey into mainstream finance has been gradual. The Bybit report provides tangible evidence that this integration is accelerating. The jump from a quarter to nearly a third of a typical crypto portfolio dedicated to BTC suggests a strategic re-evaluation by investors who are increasingly prioritizing stability and long-term value in a dynamic market. This shift has several layers of implications: De-risking Portfolios: For many, Bitcoin represents a less volatile alternative compared to the broader altcoin market, especially during periods of uncertainty. Its growing market capitalization and liquidity make it a more robust store of value. Institutional Validation: The primary driver behind this growth, as we’ll explore, is the influx of institutional capital. When large financial entities commit significant funds, it sends a powerful signal of legitimacy to the entire market. Benchmark Asset: Bitcoin is increasingly becoming the benchmark against which other cryptocurrencies are measured. Its performance often dictates the sentiment across the wider crypto ecosystem. Long-Term Strategy: The increased allocation indicates a long-term strategic play rather than short-term speculation. Investors are holding BTC with a view towards its enduring value proposition. Institutional Bitcoin Investment: The ETF Catalyst The catalyst for this monumental shift is undeniably the launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. These investment vehicles have revolutionized access to Bitcoin for a wide array of investors, particularly traditional financial institutions that were previously hesitant or unable to directly hold cryptocurrencies due to regulatory complexities or operational hurdles. Spot BTC ETFs provide a regulated, familiar, and highly liquid avenue for exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the need for direct custody or managing private keys. The impact of these ETFs has been profound: Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: ETFs act as a crucial bridge, allowing pension funds, endowments, wealth managers, and corporate treasuries to seamlessly add Bitcoin to their diversified portfolios. This eliminates many of the operational and compliance challenges associated with direct crypto purchases. Massive Capital Inflow: Since their inception, spot BTC ETFs have attracted billions of dollars in fresh capital, much of which is new money entering the crypto space from traditional finance. This consistent demand has been a significant factor in Bitcoin’s price performance and its growing portfolio share. Enhanced Liquidity: The sheer volume of trading in these ETFs contributes to Bitcoin’s overall market liquidity, making it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting prices. Increased Market Transparency: As regulated products, ETFs bring a layer of transparency and oversight that was previously less prevalent in the direct crypto market, further assuaging institutional concerns. The very existence of these ETFs is a testament to Bitcoin’s journey from a fringe asset to a recognized component of the global financial system. It underscores the growing consensus among financial professionals that Bitcoin is here to stay and deserves a place in diversified investment strategies. Corporations Embracing Bitcoin as Corporate Treasury Assets Beyond traditional financial institutions, a fascinating trend highlighted by the Bybit report is the increasing number of corporations adding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET corroborates this, showing a near doubling of firms holding BTC on their balance sheets in just a few weeks – from 124 to over 244 companies. This isn’t just about investment; it’s about strategic corporate finance. Why are corporations, from tech giants to smaller enterprises, making this move? Inflation Hedge: In an era of persistent inflation concerns, companies are seeking alternative stores of value beyond traditional fiat currencies, which can lose purchasing power over time. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive option. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding Bitcoin can be seen as a way to diversify corporate reserves and potentially generate returns on idle cash that would otherwise be subject to inflationary erosion. Forward-Thinking Strategy: Companies adopting Bitcoin early demonstrate a forward-thinking approach, positioning themselves at the forefront of digital asset innovation. This can appeal to tech-savvy investors and customers. Competitive Advantage: For some businesses, particularly those operating in or around the blockchain space, holding Bitcoin aligns with their core mission and can offer a competitive edge. The growing list of companies publicly declaring their Bitcoin holdings, with pioneers like MicroStrategy leading the charge, illustrates a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable corporate asset. This institutional and corporate embrace provides a robust foundation for Bitcoin’s continued growth and stability within the global financial ecosystem. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends with Bitcoin at the Helm The increased share of Bitcoin in investor portfolios also significantly influences broader crypto market trends . Bitcoin’s dominance typically waxes and wanes, but its current upward trajectory in portfolio allocation suggests a flight to quality or a consolidation of investment into the market leader. When Bitcoin performs strongly and attracts significant institutional capital, it often sets the tone for the entire crypto market. Key observations regarding these trends include: Bitcoin Dominance Effect: A higher Bitcoin allocation in portfolios can sometimes lead to a period where Bitcoin outperforms altcoins, as capital flows into the largest and most liquid asset. This doesn’t mean altcoins are irrelevant, but it highlights Bitcoin’s role as the primary entry point and store of value for many. Market Maturation: The shift towards Bitcoin signifies a maturing market where investors are becoming more discerning. Rather than chasing every new altcoin, there’s a growing preference for established, secure, and widely adopted assets. Risk Management: For many professional investors, increasing Bitcoin exposure is part of a calculated risk management strategy. While still volatile, Bitcoin is generally perceived as having lower idiosyncratic risk compared to smaller, less liquid cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Clarity: As more jurisdictions move towards clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets, Bitcoin often benefits first, as it is the most recognized and least likely to be classified as a security in many regions. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the complexities of the digital asset space effectively. Bitcoin’s position as the market’s anchor asset means its movements and institutional adoption often foreshadow broader market sentiment and direction. Deeper Dive into Bybit Report Analysis: Actionable Insights for Investors The insights from the Bybit report analysis offer valuable guidance for both seasoned crypto veterans and newcomers. While the report highlights a significant shift among large investors, it provides a blueprint for how individual investors might consider optimizing their own portfolios. It’s not merely about following the crowd, but understanding the underlying rationale behind these major movements. Here are some actionable insights derived from the report’s findings: Re-evaluate Your Bitcoin Allocation: If your Bitcoin exposure is significantly lower than the reported 30.9% average for crypto investors, it might be worth re-evaluating your portfolio’s balance. Consider whether your current allocation aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term investment goals. Understand the ‘Why’ Behind Institutional Adoption: Don’t just focus on the numbers; delve into why institutions are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin. This includes its finite supply, decentralization, network security, and its growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class via ETFs. Diversification Remains Key: While Bitcoin’s share is growing, it doesn’t mean a 100% BTC portfolio is suitable for everyone. Diversification across a select number of strong altcoins with clear use cases and solid fundamentals can still offer significant growth potential. However, the report suggests a foundational emphasis on Bitcoin. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The success of spot BTC ETFs underscores the importance of regulatory clarity. Keep an eye on global regulatory trends, as they can significantly impact institutional interest and market liquidity. Long-Term Horizon: The institutional accumulation of Bitcoin points towards a long-term bullish outlook. For retail investors, this reinforces the strategy of dollar-cost averaging and holding for the long term, rather than trying to time short-term market fluctuations. It’s important to remember that all investments carry risk, and the crypto market is known for its volatility. However, the data from Bybit suggests a growing maturity and institutional validation that could lead to more stable growth trajectories for Bitcoin in the future. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Ascent in the Investment World The latest Bybit report serves as a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s undeniable ascent in the investment world. The remarkable growth of its share in crypto investor portfolios, from 25.4% to 30.9%, is not merely a statistical anomaly but a clear indicator of a fundamental shift. This transformation is largely fueled by the groundbreaking introduction of spot BTC ETFs, which have unlocked unprecedented avenues for institutional capital to flow into the digital asset space. Furthermore, the near doubling of corporations adding Bitcoin to their treasury assets underscores a broader, strategic recognition of its value as an inflation hedge and a robust balance sheet component. As Bitcoin continues to cement its position as the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, its growing institutional adoption and increasing portfolio dominance signal a maturing market and a future where digital assets play an ever more central role in global finance. For investors, understanding these profound shifts is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape and positioning their portfolios for future success.

As Bitcoin recently shattered records by surpassing $111,000, attention is shifting toward high-upside altcoins, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Stands Out Explosive Presale Momentum: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale has attracted millions, with its token still priced under $0.001. This early-stage enthusiasm mirrors the kind of grassroots excitement that fueled early Bitcoin and Ethereum cycles Scarcity and Tokenomics: The project boasts a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, with 60% allocated to presale participants. This scarcity-driven model is designed to drive demand and reduce dilution risk as the asset enters secondary markets. Community and Political Relevance: A fast-growing community, now exceeding 20,000 holders, and meme-driven branding have given MAGACOIN FINANCE a unique cultural resonance, attracting both retail and institutional interest. Technical Foundation: Built on Ethereum and integrated with Injective Protocol, MAGACOIN FINANCE leverages robust smart contract capabilities and advanced trading functionalities, further enhancing its appeal and utility. Analyst Projections: Returns That Rival Bitcoin While Bitcoin’s move from $111,000 to a potential $150,000 would represent about 35% upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE is projected by multiple analysts to deliver returns ranging from 25x to 77x as it enters price discovery on major exchanges. Some models even suggest a move to $0.03 or beyond, implying 50x–60x upside from current levels. Experts point to the asset’s current presale valuation as being significantly disconnected from its long-term potential—a setup reminiscent of early Bitcoin cycles. “ MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the few that checks all the boxes—fresh, relevant, and still early. The window for early entry is closing fast—making it a top contender for 2025’s breakout story. XRP: Cross-Border Payments and Institutional Adoption XRP continues to solidify its role in cross-border payments, benefiting from increased adoption by financial institutions and regulatory clarity in key markets. The XRP Ledger has seen upgrades in 2025, expanding its smart contract capabilities and interoperability, which could drive further ecosystem growth. Analysts remain bullish, with targets as high as $3 in play, citing strong fundamentals and ongoing accumulation by long-term holders VeChain: Quietly Building Toward a Breakout VeChain is trading near $0.022, with technical analysts forecasting a climb toward $0.035 in the near term and even long-term targets as high as $2.5. The project’s focus on supply chain management and integration of blockchain with IoT and AI technologies positions it for significant enterprise adoption. As traders rotate profits from Bitcoin and XRP into emerging opportunities, VeChain stands to benefit from renewed attention and liquidity inflows. The Altcoin Rotation: What Comes Next The 2025 crypto cycle is defined by a clear trend: as Bitcoin’s upside moderates, capital is rotating into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, while established projects like XRP and VeChain are poised for renewed momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s combination of scarcity, community, and technical innovation has positioned it as the breakout contender, with analysts forecasting returns that could rival Bitcoin’s legendary gains. Meanwhile, XRP’s institutional adoption and VeChain’s enterprise focus make them top picks for traders watching for the next wave of growth. As the market evolves, all eyes are on whether MAGACOIN FINANCE can truly become the next Bitcoin-level success —and which altcoins will ride alongside into the spotlight.

Chinese auto makers attracted global scrutiny after a Reuters investigation revealed the widespread manipulation of vehicle sales figures through the export of so-called “ zero-mileage ” used cars. These vehicles, fresh off the assembly line and never driven, are being registered as “used” before being exported to overseas markets, supposedly to inflate sales numbers artificially. The practice has raised accusations of economic dishonesty and international dumping. This scheme has reportedly been running since 2019, and has flourished with the backing of local governments eager to boost their regional GDP to meet the performance targets set by Beijing. Auto sales scandal raises eyebrows Reuters found that at least 20 jurisdictions, including major export areas such as Guangdong and Sichuan, had publicly supported or facilitated the export of zero-mileage used cars through tax incentives, infrastructure support, and special export licenses. Shenzhen’s development commission announced its plans to include zero-mileage used cars in its target to export 400,000 vehicles in 2024. Guangzhou created new vehicle registration quotas specifically for zero-mileage gasoline cars, despite environmental restrictions. And in Sichuan, authorities partnered with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba to promote the online sale of these cars. “The goal is simple: show sales growth and hit performance targets at any cost,” Tu Le, a U.S.-based analyst and the founder of Sino Auto Insights, said. “It’s the result of a four-year price war that’s pushed carmakers to the edge.” The result has been an explosion in used car exports. Industry insiders have estimated that 90% of China’s 436,000 used car exports in 2024 were, in fact, zero-mileage. The incentives for local governments don’t stop at just sales numbers. Each transaction involves both a “new car sale” and a “used car export,” which means the economic activity is recorded twice, further boosting GDP tallies. According to two industry executives, this makes these transactions particularly attractive for regional officials looking to curry favor with Beijing. Critics are warning that this practice not only threatens the credibility of China’s carmakers on a global scale, but could also trigger retaliation from foreign regulators already wary of China’s growing dominance in the global auto market. Dumping accusations are intensifying The mass export of new vehicles labeled as “used” is distorting foreign markets and fueling accusations that China is “ dumping ” unwanted vehicles overseas to relieve domestic overcapacity. Russia, one of the largest recipients of these cars, issued a decree in 2023 banning zero-mileage used cars from manufacturers with official distributors, directly targeting Chinese brands such as Chery, Geely, and Changan. The Chinese border city of Heihe acknowledged the ban in a public notice, but the affected automakers either declined to comment or failed to respond to inquiries. Other countries are also beginning to tighten definitions of “used cars” to stop the exploitation of this loophole. Jordan, for instance, is mandating a waiting period after a car is registered before it can be classified as used. “The influx is creating friction in markets with established manufacturers and dealership networks,” Michael Dunne, an industry consultant specializing in Chinese auto exports said. “It’s not just about market share—it’s about trust.” Back in China, some company executives are beginning to distance themselves from the practice. Zhu Huarong, the chairman of Changan, warned at a recent conference that zero-mileage exports could “enormously damage Chinese brands’ image” overseas. Xing Lei, who runs the U.S.-based consultancy, AutoXing, also expressed his concern regarding the practice. “If investors start wondering how many sales are real and how many are padded, confidence in the sector could collapse,” he said. Excess production has ignited a bitter price war among automakers, and even subsidized electric vehicles are being offloaded in overseas markets for quick cash. William Ng of Huanyu Auto in Chongqing said his company earned as much as 10,000 yuan, which is about $1,400, in profit per vehicle by reselling EVs bought for 40,000 yuan in Central Asia. Ng complained that independent traders, livestreamers, and TikTok influencers were flooding the zero-mileage used car market, likening it to “selling wine or vases one day and cars the next.” People’s Daily recently condemned the sale of zero-mileage cars within China, but the government has remained silent on the export practice. Neither the State Council nor the commerce ministry responded to requests for comment. On the other hand, the China Passenger Car Association boldly defended the practice as a strategic workaround for global trade barriers, particularly in markets where Chinese brands face entry restrictions or lack consumer recognition.

Japan, a nation long recognized for its technological prowess and forward-thinking approach, is on the cusp of a revolutionary change in its cryptocurrency landscape. For crypto enthusiasts and investors worldwide, the news coming out of Tokyo is nothing short of electrifying. The potential for groundbreaking reforms could redefine how digital assets are viewed, traded, and taxed, setting a powerful precedent for global markets. Understanding Japan’s Crypto Regulation Shift Japan has consistently been a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market, often setting precedents for other nations. Now, the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is proposing a pivotal regulatory overhaul that could redefine how digital assets are treated. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental reclassification that aims to bring crypto assets under the robust framework of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). The FIEA is Japan’s primary legislation governing financial instruments and services, covering everything from stocks and bonds to derivatives. By bringing crypto under this umbrella, the FSA is signaling a clear intent to treat digital assets with the same level of scrutiny and investor protection as traditional financial products. This move, set for review on June 25, according to insights from Wu Blockchain on X, signifies a mature approach to integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system, offering greater clarity and stability for all market participants. The Promise of Bitcoin ETFs Japan: A New Era for Investment? One of the most anticipated outcomes of this regulatory shift is the potential for the approval of Bitcoin ETFs Japan . What exactly does this mean for the market? Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) for Bitcoin would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. This opens the floodgates for institutional capital and a broader base of retail investors who might be hesitant to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in Japan could lead to several profound benefits: Increased Accessibility: Investors can buy and sell Bitcoin exposure through their existing brokerage accounts, simplifying the process. Enhanced Liquidity: A surge in institutional participation often leads to deeper markets and improved liquidity. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering an added layer of investor protection and legitimacy. Mainstream Adoption: The presence of Bitcoin ETFs on traditional exchanges signals a maturation of the asset class, attracting more conservative investors. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs in other major economies, particularly the United States, Japan’s move could further legitimize Bitcoin as a serious investment asset on a global scale, drawing in significant new capital. A Game-Changer: The Flat Crypto Tax Proposal Beyond the excitement of ETFs, Japan is also addressing one of the most significant pain points for crypto traders: taxation. Currently, crypto profits in Japan are subject to a progressive tax system, which can soar up to an eye-watering 55% for high earners. Imagine making substantial gains only to see more than half of it vanish in taxes – it’s a major deterrent for active trading and long-term holding. The new proposal aims to replace this with a much more favorable flat crypto tax rate of 20%. This change is not merely about reducing the tax burden; it’s about fostering a more vibrant and active crypto market. A flat, predictable tax rate can: Incentivize Trading: Lower taxes on profits encourage more frequent and larger transactions. Attract Investors: Both domestic and international investors may find Japan a more appealing jurisdiction for crypto activities. Promote Transparency: A simpler tax structure can lead to higher compliance rates. Stimulate Growth: More capital remaining within the crypto ecosystem can fuel innovation and development. This pragmatic approach to taxation demonstrates Japan’s commitment to creating an environment where digital assets can thrive, aligning its policies with the dynamic nature of the crypto market. Boosting Crypto Investment in the Land of the Rising Sun These combined changes are poised to significantly boost crypto investment across Japan. Lower taxes mean more disposable income for reinvestment, encouraging both new and existing participants to engage more actively in the market. The introduction of ETFs provides a regulated, familiar pathway for traditional finance players to enter the crypto space, lending credibility and stability to the ecosystem. This could lead to a virtuous cycle of increased liquidity, better price discovery, and greater overall market maturity. For individuals and institutions alike, Japan is signaling that it is open for crypto business. This proactive stance could solidify its position as a global leader in responsible crypto adoption, potentially inspiring other nations to re-evaluate their own regulatory and tax frameworks. The synergy between regulatory clarity, investor access through ETFs, and a fair tax system creates a compelling proposition for anyone looking to engage with digital assets in a secure and profitable manner. Navigating the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act: A Deeper Dive The decision to regulate crypto assets under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA) is a strategic one that brings substantial benefits. FIEA provides a comprehensive framework that includes stringent requirements for financial service providers, such as: Licensing and Registration: Crypto exchanges and service providers will need to meet strict criteria to operate, ensuring only legitimate entities are active. Customer Asset Segregation: Mandates that customer funds and assets must be kept separate from the company’s operational funds, offering protection in case of insolvency. Disclosure Requirements: Companies must provide transparent information about their services, risks, and financial health. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Protocols: Reinforces measures to prevent illicit financial activities, enhancing the integrity of the market. By applying these established financial regulations to crypto, Japan aims to mitigate risks associated with market manipulation, fraud, and illicit financing, thereby fostering a safer and more trustworthy environment for investors. This level of regulatory clarity is often what institutional investors seek before committing significant capital, making Japan an increasingly attractive destination for crypto-related ventures. Potential Challenges and Future Outlook While the proposed changes are overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential challenges. The implementation process itself will require careful planning and coordination between the FSA, crypto businesses, and traditional financial institutions. Furthermore, the global nature of cryptocurrency means that Japan’s regulatory framework will need to remain adaptable to evolving international standards and technological advancements. However, the proactive stance taken by the FSA suggests a strong commitment to fostering a healthy and secure crypto environment, indicating that Japan is ready to navigate these complexities. Japan’s bold stride towards a more favorable crypto regulatory environment marks a significant milestone for the global digital asset industry. By paving the way for Bitcoin ETFs and proposing a pragmatic flat tax rate, the nation is not only attracting substantial capital but also setting a powerful precedent for other countries grappling with crypto integration. This move could solidify Japan’s position as a leading hub for innovation and responsible growth in the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies, promising a brighter, more accessible future for all.

Ryan VanGrack Urges Clear, National Framework At the June 24 hearing entitled “Exploring Bipartisan Legislative Frameworks for Digital Asset Market Structure,” VanGrack urged U.S. lawmakers to develop “a responsible and robust legal framework” that works for all Americans. “Crypto regulation is not, and never should be, a partisan issue,” VanGrack said. “Economic empowerment, financial innovation, and customer protection are not Republican or Democratic values; they are American values.” Appearing alongside several heavyweight names in the crypto regulatory sector, the Coinbase executive also criticized the United States’ lack of clear market structure when it comes to the digital asset sector. “The absence of clear rules for market structure has forced economic opportunities to move offshore and has left customers behind,” he added. “Regulatory uncertainty doesn’t just carry risks—it actively holds back progress.” Congress Must Act Fast, Lummis Says VanGrack’s comments came shortly after Senate Banking Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC), Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Senator Bill Hagerty (R-TN) introduced six central principles for the development of comprehensive market structure legislation.

The Senate has been a hotbed of crypto activity lately, with the GENIUS Act passing through the chamber just last week in a key victory for digital asset legislation in the United States. Following the GENIUS Act’s advancement to the House, Lummis warned that “Congress must act quickly” to enact additional crypto regulatory measures in order to bolster the legislation. “The success of the GENIUS Act hinges on comprehensive market structure legislation that protects consumers, establishes transparency, and creates clearly defined trading regulations,” Lummis said.

This investment would bring the company’s total value to $1 billion, marking a major milestone in its growth. According to a recent report, the deal is nearly finalized, marking a strong return of interest in decentralized prediction markets. Predictions Platform Sees Renewed Users’ Interest The new round of funding comes when the market for prediction platforms is regaining attention. Last year’s U.S. presidential election between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris brought a lot of excitement to Polymarket . Reportedly, millions of users placed bets on who would win. Just one day before the November 4, 2024, election, more than $3 billion was traded on the Trump vs. Harris market alone. After the election, activity on the platform dropped, with fewer users and lower trading volumes in early 2025. Now, that trend is changing. Since March, Polymarket has seen three straight months of growth in trading volume. Volume grew by 21% between March and April; from April to May, it grew another 17%. Polymarket’s trading volume reached over $1 billion in May, its best month since January. By the end of May, the platform had processed $13.89 billion in trades. Polymarket’s Funding History and Future Plans This new $200 million deal adds to Polymarket’s earlier funding rounds. In May 2024, the company raised $45 million through a Series B round. Before that, it had quietly raised $25 million in a Series A round led by the venture capital firm General Catalyst. Last year, Polymarket also considered raising another $50 million and was working on launching its own token , which users could use to settle their bets on the platform. If this new deal goes through, Polymarket will have raised far more than one of its main competitors, Kalshi. Kalshi raised $30 million in a Series A round in 2021 and several short-term loans from investors. Compared to that, Polymarket’s total funding would place it in a much stronger financial position within the prediction market space. Polymarket Thrives Abroad After U.S. Regulatory Setback Polymarket allows users to predict many events, from politics and sports to economics and global news. The platform runs on blockchain technology, which means all trades are secure, transparent, and peer-to-peer. However, Polymarket has had some trouble with U.S. regulators . In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) fined the company $1.4 million, forcing Polymarket to shut down some of its services in the U.S. Now, most of its trading volume comes from users outside the country. Meanwhile, Thailand’s cybercrime investigation bureau is also looking to ban Polymarket, citing online gambling concerns.

The crypto is trading at $2.2, and the RSI is approaching neutral territory at 44.59 . Source: Cryptonews XRP is trading up 5.64% daily within a tight $2.08—$2.21 range and faces KEY resistance at the 200-day EMA around $2.43 amid moderate volatility and elevated social engagement. The market cap reached $129.89 billion , with 24-hour volume exceeding $4.26 billion, accustomed with a modest 1.08% rise in trading activity. The following analysis was conducted using ChatGPT’s o3 AI model. It synthesized 42 real-time technical indicators, on-chain whale movements, regulatory developments, and social sentiment metrics to assess XRP’s 90-day price trajectory. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Consolidation Below Key EMAs Amid Oversold Development XRP’s current price of $2.20 reflects a modest +5.64% daily increase from an opening price of $2.158 . This establishes a narrow trading range between $2.21 (high) and $2.08 (low), a 2.28% intraday spread indicating moderate volatility compression. The RSI, at 44.62 , approaches neutral territory, suggesting potential for a relief bounce despite broader consolidation pressure. This reading places XRP closer to oversold conditions than many major cryptocurrencies, which historically precede short-term rebounds when combined with strong fundamental catalysts. MACD indicators show bearish momentum with the MACD line at +0.0004 trading below the signal line at -0.0335 , though the negative histogram at -0.0339 suggests momentum may be stabilizing. The relatively shallow MACD divergence indicates potential for trend reversal if volume increases. Source: TradingView Moving averages, however, create a challenging overhead resistance structure across all timeframes. The 20-day EMA at $2.1738 sits 1.2% below the current price, while the 50-day EMA at $2.2167 represents 1.5% overhead resistance. The 100-day EMA at $2.0972 and the 200-day EMA at $2.2326 cluster between – 2.6% and +1.4% above current levels. The 200-day EMA at $2.2326 represents the nearest major resistance level, requiring only a 1.6% rally to test this technical threshold. Breaking above this level could trigger momentum expansion toward higher EMA clusters. ATR readings at 1.8129 indicate moderate volatility, with current intraday movement showing compressed ranges. This low-volatility environment often precedes directional breakouts, particularly when combined with fundamental catalysts and improved market sentiment. Historical Price Context: Six-Month Correction from ETF Speculation Peak XRP’s 2025 performance is a systematic decline from January peaks near $3.10 following post-ETF speculation rallies. February-March trading ranges between $2.60–$2.90 and $2.40–$2.70 , respectively, gave way to April’s local high at $2.86 before accelerating weakness. May witnessed a sharp decline, with support emerging at $1.80 , followed by June’s volatile recovery between $1.79 and $2.10 . The June 10 low at $1.79 represents a key psychological level, with current prices holding approximately 12% above this threshold. Source: CoinGecko The historical high at $2.86 in April 2025 established key resistance for any recovery attempts, while the broader range between $1.79 and $3.10 defines the major trading corridor for XRP’s current cycle. Current price levels represent a 47.39% decline from the January 2018 all-time high of $3.84 , though maintaining substantial gains of 72,025% from the July 2014 all-time low of $0.002802 . Support & Resistance: Key Battle Zones Define Breakout Potential Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $1.9860 , reinforced by the psychological $2.00 level where institutional buying interest historically appears. The key support zone extends from $1.9500 to $1.9800 , which is a confluence of technical levels and potential accumulation areas. Source: TradingView Major support lies within the $1.8500 – $1.9000 historical zone, which corresponds to May’s major low and institutional buying levels. A breakdown below $1.95 would indicate a potential deeper correction toward these major support levels. Resistance begins immediately at $2.0390 (today’s high), followed by the key 200-day EMA at $2.0946 . This EMA represents the most accessible major resistance level, requiring minimal momentum to test. Source: TradingView The key resistance zone spans $2.1500 – $2.2300 , encompassing the 20-day EMA cluster where multiple moving averages converge. Breaking this level would indicate a potential trend reversal and open pathways toward higher resistance zones. Major resistance lies within the $2.5000 – $2.7000 historical high range, representing the April 2025 peak and large supply levels that would require substantial fundamental catalysts to overcome. Regulatory Breakthrough: 95% ETF Approval Odds Signal Market Transformation Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have increased their odds of XRP ETF approval to 95%.

Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 The analysts placed Litecoin, Solana, and XRP as having the highest possibility among others , with 95% odds, citing positive SEC engagement and the agency’s apparent classification of these assets as commodities rather than securities. Multiple major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale , and Bitwise , have filed XRP ETF applications. The final decision deadlines for these applications are clustered around October 2025. XRP’s final SEC decision deadline is also set for October 17, 2025.

RLUSD Stablecoin Integration: Enterprise Adoption Accelerates Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by some major countries and launched globally. On December 10, 2024, Ripple received regulatory approval in New York, positioning the company to compete in the regulated stablecoin market. Fast-forward to this month, the Dubai Financial Services Authority approved RLUSD for use within the Dubai International Financial Centre . This represents Ripple’s second major regulatory win in the region. Ripple USD is now a recognized crypto token under the DFSA’s regime in Dubai. RLUSD is: Enterprise-grade Compliant Built for real utility Another milestone as we expand our footprint in the DIFC and across the UAE. https://t.co/uvNcpRZDRG — Ripple (@Ripple) June 3, 2025 RLUSD integration into Ripple Payments enables clients to utilize the stablecoin for fast and cheap cross-border settlements, complementing rather than replacing XRP’s role as a bridge currency. RLUSD has a market cap of $293.64 million, making it the 220th biggest cryptocurrency and the 11th largest stablecoin. The stablecoin’s enterprise-grade design addresses compliance requirements, including HIPAA, GDPR, and other regulatory frameworks, expanding Ripple’s addressable market beyond traditional crypto users to regulated financial institutions. SEC Lawsuit Resolution: $50 Million Settlement Removes Legal Overhang Ripple and the SEC have proposed a final settlement, which would conclude the four-year legal battle with a $50 million penalty and a $125 million escrow release . Both parties have jointly requested that a federal court dissolve a longstanding injunction related to XRP sales and authorize the release of $125 million currently held in escrow. The settlement is a dramatic reduction from the SEC’s original $2 billion penalty demand . This follows the agency’s weakened position following Judge Torres’s 2023 ruling that programmatic XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute securities transactions. Legal resolution removes a major regulatory overhang that has suppressed XRP price action since December 2020, when the original lawsuit caused XRP to lose over 50% of its value and $16 billion in market cap.

Market Metrics: Fundamental Strength Despite Technical Consolidation XRP maintains a market capitalization of $119.35 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $3.92 billion , representing a volume-to-market cap ratio of 3.29%. Based on the maximum supply of 100 billion XRP tokens , the fully diluted valuation reaches $202.5 billion . The circulating supply stands at 58.93 billion XRP , representing 58.9% of the maximum supply. The remaining tokens are held in escrow for programmatic release. This controlled supply mechanism provides predictable inflation dynamics, supporting long-term price stability. Market dominance remains robust at 3.82% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, maintaining XRP’s position as the fourth-largest digital asset by valuation despite recent consolidation pressure. The 47.39% decline from all-time highs contrasts with the 72,025% gain from all-time lows, indicating the sharp correction from peak levels and established cryptocurrencies’ extraordinary long-term appreciation potential. Social Sentiment: Rising Engagement Amid ETF Optimism LunarCrush data reveals XRP’s AltRank at 3 with a Galaxy Score of 51, indicating strong social engagement and positive sentiment momentum. Engagement metrics total 10.29 million interactions with 51.6K mentions and 7.14K creators contributing to discussions. Sentiment is 81% positive, reflecting community optimism despite recent price consolidation. XRP’s social dominance of 3.8% demonstrates its ability to capture considerable attention relative to market cap, often preceding price movements. $XRP Holders, you deserve all the extraordinary things coming your way! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 23, 2025 Institutional Momentum: Enterprise Adoption Drives Long-Term Value Real-world asset tokenization on the XRP Ledger exemplifies growing institutional relevance, with Guggenheim Treasury Services issuing Digital Commercial Paper on the platform.

Three-Month XRP Price Forecast Scenarios Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case – 40% Probability) XRP may continue trading within the $1.95 – $2.25 range pending news about ETF approval and broader market direction. The 200-day EMA at $2.0946 provides near-term resistance, while $1.95 support offers downside protection. Source: TradingView This scenario requires sustained legal settlement progress, moderate RLUSD adoption, and stable broader crypto market conditions. Without substantial expansion, volume would likely remain moderate around current levels. Risk management involves monitoring daily closes above $2.16 for bullish momentum or below $1.93 for bearish breakdown signals. ETF-Driven Breakout (Bull Case – 35% Probability) ETF approval announcement could catalyze rapid price appreciation toward $2.80 – $3.20 , representing 40–60% upside from current levels. If XRP ETFs attract a small fraction, say 35% of the net flows that Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in since launching in January 2024, the calculations indicate that the XRP price could reach nearly $3.00 . Source: TradingView This scenario requires confirmed ETF approval, substantial institutional inflows, and broader altcoin market recovery. Daily volume would need to expand well above 5 billion XRP to support sustained upward momentum. Key resistance levels at $2.15 , $2.40 , and $2.80 would need sequential clearing with volume confirmation for full bull case realization. Regulatory Setback Correction (Bear Case – 25% Probability) ETF delays or adverse regulatory developments could trigger selling toward $1.65 – $1.80 support levels. This scenario would require ETF application rejections, broader crypto market weakness, or unexpected legal complications. Source: TradingView A breakdown below $1.95 with volume expansion would indicate a potential deeper correction toward May’s $1.80 support zone. Risk management requires stop-loss placement below $1.90 for position protection. XRP Price Forecast: Up or Monitor These Key Levels XRP’s current position reflects a unique convergence of regulatory clarity, enterprise adoption momentum, and technical consolidation near key support levels. The 95% ETF approval odds from Bloomberg analysts are a massive shift in institutional sentiment that could drive large capital inflows. Additionally, the resolution of the SEC lawsuit removes a four-year legal overhang, while RLUSD integration provides concrete enterprise utility beyond speculative trading. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions are developing, while fundamental catalysts could provide multiple pathways for value appreciation. The October 2025 ETF decision deadline creates a defined timeline for major catalyst realization. Support defense at $1.95 – $2.00 remains essential for maintaining bullish structure, while resistance clearing above $2.10 could indicate momentum expansion toward ETF-driven targets. Daily closes above the 200-day EMA at $2.0946 would confirm short-term trend reversal. Over the next 90 days, investors should monitor the progress of ETF applications, RLUSD adoption metrics, legal settlement finalization, and broader altcoin market sentiment.

Right now, all eyes are on Turkey, where significant changes are on the horizon for how digital assets are governed. If you’re involved in the cryptocurrency space, especially with Turkish platforms, understanding these upcoming Turkey crypto regulations is absolutely crucial. These aren’t just minor tweaks; they represent a fundamental shift aimed at enhancing financial security and transparency within the nation’s burgeoning crypto market. What Are the Key Changes in Turkey Crypto Regulations ? Turkey is gearing up to introduce a robust set of new rules designed to bring greater oversight to its crypto ecosystem. These comprehensive Turkey crypto regulations are not just about adding red tape; they are a strategic move to align the nation’s digital asset framework with international standards, particularly those aimed at preventing illicit financial activities. Let’s break down the core components of these anticipated changes: Detailed Transaction Information: Crypto platforms operating in Turkey will soon be required to collect and maintain much more granular data on all transactions. This includes information about senders, receivers, transaction amounts, and potentially the purpose of transfers. The goal is to create a clear audit trail, making it easier to trace funds and identify suspicious activities. Holding Periods on Withdrawals: To prevent rapid illicit fund movements, new rules will introduce mandatory holding periods on withdrawals. This means that after depositing funds or completing certain transactions, users might have to wait a specified duration before they can withdraw their assets. This measure adds a layer of friction for criminals attempting quick transfers of laundered money. Daily and Monthly Limits on Stablecoin Transfers: Stablecoins, often used for large-volume transfers due to their price stability, are specifically targeted. New daily and monthly limits will be imposed on the amount of stablecoins that can be transferred. This is a direct response to concerns about stablecoins being used as a conduit for large-scale illicit fund outflows. These measures collectively aim to create a more controlled and transparent environment, ensuring that the benefits of digital assets can be harnessed while mitigating their potential for misuse. Why the Urgent Focus on Combating Crypto Financial Crimes ? Turkey’s government is taking a firm stance against illicit financial activities, recognizing that the anonymity sometimes associated with cryptocurrencies can be exploited for money laundering, terrorism financing, and other crypto financial crimes . The urgency stems from several factors: International Pressure: Global bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) have increasingly emphasized the need for robust crypto regulations to combat financial crime. Nations that fail to comply risk being grey-listed, which can deter foreign investment and impact economic stability. Preventing Illicit Fund Outflows: Turkey has historically faced challenges with capital flight. Cryptocurrencies, if unregulated, could become a significant channel for such outflows, impacting the nation’s economic stability and currency value. Protecting Investors: While the primary driver is financial crime, stricter regulations also inadvertently offer greater protection to legitimate investors by weeding out fraudulent schemes and creating a more secure trading environment. By implementing these strict controls, Turkey aims to bolster its financial integrity and ensure that the digital economy contributes positively to its national growth without becoming a haven for illegal activities. How Will New Stablecoin Limits Impact Users and Markets? One of the most impactful aspects of these impending rules is the introduction of daily and monthly stablecoin limits . Stablecoins, like USDT or USDC, are pegged to fiat currencies and are widely used for their stability, often serving as a bridge between traditional finance and the volatile crypto market. The imposition of limits on their transfers will have significant implications: For High-Volume Traders: Traders and institutions that frequently move large sums of stablecoins will need to adjust their strategies. This could mean breaking down large transactions into smaller ones over several days or exploring alternative, regulated channels. Impact on Liquidity: While designed to curb illicit flows, these limits could also inadvertently affect market liquidity for legitimate large transactions, potentially leading to increased transaction costs or delays. Shift in Usage Patterns: Users might seek alternative methods for large transfers or shift towards platforms that offer more flexibility, provided they are compliant with other regulations. The goal of these stablecoin limits is clear: to prevent large, untraceable sums from leaving the country or being used for nefarious purposes. While it introduces new considerations for users, it is a targeted approach to a specific vulnerability. Navigating Cryptocurrency Compliance in Turkey: What You Need to Know For both individuals and platforms operating within Turkey, understanding and adhering to the new cryptocurrency compliance framework will be paramount. This isn’t just about avoiding penalties; it’s about contributing to a safer and more legitimate digital economy. For Crypto Platforms: Enhanced KYC/AML Procedures: Platforms will need to significantly upgrade their Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, collecting more detailed user data and implementing more rigorous transaction monitoring systems. Reporting Obligations: Expect increased reporting requirements to regulatory bodies, detailing suspicious activities and large transactions. Technological Upgrades: Investing in robust compliance technology will be essential to automate monitoring, data collection, and reporting, ensuring adherence to the new rules without overwhelming operational teams. For Individual Users: More Detailed Verification: Be prepared for more extensive identity verification processes when opening accounts or conducting significant transactions. Awareness of Limits: Familiarize yourself with the new stablecoin limits and withdrawal holding periods to plan your transactions accordingly. Using Regulated Platforms: Prioritize using platforms that are actively working to comply with the new regulations, as they offer greater security and legal recourse. Navigating cryptocurrency compliance effectively will ensure continued participation in Turkey’s digital asset market while supporting the broader goal of financial security. The Broader Implications of Turkey’s Digital Asset Laws Turkey’s decisive action to implement stricter digital asset laws is not an isolated event; it’s part of a growing global trend. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream adoption, governments worldwide are grappling with how to regulate them effectively to balance innovation with financial stability and crime prevention. Turkey’s approach could serve as a blueprint or a cautionary tale for other nations considering similar measures. Potential Impacts: Increased Legitimacy: Stricter laws can bring more legitimacy to the crypto sector, potentially attracting institutional investors who require regulatory clarity and security. Innovation vs. Control: There’s a delicate balance between imposing controls and stifling innovation. Turkey’s success will depend on how agile its regulatory framework remains to adapt to new technologies while maintaining oversight. Global Ripple Effect: As a significant emerging market, Turkey’s comprehensive digital asset laws could influence regulatory discussions and decisions in other countries, particularly in the Middle East and Central Asia. Ultimately, these new digital asset laws signify a maturing phase for the cryptocurrency industry in Turkey, moving from a largely unregulated space to one with defined boundaries and responsibilities. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For both individuals and businesses in the crypto space, adapting to these changes is key. Here are some actionable steps: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official announcements from Turkish regulators and reputable news sources regarding the finalization and implementation of these rules. Review Your Operations: If you are a platform or a large-scale trader, review your current operational procedures and assess what changes are needed to meet the new compliance requirements. Consult Legal Experts: For complex situations, seeking advice from legal professionals specializing in crypto regulations in Turkey is advisable. A Safer Digital Future? Turkey’s impending crypto regulations mark a significant step towards a more secure and transparent digital financial landscape. While the stricter rules, including detailed transaction information, holding periods, and stablecoin limits, might pose initial adjustments for users and platforms, they are ultimately aimed at combating financial crimes and fostering a healthier, more legitimate crypto ecosystem. This bold move underscores a global shift towards integrating digital assets within traditional regulatory frameworks, ensuring that innovation can thrive responsibly.

A 12-page document from the office noted that the Ministry of Finance failed to comply with all legal checks before launching the Palau Stablecoin (PSC). The audit comes more than two years after the Pacific island nation partnered with Ripple for the Stablecoin program to boost financial inclusion and reduce transaction costs. With Palau having the US Dollar as its national currency, the PSC was simply a Dollar-pegged stablecoin, with the pilot phase involving three local retailers and 154 government officials who volunteered to conduct the transactions. According to the report , the Ministry of Finance failed to get all the necessary approvals to proceed with the partnership. It highlighted that neither the National Director of Program, Budget, and Management nor the Attorney General certified the agreements. Under existing rules in the country, the Attorney General must certify all agreements, while the Director must provide a certification of funds before any government entity can spend state resources on public projects. However, the Ministry did not observe these rules for the Stablecoin Pilot program. The Public Auditor considered them to be red flags but acknowledged that there was no evidence of misuse of resources. Interestingly, the report also showed that Ripple funded the PSC pilot phase with $25,000, which the country’s treasury received. $14,035 was spent on the project, and most of the funds went to the three vendors to redeem the test stablecoins. What is next for PSC? Although the auditor did not identify any misappropriation in the pilot phase of the stablecoin and acknowledged that the Ministry of Finance acted within its mandate, it called for necessary certifications in future projects. However, the Ministry defended its position, noting that it acted in line with legal advice from the Office of the President and did not get the Attorney General’s certification because the agreement with Ripple was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), which did not bind the country. Nevertheless, whether the PSC will proceed beyond the pilot phase is unclear. This is because any subsequent step that would make the stablecoin become a widely accepted currency will require the legislature to pass a law on the issue. The report said: “Any further steps toward establishing a circulating currency would require legislative approval. Without the enactment of a law by the Olbiil Era Kelulau, such an expansion would be unlawful.” Given that the last report on the Pilot for the Phase 2a was released almost a year ago, in July 2024, there is no clarity on what is next for the country. Ripple celebrates landmark developments from Apex 2025 While the audit highlights how Ripple encouraged the development of stablecoins on the XRPL, the network appears to have seen sufficient development. XRPL has sizable stablecoin adoption with five stablecoins, including the Circle USDC, Ripple RLUSD, Braza Group USDB, Singapore Dollar-pegged XSGD, and Euro-pegged EURØP, all on the network. A recent report from Ripple highlighted the network’s recent growth, culminating in major announcements at the Apex 2025 conference for the XRPL community. It noted that the event marked the turnaround for XRPL in its institutional adoption efforts, with stablecoins and real-world assets (RWA) tokenization growing on the network. For instance, the Ondo tokenized US treasuries (OUSG) are now available for qualified investors on XRPL, while Guggenheim Treasury Services launched a digital commercial paper on XRPL in partnership with Zeconomy. However, more enterprise-grade products for institutional investors might soon be coming to XRP with new features such as credentials, permitted domains, and multipurpose tokens, which are set to become available in the coming months.

Recently, a critical message from former U.S. President Donald Trump , delivered via his Truth Social platform, has ignited a fresh wave of discussions regarding Middle East stability and its potential far-reaching implications. For those navigating the digital asset space, understanding these macro-level shifts is no longer optional; it is essential for informed decision-making. This article delves into the complexities of Trump’s warning, the underlying tensions between Israel and Iran, and the broader geopolitical impact on global financial ecosystems. Donald Trump’s Dire Warning: A New Era of Digital Diplomacy? The former President’s recent intervention on Truth Social marked a striking moment in international relations. In a direct and unequivocal statement, Donald Trump urged Israel to halt any planned bombings against Iran, labeling such an action as a ‘major violation’ and demanding the ‘immediate return of its pilots.’ This public admonition, delivered through a personal social media platform rather than traditional diplomatic channels, underscores the evolving landscape of global communication and its immediate accessibility to millions. Trump’s message was not merely a suggestion; it carried the weight of a former Commander-in-Chief known for his unconventional foreign policy approach. His directness bypasses the nuances of diplomatic communiqués, delivering a clear, stark warning that reverberates instantly across news desks and financial trading floors worldwide. Why does a message from a former president, conveyed on a social media platform, hold such significant sway? Firstly, Trump remains a highly influential figure, particularly within a specific political sphere, and his words are often interpreted as indicators of potential future policy or at least significant American sentiment. Secondly, the nature of the warning itself—an urgent plea to prevent military action—highlights the extreme sensitivity of the situation. Such a direct appeal on a platform like Truth Social means the message is unfiltered, immediate, and designed to capture maximum attention, ensuring its reach beyond conventional political circles and into the broader public consciousness, including the investor community. The Stakes of the Israel Iran Conflict: A Region on the Brink? The relationship between Israel Iran has been fraught with tension for decades, characterized by proxy conflicts, covert operations, and a constant shadow of potential direct confrontation. Iran, a Shia Muslim power, has long supported groups hostile to Israel, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and various Palestinian factions, while Israel views Iran’s nuclear program and regional influence as existential threats. Trump’s warning comes amidst a backdrop of heightened regional instability, where any misstep could ignite a broader conflagration. Understanding the historical context is crucial: Proxy Warfare: Both nations have engaged in extensive proxy conflicts across the Middle East, using third parties to advance their interests without direct military engagement. Nuclear Ambitions: Iran’s nuclear program remains a central point of contention, with Israel and Western powers fearing its potential weaponization. Regional Influence: The struggle for dominance in the Middle East sees both Israel and Iran vying for influence, often through military and political alliances. Historical Grievances: Deep-seated historical and ideological differences fuel the animosity, making diplomatic resolution exceedingly challenging. A direct military conflict between Israel and Iran would have catastrophic consequences, not only for the immediate region but for global stability. It would disrupt oil supplies, trigger humanitarian crises, and potentially draw in other major powers, leading to an unpredictable cascade of events. For global markets, including cryptocurrencies, such an escalation would introduce an unprecedented level of uncertainty, potentially leading to sharp corrections and a flight to perceived safe-haven assets. Truth Social: A New Geopolitical Megaphone? The choice of Truth Social as the platform for such a significant geopolitical statement is noteworthy. Launched as a ‘free speech’ alternative to mainstream social media, Truth Social has become a primary communication channel for Donald Trump and his supporters. Its design allows for direct, unfiltered communication, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers and reaching a dedicated audience instantaneously. This incident highlights a growing trend: the increasing use of social media by political figures to convey messages that once would have been reserved for official press conferences or diplomatic cables. What are the implications of this shift towards digital diplomacy on platforms like Truth Social? Aspect Traditional Diplomacy Social Media Diplomacy (e.g., Truth Social) Speed of Dissemination Slower, filtered through official channels and media. Instantaneous, direct to a global audience. Control over Message High control, carefully vetted statements. Less control, prone to immediate interpretation and misinterpretation. Audience Reach Primarily political elite, journalists, and policy wonks. Broad public, including non-traditional political observers and investors. Impact on Markets Often delayed reaction as information filters. Immediate, volatile reactions due to real-time nature. While offering unparalleled speed and directness, this form of communication also carries risks, including the potential for misinterpretation, escalation of rhetoric, and the blurring of lines between personal opinion and official policy. For crypto investors, this means that significant news, regardless of its source, can trigger rapid market movements, requiring constant vigilance and a keen understanding of global events. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact on Global Markets Geopolitical tensions, particularly those involving major energy-producing regions like the Middle East, invariably have a profound geopolitical impact on global financial markets. The prospect of an Israel Iran conflict, even if only a possibility, immediately triggers a ‘risk-off’ sentiment among investors. This means a shift away from riskier assets towards perceived safer ones. How does this manifest across various markets, and specifically, in the crypto space? Oil Prices: The most immediate and direct impact is often seen in oil prices. Any threat to Middle Eastern oil production or shipping lanes sends crude oil futures soaring, impacting global energy costs and inflation. Equities: Stock markets typically react negatively, with indices experiencing declines as investor confidence wanes. Sectors particularly vulnerable include travel, consumer discretionary, and technology, due to supply chain disruptions or reduced consumer spending. Currencies and Bonds: Safe-haven currencies like the U.S. Dollar, Japanese Yen, and Swiss Franc tend to strengthen. Government bonds, especially those of stable economies, see increased demand as investors seek security. Gold: Historically, gold has been a primary safe-haven asset during times of geopolitical uncertainty. Its price often rises significantly as investors flock to its perceived stability. Now, how does this translate to cryptocurrencies? While Bitcoin was initially touted as ‘digital gold’ and a hedge against traditional financial instability, its behavior during recent geopolitical crises has been mixed. Sometimes, it acts as a risk-off asset, seeing inflows. At other times, it correlates with broader equity markets, especially tech stocks, and experiences sell-offs alongside other risk assets. The key takeaway is volatility. Increased geopolitical risk almost certainly means increased volatility in the crypto market, driven by investor fear, speculation, and the broader macroeconomic environment. Understanding these dynamics allows investors to anticipate potential price swings and adjust their strategies accordingly. Navigating Market Stability Amidst Uncertainty: What Crypto Investors Need to Know In an environment shaped by significant geopolitical events and pronouncements from figures like Donald Trump , maintaining market stability in your portfolio requires a strategic approach. For crypto investors, this means moving beyond just technical analysis and understanding the macro factors at play. The potential for an Israel Iran conflict, or any major global event, demands a proactive rather than reactive stance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Stay Informed: Beyond crypto-specific news, follow global geopolitical developments closely. Major news outlets, think tanks, and reputable analysts can provide insights into potential flashpoints and their implications. Diversify Wisely: While crypto offers unique opportunities, a well-diversified portfolio that includes traditional assets (even if a small percentage) can help cushion against extreme market shocks. Within crypto, consider diversifying across different asset classes (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, DeFi tokens) to spread risk. Assess Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events often lead to sharp, unpredictable movements. Understand your personal risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio size in highly volatile assets accordingly. Avoid over-leveraging during periods of heightened uncertainty. Consider Stablecoins: During extreme volatility, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies (like USDT or USDC) can offer a temporary refuge for capital, allowing you to preserve value without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely. Long-Term Vision: For many crypto investors, the long-term vision of decentralized finance and blockchain technology remains strong. Short-term geopolitical tremors, while impactful, should be viewed in the context of your overall long-term investment strategy. Avoid panic selling based on immediate headlines. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Continue with a dollar-cost averaging strategy if you are building positions. This helps mitigate the risk of buying at market peaks during volatile periods. The directness of communication on platforms like Truth Social means that news travels faster than ever, impacting markets in real-time. This necessitates a more dynamic and informed approach to investing. While the crypto market is known for its inherent volatility, external geopolitical factors can amplify these swings. By understanding the potential geopolitical impact and adopting prudent strategies, investors can better navigate the turbulent waters and work towards maintaining their portfolio’s market stability . Conclusion: Vigilance in a Connected World The warning from Donald Trump on Truth Social regarding a potential Israel Iran conflict serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of global politics and finance. In an era where a single social media post can send ripples through international relations and financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, vigilance and informed decision-making are paramount. The potential geopolitical impact of such a conflict is immense, threatening not only regional peace but also global market stability . For crypto investors, this means recognizing that macro events are no longer distant concerns but direct influences on their digital assets. By staying abreast of global affairs, understanding the intricate web of geopolitical forces, and applying sound investment principles, one can better navigate the uncertainties and position their portfolios for resilience in an ever-changing landscape.

Ethereum Investors Debate, Eyeing Chainlink",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-magacoin-finance-a-better-pick-than-xrp-ethereum-investors-debate-eyeing-chainlink/,"As the crypto market warms up for a potential 2025 bull cycle, a major debate is emerging across Ethereum investor circles: could MAGACOIN FINANCE be a better short-term pick than XRP? Once seen as one of the safest mid-cap options in the market, XRP is now facing serious competition from a newcomer that’s generating powerful early momentum. That newcomer, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is more than just a meme token—it’s a presale that’s turning heads and creating FOMO across every major trading group. As Ethereum holders diversify and XRP holders re-evaluate risk/reward dynamics, a rising number of traders are also looking at Chainlink—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s dominating the headlines. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Wildcard Gaining Real Ground What’s making MAGACOIN FINANCE so difficult to ignore is its trajectory. Within weeks of its presale launch, the project has: Attracted thousands of early investors Surpassed expectations in early fundraising milestones Sparked viral traction across Twitter, Telegram, and Reddit Offered a 100% token bonus that’s accelerating presale demand This isn’t just another flash-in-the-pan memecoin. MAGACOIN FINANCE is combining scarcity (170B fixed supply), community-first branding, and precision marketing to create the exact conditions that can trigger parabolic growth. Ethereum investors familiar with early launches are calling this the most calculated and high-energy presale of the year. XRP Still Holds Value While XRP continues to benefit from improving regulatory clarity and established partnerships, its explosive growth days may be behind it. Many long-term XRP holders have seen price stagnation over the past cycles and are now wondering whether higher returns could be found elsewhere. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture—with the kind of raw, early-stage upside that XRP no longer offers. The opportunity to get in before listings, before major media coverage, and before whales dominate the market is what’s fueling the shift in sentiment. Chainlink Attracting Strategic Interest—But MAGACOIN Is Winning Momentum Chainlink remains a favorite among Ethereum-aligned developers and long-term infrastructure builders. However, when it comes to viral energy and short-term upside, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s catching fire. Retail investors, especially those who missed early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu entries, are now treating MAGACOIN FINANCE as a redemption play—with stronger fundamentals and real scarcity baked in. Conclusion The debate over MAGACOIN FINANCE vs. XRP is no longer hypothetical—Ethereum investors are making moves. While XRP remains a strong player, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rewriting the rules for what a meme-driven altcoin can be. With presale demand exploding, a 50% bonus still in play, and a fast-rising investor base, MAGACOIN FINANCE may very well be the surprise winner of 2025 .

If you’ve been following the market, you might have noticed a significant uplift in the fortunes of digital asset producers. Indeed, the latest reports indicate a remarkable surge in Bitcoin mining profitability , making May a particularly lucrative month for miners across the globe. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; we’re talking about an impressive 18.2% jump, a figure that certainly turns heads in an industry known for its volatility. What Fueled the Astonishing Bitcoin Mining Profitability Surge? The primary drivers behind this notable increase in Bitcoin mining profitability are multifaceted, yet clear. According to an analysis by investment bank Jefferies, as cited by CoinDesk, two main factors stand out: A Robust BTC Price Increase: The value of Bitcoin itself experienced a significant appreciation, climbing by approximately 20% during May. For miners, whose revenue is directly tied to the price of the Bitcoin they unearth, this surge translated directly into higher earnings per block mined. When the underlying asset gains substantial value, the profitability of the operation naturally follows suit, creating a more favorable economic environment for miners. A Stable Network Hashrate: While the Bitcoin price surge was the dominant factor, a slight increase in the network hashrate also played a subtle but supportive role. The hashrate represents the total computational power being used to mine Bitcoin and process transactions. A stable or slightly rising hashrate, especially when coupled with a strong price, indicates a healthy and competitive network without an overwhelming influx of new miners that would dilute individual rewards too quickly. These two elements combined to create a powerful tailwind for the mining sector, demonstrating the intricate relationship between market dynamics and operational success in the crypto space. How Did US Bitcoin Miners Capitalize on This Momentum? The positive market conditions in May were certainly reflected in the output of publicly listed US Bitcoin miners . These companies, often equipped with large-scale operations and significant capital, are bellwethers for the industry’s health. During May, U.S.-listed mining companies collectively produced an impressive 3,754 BTC. This substantial output underscores their capacity and efficiency in leveraging the improved profitability landscape. Among these prominent players, Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) once again showcased its leadership. The company reported mining 950 BTC, solidifying its position as one of the top producers in the sector. Marathon’s consistent performance highlights its strategic investments in infrastructure and its ability to scale operations effectively to meet market demand and capitalize on favorable conditions.

All US-listed Miners (Total) 3,754 BTC Strong collective output, benefiting from market conditions. Despite the strong operational output and the overall positive trend in Bitcoin mining profitability , Jefferies did revise its price target for MARA stock downwards to $16. This adjustment might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, such revisions often reflect broader market outlooks, competitive landscape changes, or adjustments in future growth projections that go beyond a single month’s performance. It serves as a reminder that even strong operational results are viewed through the lens of long-term investment strategies and market sentiment. Decoding the Crypto Mining Hashrate: Why It Matters The concept of crypto mining hashrate is fundamental to understanding the Bitcoin network and the economics of mining. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, such as Bitcoin. It’s a measure of the network’s security and processing capability. Here’s why it’s crucial: Network Security: A higher hashrate generally means a more secure network, as it requires more computational power to attempt a 51% attack. Mining Difficulty: The Bitcoin network automatically adjusts its mining difficulty every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks) to ensure that blocks are found approximately every 10 minutes. If the hashrate increases, the difficulty rises to maintain this target time, meaning miners need more power to find a block. Miner Competition: When the hashrate increases significantly without a corresponding increase in Bitcoin price, individual miners might find their share of the block reward diminishing, impacting their profitability. Conversely, a stable or slightly increasing hashrate during a price surge is ideal, as it means the rewards are more valuable without an overwhelming increase in competition. The slight rise in hashrate during May, coupled with the substantial Bitcoin price surge, indicates a healthy balance where the network’s security grew modestly, while miners benefited significantly from the increased value of their output. The Future Outlook: Sustaining the Bitcoin Price Surge and Mining Momentum The performance in May certainly sets a positive tone, but what does it mean for the future? The sustainability of the current Bitcoin price surge and, by extension, mining profitability, depends on several factors: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic stability, inflation rates, and central bank policies continue to influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. Institutional Adoption: Continued interest from institutional investors, particularly through vehicles like Bitcoin ETFs, can provide significant upward pressure on price. Technological Advancements: Innovations in mining hardware efficiency and renewable energy sources can further reduce operational costs for miners, enhancing profitability even during periods of price stagnation. Regulatory Environment: Clear and favorable regulations can attract more investment and foster a stable environment for mining operations. For miners, navigating the post-halving landscape is also critical. While the halving event reduces the block reward, increased transaction fees and a rising Bitcoin price can offset this reduction, as evidenced by May’s performance. The key is operational efficiency and strategic hedging against price volatility. Actionable Insights for Aspiring and Current Bitcoin Miners The recent jump in profitability offers valuable lessons and considerations for anyone involved in or considering entering the Bitcoin mining space: Monitor BTC Price and Hashrate Closely: These are the two most critical metrics. Tools and dashboards that track real-time Bitcoin price and network hashrate are indispensable for making informed decisions. Focus on Efficiency: In a competitive environment, lower operational costs (especially electricity) are paramount. Investing in the latest, most energy-efficient mining hardware can significantly boost your bottom line. Diversify Revenue Streams: Some miners explore opportunities in hosting services or providing computational power for other networks to diversify their income beyond just block rewards. Understand Market Cycles: Bitcoin’s price is cyclical. Profitability can swing dramatically. Having a long-term strategy that accounts for both bull and bear markets is essential for survival and growth. Stay Informed on Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape for crypto mining is evolving. Staying abreast of new laws and policies can help you adapt and ensure compliance. A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Gold Mining May’s impressive surge in Bitcoin mining profitability serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often rewarding nature of the cryptocurrency industry. It underscores how a combination of strong asset performance and a healthy network environment can create significant opportunities for those involved in securing the blockchain. While challenges such as fluctuating prices and increasing competition remain, the resilience and adaptability of the mining sector continue to drive innovation and growth. The future of Bitcoin mining appears bright, driven by technological advancements, increasing institutional interest, and the enduring appeal of decentralized digital currency. As the ecosystem matures, efficiency, strategic planning, and a keen eye on market signals will be the hallmarks of successful mining operations.
