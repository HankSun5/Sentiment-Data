On June 23, 2025, the EU Commissioner for Industrial Strategy, Stephane Sejourne, while talking to the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that countries within the EU need to establish joint strategic reserves of rare earths to counter supply chain disruptions and potential “economic blackmail” from China. The EU can defend itself from economic blackmail from China It is common knowledge that all European countries have oil and gas reserves, but Sejourne wants to take things further by advocating for the creation of a strategic reserve for raw materials. In June, the European Union announced 13 new raw material projects outside the bloc that would increase its supplies of metals and minerals essential to its competitiveness in the energy transition, as well as defense and aerospace. This followed China’s decision in April to impose export curbs on rare earth magnets until new licences are obtained, which left diplomats, carmakers and other companies from Europe and other countries rushing to meet with Beijing officials and avert factory shutdowns. That move from China opened the EU’s eyes to how dependent it has become on the Asian giant for rare earths, and Sejourne wants that to end. She has committed to launching further tenders this year to promote alternative raw material sources. Sejourne has also warned Beijing, reminding them that the EU also has the tools to defend itself in a potential trade war. “Europe must finally use the same weapons as its competitors,” he said. China responded in June, saying it attached great importance to the EU’s concerns and would consider speeding up the approval process to get rare earth exports to the EU. EU leaders hope to address rare earth access at a July summit with China The issue of the EU’s dependence on China for rare earths is a priority for the EU, and leaders are reportedly planning to address rare earth access at the upcoming July 2025 summit with China. While China has offered a “green channel” to expedite licenses for EU firms, this is seen as a partial fix, as approvals are still subject to Beijing’s discretion. The summit aims to negotiate stable supply terms, but EU officials are wary of China’s leverage, and rightfully so, given it has a history of using rare earths exports as a diplomatic tool. Earlier this month when China’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, met with EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, he talked about reciprocation, mentioning how he hoped the bloc would also “adopt effective measures to facilitate, safeguard, and promote compliant trade of high-tech products with China.” They also spoke of Chinese electric vehicle imports into European countries, which the EU has hit with levies over allegedly unfair subsidies from Beijing. “The negotiation on the price commitment of electric vehicles between China and Europe has entered the final stage, but both sides still need to make efforts,” the commerce ministry said.

The emerging token is now being compared by some analysts to the early stages of Solana and Ethereum’s historic rallies — and with Litecoin showing fresh signs of life, the market narrative is shifting toward unexpected leaders in the altcoin space. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 2025 Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the most talked-about early-stage crypto asset of 2025. Its presale has seen overwhelming demand, with phases selling out almost instantly and over $10 million raised from global buyers. This surge is not just hype-driven—analysts highlight its scarcity-focused tokenomics, fully audited smart contract, and disciplined rollout as key structural strengths. The project’s limited supply and asymmetric reward mechanics are drawing comparisons to early-stage runs of meme giants, but with a more refined and strategic approach. Analyst Projections: 30x–100x Potential Crypto analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver returns between 25x and 100x, with some estimates suggesting an 18,500% ROI for early buyers. This optimism is fueled by: Scarcity mechanics that reduce dilution risk and prime the asset for exponential growth. Massive presale demand and accumulation by both retail and institutional players, indicating strong conviction and long-term holding behavior. Cultural relevance and a politically charged brand that drives organic growth and community engagement Solana: Institutional Catalysts and ETF Hopes Solana (SOL) recently experienced a strong bounce from key support, with a 5.2% price increase to $139.30 on June 23, 2025, and trading volumes exceeding $2.1 billion in 24 hours.The excitement around a potential Solana ETF approval is a major catalyst, with institutional interest surging and the network’s Alpenglow upgrade promising sub-second transaction finality. SOL’s price action is closely tied to broader risk-on sentiment in tech stocks, further amplifying its upside in bullish market conditions. Ethereum: Technical Breakout Imminent Ethereum is trading above $2,500, having rebounded 79% from its April low. Analysts are eyeing a “golden cross” on technical charts—a historic bullish reversal signal. Whale accumulation is at record highs, and inflows into spot ETH ETFs underscore growing institutional confidence. Forecasts suggest a decisive breakout above $4,000 could propel ETH to $6,000–$8,000 in 2025, marking a new all-time high. Litecoin: The “Silver” Factor While not as explosive as Solana or Ethereum, Litecoin remains a staple for risk-averse investors seeking reliable upside during bull cycles. Its established reputation as “digital silver” and consistent network activity make it a favored hedge, especially when meme and altcoin rallies accelerate. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Replicate These Rallies MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current setup mirrors the early momentum seen in Solana and Ethereum before their historic rallies: Early-stage accumulation and scarcity-driven tokenomics echo Solana’s pre-ETF surge and Ethereum’s pre-breakout consolidation. Strong community and cultural branding provide viral potential, reminiscent of meme coin booms but with greater structural integrity. Analysts’ conviction in 30x–100x returns is based on the same market imbalances that fueled Solana and Ethereum’s exponential growth in previous cycles. Conclusion With surging presale demand, disciplined rollout, and a scarcity-focused model, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as the breakout altcoin of 2025 . Its trajectory could mirror the explosive rallies of Solana and Ethereum, while its fundamentals offer a more calculated approach than typical meme coins—making it a strategic pick for those seeking outsized returns before mainstream exchange listings.

Here’s Why Smart Investors Believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is the Best Bet For Such Returns,https://timestabloid.com/missed-shiba-inus-shib-100x-rally-heres-why-smart-investors/,"Shiba Inu made headlines for its phenomenal 100x rally, creating countless overnight millionaires. But for many who missed that boat, repeating such returns may feel like a distant dream. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI), a rising star in cryptocurrency. With a structured growth plan, innovative applications, and a presale raising over $1.9 million , smart investors are now turning to Ruvi AI as the best bet for achieving life-changing gains. Why Ruvi AI Is Smarter Than Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu thrived on speculation and community hype, its lack of clear utility left many wondering about its long-term relevance. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, blends blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to address practical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. This focus on real-world problem-solving ensures RUVI tokens have sustained value beyond just market trends or social media buzz. Ruvi AI’s structured growth model is another key advantage. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at a highly accessible $0.015 per token. At the end of the presale, the price will lock at $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts also predict Ruvi AI could hit $1 after listing , offering an extraordinary 66x ROI for early investors. This transparency and clear growth trajectory make Ruvi AI particularly attractive to investors seeking predictable yet massive returns. Strong Presale Performance Signals Potential Ruvi AI’s presale numbers paint a promising picture for its future. Key milestones include: Raising over $1.9 million, showcasing strong community and investor interest. Selling more than 160 million tokens, highlighting substantial demand. Growing a community of over 1,600 holders, reflecting its widespread appeal. Unlike Shiba Inu’s unpredictable rises and falls, Ruvi AI offers a guaranteed price of $0.07 post-presale. This ensures financial stability and an immediate boost in value for investors who join during this early stage. Maximize Your ROI With VIP Investment Tiers For those looking to seriously grow their investments, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers , designed to reward early backers with generous bonus tokens. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers not only offer immediate value but also create opportunities for mind-blowing returns as Ruvi AI approaches its $1 price projection. Built-In Security and Transparency Another factor making Ruvi AI stand out is its commitment to security and transparency. Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI has undergone a third-party audit by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. This successful audit ensures the platform is secure, further building trust among investors. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity. This means RUVI tokens will be tradeable as soon as the presale ends, providing flexibility and reliability for investors eager to capitalize on market growth. Real-World Applications Ensure Demand While meme coins like Shiba Inu rely on community hype, Ruvi AI builds demand through practical utility. Here’s how it stands out across industries: Marketing: Businesses optimize ad strategies, refine audience targeting, and increase ROI with Ruvi AI’s AI-driven tools. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from personalized AI tools and blockchain-secured payment systems, making it easier to grow audiences and monetize content. Finance: Institutions use Ruvi AI for fraud detection, scalability, and improved operational transparency, leading to streamlined processes and better outcomes. This diversity in applications ensures that RUVI tokens maintain demand over time, creating a robust foundation for consistent growth. Why Ruvi AI Is the Best Bet for 100x Returns For crypto enthusiasts who missed Shiba Inu’s once-in-a-lifetime rally, Ruvi AI represents a second chance, but with far more predictability and functionality. The presale pricing at just $0.015 per token , coupled with a locked $0.07 post-sale valuation , gives early investors a clear roadmap to high returns. Having raised over $1.9 million , sold more than 160 million tokens , and secured partnerships with trusted names like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI has laid the groundwork for unparalleled success.

46645353,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72345,1750719793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Flare CEO: A New Product That Will Put 10’s of Billions of XRP to Work Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/flare-ceo-a-new-product-that-will-put-10s-of-billions-of-xrp-to-work-is-coming/,"Flare Network CEO Hugo Philion has teased a groundbreaking innovation that could transform the XRP ecosystem: Firelight. In a recent post on X, Philion revealed that he spent time in the U.S. with the Firelight team, praising the product as “hugely innovative” and capable of putting “billions, if not tens of billions, of XRP to work” on the Flare Network. Introducing Firelight: Unlocking XRP’s True Potential Firelight is a liquid staking protocol designed to bring dormant XRP to life through decentralized finance (DeFi). At its core, Firelight allows users to mint FXRP, a fully collateralized representation of XRP on the Flare Network . Once FXRP is deposited into Firelight’s Launch Vault, users receive an equal amount of stXRP—an ERC-20 token that can be traded, lent, or used across DeFi platforms while still earning staking rewards. According to Philion, this approach will revolutionize XRP staking, offering both flexibility and powerful yield-generating opportunities. Early adopters of Firelight will also earn Firelight Points, an incentive designed to reward participants for engaging with the protocol from the outset. I spent much of the last week in the US with the Firelight team. This product is hugely innovative and has the potential to put BILLIONS if not 10’s of BILLIONS of XRP to work -> on Flare. — Hugo Philion (@HugoPhilion) June 22, 2025 Institutional Adoption: Billions Already Committed Philion’s bold claims aren’t without backing. Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has already committed $100 million worth of XRP to the Flare ecosystem, specifically through Firelight, in a move aimed at generating stable yield and growing its treasury. Uphold, one of the largest holders of XRP with roughly 1.8 billion tokens in custody, has also confirmed plans to integrate FXRP, signaling major institutional confidence in the system. Meanwhile, testing on Flare’s canary network, Songbird, has shown strong early results. In just a few days, over $2 million in FXRP was minted, driving a 220% surge in total value locked (TVL) and significantly boosting stablecoin activity. A Secure, Scalable Framework for DeFi Security and trust are central to Firelight’s design. All collateral agents are KYC-verified, and FXRP is backed by a diversified pool of over-collateralized assets, including FLR and stablecoins. This ensures users can rely on Firelight for both performance and protection, key for attracting institutional and retail investors alike. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More importantly, Firelight solves one of the XRPL’s current limitations: the absence of native staking. By offering yield on XRP without compromisinadvised to conduct thoroughg liquidity, Flare positions itself as a leading hub for XRP-based DeFi—or what some now call “XRPFi.” A New Era for XRP Utility With XRP’s market cap sitting above $130 billion, even a small portion of assets deployed via Firelight could translate into tens of billions of dollars in active capital. Philion’s vision reflects this potential: a decentralized ecosystem where XRP holders can earn yield, participate in DeFi, and retain liquidity, all without leaving the safety of the Flare ecosystem. Firelight is currently live on Songbird, with a full launch on Flare’s mainnet expected soon. Once deployed, it could mark a major milestone—not just for Flare, but for XRP as a whole. As Philion put it, this is not just another product. It’s the beginning of a new financial paradigm for XRP holders worldwide.

It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!” Trump posted. He detailed that Iran would begin the first 12-hour truce, followed by Israel starting theirs in the second half, closing what he called the “12 Day War.” Trump also declared, “During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL.” He praised both countries for what he called their “Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence” to end a war he said could have “destroyed the entire Middle East.” Trump ended the post with a long line of blessings—naming Israel, Iran, the Middle East, the U.S., and “THE WORLD.” Iran rejects Trump’s ceasefire claims, accuses U.S. of deception as Netanyahu confirms the deal But Tehran denied all of it. Aziz Nasirzadeh, a senior official in Iran’s National Security Council, told CNN that Iran had not received any such ceasefire proposal. “At this very moment, the enemy is committing aggression against Iran,” he said, adding, “Iran is on the verge of intensifying its retaliatory strikes, with no ear to listen to the lies of its enemies.” Shamkhani said Iran would fight until it achieved “lasting peace,” calling Trump’s remarks a U.S. and Israeli attempt to justify further attacks on Iranian targets. Despite the denial, another Iranian official, Abbas Araghchi , speaking to Reuters, confirmed that Iran had agreed to a Qatar-mediated, U.S.-proposed truce with Israel. He did not mention Trump or the exact terms, but said Iran was “prepared to observe a temporary ceasefire under the current framework.” No full details were released. Still, this was the first public sign from Tehran that a diplomatic path might be on the table behind closed doors. Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has also confirmed the ceasefire, saying US and Qatar were key in making it happen. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted this on his X: “Those who know the Iranian people and their history know that the Iranian nation isn’t a nation that surrenders.” Markets surge, oil tanks, Bitcoin bounces back as traders price in peace U.S. markets reacted immediately to Trump’s post. Dow Jones futures went up by 134 points (0.3%), S&P 500 futures rose by 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures jumped 0.6%. The Dow added almost 375 points, S&P 500 closed 0.96% higher, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up by 0.94%. Investors, for now, are betting that some kind of ceasefire, whatever the official messaging, will take hold. Oil prices collapsed as traders pulled out of risk positions. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped more than 7% by Monday evening, falling to $64, which is now 3% below pre-war levels. That sharp fall suggests traders are fully pricing in the end of the war, even if there’s no formal joint statement. Crypto didn’t sit still either. Bitcoin, which had dipped to $98,000 during the U.S. strikes, bounced hard to $106,700 before settling at $105,600 by the time U.S. markets closed. Over $50 million in short positions were liquidated in just one hour, catching bears off guard and flipping sentiment.

Won-based stablecoins could potentially revolutionize the South Korean finance sector. They would allow people to make payments using privately issued tokens without involving fiat. The Bank of Korea has expressed skepticism. It has urged caution and is warning of a deleterious effect on the commercial banking sector . New Daily Kyungjae reported that credit card providers could also be adversely impacted by stablecoin rollouts. The media outlet noted that experts are concerned that the card industry “may face a structural crisis in the long term as its payment base gradually weakens.” Stablecoin rollouts could, the outlet warned, “may make it difficult for the industry to guarantee even short-term profitability.” However, an employee at an unnamed card provider offered a ray of hope, explaining: “It is difficult to predict the impact stablecoins will have on profitability. However, it will be difficult for them to replace our ability to offer spending on credit. That is the unique domain of card issuing companies.” But credit appears to be something of a double-edged sword for card companies. The outlet reported that domestic card issuers have been trying to “defend their profitability by expanding their high-interest loan offerings.” This, the outlet wrote, is causing a rise in loan defaults as “borrowers’ ability to repay is decreasing.” The Bank of Korea, South Korea’s central bank, is still lukewarm on proposals to launch a won stablecoin despite a recent meeting with the USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle. #SouthKorea #Stablecoins #USDC https://t.co/qPwbqgvtFg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The average monthly default levels of South Korean card companies in the first quarter of the financial year hit 1.93%. This is remarkably close to the 2% rate that the industry considers “dangerously high.” Worse still, three of the country’s biggest card firms (KB Kookmin, Hana, and BC Card) have already exceeded the 2% mark this year. Stablecoin Pivot: Which Companies Will Prosper? While banks and car providers are clearly fearful of what stablecoin-powered business could do to their industry, tech firms appear keen to embrace the change. Pinpoint News reported that while years of regulatory uncertainty have limited business expansion, IT heavy-hitters are “moving quickly as governments around the world begin to show signs of establishing clear guidelines.” The outlet made note of the likes of the search engine operator Naver and the chat app developer Kakao, both of which have been working on blockchain-related innovations for years. Naver share prices over the past month. (Source: Google Finance) Other firms said to be looking with interest at developments in the stablecoin space are the Hyundai subsidiaries Hyundai HT (smart homes) and Hyundai Mobis (auto parts). Another smart home firm, Kocom, was also named, along with the software developer MediaZen, the connectivity provider Kaon Media, and the IT services firm Bridgetec. The media outlet said that expectations are “growing” for a Naver stablecoin release and a link to web3 services that make use of this coin. #Hanwha Ocean ramps up push into U.S. Navy ship repair, eyes tech transfer via #Philly Shipyard.

It has built up a vast ecosystem of web, IT, and payment services. An unnamed industry expert said: “Positive changes in stablecoin policy will help accelerate Naver’s blockchain-related business.” In Naver’s case, stablecoin-related business expansion has the potential to cross borders. The firm has a close historical link with Line, a chat app popular in Japan and other Asian markets. A potential Naver-Line stablecoin cooperation or interoperability solution could provide a further boost, the outlet concluded. South Korea’s stablecoin frenzy has led to a flurry of speculative activity on the nation’s stock and crypto markets . Traders have been attempting to pre-empt lawmakers’ decision by snapping up stocks in firms that have previously expressed a willingness to do stablecoin-related business.

46646715,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169031,1750721402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/46646715.jpeg,"Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Be the Next Community Favorite for Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink Traders?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-the-next-community-favorite-for-bitcoin-xrp-and-chainlink-traders/,"MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto projects , drawing attention from traders of established giants like Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink. As the market pivots toward early-stage, community-driven tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s blend of meme appeal, fixed-supply tokenomics, and robust community engagement is fueling speculation that it could become the next breakout favorite among both retail and institutional investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Momentum and Strong Fundamentals Unlike many meme tokens that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on a foundation of transparent governance and a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, eliminating inflation risk and creating scarcity-driven value. The project is 100% community-owned, with its smart contracts fully audited by HashEx, boosting investor confidence and distinguishing it from typical meme coins. Early presale momentum has been explosive, with analysts predicting potential returns of 25x–35x once major exchange listings go live. The project’s strategic branding and disciplined rollout have attracted both seasoned traders and newcomers, echoing the viral trajectories once seen with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Bitcoin: The Benchmark for Crypto Traders Bitcoin remains the market’s bellwether, with 2025 price forecasts ranging from $100,000 to $175,000, driven by institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and political tailwinds. While Bitcoin offers stability and long-term growth, its massive market cap limits the kind of explosive upside that smaller, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE can deliver. Many Bitcoin holders are now seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging projects, fueling capital rotation into promising altcoins. XRP: Utility and the Prospect of a Major Breakout XRP is gaining renewed attention as analysts predict a bullish breakout, with price targets ranging from $5.50 to as high as $27 by the end of 2025, contingent on regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. The token’s real-world utility in cross-border payments and its growing ecosystem make it a favorite for traders seeking assets with both narrative and use case. However, like Bitcoin, XRP’s upside may be more gradual compared to the meteoric potential of new community-driven tokens. Chainlink: Infrastructure Powerhouse with Steady Growth Chainlink (LINK) continues to dominate the decentralized oracle sector, trading around $13–$16 in mid-2025, with analysts targeting $20–$30 as the next major resistance zone. Chainlink’s integration across DeFi and real-world applications ensures its relevance, but its growth is likely to be steadier and less volatile than the explosive rallies seen in smaller-cap tokens. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Appeals to BTC, XRP, and LINK Traders Asymmetric Upside: With a low price and a capped supply, early MAGACOIN FINANCE backers are positioning for outsized returns not typically available in large-cap coins. Community-Driven Model: Like Dogecoin and early Chainlink, MAGACOIN FINANCE is powered by grassroots enthusiasm, which can drive viral adoption and price surges. Security and Transparency: The HashEx audit and transparent governance address common concerns among serious traders, making it more than just a meme play. Strategic Timing: As capital rotates from blue chips to high-upside altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to capture significant inflows from traders seeking the next big thing Conclusion For Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink traders seeking the next community-driven favorite with explosive upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top contender for 2025. Its blend of meme culture, fixed-supply economics, and genuine community engagement is attracting serious attention—and if current momentum holds, it could soon join the ranks of the market’s most beloved tokens.

46647054,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72365,1750721939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Why XRP Price Starts Rising Suddenly,https://timestabloid.com/heres-why-xrp-price-starts-rising-suddenly/,"A surprising policy shift by the Federal Reserve Board has triggered fresh optimism across the crypto markets, with XRP leading the charge. On June 23, the Fed announced it will no longer consider “reputational risk” as a component of its examination programs when supervising banks. The move, seen by many as a step toward regulatory clarity, immediately fueled speculation that barriers facing crypto-friendly banks may be easing. XRP, in particular, responded with a sharp 6% increase, currently trading at $2.14, and catching the attention of market participants. Excitement for the Pro-crypto Shift The update was shared widely on X, with crypto commentator Amonyx (@amonbuy) calling it a moment that eases crypto banking restrictions. He shared a screenshot of the Fed’s release, which outlined the Board’s intention to eliminate reputational risk assessments from supervisory materials and replace them with more targeted evaluations of financial risk. JUST IN: THE FED JUST REMOVED ""REPUTATIONAL RISK"", EASING CRYPTO BANKING RESTRICTIONS. BULLISH #XRP pic.twitter.com/nGtqoWm3Ke — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 23, 2025 That detail is critical, as it removes a long-standing regulatory ambiguity that had often been used to restrict banking relationships with digital asset companies. This move follows the Comptroller of the Currency’s decision to remove crypto restrictions on regulated banks , allowing them to buy and trade digital assets. Why This Matters for XRP The connection to XRP is not arbitrary. XRP’s use case in banking and cross-border settlements has often required partnerships with financial institutions . Over the years, many U.S. banks avoided direct crypto exposure, citing reputational risk. The Fed has now shifted its stance. It recently recognized the advantages of XRP’s consensus mechanism . With this restriction now officially removed from its supervisory framework, there is a clearer path forward for regulated banks to engage with blockchain infrastructure providers, including those that use or support XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Opens New Doors More significantly, the Fed emphasized that while reputational risk will be excluded from its examination criteria, this change does not alter the requirement for banks to maintain strong risk management or comply with existing laws. In practical terms, this means that as long as banks uphold financial and operational standards, their choice to serve crypto firms can no longer be challenged on vague reputational grounds. For XRP, which relies heavily on adoption through real-world utility and integration, this policy change signals a more open environment. It reaffirms the growing perception that U.S. regulators are rethinking their approach to crypto-related banking access, removing barriers hidden in regulatory language and adopting a significantly different approach from the former administration’s war on cryptocurrencies.

This follows recent breaches at CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinTelegraph (CT) that exposed users to wallet-draining phishing schemes. The CMC and CT Attacks “Hackers are targeting information websites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect,” CZ said in a post on X. He pointed out that CMC was attacked just two days before CT was hit with a similar breach. The trouble began on June 21 when CMC users started seeing a pop-up that said “Verify Wallet” and asked them to connect their crypto wallets. Members of the crypto community on X quickly flagged the notification as a phishing attempt designed to deceive victims into revealing private keys or sensitive information. Shortly after the reports spread on social media, the platform acknowledged the malicious notification on its account. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” CoinMarketCap said in a Friday update . The team added that security investigations were underway and warned people not to connect their wallets. CZ later shared that early checks showed 39 individuals were affected by the incident, with total losses of around $18,570. CMC also revealed plans to reimburse those affected by the hack. On June 23, Cointelegraph’s website was also compromised in a front-end exploit. This time, users saw a pop-up promoting a fake token airdrop. The notification claimed people were eligible to get 50,000 “CTG” tokens, worth around $5,500 if they connected their wallets. The pop-up also falsely claimed that CertiK, a well-known security firm, had reviewed the smart contract. The media outlet confirmed the issue on Sunday night and said it was working to fix it. “Do not click on these pop-ups, connect your wallets, or enter any personal information,” it warned on X. Blockchain Security firm Scam Sniffer also found that the fake JavaScript code came from the company’s advertising system. Hackers Are Shifting Tactics In both cases, the bad actors were able to approve transactions and steal crypto once users connected their wallets. These incidents show a new trend where attackers are now using trusted news and data platforms to reach people instead of going after crypto exchanges directly. Meanwhile, a recent study by TRM Labs showed that phishing schemes and malware-based infrastructure attacks made up 70% of the $2.2 billion stolen in crypto-related hacks in 2024. Another report by Cybernews revealed a massive data breach that exposed over 16 billion login credentials, making it one of the largest stolen data collections ever found. Researchers believe this came from infostealer malware, credential stuffing, and past leaks that were repackaged.

The move appears to have reversed recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment across crypto markets. At 10:02 p.m. UTC on June 23, Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. According to his statement, each country would pause hostilities in coordinated stages: Iran would initiate a 12-hour ceasefire, followed by Israel, leading to a 24-hour complete cessation of the conflict. Trump described this as a successful conclusion to what he labeled a 12-day war — one he claimed could have escalated into a much longer and more devastating regional conflict. He praised both sides for choosing restraint and credited the agreement with averting further turmoil in the Middle East. The announcement injected a wave of optimism into the crypto market, especially for high-beta assets like ether. Prior to the rally, ETH had already been showing signs of strength, supported by steady whale accumulation. On-chain data shows over $265 million in ETH was acquired by large holders during the recent downturn, including a single wallet that purchased 47,070 ETH —r oughly $113 million — over a three-day period. Ethereum’s network fundamentals remain robust, with an average of 1 million new ETH wallet addresses created weekly since mid-May, representing a 50% year-over-year increase. With volatility receding and risk appetite returning, traders are now watching whether ETH can break through the next psychological threshold of $2,500. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH rallied 7.7% from $2,230 to $2,401 over the 24-hour analysis window. High-volume support formed between $2,220 and $2,230, with initial buying at $2,191.36. Price broke out above $2,400 during the 22:02–22:11 window as volume spiked to 28,149 ETH. Resistance at $2,275 flipped into support as buying momentum accelerated. ETH touched an intrahour high of $2,434.95 before entering a consolidation phase. Price action formed a potential bull flag as ETH traded between $2,390 and $2,402. Volume surged to 2.5x the 24-hour average in the final three hours of the session. Higher lows confirmed bullish structure throughout the uptrend.

Despite recent market turbulence, Ethereum whales and long-term traders are doubling down — but not just on ETH. Many are allocating into next-wave opportunities with stronger risk-to-reward ratios. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered that conversation with increasing frequency, especially as its early fundamentals now resemble the kind of token setups ETH traders historically favored in pre-breakout phases. Aptos Traders Are Eyeing Strategic Diversification Aptos has drawn strong developer interest and ecosystem engagement in 2025, maintaining a lead in blockchain activity. However, Aptos traders — particularly those focused on community-driven assets — are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. The project offers both meme energy and structured tokenomics, striking a balance that APT holders find appealing as they search for tokens with early-stage momentum and long-term potential. With its token supply locked and staking now live, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a framework that encourages accumulation, not speculation. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating Analyst Forecasts Analysts tracking altcoin rotations in mid-2025 have started highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare convergence of investor energy, ecosystem clarity, and strategic fundamentals. What began as a meme-centric project has evolved rapidly into a credible altcoin with legitimate infrastructure and community traction. The coin’s performance — both in terms of participation and market sentiment — suggests it may be entering a breakout cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining favor because of several key structural traits: Supply Certainty: With a locked supply of 170 billion tokens, there’s no inflation risk and no behind-the-scenes minting. Traders can assess value without fearing dilution. Audit by HashEx: Institutional-grade transparency has helped attract more serious capital and enhanced credibility. No Insider Control: The project is entirely community-owned with no VC interference, a trait especially important to Ethereum and Aptos veterans who’ve witnessed misaligned token launches in the past. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is the way it has combined meme-driven appeal with structural strength — a hybrid model that’s increasingly rare in the altcoin landscape. Final Thoughts: Is This the Ethereum of the Meme Era? While Ethereum and Aptos will likely continue dominating their sectors, the smartest investors are looking for what’s next. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a compelling answer — a project that mirrors early Ethereum in its community formation and upside potential but fits the current market’s appetite for engagement, utility, and reward mechanics. As more institutional and retail investors take notice, this token is quickly becoming more than a curiosity — it’s shaping up to be the 2025 cycle’s most watched altcoin.

New projects are bringing better tech, more adoption, and fresh attention from investors. Coins like Web3 ai (WAI), Sui (SUI), Cronos (CRO), and Litecoin (LTC) are gaining popularity through useful features, active communities, and strong development. Each coin shines in its own way, from blockchain-based AI to upgrades in DeFi. These coins are being seen as some of the best cryptos for 2025 for this cycle. In this article, we’ll cover why Web3 ai, SUI, CRO, and LTC are worth watching. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, understanding these coins will help you spot great buying opportunities. Let’s dive in! 1. Web3 ai (WAI): Driving AI and Blockchain Forward Web3 ai is fast becoming one of the best cryptos for 2025 today. Its unique blend of AI and blockchain makes it stand out. Many crypto projects focus on hype, but Web3 ai is building real tools for everyday users. These tools will help people make smart choices in the DeFi space and beyond, once it launches. Its AI-powered features offer real-time insights and smarter ways to use blockchain. Unlike other projects made for developers, Web3 ai ($WAI) is made for all users. One key reason why Web3 ai is leading among the best cryptos for 2025 is its deep blockchain integration. By linking AI with blockchain tech, it enables automated actions, smart predictions, and better decision-making for everyone. Its strong presale results show its value. Currently in stage 9, each $WAI token is priced at $0.000443. Over $8.4 million has already been raised, with 23.3 billion tokens sold. There are 50 stages in total. The last stage price will be $0.003276, with a listing price of $0.005242, giving a potential ROI of 1747% to early holders. Web3 ai’s clear roadmap and growing community prove it’s more than just another token. It’s shaping the future of AI and blockchain together, one of the best cryptos for 2025 to keep an eye on. 2. Sui (SUI): Attracting More Institutional Buyers Sui (SUI) is showing resilience, even after a 16% dip caused by the Cetus Protocol issue. The coin’s core strengths remain strong. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has climbed back to $2.47 billion. Institutional interest is also rising. A new spot ETF filing by 21Shares highlights growing confidence in SUI. Technically, SUI is trading above its 50- and 100-day EMAs. If it breaks past $4.26, it could soon retest its earlier high of $5.37. If market sentiment turns positive, Sui could outperform many bigger tokens. It holds its spot as one of the best cryptos for 2025 with strong potential. 3. Cronos (CRO): On the Path to Recovery Cronos (CRO) has bounced back from a steep 68% drop earlier this year. It found solid support around $0.07 to $0.08 and has now moved above $0.105. With an RSI of 53, CRO has room to climb higher without being overbought. If it crosses $0.1238, it could target $0.14. Growing interest on-chain and renewed community support make CRO worth watching. Among the best cryptos for 2025, it’s showing good momentum again and could challenge larger tokens if positive trends continue. 4. Litecoin (LTC): Smart Contracts Through BitcoinOS Upgrade Litecoin, known as “digital silver,” is seeing renewed interest. Its chart is forming a bull flag, hinting at a move toward $130. Whales are actively moving billions of LTC between wallets. Plus, over 75% of LTC holders have held onto their coins for at least 18 months, showing a strong belief in its long-term value. The recent BitcoinOS upgrade brings smart contracts and zero-knowledge rollups to Litecoin. This greatly boosts its DeFi abilities. With a fixed supply and fast transactions, LTC stands firm among the best cryptos for 2025 today. It can compete with legacy coins like Cardano and Tron. Final Thoughts As the market gears up for its next phase, coins like SUI, CRO, and LTC are gaining technical strength and community interest. Each brings something unique, from new DeFi features to growing institutional support. But Web3 ai stands apart for its practical AI tools, easy-to-use design, and strong presale momentum. It’s one of the best cryptos for 2025 to watch closely now. While all four coins offer exciting opportunities, Web3 ai’s clear use case and fast growth could make it the standout choice as the market heats up.

This paradox leaves traders and investors weighing which force will ultimately dominate the market’s next move. As pressure mounts from both sides, understanding the technical nuances behind this tug-of-war becomes crucial to anticipating BNB’s trajectory in the near term. BNB Faces Pressure From Key Technical Levels Analyzing the BNBUSD setup on the M30 timeframe, Thomas Anderson in an X post highlighted that the price is currently testing the yellow support line at $626.95, following a decisive drop below the cyan price line at $633.99. This breakdown has shifted short-term sentiment, suggesting that sellers are beginning to exert stronger control over the price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Breakout Could Trigger ATH Rally Repeat – Is $730 The Next Stop? According to Anderson, the 200 MA (red line), positioned between $642 and $645, is now acting as a dynamic resistance zone overhead. With price trading below this moving average, any attempts at recovery may face immediate rejection. He also pointed out that the H1 chart confirms the ongoing bearish momentum, with the price continuing to trade below both the cyan level and the 200 MA. This alignment between the M30 and H1 timeframes strengthens the case for further downside movement, especially if the current support at $626.95 fails to hold. Until buyers manage to reclaim key resistance levels, the overall outlook remains weak, and traders should keep an eye on how the price behaves around the current support to gauge the next likely move. BNB’s Price Outlook Strengthened By Bullish Continuation Signal Despite the bearish outlook presented by Thomas Anderson, eL Zippo expressed a more optimistic stance in his latest X tweet regarding BNB. He believes that BNB still has the potential to rise in value, challenging the prevailing negative sentiment around its recent price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Eyes Comeback: Can It Regain Momentum and Rally Higher? EL Zippo’s view is supported by the formation of a bullish flag pattern on the chart. This pattern is widely recognized as a continuation signal, indicating that the asset may resume its prior upward trend after a period of consolidation. For eL Zippo, the presence of this structure suggests that BNB could be setting up for another leg higher if market conditions align. At the time of writing, BNB was trading around the $623 mark, reflecting steady price action. The asset’s market capitalization stood at approximately $87.7 billion, signaling strong investor interest. Additionally, BNB recorded a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $1.8 billion, with price and volume showing percentage gains of 2.11% and 13.22%, respectively—an indication of renewed activity and positive sentiment in the market.

In a post on the social media platform X, Swissblock highlights a sudden plunge in on-chain liquidity, something the firm says needs to reverse if BTC should rally. “At the same time as the rest of the market has consolidated back into BTC, we have seen a drop off in our on-chain liquidity. For bullish continuation, we need to see an uptick again in on-chain liquidity.” Source: Swissblock/X On-chain liquidity refers to how easily and efficiently Bitcoin can be bought or sold without significantly impacting BTC’s price. Low liquidity environments suggest that there are not enough buyers to absorb sell orders, triggering price declines. Swissblock says that the fast drop in liquidity by itself is “a concern” and that BTC is showing a reduction in overall activity in the Bitcoin network. However, the analytics firm says that BTC’s long-term bullish market structure still looks solid. “Lower liquidity as price is more correlated with on-chain dynamics vs external factors. Lower activity making price more susceptible to downside volatility.. All is not lost. Even though we have had a liquidity flush, the bullish long-term structure is still intact as long as our Risk off signal is at 0… While liquidity conditions have deteriorated, the broader bullish structure remains intact – provided risk signals continue to hold.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $101,833.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity is causing some traders to hesitate and SUI bullish structure shows signs of a potential breakout, Unstaked is making its move, and it’s happening quickly. With a presale that’s already raised over $10.4 million and climbing, Unstaked is generating serious buzz and jumping into the conversation as the top crypto to buy right now. Unlike SHIB and SUI, Unstaked isn’t just riding waves, it’s building momentum with a clear structure, growing demand, and game-changing utility. This isn’t just another presale. It’s a front-row chance at the next big launch, and people are lining up. SHIB Whale Sell-Offs Raise Red Flags, But Could Offer a Reset There’s been a big shift in Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity, and it’s got the market watching closely. Major holders have started moving large amounts of SHIB to exchanges, often a signal that sell-offs are underway. For short-term traders, that’s a concern, especially as SHIB slips below critical moving averages. The $0.000025 zone is now acting as a key support, but if SHIB can’t hold, we could see more downside. Still, some see opportunity here. When whales exit, they often reset the chart, and for buyers with patience, that might be a golden entry point. Whether this is just a shakeout or a deeper dip is still unclear, but the impact of large wallets can’t be ignored. One thing’s certain: Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity is driving the short-term mood, and the next few days could set the tone for what’s ahead. SUI Bullish Structure Could Be Days Away from Breaking Out Now here’s where it gets interesting, SUI bullish structure is tightening, and that’s usually a pre-breakout signal. With a steady climb of higher lows and volume starting to build, SUI is gearing up for something bigger. Traders are eyeing key resistance levels, and if those flip, SUI could take off fast. Momentum is coiling like a spring. Technical indicators show positive signs, and the trendline is holding strong. Add in growing interest from technical traders, and SUI is now firmly on breakout watch. If it moves past resistance with volume, this could quickly become one of the most explosive charts on the table. All eyes are now on SUI, and if you’re not watching it, you might miss the move. Unstaked’s $100M Goal Might Look Bold, But the Presale’s Already Taking Off While others are still fighting resistance, Unstaked is flying past milestones. With a presale goal of $100 million and over $10.4 million already secured, this project is moving fast. Right now, it’s in stage 21, priced at just $0.011739, and that won’t last long. What sets it apart? It’s not just the numbers. Sixty percent of the total 6 billion $UNSD tokens are open to the public, with no secret deals or private sales. That means regular buyers get real access and real upside. On top of that, $20 million in launch liquidity is already locked in, which could smooth out the price action once trading begins. And then there’s the utility. At launch, Unstaked will introduce AI agents designed to grow and manage online communities. These tools will automate engagement, drive traffic, and reward performance through a unique Proof of Intelligence system, all powered by $UNSD. With a listing price of $0.1819, the current rate offers a steep discount. That’s why so many are calling this the top crypto to buy right now, because it’s still early, but not for long. Wrapping Up When price action cools down, serious buyers look at the roadmap. SHIB is uncertain, and SUI’s breakout hasn’t confirmed. Meanwhile, Unstaked is marching forward. With transparent tokenomics, a fully public presale, and AI utility going live at launch, it’s got structure, and that’s something most tokens can’t say before listing. $10.4 million raised already. A public presale with no hidden whales. A $0.011739 entry before a $0.1819 listing. If you’re still on the sidelines, you’re risking missing out. Unstaked isn’t just about hype, it’s delivering all the elements that matter, and it’s doing it now. If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy right now , this might be your moment to act before the market catches on.

The announcement comes as NATO leaders gather in The Hague to adopt the 5% goal —an increase from the alliance’s current 2% target—amid rising global security concerns. “This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to NATO and drive greater investment in the nation’s wider security and resilience,” Starmer said in a statement ahead of the summit. The pledge, seen as a nod to US President Donald Trump’s longstanding calls for European nations to shoulder more defense responsibilities, marks a significant step up from the UK’s current plans to reach 2.6% by 2027, including intelligence spending. However, the government has not detailed how it plans to meet the 5% goal, especially given that the lion’s share of the increase will occur after the next two general elections. Broader definition of security to include cyber defense, infrastructure, and borders As part of the new framework, the UK will broaden its definition of security spending beyond traditional defense to include border protection, critical infrastructure, and supply chain resilience. Starmer’s office said that factoring in these additional categories, the UK will hit 4.1% of GDP on security by 2027. Despite the expanded scope, the government has no current plans to increase core military spending beyond 2027. Still, the commitment envisions dedicating 3.5% to defense by 2035, leaving the remaining 1.5% for broader security efforts. Starmer had previously presented his increase in defense spending to 2.5% of GDP as “the biggest sustained rise since the end of the Cold War.” He first hinted at further increases in an interview earlier this month. NATO allies respond as the UK extends deadline and emphasizes strategic independence Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has intensified calls across Europe to bolster defense budgets, especially with growing uncertainty around the US security posture under a potential second Trump administration. To that end, Starmer ultimately won a commitment from the NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, to extend the deadline from 2032 to 2035. Most NATO allies will accept the new target. Still, Spain won an exemption through lobbying, demanding the rate be set at 2.1%, arguing that capability, not money, matters. Germany, meanwhile, said it intended to increase its defense expenditure to 3.5% in the next five years . The UK is also expected to unveil its National Security Strategy this week, alongside a long-awaited review of its ties with China and a new industrial plan. According to Starmer’s office, the strategy will emphasize competitiveness in areas such as science, education, trade, and advanced technology. It includes £86 billion ($116 billion) earmarked for R&D investment to support technology growth and strengthen protection against cyber threats and sabotage. Starmer’s office said they would become more unapologetic and systematic in pursuing their national interests, signaling a shift toward greater strategic independence and resilience.

With blue-chip assets stabilizing, the spotlight is shifting to early-stage projects that offer scarcity-driven growth and asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity, Structure, and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly gained traction as one of 2025’s most promising altcoins , joining the ranks of top bullish picks for the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its hard-cap mechanics, community-led rollout, and audited smart contract, ensuring no VC dilution or inflation risk. Its rapid series of sold-out pre-sale stages reflects real strategic demand. Its scarcity model and limited access favor early believers, creating the same kind of supply shock potential that fueled Ethereum’s early rise. On-chain activity shows that accumulation isn’t random: large, informed capital is locking in positions now, echoing historical patterns from past altcoin cycles. Bitcoin: Solid Foundation, Slower Expansion Bitcoin remains the foundation of the crypto market, currently trading at impressive levels with continued institutional interest. While BTC offers long-term security, many traders recognize that its upside is increasingly capped by market maturity. As a result, investors are branching out into smaller-cap projects with higher potential, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , in search of greater ROI while maintaining a core BTC position. Ethereum: Innovation Leader, but Competitive Ethereum continues to dominate as the leading smart contract platform, driven by its ongoing upgrades and expanding network utility. However, its price movements are now closely tied to regulatory headlines and broader macro trends. Traders seeking outsized returns are increasingly diversifying into earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offers exposure to rapid growth without Ethereum’s scale limitations. Kaspa: Steady Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Upside Kaspa is also gaining traction for its technical fundamentals and blockDAG technology, appealing to long-term builders and early adopters.

The deal, negotiated through Gulf intermediaries and direct talks with Israeli and Iranian officials, marks a dramatic de-escalation after nearly two weeks of military strikes. The crypto market responded immediately. With tensions cooling and traditional safe havens like gold plateauing, Bitcoin regained its risk-on momentum. Traders are betting that a period of regional stability could restore confidence in speculative assets. Trump credited early Iranian warning of a retaliatory missile strike for avoiding casualties at U.S. bases in Qatar, which helped pave the way for the truce. As regional hostilities paused, investors rotated out of defensive positions and re-entered crypto markets. Breaking News Trump has posted that he has brokered and ""complete and total ceasefire"" between Iran and Israel. #Iran #IranIsraelConflict #Trump #ceasefire pic.twitter.com/zQPraXx7Qa — The Blue Collar Intellectual (Julian) (@JulianAcciard1) June 23, 2025 Why Peace Lifts BTC and Crypto Geopolitical clarity tends to revive appetite for higher-risk assets. Ceasefire agreements, especially those with direct U.S. involvement, often act as catalysts for equity and crypto rebounds. Reduced global uncertainty restores market confidence. Traders unwind hedges like gold and bonds. Volatility decreases, encouraging capital inflows to crypto. Bitcoin, known for its sharp sensitivity to macro headlines, acts as a barometer for global sentiment. With risk appetite returning, its rebound above $105K could signal broader recovery across altcoins and digital assets. Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes Breakout The Bitcoin price prediction turned bullish following the cryptocurrency’s recent surge, pushing it through the 50-period EMA at $103,806 and forming a strong bullish engulfing pattern. Momentum indicators like MACD have turned decisively bullish, with a wide histogram and crossover signal suggesting more upside. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, BTC now faces critical trendline resistance near $106,000. This level marks the descending barrier from June highs and remains a key decision zone for bulls. Key Levels: Resistance: $106,000, $107,580, $109,041 Support: $103,965, $102,199, $100,487 Trade Idea: A confirmed breakout above $106K on strong volume may open a run toward $109K. A failed retest or bearish engulfing at $106K could send BTC back to $102K. With over $64.9B in daily trading volume and a $2.09 trillion market cap, Bitcoin remains technically balanced but fundamentally charged. The Israel-Iran ceasefire may be the pivot traders needed to chase higher highs, as long as peace holds. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.3M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1.5 million milestone in its public presale, raising $1,527,516.42 out of a $1,763,403 target. With just hours left before the next price tier, buyers can still secure HYPER at $0.012 per token. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC network. It combines Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with ultra-low gas fees and seamless BTC bridging. Audited by Consult, Bitcoin Hyper is built for trust, scale, and performance. Over 91 million $HYPER are already staked, with projected post-launch staking rewards of up to 577% APY. The token fuels gas fees, dApp access, and decentralized governance. The presale accepts both crypto and cards, and through Web3Payments, no wallet is required. Meme culture meets utility—Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as Layer 2’s potential breakout star of 2025.

The Galaxy Unpacked summer event in Brooklyn, New York, starting at 10 a.m. local time, aims to debut the company’s latest breakthroughs in foldable smartphones and artificial intelligence technology. The new Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 will focus attention. These devices will bring a better design, features, and overall user experience to help the company remain dominant in the foldable phone market. The external display on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is also said to be larger and more functional when the phone is closed. This could make it more friendly to those who prioritize a handset that doesn’t require them to pick up the phone without being as aggressive in the design stakes as Motorola’s Razr Ultra. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is believed to follow the firm’s lead and further refine its vision for a smartphone-tablet crossover. The Fold 7 is likely to address some of the problems with foldables, including thinness, the size of the bezels, and durability. Samsung is confident its relentless technology evolution and leadership will grow foldable devices into a more mainstream product. The company faces fierce competition, especially from Chinese brands like Huawei, Honor, and Oppo, which have aggressively expanded their foldable offerings. Samsung drives AI transformation in mobile devices Aside from the hardware, Samsung is also working hard on AI. Among the arsenal we expect the company to unveil is its Galaxy AI suite , an array of AI-powered tools designed to change how consumers interact with their devices. From clever photo editing and real-time translation to productivity gains and better search, Galaxy AI is set to play a significant role in next month’s event. According to Bloomberg, Samsung is reportedly nearing a deal to put Perplexity’s AI assistant on future Galaxy devices as a pre-installed replacement or supplement to Google Assistant on certain devices in certain markets. The move could represent a significant change in Samsung’s AI strategy, offering it an even larger degree of control over the user experience while reducing the reliance on Google’s ecosystem. AI integration is coming as Samsung and other tech giants are racing to stay ahead with the increasing demand for smart, context-aware tools. AI has emerged as a critical battlefield in mobile, and Samsung seems set to make a bigger push into that field. Rivals challenge Samsung’s foldable dominance Samsung may be the leading player in the global foldable market, but the war has just begun. Some Chinese handset makers have been even more aggressive; Honor unveiled an extra-thin foldable, the Magic V5, that falls to a skinflinty 8.8 millimeters when collapsed for those who need the power but want to look stylish. In the United States, Google is Samsung’s closest competitor in the world of foldables. Later this summer, the tech giant is also expected to unveil the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a new and sorely needed challenger to Samsung’s dominance. Google has never approached Samsung’s scale in this area, but its Android-AI story has some unique charm for certain users. Apple, Samsung’s largest smartphone competitor worldwide, has not released a foldable device. However, insiders indicate that Apple is secretly developing its own foldable iPhone for a possible release by 2026. Apple’s foray into foldables would turn the market on its head and maybe push foldable phones towards becoming a mass-market product.

BlockDAG is one of them. It has already raised over $318.5 million, sold 23.1 billion coins, and is now aiming for a $600 million finish. This isn’t just another Layer 1 idea; it’s a functional system already welcoming users, developers, and miners before any exchange listing. Many projects throw around the term most successful crypto, but BlockDAG is showing the receipts. With a technical backbone that fuses DAG’s scalability and Proof-of-Work’s security, the path to that $600M milestone looks more possible by the day. From Testnet to Mainnet: Inside BlockDAG’s Infrastructure Unlike the usual whitepaper projects waiting to build, BlockDAG already has a live testnet. Smart contracts are active. A no-code dApp builder is available to both devs and non-devs. Plus, over 2 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 app. The mainnet launch is on a six-week countdown, ready, scheduled, and about to begin. Here’s the rollout plan: Week 6: Presale ends, staking wraps up, wallet migration kicks off. Week 4: Mainnet and ASIC mining go live, though BDAG isn’t circulating yet. Week 3: Community nodes and mining pools come online. Week 2: Airdrop of 40% presale supply and DeFi tools like DEX, bridge, and oracles go live. This isn’t theory, it’s a timeline with clear execution, and that clarity is helping push the presale forward fast. No-Code Tools, Dev Incentives, and a Builder-First Ecosystem Hyped coins come and go. But protocols that thrive long term tend to do one thing right: bring in developers. BlockDAG knows this. It’s launching grants, hackathons, and tools before listings even begin. Its no-code builder is already in use, letting anyone launch smart contracts on testnet. Add EVM support, and it becomes even easier for Ethereum-based teams to try BlockDAG’s faster, more affordable platform. The team is also backing early projects with grants and promo support, aiming to hit 1,000+ dApps by 2026. This type of growth clearly implies that BlockDAG could hit listings with a live app ecosystem, something even Solana and Avalanche needed time to build. Why the $600M Target Means Real Infrastructure, Not Just Hype Large raises usually scream hype. But for BlockDAG, $600 million is about making the system real. The numbers speak for themselves: 2M+ users mining via X1 App Over 18,100 ASIC miners sold Live public testnet with smart contracts No-code dApp builder already active 20 exchanges lined up Over 200,000 holders of BDAG This raise isn’t just for attention. It’s to support a network built before listing. The goal isn’t to pump post-launch, it’s to empower the people building it now. Right now, BDAG is available at $0.0020, but that climbs to $0.0030 after June 24. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, that means early supporters could be looking at a 2,400% upside by the time it hits exchanges. Is BlockDAG the Most Successful Crypto of 2025? “Success” can mean different things. For some, it’s price gains. For others, it’s utility and growth. BlockDAG is setting up for both. It’s already outpacing major Layer 1s in early traction, raising $318.5 million without VC help, delivering real systems, and launching with a mapped-out public countdown. It has the tools. It has the roadmap. And more importantly, it’s got real momentum. Once the presale hits $600M and the rollout executes step-by-step, BlockDAG might not just be another project launch. It could very well be the most successful crypto of 2025.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Just Made Large Exchange Inflows At A Loss In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about how the Bitcoin short-term holders have reacted to the price volatility that has come alongside rising tensions in the Middle East following US strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The other side of the network, the holders with a holding time greater than 155 days, are termed as the long-term holders (LTHs). The former group contains the new entrants and low conviction holders, who generally panic easily whenever some change occurs in the market. On the other hand, the latter cohort includes the veterans of the market, who tend to sit tight through crashes and rallies alike. As such, given the recent sharp price action that has occurred in the sector, the STHs are likely to have made some moves. And indeed, on-chain data would confirm so. The above chart, shared by the analyst, shows the data for the profit and loss exchange deposit transactions that the STHs as a whole are making. Investors usually transfer to these centralized platforms when they want to sell, so inflows going to them can provide hints about whether selling is elevated or not. From the graph, it’s visible that the loss transactions going to the exchanges from this cohort have amounted to 14,700 BTC, which, although lower than the two major capitulation events from the past couple of months, is significant. Thus, it would appear that some of the STHs have reacted to the news by exiting the market, even if it means taking a loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? It’s also apparent from the chart that the profitable transfers have remained relatively low at 3,100 BTC. This is likely down to the fact that the STHs are left with little profit following the price decline, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. In the chart, the trend of the STH Realized Price is displayed. This indicator keeps track of the Bitcoin cost basis or acquisition level of the average STH. During the crash, the price almost retested the line, and even after the rebound, it remains close to it, meaning the profit margin for the cohort is still tight. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $101,300, down over 5% in the last week.

As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates and large-cap momentum slows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing early-stage watchlists. Could it become the most strategic play for these seasoned investor bases? MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Builds Ahead of Public Listing MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong traction among early-stage investors, with experts calling it one of the most promising new altcoin entries of 2025 . Its momentum is being fueled by a limited token supply, a rapidly filling pre-sale, and a growing wave of institutional and retail interest. The project is fully audited and structured to deliver long-term value, making it a standout in today’s altcoin landscape. Key highlights include: Over $10 million already raised , with ongoing demand across every pre-sale round Scarcity-based tokenomics and capped supply , designed to support price stability and upside Full smart contract audit and transparent governance , building investor confidence ahead of public listing XRP: Seeking Sharper Upside Beyond Legal Resolution XRP continues to trade in a tight range while the Ripple vs. SEC case nears conclusion. Prediction markets now estimate an 88% chance of spot ETF approval before year-end. Although XRP’s global payments use case and DeFi integrations are expanding, its price remains capped. Many XRP holders—aware that previous cycle returns are unlikely to repeat—are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a fresh-growth opportunity ahead of exchange listings. Solana: Institutional Inflows and Layer-1 Strength Solana is enjoying increased institutional adoption, with public firms investing for its speed, staking yield, and strength in NFTs and DeFi. Spot ETF approval odds for SOL are now at 92%, fueling its recent climb above $178 and momentum toward $200. But as Solana becomes more mature, many traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE , which analysts forecast could deliver up to 4,000% upside —a rare window in today’s market. Polygon: Scaling Ambitions, but Traders Seek Higher Multiples Polygon’s “Gigagas” roadmap targets up to 100,000 TPS and broader interoperability for global payment dominance. While MATIC may reach $0.27–$0.35 in June 2025, it remains range-bound. Facing growing competition, many Polygon investors are moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its capped supply, rapid pre-sale sellouts, and projected listing price of $0.007 . Conclusion With traders from XRP, Solana, and Polygon all seeking the next breakout altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the consensus early-stage favorite for 2025. Its scarcity-based tokenomics, surging demand, and strong analyst backing suggest that those who act early could be perfectly positioned for the next cycle of crypto growth.

Dogecoin Consolidates in Mid‑$0.17 Range Amid Cautious Market Sentiment As of the time of writing, the trading price of dogecoin (DOGE) is about $0.1682 with the intraday highs being at $0.1715 and the lows at around $0.1674. The meme-coin has been contained in the range over a series of days, with the price movement remaining below the significant moving averages. Unless DOGE surpasses the resistance point of 0.1760, analysts caution that the cryptocurrency can remain in its consolidation stage. Long‑term accumulation on-chain indicates that DOGE still remains on the radar. In the meantime, new tokens also start appearing in the spotlight of investors, such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Stage 5 Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up some serious traction as it reaches Stage 5 of its presale. With more than 12,300 early adopters and more than $11 million raised, it’s clear to see this isn’t a flash in the pan wave of sentiment, Mutuum Finance is taking big steps as a key player in the DeFi. Whereas tokens are founded on ephemeral mania for the most part, Mutuum is founded on usability and sustained scalability with sound fundamentals backing it. Phase 5 investors will be rewarded with up to 2x ROI, when the token launch price of $0.06 is hit. Stable, Audited, and Future-Proof: A USD-Pegged Token on Ethereum In its strategic efforts to deepen its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin on the Ethereum network. Unlike highly volatile algorithmic stablecoins, this token is crafted to hold its value even in extreme market fluctuations, earning it a solid store of value and medium of exchange. Security and integrity are central to the project. The Mutuum Finance platform was audited completely by CertiK, one of the most established blockchain security firms. This audit again testifies to the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and long-term sustainability. Early Investors Reward as Community Grows To celebrate the presale action and express gratitude to early adopters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $100,000 giveaway . Ten of these winners will receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens as a “thank you” for being one of the early backers of the project. While the community expands rapidly, the early supporters are being rewarded, not only with the possibility of future upside, but with concrete, real-time rewards. Dogecoin’s stagnant price action around $0.17 continues to leave investors underwhelmed, while utility-first projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are stealing the spotlight. Currently priced at just $0.03, MUTM has already raised over $11 million from 12,300+ investors, offering up to 2x returns before launch and long-term upside driven by real DeFi use. With a USD-pegged stablecoin, CertiK audit, and a $100K giveaway fueling momentum, Mutuum Finance is proving to be a smarter, future-ready alternative to hype-driven coins like DOGE.

In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a rare opportunity—analysts are increasingly calling it the most undervalued crypto asset of the year , mirroring the early dynamics of Bitcoin’s historic bull runs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Momentum and Analyst Confidence Unlike fleeting meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on a scarcity-focused framework and a community-first governance model. Its fixed supply and structured tokenomics have triggered rapid sellouts across every pre-sale phase, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Experts say the current valuation is significantly disconnected from its long-term upside—a pattern historically associated with substantial returns, echoing early Bitcoin cycles. A full smart contract audit and aggressive marketing strategy further strengthen the project’s credibility. As altcoin rotation accelerates, analysts project exponential gains as MAGACOIN FINANCE enters price discovery on major exchanges. Bitcoin’s Rally Sets the Stage for Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin recently broke above $111,000, fueled by institutional inflows, ETF approvals, and a surge in whale accumulation. While BTC remains the market’s anchor, its upside from here is seen as more modest compared to early-stage altcoins. Analysts believe the next phase of the bull cycle will see capital rotating into high-upside tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE, echoing the pattern that sent Ethereum and Solana soaring after Bitcoin’s previous peaks. Ethereum and Injective Protocol: Momentum and Upgrades Ethereum, despite a recent security scare, is expected to stabilize and regain momentum as network upgrades and innovation continue. Meanwhile, Injective Protocol’s launch of INJ 3.0 and deflationary tokenomics have secured overwhelming community support, positioning it as a leader in the next wave of innovation. Both ETH and INJ are seeing capital rotate into early-stage opportunities, with many traders now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next breakout candidate. Conclusion: The Rare Setup Everyone’s Watching With Bitcoin’s rally confirming the bull market and Ethereum and Injective Protocol driving innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the high-upside play analysts say could echo the legendary returns of past bull cycles. As pre-sale stages sell out and momentum builds, the window for early entry is closing fast—making MAGACOIN FINANCE a top contender for 2025’s breakout story.

46652909,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=754131,1750729011,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/46652909.jpeg,Is Mango’s Multi-VM approach enough to solve fragmented liquidity?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-mango-fix-liquidity-fragmentation/,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) still struggles with fragmented liquidity, where users face higher costs, developers must duplicate their efforts across chains, and capital becomes less efficient because every blockchain operates in isolation. A new Layer 1 blockchain, Mango Network , claims it runs several virtual machines, Ethereum’s EVM, Solana’s SVM, and Facebook’s MoveVM (Multi-VM architecture) on a shared system. This allows it to connect apps and users from different blockchain communities without risky third-party tools. Mango even launched a major airdrop to reward early users, and its testnet claims to handle more than 297,000 transactions per second due to high-speed performance. But can a single blockchain link multiple virtual machines, both enable assets to move freely, process extremely fast transactions, and remain secure? Some followers say Mango will open up access to liquidity and open the world of decentralized finance to everyone in a more connected and useful way, to a wider array of people. Still, critics worry the system is too complex, too new, and potentially so unstable that it becomes increasingly difficult to untangle as it grows. Why should anyone care about Mango Network? Mango Network is a newly launched full-chain Layer 1 blockchain that aims to change how developers build and users interact with decentralized applications across different ecosystems. While traditional blockchains rely on just one type of virtual machine (VM), such as Ethereum’s EVM or Solana’s SVM, Mango supports multiple virtual machines running side by side within a single network. The company may use Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for Solidity-based apps, MoveVM for applications written in the Move language (originally developed by Meta), and Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for Rust-based, high-performance programs. With this unique structure, Mango creates one platform where developers from different blockchains can build apps using their preferred tools. At the same time, users interact with these products through one account and ecosystem without leaving the platform or going through risky, expensive, and slow bridging processes. The company gave away 5% of its MGO token supply to early adopters, testnet participants, and contributors through a community-first airdrop that allowed users to trade, stake, or move their tokens as they please before Mango’s Token Generation Event (TGE). Mango secured $13.5 million in Series B funding in February 2025 for security audits, ecosystem development, developer onboarding, and expanding toolkits to make it easier to build on the network. Mango’s vision of shared infrastructure, native cross-VM communication, and unified state management could set a new standard for what a blockchain can do. Why does DeFi struggle with fragmented liquidity? Each blockchain (Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, etc) has its tokens, apps, smart contracts, and user base locked within its network that traps money and assets in silos. This isolation slows down the entire DeFi economy because money can’t move freely or interact with other ecosystems, and creates multiple small liquidity pools instead of one large, flexible pool of capital. Users have to use third-party bridges or deal with wrapped tokens that copy the value of the original asset, but come with their risks, just to move assets between chains, like sending tokens from Ethereum to Solana. Bridges cause huge losses because they’re often slow, expensive, and complicated, and in many cases, they’ve been hacked or broken. In contrast, wrapped tokens can break the connection to the original asset or lose value if the wrapping system fails. This fragmentation costs developers time and money and splits their user base across different versions of the same application. They must either stick to one chain and limit their audience or rebuild and redeploy their app across multiple chains to reach more users. It also multiplies their workload and adds unnecessary complexity to DeFi building as they must maintain these versions, manage different smart contracts, and track separate liquidity pools. On the other hand, users must set up different wallets, learn new interfaces, and pay extra fees each time they move money around just to use apps on multiple chains. The struggle creates a broken experience where users feel like they’re jumping between disconnected worlds instead of using one global financial system. How Mango Network tries to fix liquidity fragmentation Mango Network connects smart contracts on different VMs through a communication protocol built on OPStack (OP-Mango) that syncs all the VMs and ensures data and events are correctly passed between them. Developers can mix and match components from different VMs, and users can access a unified experience because cross-chain interactions are faster, smoother, and far more secure. There’s also no need to sync data across different parts of the chain on Mango’s shared global state across all VMs because every virtual machine (EVM, MoveVM, and SVM) reads from and writes to the same underlying ledger. On top of that, users only need one account to access all dApps and services across all supported VMs. In addition, Mango allows tokens to move freely and natively within the network through a standardized format for digital assets across all VMs, making wrapping, copying, or bridging unnecessary. Developers can now create more reliable apps, and users can transfer or use their tokens more confidently, knowing they won’t encounter compatibility problems. Mango’s unified liquidity pools across all VMs allow assets deposited into one protocol to be used instantly by another, even if the apps are written in different languages and built for different VMs.You won’t have to copy funds, bridge tokens, or manually move assets between services because a lending protocol built on EVM can contribute liquidity to a DEX written in MoveVM, and vice versa. Can Mango’s Network handle the load? Mango Network says the blockchain can process up to 297,450 transactions per second (TPS) and offer sub-second finality. This means a transaction gets confirmed and finalized almost instantly once a user sends it. Mango could support thousands of decentralized apps and millions of users without suffering from congestion or delays if these numbers prove true on the mainnet. The network processed over 120 million on-chain interactions in more than 500,000 wallet addresses from token swaps, staking, cross-chain transfers, and decentralized trading through its ecosystem partner, BeingDEX, in just a few weeks during its testnet campaign. Mango’s parallel execution engine, MoveVM, uses the Move language’s resource-oriented design to process many operations simultaneously rather than waiting for each one to finish before starting the next. Moreover, Solana’s SVM runs on the Sealevel execution engine to provide blazing speeds and high throughput in the Solana ecosystem. However, testnets may not behave the same way as real economic activity on a live chain because they often involve simulated or incentivized traffic. Mainnet conditions introduce new challenges like malicious behavior, network-wide stress tests, flash loan attacks, and unexpected user spikes that can expose weaknesses in performance or security.. Mango’s true test will come after its Token Generation Event (TGE) and mainnet launch, when real users, real assets, and real market demand begin to flood the chain. The platform could set a new benchmark for performance in DeFi infrastructure if it can deliver sub-second speeds and high transaction throughput without compromising security, reliability, or developer experience. However, it may need to scale back its ambitions or make rapid improvements if it doesn’t. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

While concerns about a potential double top persist, on-chain data has yet to show any major warning signs. Bitcoin Undergoing Healthy Consolidation According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Avocado_onchain, despite broader market sentiment turning bearish, BTC has not yet displayed any significant red flags. In fact, the cryptocurrency still appears to be in a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Pull 4,500 BTC From Binance, Hinting At Incoming Rally Notably, the 30-day moving average (MA) of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicates that long-term holders are continuing to hold onto their BTC rather than selling. This suggests that investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential for further upside in the near term. For the uninitiated, the 30-day MA Binary CDD smooths out daily fluctuations to show how frequently long-term Bitcoin holders are moving their coins over a month. A lower value suggests strong holding behavior and accumulation, while a higher value may indicate distribution or selling pressure from experienced holders. The analyst noted in a previous analysis that when Bitcoin’s Binary CDD exceeded 0.8, it was typically followed by a steep correction. However, this time, the indicator has peaked around 0.6 and is now on the decline – suggesting the market is far from overheating. They added: Although the data may not align perfectly from cycle to cycle, this moderation below 0.8 still implies the market may be entering a consolidation period, and further price or time correction could follow. The analyst emphasized that this indicator does not signal the end of the bull run. Rather – similar to the previous two market phases – Bitcoin could be following a “staircase-like movement,” where periods of consolidation are followed by a strong upward leg. They concluded that BTC historically tends to rally when market attention fades and sentiment remains quiet. Therefore, the current period of low volatility could be a precursor to Bitcoin’s next major move to the upside. Are BTC Bears In Trouble? While the current bearish sentiment may have raised hopes for further price pullback for the largest cryptocurrency by reported market cap, both technical and on-chain indicators suggest otherwise.

That said, some caution is warranted, as short-term holders have been selling during recent dips, showing a lack of confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to sustain its upward trajectory. At press time, BTC trades at $101,954, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

XRP and Arbitrum attract attention with volume surges and price forecasts, but Unstaked offers a new model based on usability. Its platform lets users build, deploy, and profit from AI agents without writing a line of code. These bots can be rented or monetized across X, Telegram, and other platforms. Unstaked stands out among top crypto performers for empowering users to create and benefit from infrastructure-level participation. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Prediction Reflects Mixed Sentiment Arbitrum (ARB) is regaining interest after dipping to $0.73 in May 2025. Analysts see potential recovery paths: a range of $0.25 to $1.20 for late 2025, and $1.50 to $2.40 by 2026 if Ethereum’s layer-2 demand grows. Long-term predictions stretch from $0.43 to $5 by 2030, depending on regulatory clarity and infrastructure adoption. While volatility remains a factor, the Arbitrum (ARB) price prediction highlights how scaling needs and Ethereum developments could shape its future performance. XRP Futures Reach $30M: New Tools & Price Movement XRP futures launched on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and quickly reached nearly $30 million in trading volume. This momentum has sparked speculation about a potential spot XRP ETF, which could drive further liquidity. Technical analysis shows XRP breaking past key resistance levels, aiming for a mid-term target of $4.90. The new futures market gives traders additional ways to hedge and speculate, enhancing market depth and boosting overall visibility. XRP price analysis remains central as institutional interest expands. Unstaked Introduces a No-Code, AI-Driven Creator Model Unstaked brings a new approach to digital ownership. Users can become “Agent Creators” and build AI agents without coding skills. These bots handle content, community tasks, and interaction across social platforms. Backed by Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence system, each agent’s actions are recorded on-chain, allowing owners to lease or license them.

SHIB Price Stalls & WLD Picks Up",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-to-ship-miners-before-trading-even-begins-18100-units-sold-shib-price-stalls-wld-picks-up/,"SHIB’s sideways trend continues, while WLD’s recent spike is stealing market attention. Was it just a temporary rise or the beginning of sustained growth? Traders remain cautious, eyeing Shiba Inu’s potential breakout and WLD’s resistance levels. But while those two battle technical uncertainty, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking bold action. BlockDAG has taken a different path, shipping actual mining hardware before its coin even enters the market. Scheduled for shipping from July 7 onwards, these ASIC miners are being sent out ahead of trading. So far, over 18,100 mining rigs have been sold. This early rollout places BlockDAG in a category of its own. For those focused on finding the highest ROI crypto, moving ahead of exchange listings might be the smartest step. Unlike the stalled SHIB charts, BlockDAG is already delivering. BlockDAG To Ship Miners Before Trading Kicks Off BlockDAG is flipping the script on how crypto launches work. Instead of waiting to earn credibility through listings, it’s already delivering. The shipment of real ASIC miners begins on July 7, well before BDAG appears on any exchange. With a US-based sponsorship set to be announced on June 30, it’s not simply preparing for success; it’s demonstrating readiness now. What makes this even more significant is that BlockDAG becomes the first blockchain project to release hardware before exchange trading. It shows real-world commitment and preparation, not empty claims. While many coins are still selling ideas, BlockDAG is handing users actual machines. This approach is why people are calling it the highest ROI crypto of 2025. The presale currently sits in Batch 29 of 45. So far, over 23.1 billion BDAG coins have been sold, raising more than $318.5 million. Right now, buyers can still get BDAG at a special limited-time price of $0.0020 until June 24, after which it will increase to $0.0030. As each new batch pushes prices upward, the $600 million goal draws closer. There’s no need to wait for proof; BlockDAG is already showing results. It’s not just another presale; it’s one already in motion. Early backers have seen their funds grow by 2,660% since batch 1. The machines are nearly out the door; those who act before the next price rise may get the highest ROI crypto entry of this cycle. WLD’s Price Gains, Backed by Solid Ecosystem Support Worldcoin (WLD) recently climbed from $1.11 to $1.18, largely due to new developments tied to OpenAI and stablecoin adoption. OpenAI’s shift to Google Cloud gave WLD a boost, as did the World Chain’s June 11 integration of USDC. This added tangible use cases, expanding its reach to Uniswap, Morpho Labs, and BitGo. These updates increased trade volume by 38% and brought WLD close to its $1.20 resistance. Financial rising graph and chart with lines and numbers that illustrate stock market behaviour. Concept of successful trading. Dark blue background. 3d rendering Despite this positive trend, WLD hasn’t broken through $1.20 with conviction. Technical indicators are mixed, RSI is neutral at 52, and while MACD leans bullish, there’s hesitation. If the coin doesn’t break above resistance soon, a short-term pullback is likely. WLD’s near-term future hinges on how strongly it can push past its current ceiling. SHIB Price Formation Suggests a Breakout May Be Forming SHIB continues to hover around $0.0000122, trading in a narrow range since June 12. A double-bottom pattern is forming near its key support, hinting at possible upward momentum. Should it break past $0.00001285, its 50-hour simple moving average, it might target the $0.0000133 range. Though trading volume has dipped, the chart setup hints at steady accumulation. However, confirmation will only come once SHIB holds above $0.0000126. If it slips, a fall toward $0.0000115 could follow. The 50-day SMA continues to act as a ceiling, limiting upward moves. While the current pattern doesn’t yet signal major strength, it also doesn’t suggest weakness. A volume-backed move beyond resistance could be the catalyst SHIB needs. Final Thoughts! WLD’s climb reflects optimism around its OpenAI and USDC connections, but resistance at $1.20 remains a challenge. Meanwhile, SHIB’s tight price formation suggests a breakout may be coming, though it still lacks confirmation. Both are showing activity, but neither has broken through to dominance. BlockDAG, in contrast, has already stepped ahead. With miners shipping on July 7 and a US-based sponsorship going live on June 30, it stands out as the only project delivering real value ahead of listings. The $0.0020 price freeze ends June 24, marking this moment as a possible entry into what many are calling the highest ROI crypto for 2025 . The path is clear, and progress is already visible.

With SEI ecosystem traders and top analysts now spotlighting this pre-sale, the stage is set for a disruptive new entry that could reshape the altcoin narrative. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early-Stage Advantage MAGACOIN FINANCE is forecasted by analysts to deliver returns that could outpace even sector giants, with projections of a 75x–100x surge upon listing. Strategic investors are flocking to its pre-sale, drawn by a capped supply, full audit, and zero stealth minting risk. Unlike Bitcoin and Solana—now tied to macro trends and ETF flows—MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a rare early-stage entry point with outsized ROI potential. Each presale phase is filling fast, fueled by transparent tokenomics, community-first incentives, and SEI traders rotating profits into what many call the next crypto phenomenon. Bitcoin & Solana: Strength, But Limited Explosive Upside Bitcoin is trading above $105,000, buoyed by ETF inflows and supportive policy, while Solana’s ecosystem is booming with upgrades and institutional traction. Both assets are expected to post steady gains, with Solana forecasted to reach the $270 range and Bitcoin potentially targeting $135,000–$175,000 by year-end. However, their massive market caps now suggest more stability and less room for the kind of exponential moves seen in earlier cycles. SEI: Bullish Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Steals the Spotlight SEI is drawing attention for its uptrend and robust ecosystem, with forecasts suggesting a rise toward the $1 range by year-end. Yet, even as SEI posts strong gains, traders are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its unmatched early-stage upside and rapidly growing community. The pre-sale’s momentum and security assurances are setting a new standard for what’s possible in 2025’s altcoin market. Conclusion: The Breakout Story of 2025? While Bitcoin, Solana, and SEI remain strong performers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing the imagination of traders and analysts alike. With a scarcity-driven model, robust security, and surging demand, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the breakout altcoin story of 2025—especially for those who position early.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin recovered to $106K after dipping below $98.5K, following Trump’s ceasefire announcement. An 8% drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate raised concerns, though analysts say such volatility is not unusual. Markets are now pricing in higher odds of Fed rate cuts, supporting risk assets like BTC. The recovery came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a “total ceasefire” between Israel and Iran, calming market nerves after a weekend of geopolitical uncertainty. The sudden price dip led to $193 million in liquidations of long leveraged Bitcoin positions, but that accounted for just 0.3% of total open interest. With roughly $68 billion in leveraged positions still active, the derivatives market remains largely unaffected. Bitcoin’s Hashrate Drops 8% in One Week Adding to the volatility, Bitcoin’s hashrate dropped 8% over the past week, from 943.6 million TH/s to 865.1 million TH/s, fueling speculation of disrupted mining activity. Analysts have pointed to Iran’s role in global mining, though accurate data remains elusive. Reports suggest up to 2 gigawatts of electricity may be consumed by unauthorized mining operations in the country. However, sudden hashrate fluctuations are not uncommon. Energy-related shutdowns in the U.S. are often the cause. Analyst Daniel Batten noted similar dips occur during extreme weather events, such as the April 22 storms in Texas and Oklahoma that temporarily slashed hashrate by 27%. No this is not because Iran is secretly mining large swathes of Bitcoin using nuclear energy. Firstly, drops like this are common (see chart below) and are more likely due to ERCOT curtailment (being paid to shed load, or getting a price signal it's uneconomical to mine).… https://t.co/AxX3poncZ6 pic.twitter.com/XnL4YGaMCl — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) June 23, 2025 On the macro front, oil prices dropped sharply Monday, retreating from a Sunday peak of $77, as broader markets responded positively to the ceasefire. The S&P 500 rose 1%, while expectations grew for U.S. interest rate cuts. According to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, the probability of the Federal Reserve maintaining its current 4.25% rate through November has fallen to 8.4%. Meanwhile, the chance of rates dropping to 3.75% or lower rose to 53%, up from 38% last week. Whether Bitcoin can break through $110,000 remains uncertain, but the quick recovery suggests institutional appetite hasn’t weakened. For now, traders are balancing optimism over de-escalation with caution around global and macroeconomic developments. Crypto Funds Log $1.24B in 10th Week of Inflows Crypto funds recorded $1.24 billion in inflows last week, marking the tenth consecutive week of gains and pushing year-to-date totals to a record $15.1 billion. Despite the milestone, the pace of inflows slowed in the latter half of the week. The report attributed the decline to the U.S. Juneteenth holiday and rising geopolitical uncertainty surrounding reports of U.S. involvement in the Iran conflict . The US remained the primary driver, contributing $1.25 billion in inflows. Canada and Germany added $20.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. Bitcoin attracted $1.1 billion in fresh capital, marking its second straight week of inflows despite recent price weakness, signaling continued appetite among institutional buyers. Short-Bitcoin products, meanwhile, saw modest outflows of $1.4 million, reinforcing the bullish bias.

Over the past week, the price dropped below a crucial support zone between $2.50 and $2.10, triggering a sharp fall toward the $1.95 to $1.92 range. As predicted earlier, XRP did find temporary support around $1.92, bouncing slightly from that level. However, if the price breaks below $1.90 on a daily closing basis, it could trigger a further decline towards $1.80 to $1.79, which is considered the next key support zone. For now, resistance for XRP stands between $2.16 and $2.60. A decisive breakout above $2.16 would be the first sign that the downtrend might be easing. Until then, the overall market structure remains bearish on the daily chart, with small bounces likely but no confirmed trend reversal yet. If XRP falls below $1.79, it could enter a risky zone where lower levels like $1.56 and even $1.21 might come into play. On the other hand, a break above resistance with a strong five-wave pattern could hint at a bullish recovery starting earlier than expected. Expert Says ‘Nothing Is Confirmed Yet’ Analyst Casi Trades has warned that XRP is once again approaching a key support level at $1.90. Casi explained that this kind of “bounce-then-final-dip” move is common before a proper bottom forms. While nothing is confirmed yet, XRP remains in a wider trading range between $2.13 and $1.55. “This week is already full of tension in world events and in the charts. Eyes on this next test.

At the same time, new altcoins are capturing serious investor attention. One project gaining momentum across investor watchlists is MAGACOIN FINANCE—positioning itself as a high-upside contender in the evolving altcoin landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Growth and Surging Demand MAGACOIN FINANCE is building rapid momentum, with analysts highlighting it as a top early-stage pick thanks to its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-selling presale. The project has already raised over $10 million, backed by a full HashEx audit and a capped supply model designed for sustained value growth. Investor confidence is rising, supported by a transparent governance structure and community-first focus. As presale phases continue to fill, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a compelling opportunity in the altcoin space—well-positioned for further upside as it nears public listing. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Institutional Inflows Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum in June 2025, trading near $2,800–$2,900. Institutional buying, DeFi growth, and recent upgrades—including ETF developments—are fueling optimism for new highs. On-chain data reveals accumulation and tightening supply, with analysts predicting that ETH could reclaim the $2,800–$3,000 range this month and potentially retest all-time highs later in the year. As Ethereum’s network fundamentals strengthen, its momentum is helping to lift interest in new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Legal Catalysts and Breakout Potential XRP is trading near $0.54, buoyed by positive momentum from the upcoming Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation. Analysts forecast potential breakouts above $0.65, with high trading volumes and institutional interest supporting the price. June 2025 could see XRP reach as high as $2.09, depending on legal outcomes and market sentiment. As traders seek the next major mover, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly mentioned as a high-conviction alternative for those looking to diversify beyond large caps. Aptos (APT): Short-Term Weakness, Long-Term Watch Aptos is currently experiencing bearish sentiment, with a recent price drop and forecasts suggesting a short-term decline to $3.28 by late June. Despite this, APT maintains key support levels and could stabilize as the market digests recent volatility. While sentiment remains cautious, some investors are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE, attracted by its early-stage upside and scarcity-driven model. Conclusion With Ethereum and XRP both showing strong momentum and Aptos stabilizing, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top early-stage contender in 2025. Its unique fundamentals, rapid presale sellouts, and growing institutional interest suggest the project could continue its rise—potentially outperforming many established names as the cycle unfolds.

According to a detailed thread posted on X by on-chain analytics account Lookonchain on June 23, the punter’s aggressive leveraged bets unraveled spectacularly as the Israel-Iran conflict rocked global markets and sent crypto prices on a wild ride. Anatomy of a $35M Meltdown Lookonchain’s forensic analysis traced the rapid downfall of a wallet linked to AguilaTrades, who publicly celebrated a number 1 ranking on Bybit in late 2024, and claimed to have turned U.S. election predictions into a $50 million windfall. The sequence in question started on June 8, when the trader moved $39.18 million in USDC from Bybit to perpetual futures exchange Hyperliquid. His strategy was straightforward, aggressively leveraging long positions on BTC. He initiated his first major long on June 9, making paper gains of around $5.6 million. However, he refused to take profits, a decision that proved disastrous when Bitcoin plunged sharply after Israel made a preemptive attack on several strategic Iranian nuclear installations and military personnel. As a result, he was forced to close this position at a $12.47 million loss. The investor didn’t give up, though, doubling down with new long positions on June 15 and June 20, both of which saw significant gains. The former bet put him $10 million in the black, while the latter resulted in a more modest but no less grin-inducing $3.2 million in unrealized profit. Once again, AguilaTrades didn’t collect on his windfall, choosing instead to push his luck some more. Fate wouldn’t be tempted, nonetheless, and over the weekend, things went from bad to worse, with the U.S. executing direct military strikes on Iran, and the Persian Gulf state reportedly voting to close the Straits of Hormuz, a key oil transit chokepoint. The action saw BTC crash below $100,000 for the first time since the last week of May, liquidating both of AguilaTrades’ positions and causing him losses of $2.95 million and $17 million, respectively. Data from CoinGlass confirmed that he was not alone in his misery, with over $700 million in leveraged positions liquidated on Saturday alone. According to Lookonchain, the trader made one final dice throw, choosing to go short this time. But, in a cruel twist, Bitcoin bounced back , leaving the luckless investor with an additional $2.33 million loss. “Don’t Be Greedy” The analytics platform bluntly summarized the grim lesson: “Don’t be greedy—take profits. Don’t FOMO into positions during a rally. Avoid using high leverage.” BTC was trading around $101,429 at this writing, down about 1% in the last 24 hours and 5.2% over seven days. It has shown relative resilience compared to the broader crypto market, which lost 7.1% of its value in the past week, a fact that will be of little solace to those caught over-leveraged.

Key Takeaways: Senator Schiff’s COIN Act would bar the president and family members from issuing or endorsing crypto. The bill requires disclosure of any digital asset sale over $1,000. It also suggests penalties including fines and prison time for violations. The bill, titled the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act , comes amid rising concern over the intertwining of politics and digital assets, particularly in the context of former President Donald Trump’s expanding crypto footprint. The COIN Act proposes a strict ban on issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing any form of cryptocurrency, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. New Bill Requires Disclosure of Digital Asset Sales Over $1,000 The new bill also mandates disclosure of any sale of digital assets worth over $1,000. Violators, including a sitting president, would face a civil penalty equal to the amount of profit made and up to five years in prison. Schiff directly linked the proposal to Trump’s crypto dealings. “President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency dealings have raised significant ethical, legal and constitutional concerns over his use of the office of the presidency to enrich himself and his family,” he said in a statement. However, the timing of Schiff’s move has raised eyebrows. Just last week, he voted in favor of the GENIUS Act , a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. And here it is: An Obama holdover?

Democrats initially balked at the GOP’s refusal to include language addressing presidential crypto conflicts in the GENIUS Act. But facing pressure to push the legislation through, they ultimately relented. Schiff, along with 17 other Democrats, voted in favor. Nine Senate Democrats joined Schiff in co-sponsoring the COIN Act. Seven of them also voted in favor of the GENIUS Act. Other Democratic-led proposals targeting Trump’s crypto ventures include the MEME Act and the Stop TRUMP in Crypto Act, though none are expected to pass in a Republican-controlled Congress. Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes.

Unlike Arizona and New Hampshire, which approved similar legislation, Texas allowed the reserve and provided funding for it. The state has allocated $10 million to invest in the Bitcoin reserve. With this approach, Texas has made a significant step toward the future of finance. Trump’s pro-crypto stance attracts more US states to adopt Bitcoin reserves The Bill 21 requires the state to set up a Bitcoin reserve that operates separately from the main treasury. This aligns with a few other states also looking into digital asset reserves. The announcement that Texas has allocated $10 million for a Bitcoin reserve comes months after the Trump administration said it would establish a national crypto reserve. However, such a vehicle is supposed to be funded strictly by budget-neutral means, such as crypto asset seizures or issuing crypto bonds. Abbott also signed bill HB 4488, a companion measure that shields the Bitcoin reserve from standard “fund sweeps” into the state’s general revenue. The legislation changes how states handle digital assets, not just as speculative devices, but as sovereign financial instruments that one might want to hold onto for the long term. Texas sets up Bitcoin reserve to fight inflation and flex financial muscle Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), which finally allowed the establishment of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. According to the bill’s text, the new reserve will help make the state more financially resilient while acting as a potential hedge against inflation. In addition, only cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $500 billion can be included, a threshold only Bitcoin currently has. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage the fund and be guided by an advisory committee with three crypto investment experts. Aside from direct purchases, the reserve could be filled through forks, airdrops, investment profits, or public crypto donations. A public report listing the fund’s holdings and performance will be issued every two years. With this, Texas becomes the third state in the US to pass Bitcoin reserve legislation. Public firms demonstrate a growing trend of purchasing more BTC for their treasuries Several publicly traded companies follow Michael Saylor’s strategy by adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. For instance, on Friday, June 20, US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency adviser, David Bailey‘s Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings, raised $51.5 million in new funds through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal to purchase more BTC. Moreover, last week, The Blockchain Group, a technology company listed in Paris, increased its Bitcoin reserves by buying 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. This purchase raised its total holdings to 1,653 BTC. Just over the past month, companies have added Bitcoin to their treasuries, a trend that has been documented with the help of data from BitcoinTreasuries. Furthermore, NET shows public companies still have an appetite for BTC. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Could this trigger a selloff from these chain validators? Bitcoin Miners Are Extremely Underpaid According To This Model As pointed out by analyst IT Tech in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post , the Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability has recently seen a sharp negative spike for Bitcoin. The “Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability” refers to an on-chain indicator that compares miner revenue with mining difficulty . When the value of the metric is highly positive, it means the miners are earning a high income relative to the difficulty level imposed by the blockchain for mining new blocks. Such a trend can imply that these chain validators may be becoming overpaid. On the other hand, the indicator being deep in the negative region can suggest miners may be underpaid as they are pulling in a low revenue despite high difficulty. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability has witnessed a plunge deep into the red zone, a sign that miner revenue has dropped relative to the difficulty. The indicator is now flashing an ‘extremely underpaid’ signal for the miners. Historically, whenever the miners are under financial pressure, they participate in some selling to keep the electricity bills paid. Given the current state of this cohort, it’s possible that BTC could soon face elevated selling pressure from them. So far, miner selling has actually trended down, as the trend in another indicator suggests. The chart shows the log-scaled data of the Bitcoin Miner Selling Power, an indicator that measures the ratio between BTC miner outflows (that is, the amount going out of their wallets) against their total holdings. It would appear that the metric has recently been sharply moving down, a potential indication that miners have been participating in reduced selling relative to their reserves. Considering the pressure that these chain validators are under, however, it only remains to be seen how long this balance lasts. In some other news, the total amount of computing power employed by the miners, the “ Hashrate ,” has crashed, as the 7-day average data of the metric shows. Earlier in the month, the Bitcoin Hashrate rose to a new all-time high (ATH) earlier in the month, but has plummeted since then, meaning that the miners haven’t been able to sustain their upgrades, providing another confirmation of the pressure the miners are under. BTC Price Bitcoin crashed close to the $98,000 mark yesterday, but its price has since jumped back up to $101,100.",Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Miner Revenue|Bitcoin Miner Selling|Bitcoin Miners|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-24 03:00:31

Amid this backdrop, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a breakout contender, drawing comparisons to the early trajectories of these market leaders and positioning itself as a high-upside opportunity in the evolving altcoin landscape. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity-Driven Growth and Surging Demand MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly building momentum, with analysts highlighting it as a top early-stage pick thanks to its scarcity-driven tokenomics and fast-selling presale. The project has already raised over $10 million, supported by a full HashEx audit and a capped supply model designed for sustained value growth. Investor confidence is rising, underpinned by a transparent governance structure and a strong community-first focus. As presale phases continue to fill, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a compelling opportunity—well-positioned for further upside as it nears public listing. Analysts note the project’s structured rollout and scarcity mechanics, which historically have produced outsized returns for early entrants. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Momentum and Market Anchor Bitcoin remains the market’s anchor, trading above $112,000 and supported by robust institutional inflows and ETF demand. Analysts see potential for BTC to reach $130,000–$200,000 if the current uptrend persists. While Bitcoin’s upside is steady, its early-stage success story is inspiring investors to seek similar growth in new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum and Network Strength Ethereum is showing strong bullish momentum, trading above $2,500 and benefiting from institutional buying, DeFi growth, and recent upgrades. On-chain data reveals accumulation and tightening supply, with analysts predicting that ETH could reclaim the $2,800–$3,000 range this month and potentially retest all-time highs later in the year. As Ethereum’s fundamentals strengthen, its momentum is helping to lift interest in new altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Polkadot (DOT): Interoperability and Growth Potential Polkadot is trading near $4.74, with forecasts pointing to a possible rise to $5.03 by the end of May 8 . While DOT’s gains are modest compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, it remains a key player in the interoperability sector. Analysts highlight Polkadot’s long-term potential, but many investors are now seeking higher-multiple opportunities in early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the market and Polkadot maintaining its role as a key interoperability platform, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top early-stage contender in 2025. Its unique fundamentals, rapid presale sellouts, and growing institutional interest suggest the project could follow a similar path to success—potentially outperforming many established names as the cycle unfolds.

That brings the year-to-date haul to $15 billion. Even holiday trading lulls and global jitters haven’t stalled the momentum. Investors seem to be treating this pullback as a chance to buy, not a reason to sell. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Bitcoin And Ethereum Lead The Pack According to CoinShares data, Bitcoin pulled in $1.114 billion this week alone. It has now logged $2.37 billion month-to-date and $12.7 billion YTD, across nearly $152 billion in assets under management. Ethereum chipped in with its ninth straight week of gains, adding $124 million in weekly inflows. That pushed its month-to-date total past $1 billion and its YTD figure to $2.43 billion, across $14.29 billion of assets. Investors aren’t scooping up bearish bets, either: short Bitcoin products saw just $1.4 million in outflows this week and $8.7 million since January. Altcoins See Mixed Results Solana attracted $2.80 million this week and nearly $3 million month-to-date, lifting its YTD flows to almost $86 million. XRP pulled in $2.70 million weekly and $10.55 million month-to-date, taking its year-long total to $268 million across $1.205 billion in managed assets. But funds that package multiple tokens bled $5.76 million this week and almost $17 million for the month—though they’re still up $58 million in 2025. Other altcoin vehicles are in rough shape, with $509 million of outflows since January. Regional Trends Highlight The US The United States led global flows with $1.25 billion in weekly inflows. That’s $3.37 billion month-to-date and $14.30 billion YTD, out of $135 billion under management. Canada added nearly $21 million this week and $42.8 million for June. Germany chipped in almost $11 million while Australia booked $16.6 million. Brazil bucked the trend with $9 million of outflows this week and $26.4 million in June, but it’s still about $34.8 million ahead for the year. Smaller Tokens Struggle For Attention Some newer names drew mixed reactions. Sui saw $8.5 million drain this week despite $3.3 million of gains so far in June. Litecoin eked out $0.21 million in weekly inflows and clos to $6 million YTD. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Free—Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says Cardano and Chainlink grabbed $0.34 million and $0.6 million this week, respectively.

Total weekly flows hit $1.23 billion, taking June’s total to $3.38 billion and the year’s to $15 billion, across $176 billion in overall assets. Based on these trends, big spenders aren’t ready to abandon digital tokens. They’re treating pullbacks like offers they can’t pass up.

There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it settles above the $2,460 resistance zone in the near term. Ethereum Price Regains Traction Ethereum price started a fresh increase from the $2,120 support level, like Bitcoin . ETH price was able to clear the $2,200 and $2,250 resistance levels to move into a positive zone. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $2,240 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The bulls even pushed the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,114 low. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,440 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,460 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,568 swing high to the $2,114 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,500 level. A clear move above the $2,500 resistance might send the price toward the $2,550 resistance. An upside break above the $2,550 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,620 resistance zone or even $2,650 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,460 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,340 level. The first major support sits near the $2,320 zone. A clear move below the $2,320 support might push the price toward the $2,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,150 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) remain dominant forces, but many traders are now eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for its rare early-stage upside. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is also on the radar, though its recent volatility has prompted a shift in capital toward projects with stronger momentum and structure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Powerhouse MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the most talked-about pre-sale of 2025 , with over $10 million raised and every phase selling out at record speed. Analysts highlight its scarcity-driven tokenomics, full audit, and disciplined rollout as key reasons for its surge in demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE has built a reputation for credibility and long-term potential, with experts’ analysis citing: Capped token supply and full HashEx audit , ensuring long-term integrity and no stealth inflation Strong retail and institutional interest , with momentum growing across altcoin trading communities Bitcoin (BTC): The Market’s Anchor Bitcoin continues to set the tone for crypto markets, trading above $105,000 and attracting significant institutional inflows. While BTC remains a benchmark for bullish sentiment, its massive market cap now implies more stability and less explosive upside compared to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Many seasoned BTC holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking the kind of sharp returns that defined Bitcoin’s early years. Solana (SOL): Bullish Momentum, But Investors Seek More Solana is drawing strong forecasts, with some projecting 2025 highs between $220 and $1,000. Its ecosystem growth and potential ETF inclusion are fueling optimism. However, as SOL matures, many traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for its greater upside potential and scarcity-driven model. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Volatility Spurs Diversification NEAR Protocol is experiencing heightened volatility, recently dropping to $1.89 despite increased trading volume. While some analysts expect a potential recovery, the broader sentiment is cautious. With support levels weakening and resistance holding firm, investors are seeking more stable growth paths—leading many to diversify into early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion In a market where timing and structure are everything, even a small investment in MAGACOIN FINANCE could reshape portfolios for those who act early. As Bitcoin and Solana traders seek sharper returns and NEAR faces headwinds, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout candidate of 2025.

A new airdrop event by Midnight , a privacy-focused blockchain connected to Cardano, is now live, offering free NIGHT tokens to eligible ADA holders. And no, it’s not just a few tokens — the numbers are quite impressive . So, here’s how to claim your FREE Night token. What Is Midnight and Why Does It Matter? Midnight is a fully integrated partner chain of Cardano that utilizes Cardano’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism for its security and governance. What sets it apart is its strong multichain strategy, targeting not only Cardano users but also holders on Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and more. However, the ongoing buzz is mostly around the “Glacier Drop”, the first phase of Midnight’s token distribution plan. According to the project’s whitepaper , 12 billion NIGHT tokens—half of the entire supply—will be given away to eligible users. And the largest beneficiary of this ecosystem will be the Cardano wallet holders. More Than Just an Airdrop—It’s Cardano’s Growth Catalyst What’s exciting is that Midnight isn’t some side project—it’s deeply tied into Cardano’s architecture. The NIGHT token is minted directly on Cardano. Stake pool operators (SPOs) can even earn NIGHT without giving up ADA rewards. With strong tokenomics, real utility, and multichain support, Midnight might be the boost Cardano needs to reclaim its spotlight in the crypto space. How to Claim Your NIGHT Tokens To be eligible for the Midnight airdrop, you must have held at least $100 worth of ADA in a Cardano wallet at the time of a previously taken snapshot. Midnight is bringing private smart contracts, cross-chain privacy, and dual-token mechanics ($NIGHT + $DUST ). It’s free to claim if you qualify — don’t miss it. For more alpha follow @onewisemelon — melon (@onewisemelon) June 23, 2025 The claiming process is simple and gas-free, just sign with your wallet and provide a clean Cardano address. There’s no KYC or cost involved. How Much NIGHT Could You Receive? However, each person’s airdrop amount depends on how much ADA they held compared to others. For example, if you held 5,000 ADA, and the total eligible pool was 1.5 billion ADA, you’d receive around 40,000 NIGHT tokens. How Much 1 NIGHT Token Worth? Now here’s where it gets interesting. If NIGHT reaches a $500 million market cap, each token could be worth around $0.0208, which means your free 40,000 NIGHT tokens could be worth over $800. There is a 60-day window to claim your tokens, and they won’t be usable right away. Meanwhile, claimed tokens will first be locked and will “thaw” gradually during the Redemption period, allowing holders to access them over time.",News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 03:32:37

Over the past few months, Ripple has made several strategic moves, fueling talks of an eventual public listing , even though the company has officially said it’s not on the table for 2025. While Ripple’s executives, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse and President Monica Long, have made it clear that no IPO is planned this year, signs of IPO preparation are visible. The company recently launched a $700 million share buyback and has been hiring for corporate development and investor relations roles. Its $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road and a $250 million deal for custody provider Metaco also hint at long-term growth plans. Adding to this, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton reacted to a video clip of Garlinghouse commenting on Circle’s market performance after its IPO. Deaton said that while Ripple isn’t in a rush to go public and doesn’t need to raise capital, timing an IPO is crucial. I know @bgarlinghouse said @Ripple is NOT in a rush to go public. They certainly don’t need to raise capital, which is often, a primary reason to go public. But TIMING an IPO is also a big consideration. If @circle can hit a 62B-75B market cap then @Ripple , with nearly 40B XRP,… https://t.co/MSFNMy6i8E — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 23, 2025 He added that if Circle could reach a $62 billion to $75 billion market cap, Ripple, with nearly 40 billion XRP currently valued at around $2 (or roughly $80 billion) — could aim for a $100 billion market cap in the current market environment. XRP’s price has been trading within a tight range since its drop from $3.40 in January, hovering around $2. It briefly spiked to $3 in March after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed including XRP in a national crypto reserve. Since then, the token has remained trapped within a rigid range. Meanwhile, institutional interest around XRP appears to be growing. Publicly listed firm VivoPower recently partnered with the Flare blockchain to earn yields on its XRP holdings and invested $121 million in XRP for its treasury. While Ripple’s IPO plans remain speculative for now, the company’s expanding footprint and market activity continue to keep investors watching closely.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 03:41:00

The digital asset reached lows of approximately $98,974 following reports of US military strikes on Iran. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has regained some ground and is trading at $102,1010, representing a 2.4% increase over the past 24 hours and a 5.82% decrease over the last week. Amid this price performance, recent on-chain analysis points to a phase of consolidation rather than a structural breakdown. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared in a QuickTake post that long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be maintaining their positions rather than exiting, indicating continued conviction despite short-term volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Signal Consolidation, Not Capitulation According to Darkfost, the current market behavior is reflective of a quiet consolidation period, with long-term holders showing little inclination to sell. Based on the 30-day moving average of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD), his analysis shows that the metric has stayed below the 0.8 threshold typically associated with major corrections. The value recently peaked at 0.6 before trending downward, suggesting limited market overheating at present levels. Darkfost emphasized that this moderation could precede a continuation of the broader bull cycle, mirroring past market structures where consolidation phases led to further price advances. He noted that past bull runs have often been characterized by a “staircase” trajectory, periods of sideways or modest downward movement followed by renewed upward momentum. In this context, subdued sentiment may indicate that the market is preparing for a potential next leg higher. The analyst wrote: Importantly, this does not signal the end of the bull cycle. Instead, similar to the past two phases, we may once again see a staircase-like movement where consolidation is followed by another leg up. Historically, Bitcoin’s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move. Whale Behavior Remains Steady Amid Market Tensions Complementing this outlook, another CryptoQuant contributor, Mignolet, provided insight into whale activity during the current consolidation phase. He noted that while the market setup resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021, key on-chain signals from whales have not aligned with those seen during that previous peak. Specifically, Ethereum transaction outflows, often used as a proxy for large investor exits, have not shown the kind of spikes observed during the 2021 market top. Related Reading: Bears Will Be Washed Out Of Bitcoin If This Happens Mignolet pointed out that although Ethereum has seen a gradual decline in market share relative to other layer-1 and layer-2 chains since 2020, its transactional data still maintains a strong correlation with Bitcoin price movements. The absence of aggressive exit activity among large holders suggests that major market participants are not rushing for the exits, despite heightened geopolitical uncertainty and short-term price volatility.

Instead of betting on pure hype, the focus is now on coins backed by adoption, delivery, and clear roadmaps. That’s where the current spotlight is turning, toward a new mix of value and upside. Among the top picks gaining traction right now are BlockDAG , Avalanche, Cardano, and Cosmos. Each brings something unique to the table, but only one stands out with fresh infrastructure rollouts and a strong entry price window. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in now, this shortlist gives you the most relevant updates and pricing insights to help you decide before the next breakout. BlockDAG: $0.0020 Price Ends June 24 BlockDAG is quickly becoming a prominent player in the cryptocurrency market, attracting considerable attention even before its official exchange debut. This growing interest is evident in its impressive presale success and its dedication to swift infrastructure development. The presale has garnered significant investor confidence, with over 23.2 billion BDAG coins sold, raising an impressive $318.5 million. Currently in Batch 29, the price is set at $0.0020 until June 24th, after which it will rise to $0.0030. This strategic price increase encourages early adoption, promising substantial returns. If BlockDAG hits its target listing price of $0.05, early investors could see a remarkable 25x return, leading many analysts to recommend it as a top pre-launch investment. BlockDAG’s commitment to rapid infrastructure development further solidifies its credibility. The X1 mobile miner already boasts over 2 million active users, showcasing early community engagement. Additionally, the X30 and X100 mining rigs are slated for shipment on July 7th, emphasizing a push towards decentralized mining. Strategic exchange listings with major platforms like MEXC, BitMart, and LBANK are also secured, ensuring broad accessibility and liquidity. The project has undergone rigorous audits by CertiK and Halborn, reinforcing its security. With a clear plan for post-launch liquidity and price stability, BlockDAG is actively rolling out features and building a robust ecosystem. The upcoming price increase offers a prime investment opportunity in a cryptocurrency with significant growth potential. Avalanche: Short-Term Weakness but Long-Term Potential Avalanche (AVAX) has been trying to hold support levels this week, currently trading near $16.83 after seeing highs of $17.13 and lows around $15.72. Short-term sentiment is slightly bearish as some analysts warn of a possible breakdown below $15.50, which could lead to a move toward $10.50. However, the on-chain metrics tell a different story. Avalanche continues to see solid activity, especially in DeFi and meme coin launches on its C-chain earlier this year. The divergence between strong network usage and recent price dips suggests that AVAX may be undervalued at current levels. If the ecosystem continues to expand, this could become a recovery play. For those looking at ecosystem strength over temporary volatility, Avalanche still offers real potential. While it may not be the best crypto to invest in now for short-term returns, it’s definitely one to keep on the radar if the market sentiment shifts. Cardano: Oversold Setup Could Fuel a Bounce Cardano (ADA) is hovering around $0.54, having pulled back from earlier resistance levels around $0.60. Over the past few days, ADA has faced downward pressure, dropping roughly 6.5% due to global market jitters and heavy volume trading. Still, its charts are now flashing oversold indicators, which some analysts say could set up a bounce if ADA holds above the $0.513 support range. On the ecosystem side, Cardano continues to be active with over 2,000 projects in development, 110+ million transactions, and 355 developer commits this week alone. It also leads the market in exchange outflows, over $932 million ADA has been pulled off exchanges so far this year, signaling long-term holder confidence. While ADA might not be leading the pack in short-term gains, its strong fundamentals make it a reasonable pick for anyone balancing long-term positioning with current opportunities. It still earns a spot on any serious list of the best crypto to invest in now. Cosmos: Range-Bound but Still Building Cosmos (ATOM) has been trading in a narrow range, currently sitting at about $3.78, with support at $3.60 and resistance around $3.87 to $4.00. Over the past few sessions, the coin has been consolidating, and although it hasn’t made a clear breakout, traders are watching for any signals that might push it beyond this resistance band. Indicators like RSI and MACD are mostly neutral, and volume has been steady. Despite the price stall, Cosmos isn’t sitting idle. Its interchain upgrades like IBC Eureka and Tokenomics 2.0 continue to drive interest from both developers and institutional players. Recent ecosystem momentum includes ongoing CBDC trials and new integrations with chains like Ethereum through IBC. Cosmos may not be the flashiest pick today, but it still brings real utility and infrastructure backing it. If the charts hold and the next upgrade cycle hits on time, it could surprise to the upside, making it one of the best crypto to invest in now from a mid-term growth angle. Summing Up All four coins in this list offer different types of value right now. Avalanche is rebuilding momentum after a recent dip. Cardano has strong development and network metrics pointing to long-term resilience. Cosmos is quietly building under the surface with key infrastructure updates. But BlockDAG stands out for one simple reason, it’s not even live yet and already has infrastructure, traction, and funding most live coins are still chasing. With a presale price of $0.0020 ending on June 24 and a target listing of $0.05, the upside is clear. Combined with its mobile miner adoption and exchange listing roadmap, BlockDAG offers the most immediate and scalable upside. That’s why if you’re picking the best crypto to invest in now, this list helps, but the smart money will move before the next presale price hike hits.

Some believe this might happen before ETF approvals and the FedNow launch on July 14. Ripple Paying SEC Fine in Cash, Not XRP However, former SEC official Marc Fagel has put those rumors to rest saying they are not paying in XRP. Instead, the money is already set aside in cash inside an escrow account. They’re not paying in XRP. It’s sitting in an escrow account in cash. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) June 22, 2025 An XRP supporter also said the token is safe for now and explained that while tokens can be moved, it’s an all-or-nothing system.. XRP Price Reacts to Uncertainty Recently, crypto analyst John Squire had suggested that the U.S. government might seize Ripple’s escrowed XRP and hold it as a national reserve. However, Bill Morgan shut down the idea by simply stating “it wont”. No it won’t. https://t.co/48zQvTBUg9 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2025 Amid these rumours, XRP price had dropped over 2%. However, crypto prices spiked today after President Trump announced a ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel. Bitcoin rose nearly 3% as it climbed above $106,000. XRP also posted gains around 6% in the last 24 hours. No Long Delay in Sight There were speculations that the Ripple vs. SEC case could drag into late 2026. But Bill Morgan clarified that such a delay is unlikely, unless Judge Torres rejects the current joint proposal. The most probable outcome, he says, is both parties accepting the summary judgment, along with a penalty and permanent injunction. The court is now waiting on a key SEC filing due by mid-August. The XRP community remains on edge, unsure of what Judge Torres might decide next. Experts say that “it could go either way” but nobody has backed the idea of a delay into 2026.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-24 04:01:17

The move further cements Amazon’s long-term commitment to the UK as a key market and powerhouse of talent and innovation. The far-reaching investment will impact several industries, including logistics, digital technology, creative industries, and cloud computing. It is expected to add £38 billion to the UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2027. A significant portion of the £40 billion spending spree will expand Amazon’s operational network throughout the UK. That includes four new, high-tech fulfillment centers. Two of these sites, Hull and Northampton, are already known. Two additional fulfillment centers will open in the East Midlands. While it is unknown where these will be, the expansion suggests that the tech giant is keen to spread its sites further across the country rather than just concentrating on London, where much of its previous infrastructure spending has occurred. Along with these new sites, Amazon will open dozens of new delivery stations to assist with its last-mile delivery service . They’ll help slash delivery time, cut congestion, and enable businesses to be more productive all across the UK. The online retail powerhouse also intends to renovate and grow over 100 active buildings, including warehouses and sortation centers. Investments such as new robotic systems, sustainability improvements, and worker-friendly features will increase safety and productivity. Amazon will also create two new office buildings at its UK headquarters in East London to back up its corporate employees. They are intended to house locally based teams in software development, customer experience, and artificial intelligence. Amazon to create thousands of jobs across UK Amazon’s £40 billion commitment would significantly impact employment in the UK, especially in areas that have received less investment from the private sector in the past. The firm expects thousands of permanent, full-time jobs to be established throughout the country over the next three years. Amazon has over 75,000 employees in the UK and is one of Britain’s largest private-sector employers. That number will increase substantially with the expansion, and the new and existing plants will generate more than 60 different kinds of jobs. Positions will range from warehouse associates and robotics technicians to mechatronic engineers, IT workers, and health and safety officers. The firm is also pioneering apprenticeships and training schemes, which have been secured since the lockdown, to maintain a talent pipeline for future positions. Amazon pays a competitive wage starting at £28,000 a year outside London and £30,000 in London. The company also provides various employee benefits, such as health care, parental leave, and education assistance. Amazon supercharges UK’s digital and creative sectors with cloud, AI, and studio expansion A large part of Amazon’s investment will be towards enhancing the UK’s digital economy. That funding extends to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing unit. Amazon said in September 2024 it planned to spend £8bn by 2028 creating, operating, and servicing data centers throughout the UK. These data centers will help power cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning services. They will be vital to UK companies of all sizes and will help drive national aspirations to lead the world in AI infrastructure. Amazon is expanding its footprint with Prime Video and studio operations in the creative field. It will redevelop the historic Bray Film Studios in Berkshire as part of the new investment. The site will become a major production hub for UK-originated film and TV content, providing new opportunities for the creative economy and creating hundreds of jobs for the area for production crews, writers, and actors. The company also invests in upskilling UK creatives through multimillion-pound training initiatives and a new education partnership focused on media and digital production.
