On June 23, 2025, the EU Commissioner for Industrial Strategy, Stephane Sejourne, while talking to the German newspaper Handelsblatt, said that countries within the EU need to establish joint strategic reserves of rare earths to counter supply chain disruptions and potential “economic blackmail” from China. The EU can defend itself from economic blackmail from China It is common knowledge that all European countries have oil and gas reserves, but Sejourne wants to take things further by advocating for the creation of a strategic reserve for raw materials. In June, the European Union announced 13 new raw material projects outside the bloc that would increase its supplies of metals and minerals essential to its competitiveness in the energy transition, as well as defense and aerospace. This followed China’s decision in April to impose export curbs on rare earth magnets until new licences are obtained, which left diplomats, carmakers and other companies from Europe and other countries rushing to meet with Beijing officials and avert factory shutdowns. That move from China opened the EU’s eyes to how dependent it has become on the Asian giant for rare earths, and Sejourne wants that to end. She has committed to launching further tenders this year to promote alternative raw material sources. Sejourne has also warned Beijing, reminding them that the EU also has the tools to defend itself in a potential trade war. “Europe must finally use the same weapons as its competitors,” he said. China responded in June, saying it attached great importance to the EU’s concerns and would consider speeding up the approval process to get rare earth exports to the EU. EU leaders hope to address rare earth access at a July summit with China The issue of the EU’s dependence on China for rare earths is a priority for the EU, and leaders are reportedly planning to address rare earth access at the upcoming July 2025 summit with China. While China has offered a “green channel” to expedite licenses for EU firms, this is seen as a partial fix, as approvals are still subject to Beijing’s discretion. The summit aims to negotiate stable supply terms, but EU officials are wary of China’s leverage, and rightfully so, given it has a history of using rare earths exports as a diplomatic tool. Earlier this month when China’s Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, met with EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic, he talked about reciprocation, mentioning how he hoped the bloc would also “adopt effective measures to facilitate, safeguard, and promote compliant trade of high-tech products with China.” They also spoke of Chinese electric vehicle imports into European countries, which the EU has hit with levies over allegedly unfair subsidies from Beijing. “The negotiation on the price commitment of electric vehicles between China and Europe has entered the final stage, but both sides still need to make efforts,” the commerce ministry said.

The emerging token is now being compared by some analysts to the early stages of Solana and Ethereum’s historic rallies — and with Litecoin showing fresh signs of life, the market narrative is shifting toward unexpected leaders in the altcoin space. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 2025 Standout MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the most talked-about early-stage crypto asset of 2025. Its presale has seen overwhelming demand, with phases selling out almost instantly and over $10 million raised from global buyers. This surge is not just hype-driven—analysts highlight its scarcity-focused tokenomics, fully audited smart contract, and disciplined rollout as key structural strengths. The project’s limited supply and asymmetric reward mechanics are drawing comparisons to early-stage runs of meme giants, but with a more refined and strategic approach. Analyst Projections: 30x–100x Potential Crypto analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver returns between 25x and 100x, with some estimates suggesting an 18,500% ROI for early buyers. This optimism is fueled by: Scarcity mechanics that reduce dilution risk and prime the asset for exponential growth. Massive presale demand and accumulation by both retail and institutional players, indicating strong conviction and long-term holding behavior. Cultural relevance and a politically charged brand that drives organic growth and community engagement Solana: Institutional Catalysts and ETF Hopes Solana (SOL) recently experienced a strong bounce from key support, with a 5.2% price increase to $139.30 on June 23, 2025, and trading volumes exceeding $2.1 billion in 24 hours.The excitement around a potential Solana ETF approval is a major catalyst, with institutional interest surging and the network’s Alpenglow upgrade promising sub-second transaction finality. SOL’s price action is closely tied to broader risk-on sentiment in tech stocks, further amplifying its upside in bullish market conditions. Ethereum: Technical Breakout Imminent Ethereum is trading above $2,500, having rebounded 79% from its April low. Analysts are eyeing a “golden cross” on technical charts—a historic bullish reversal signal. Whale accumulation is at record highs, and inflows into spot ETH ETFs underscore growing institutional confidence. Forecasts suggest a decisive breakout above $4,000 could propel ETH to $6,000–$8,000 in 2025, marking a new all-time high. Litecoin: The “Silver” Factor While not as explosive as Solana or Ethereum, Litecoin remains a staple for risk-averse investors seeking reliable upside during bull cycles. Its established reputation as “digital silver” and consistent network activity make it a favored hedge, especially when meme and altcoin rallies accelerate. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Replicate These Rallies MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current setup mirrors the early momentum seen in Solana and Ethereum before their historic rallies: Early-stage accumulation and scarcity-driven tokenomics echo Solana’s pre-ETF surge and Ethereum’s pre-breakout consolidation. Strong community and cultural branding provide viral potential, reminiscent of meme coin booms but with greater structural integrity. Analysts’ conviction in 30x–100x returns is based on the same market imbalances that fueled Solana and Ethereum’s exponential growth in previous cycles. Conclusion With surging presale demand, disciplined rollout, and a scarcity-focused model, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as the breakout altcoin of 2025 . Its trajectory could mirror the explosive rallies of Solana and Ethereum, while its fundamentals offer a more calculated approach than typical meme coins—making it a strategic pick for those seeking outsized returns before mainstream exchange listings.

Here’s Why Smart Investors Believe Ruvi AI (RUVI) Is the Best Bet For Such Returns,https://timestabloid.com/missed-shiba-inus-shib-100x-rally-heres-why-smart-investors/,"Shiba Inu made headlines for its phenomenal 100x rally, creating countless overnight millionaires. But for many who missed that boat, repeating such returns may feel like a distant dream. Enter Ruvi AI (RUVI), a rising star in cryptocurrency. With a structured growth plan, innovative applications, and a presale raising over $1.9 million , smart investors are now turning to Ruvi AI as the best bet for achieving life-changing gains. Why Ruvi AI Is Smarter Than Shiba Inu While Shiba Inu thrived on speculation and community hype, its lack of clear utility left many wondering about its long-term relevance. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, blends blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to address practical challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. This focus on real-world problem-solving ensures RUVI tokens have sustained value beyond just market trends or social media buzz. Ruvi AI’s structured growth model is another key advantage. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale , RUVI tokens are priced at a highly accessible $0.015 per token. At the end of the presale, the price will lock at $0.07 , delivering an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts also predict Ruvi AI could hit $1 after listing , offering an extraordinary 66x ROI for early investors. This transparency and clear growth trajectory make Ruvi AI particularly attractive to investors seeking predictable yet massive returns. Strong Presale Performance Signals Potential Ruvi AI’s presale numbers paint a promising picture for its future. Key milestones include: Raising over $1.9 million, showcasing strong community and investor interest. Selling more than 160 million tokens, highlighting substantial demand. Growing a community of over 1,600 holders, reflecting its widespread appeal. Unlike Shiba Inu’s unpredictable rises and falls, Ruvi AI offers a guaranteed price of $0.07 post-presale. This ensures financial stability and an immediate boost in value for investors who join during this early stage. Maximize Your ROI With VIP Investment Tiers For those looking to seriously grow their investments, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers , designed to reward early backers with generous bonus tokens. Here’s how the tiers are structured: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers not only offer immediate value but also create opportunities for mind-blowing returns as Ruvi AI approaches its $1 price projection. Built-In Security and Transparency Another factor making Ruvi AI stand out is its commitment to security and transparency. Unlike many speculative tokens, Ruvi AI has undergone a third-party audit by CyberScope, a leading blockchain security firm. This successful audit ensures the platform is secure, further building trust among investors. Additionally, Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange guarantees post-presale liquidity. This means RUVI tokens will be tradeable as soon as the presale ends, providing flexibility and reliability for investors eager to capitalize on market growth. Real-World Applications Ensure Demand While meme coins like Shiba Inu rely on community hype, Ruvi AI builds demand through practical utility. Here’s how it stands out across industries: Marketing: Businesses optimize ad strategies, refine audience targeting, and increase ROI with Ruvi AI’s AI-driven tools. Entertainment: Content creators benefit from personalized AI tools and blockchain-secured payment systems, making it easier to grow audiences and monetize content. Finance: Institutions use Ruvi AI for fraud detection, scalability, and improved operational transparency, leading to streamlined processes and better outcomes. This diversity in applications ensures that RUVI tokens maintain demand over time, creating a robust foundation for consistent growth. Why Ruvi AI Is the Best Bet for 100x Returns For crypto enthusiasts who missed Shiba Inu’s once-in-a-lifetime rally, Ruvi AI represents a second chance, but with far more predictability and functionality. The presale pricing at just $0.015 per token , coupled with a locked $0.07 post-sale valuation , gives early investors a clear roadmap to high returns. Having raised over $1.9 million , sold more than 160 million tokens , and secured partnerships with trusted names like CyberScope and WEEX Exchange, Ruvi AI has laid the groundwork for unparalleled success.

46645353,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72345,1750719793,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Flare CEO: A New Product That Will Put 10’s of Billions of XRP to Work Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/flare-ceo-a-new-product-that-will-put-10s-of-billions-of-xrp-to-work-is-coming/,"Flare Network CEO Hugo Philion has teased a groundbreaking innovation that could transform the XRP ecosystem: Firelight. In a recent post on X, Philion revealed that he spent time in the U.S. with the Firelight team, praising the product as “hugely innovative” and capable of putting “billions, if not tens of billions, of XRP to work” on the Flare Network. Introducing Firelight: Unlocking XRP’s True Potential Firelight is a liquid staking protocol designed to bring dormant XRP to life through decentralized finance (DeFi). At its core, Firelight allows users to mint FXRP, a fully collateralized representation of XRP on the Flare Network . Once FXRP is deposited into Firelight’s Launch Vault, users receive an equal amount of stXRP—an ERC-20 token that can be traded, lent, or used across DeFi platforms while still earning staking rewards. According to Philion, this approach will revolutionize XRP staking, offering both flexibility and powerful yield-generating opportunities. Early adopters of Firelight will also earn Firelight Points, an incentive designed to reward participants for engaging with the protocol from the outset. I spent much of the last week in the US with the Firelight team. This product is hugely innovative and has the potential to put BILLIONS if not 10’s of BILLIONS of XRP to work -> on Flare. — Hugo Philion (@HugoPhilion) June 22, 2025 Institutional Adoption: Billions Already Committed Philion’s bold claims aren’t without backing. Nasdaq-listed VivoPower has already committed $100 million worth of XRP to the Flare ecosystem, specifically through Firelight, in a move aimed at generating stable yield and growing its treasury. Uphold, one of the largest holders of XRP with roughly 1.8 billion tokens in custody, has also confirmed plans to integrate FXRP, signaling major institutional confidence in the system. Meanwhile, testing on Flare’s canary network, Songbird, has shown strong early results. In just a few days, over $2 million in FXRP was minted, driving a 220% surge in total value locked (TVL) and significantly boosting stablecoin activity. A Secure, Scalable Framework for DeFi Security and trust are central to Firelight’s design. All collateral agents are KYC-verified, and FXRP is backed by a diversified pool of over-collateralized assets, including FLR and stablecoins. This ensures users can rely on Firelight for both performance and protection, key for attracting institutional and retail investors alike. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 More importantly, Firelight solves one of the XRPL’s current limitations: the absence of native staking. By offering yield on XRP without compromisinadvised to conduct thoroughg liquidity, Flare positions itself as a leading hub for XRP-based DeFi—or what some now call “XRPFi.” A New Era for XRP Utility With XRP’s market cap sitting above $130 billion, even a small portion of assets deployed via Firelight could translate into tens of billions of dollars in active capital. Philion’s vision reflects this potential: a decentralized ecosystem where XRP holders can earn yield, participate in DeFi, and retain liquidity, all without leaving the safety of the Flare ecosystem. Firelight is currently live on Songbird, with a full launch on Flare’s mainnet expected soon. Once deployed, it could mark a major milestone—not just for Flare, but for XRP as a whole. As Philion put it, this is not just another product. It’s the beginning of a new financial paradigm for XRP holders worldwide.

It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE (in approximately 6 hours from now, when Israel and Iran have wound down and completed their in progress, final missions!), for 12 hours, at which point the War will be considered, ENDED!” Trump posted. He detailed that Iran would begin the first 12-hour truce, followed by Israel starting theirs in the second half, closing what he called the “12 Day War.” Trump also declared, “During each CEASEFIRE, the other side will remain PEACEFUL and RESPECTFUL.” He praised both countries for what he called their “Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence” to end a war he said could have “destroyed the entire Middle East.” Trump ended the post with a long line of blessings—naming Israel, Iran, the Middle East, the U.S., and “THE WORLD.” Iran rejects Trump’s ceasefire claims, accuses U.S. of deception as Netanyahu confirms the deal But Tehran denied all of it. Aziz Nasirzadeh, a senior official in Iran’s National Security Council, told CNN that Iran had not received any such ceasefire proposal. “At this very moment, the enemy is committing aggression against Iran,” he said, adding, “Iran is on the verge of intensifying its retaliatory strikes, with no ear to listen to the lies of its enemies.” Shamkhani said Iran would fight until it achieved “lasting peace,” calling Trump’s remarks a U.S. and Israeli attempt to justify further attacks on Iranian targets. Despite the denial, another Iranian official, Abbas Araghchi , speaking to Reuters, confirmed that Iran had agreed to a Qatar-mediated, U.S.-proposed truce with Israel. He did not mention Trump or the exact terms, but said Iran was “prepared to observe a temporary ceasefire under the current framework.” No full details were released. Still, this was the first public sign from Tehran that a diplomatic path might be on the table behind closed doors. Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has also confirmed the ceasefire, saying US and Qatar were key in making it happen. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei posted this on his X: “Those who know the Iranian people and their history know that the Iranian nation isn’t a nation that surrenders.” Markets surge, oil tanks, Bitcoin bounces back as traders price in peace U.S. markets reacted immediately to Trump’s post. Dow Jones futures went up by 134 points (0.3%), S&P 500 futures rose by 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures jumped 0.6%. The Dow added almost 375 points, S&P 500 closed 0.96% higher, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up by 0.94%. Investors, for now, are betting that some kind of ceasefire, whatever the official messaging, will take hold. Oil prices collapsed as traders pulled out of risk positions. West Texas Intermediate crude dropped more than 7% by Monday evening, falling to $64, which is now 3% below pre-war levels. That sharp fall suggests traders are fully pricing in the end of the war, even if there’s no formal joint statement. Crypto didn’t sit still either. Bitcoin, which had dipped to $98,000 during the U.S. strikes, bounced hard to $106,700 before settling at $105,600 by the time U.S. markets closed. Over $50 million in short positions were liquidated in just one hour, catching bears off guard and flipping sentiment.

Won-based stablecoins could potentially revolutionize the South Korean finance sector. They would allow people to make payments using privately issued tokens without involving fiat. The Bank of Korea has expressed skepticism. It has urged caution and is warning of a deleterious effect on the commercial banking sector . New Daily Kyungjae reported that credit card providers could also be adversely impacted by stablecoin rollouts. The media outlet noted that experts are concerned that the card industry “may face a structural crisis in the long term as its payment base gradually weakens.” Stablecoin rollouts could, the outlet warned, “may make it difficult for the industry to guarantee even short-term profitability.” However, an employee at an unnamed card provider offered a ray of hope, explaining: “It is difficult to predict the impact stablecoins will have on profitability. However, it will be difficult for them to replace our ability to offer spending on credit. That is the unique domain of card issuing companies.” But credit appears to be something of a double-edged sword for card companies. The outlet reported that domestic card issuers have been trying to “defend their profitability by expanding their high-interest loan offerings.” This, the outlet wrote, is causing a rise in loan defaults as “borrowers’ ability to repay is decreasing.” The Bank of Korea, South Korea’s central bank, is still lukewarm on proposals to launch a won stablecoin despite a recent meeting with the USD Coin (USDC) issuer Circle. #SouthKorea #Stablecoins #USDC https://t.co/qPwbqgvtFg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The average monthly default levels of South Korean card companies in the first quarter of the financial year hit 1.93%. This is remarkably close to the 2% rate that the industry considers “dangerously high.” Worse still, three of the country’s biggest card firms (KB Kookmin, Hana, and BC Card) have already exceeded the 2% mark this year. Stablecoin Pivot: Which Companies Will Prosper? While banks and car providers are clearly fearful of what stablecoin-powered business could do to their industry, tech firms appear keen to embrace the change. Pinpoint News reported that while years of regulatory uncertainty have limited business expansion, IT heavy-hitters are “moving quickly as governments around the world begin to show signs of establishing clear guidelines.” The outlet made note of the likes of the search engine operator Naver and the chat app developer Kakao, both of which have been working on blockchain-related innovations for years. Naver share prices over the past month. (Source: Google Finance) Other firms said to be looking with interest at developments in the stablecoin space are the Hyundai subsidiaries Hyundai HT (smart homes) and Hyundai Mobis (auto parts). Another smart home firm, Kocom, was also named, along with the software developer MediaZen, the connectivity provider Kaon Media, and the IT services firm Bridgetec. The media outlet said that expectations are “growing” for a Naver stablecoin release and a link to web3 services that make use of this coin. #Hanwha Ocean ramps up push into U.S. Navy ship repair, eyes tech transfer via #Philly Shipyard.

It has built up a vast ecosystem of web, IT, and payment services. An unnamed industry expert said: “Positive changes in stablecoin policy will help accelerate Naver’s blockchain-related business.” In Naver’s case, stablecoin-related business expansion has the potential to cross borders. The firm has a close historical link with Line, a chat app popular in Japan and other Asian markets. A potential Naver-Line stablecoin cooperation or interoperability solution could provide a further boost, the outlet concluded. South Korea’s stablecoin frenzy has led to a flurry of speculative activity on the nation’s stock and crypto markets . Traders have been attempting to pre-empt lawmakers’ decision by snapping up stocks in firms that have previously expressed a willingness to do stablecoin-related business.

46646715,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=169031,1750721402,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/46646715.jpeg,"Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Be the Next Community Favorite for Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink Traders?",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoin-finance-be-the-next-community-favorite-for-bitcoin-xrp-and-chainlink-traders/,"MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto projects , drawing attention from traders of established giants like Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink. As the market pivots toward early-stage, community-driven tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s blend of meme appeal, fixed-supply tokenomics, and robust community engagement is fueling speculation that it could become the next breakout favorite among both retail and institutional investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Viral Momentum and Strong Fundamentals Unlike many meme tokens that rely solely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built on a foundation of transparent governance and a capped supply of 170 billion tokens, eliminating inflation risk and creating scarcity-driven value. The project is 100% community-owned, with its smart contracts fully audited by HashEx, boosting investor confidence and distinguishing it from typical meme coins. Early presale momentum has been explosive, with analysts predicting potential returns of 25x–35x once major exchange listings go live. The project’s strategic branding and disciplined rollout have attracted both seasoned traders and newcomers, echoing the viral trajectories once seen with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Bitcoin: The Benchmark for Crypto Traders Bitcoin remains the market’s bellwether, with 2025 price forecasts ranging from $100,000 to $175,000, driven by institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and political tailwinds. While Bitcoin offers stability and long-term growth, its massive market cap limits the kind of explosive upside that smaller, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE can deliver. Many Bitcoin holders are now seeking higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in emerging projects, fueling capital rotation into promising altcoins. XRP: Utility and the Prospect of a Major Breakout XRP is gaining renewed attention as analysts predict a bullish breakout, with price targets ranging from $5.50 to as high as $27 by the end of 2025, contingent on regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. The token’s real-world utility in cross-border payments and its growing ecosystem make it a favorite for traders seeking assets with both narrative and use case. However, like Bitcoin, XRP’s upside may be more gradual compared to the meteoric potential of new community-driven tokens. Chainlink: Infrastructure Powerhouse with Steady Growth Chainlink (LINK) continues to dominate the decentralized oracle sector, trading around $13–$16 in mid-2025, with analysts targeting $20–$30 as the next major resistance zone. Chainlink’s integration across DeFi and real-world applications ensures its relevance, but its growth is likely to be steadier and less volatile than the explosive rallies seen in smaller-cap tokens. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Appeals to BTC, XRP, and LINK Traders Asymmetric Upside: With a low price and a capped supply, early MAGACOIN FINANCE backers are positioning for outsized returns not typically available in large-cap coins. Community-Driven Model: Like Dogecoin and early Chainlink, MAGACOIN FINANCE is powered by grassroots enthusiasm, which can drive viral adoption and price surges. Security and Transparency: The HashEx audit and transparent governance address common concerns among serious traders, making it more than just a meme play. Strategic Timing: As capital rotates from blue chips to high-upside altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned to capture significant inflows from traders seeking the next big thing Conclusion For Bitcoin, XRP, and Chainlink traders seeking the next community-driven favorite with explosive upside potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a top contender for 2025. Its blend of meme culture, fixed-supply economics, and genuine community engagement is attracting serious attention—and if current momentum holds, it could soon join the ranks of the market’s most beloved tokens.

46647054,https://timestabloid.com/?p=72365,1750721939,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s Why XRP Price Starts Rising Suddenly,https://timestabloid.com/heres-why-xrp-price-starts-rising-suddenly/,"A surprising policy shift by the Federal Reserve Board has triggered fresh optimism across the crypto markets, with XRP leading the charge. On June 23, the Fed announced it will no longer consider “reputational risk” as a component of its examination programs when supervising banks. The move, seen by many as a step toward regulatory clarity, immediately fueled speculation that barriers facing crypto-friendly banks may be easing. XRP, in particular, responded with a sharp 6% increase, currently trading at $2.14, and catching the attention of market participants. Excitement for the Pro-crypto Shift The update was shared widely on X, with crypto commentator Amonyx (@amonbuy) calling it a moment that eases crypto banking restrictions. He shared a screenshot of the Fed’s release, which outlined the Board’s intention to eliminate reputational risk assessments from supervisory materials and replace them with more targeted evaluations of financial risk. JUST IN: THE FED JUST REMOVED ""REPUTATIONAL RISK"", EASING CRYPTO BANKING RESTRICTIONS. BULLISH #XRP pic.twitter.com/nGtqoWm3Ke — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 23, 2025 That detail is critical, as it removes a long-standing regulatory ambiguity that had often been used to restrict banking relationships with digital asset companies. This move follows the Comptroller of the Currency’s decision to remove crypto restrictions on regulated banks , allowing them to buy and trade digital assets. Why This Matters for XRP The connection to XRP is not arbitrary. XRP’s use case in banking and cross-border settlements has often required partnerships with financial institutions . Over the years, many U.S. banks avoided direct crypto exposure, citing reputational risk. The Fed has now shifted its stance. It recently recognized the advantages of XRP’s consensus mechanism . With this restriction now officially removed from its supervisory framework, there is a clearer path forward for regulated banks to engage with blockchain infrastructure providers, including those that use or support XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Opens New Doors More significantly, the Fed emphasized that while reputational risk will be excluded from its examination criteria, this change does not alter the requirement for banks to maintain strong risk management or comply with existing laws. In practical terms, this means that as long as banks uphold financial and operational standards, their choice to serve crypto firms can no longer be challenged on vague reputational grounds. For XRP, which relies heavily on adoption through real-world utility and integration, this policy change signals a more open environment. It reaffirms the growing perception that U.S. regulators are rethinking their approach to crypto-related banking access, removing barriers hidden in regulatory language and adopting a significantly different approach from the former administration’s war on cryptocurrencies.

This follows recent breaches at CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinTelegraph (CT) that exposed users to wallet-draining phishing schemes. The CMC and CT Attacks “Hackers are targeting information websites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect,” CZ said in a post on X. He pointed out that CMC was attacked just two days before CT was hit with a similar breach. The trouble began on June 21 when CMC users started seeing a pop-up that said “Verify Wallet” and asked them to connect their crypto wallets. Members of the crypto community on X quickly flagged the notification as a phishing attempt designed to deceive victims into revealing private keys or sensitive information. Shortly after the reports spread on social media, the platform acknowledged the malicious notification on its account. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” CoinMarketCap said in a Friday update . The team added that security investigations were underway and warned people not to connect their wallets. CZ later shared that early checks showed 39 individuals were affected by the incident, with total losses of around $18,570. CMC also revealed plans to reimburse those affected by the hack. On June 23, Cointelegraph’s website was also compromised in a front-end exploit. This time, users saw a pop-up promoting a fake token airdrop. The notification claimed people were eligible to get 50,000 “CTG” tokens, worth around $5,500 if they connected their wallets. The pop-up also falsely claimed that CertiK, a well-known security firm, had reviewed the smart contract. The media outlet confirmed the issue on Sunday night and said it was working to fix it. “Do not click on these pop-ups, connect your wallets, or enter any personal information,” it warned on X. Blockchain Security firm Scam Sniffer also found that the fake JavaScript code came from the company’s advertising system. Hackers Are Shifting Tactics In both cases, the bad actors were able to approve transactions and steal crypto once users connected their wallets. These incidents show a new trend where attackers are now using trusted news and data platforms to reach people instead of going after crypto exchanges directly. Meanwhile, a recent study by TRM Labs showed that phishing schemes and malware-based infrastructure attacks made up 70% of the $2.2 billion stolen in crypto-related hacks in 2024. Another report by Cybernews revealed a massive data breach that exposed over 16 billion login credentials, making it one of the largest stolen data collections ever found. Researchers believe this came from infostealer malware, credential stuffing, and past leaks that were repackaged.

The move appears to have reversed recent war-driven market anxiety, fueling renewed bullish sentiment across crypto markets. At 10:02 p.m. UTC on June 23, Trump posted on Truth Social that a full ceasefire agreement had been reached by both Israel and Iran. According to his statement, each country would pause hostilities in coordinated stages: Iran would initiate a 12-hour ceasefire, followed by Israel, leading to a 24-hour complete cessation of the conflict. Trump described this as a successful conclusion to what he labeled a 12-day war — one he claimed could have escalated into a much longer and more devastating regional conflict. He praised both sides for choosing restraint and credited the agreement with averting further turmoil in the Middle East. The announcement injected a wave of optimism into the crypto market, especially for high-beta assets like ether. Prior to the rally, ETH had already been showing signs of strength, supported by steady whale accumulation. On-chain data shows over $265 million in ETH was acquired by large holders during the recent downturn, including a single wallet that purchased 47,070 ETH —r oughly $113 million — over a three-day period. Ethereum’s network fundamentals remain robust, with an average of 1 million new ETH wallet addresses created weekly since mid-May, representing a 50% year-over-year increase. With volatility receding and risk appetite returning, traders are now watching whether ETH can break through the next psychological threshold of $2,500. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH rallied 7.7% from $2,230 to $2,401 over the 24-hour analysis window. High-volume support formed between $2,220 and $2,230, with initial buying at $2,191.36. Price broke out above $2,400 during the 22:02–22:11 window as volume spiked to 28,149 ETH. Resistance at $2,275 flipped into support as buying momentum accelerated. ETH touched an intrahour high of $2,434.95 before entering a consolidation phase. Price action formed a potential bull flag as ETH traded between $2,390 and $2,402. Volume surged to 2.5x the 24-hour average in the final three hours of the session. Higher lows confirmed bullish structure throughout the uptrend.

Despite recent market turbulence, Ethereum whales and long-term traders are doubling down — but not just on ETH. Many are allocating into next-wave opportunities with stronger risk-to-reward ratios. MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered that conversation with increasing frequency, especially as its early fundamentals now resemble the kind of token setups ETH traders historically favored in pre-breakout phases. Aptos Traders Are Eyeing Strategic Diversification Aptos has drawn strong developer interest and ecosystem engagement in 2025, maintaining a lead in blockchain activity. However, Aptos traders — particularly those focused on community-driven assets — are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. The project offers both meme energy and structured tokenomics, striking a balance that APT holders find appealing as they search for tokens with early-stage momentum and long-term potential. With its token supply locked and staking now live, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides a framework that encourages accumulation, not speculation. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Dominating Analyst Forecasts Analysts tracking altcoin rotations in mid-2025 have started highlighting MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare convergence of investor energy, ecosystem clarity, and strategic fundamentals. What began as a meme-centric project has evolved rapidly into a credible altcoin with legitimate infrastructure and community traction. The coin’s performance — both in terms of participation and market sentiment — suggests it may be entering a breakout cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining favor because of several key structural traits: Supply Certainty: With a locked supply of 170 billion tokens, there’s no inflation risk and no behind-the-scenes minting. Traders can assess value without fearing dilution. Audit by HashEx: Institutional-grade transparency has helped attract more serious capital and enhanced credibility. No Insider Control: The project is entirely community-owned with no VC interference, a trait especially important to Ethereum and Aptos veterans who’ve witnessed misaligned token launches in the past. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is the way it has combined meme-driven appeal with structural strength — a hybrid model that’s increasingly rare in the altcoin landscape. Final Thoughts: Is This the Ethereum of the Meme Era? While Ethereum and Aptos will likely continue dominating their sectors, the smartest investors are looking for what’s next. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a compelling answer — a project that mirrors early Ethereum in its community formation and upside potential but fits the current market’s appetite for engagement, utility, and reward mechanics. As more institutional and retail investors take notice, this token is quickly becoming more than a curiosity — it’s shaping up to be the 2025 cycle’s most watched altcoin.

New projects are bringing better tech, more adoption, and fresh attention from investors. Coins like Web3 ai (WAI), Sui (SUI), Cronos (CRO), and Litecoin (LTC) are gaining popularity through useful features, active communities, and strong development. Each coin shines in its own way, from blockchain-based AI to upgrades in DeFi. These coins are being seen as some of the best cryptos for 2025 for this cycle. In this article, we’ll cover why Web3 ai, SUI, CRO, and LTC are worth watching. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, understanding these coins will help you spot great buying opportunities. Let’s dive in! 1. Web3 ai (WAI): Driving AI and Blockchain Forward Web3 ai is fast becoming one of the best cryptos for 2025 today. Its unique blend of AI and blockchain makes it stand out. Many crypto projects focus on hype, but Web3 ai is building real tools for everyday users. These tools will help people make smart choices in the DeFi space and beyond, once it launches. Its AI-powered features offer real-time insights and smarter ways to use blockchain. Unlike other projects made for developers, Web3 ai ($WAI) is made for all users. One key reason why Web3 ai is leading among the best cryptos for 2025 is its deep blockchain integration. By linking AI with blockchain tech, it enables automated actions, smart predictions, and better decision-making for everyone. Its strong presale results show its value. Currently in stage 9, each $WAI token is priced at $0.000443. Over $8.4 million has already been raised, with 23.3 billion tokens sold. There are 50 stages in total. The last stage price will be $0.003276, with a listing price of $0.005242, giving a potential ROI of 1747% to early holders. Web3 ai’s clear roadmap and growing community prove it’s more than just another token. It’s shaping the future of AI and blockchain together, one of the best cryptos for 2025 to keep an eye on. 2. Sui (SUI): Attracting More Institutional Buyers Sui (SUI) is showing resilience, even after a 16% dip caused by the Cetus Protocol issue. The coin’s core strengths remain strong. Its Total Value Locked (TVL) has climbed back to $2.47 billion. Institutional interest is also rising. A new spot ETF filing by 21Shares highlights growing confidence in SUI. Technically, SUI is trading above its 50- and 100-day EMAs. If it breaks past $4.26, it could soon retest its earlier high of $5.37. If market sentiment turns positive, Sui could outperform many bigger tokens. It holds its spot as one of the best cryptos for 2025 with strong potential. 3. Cronos (CRO): On the Path to Recovery Cronos (CRO) has bounced back from a steep 68% drop earlier this year. It found solid support around $0.07 to $0.08 and has now moved above $0.105. With an RSI of 53, CRO has room to climb higher without being overbought. If it crosses $0.1238, it could target $0.14. Growing interest on-chain and renewed community support make CRO worth watching. Among the best cryptos for 2025, it’s showing good momentum again and could challenge larger tokens if positive trends continue. 4. Litecoin (LTC): Smart Contracts Through BitcoinOS Upgrade Litecoin, known as “digital silver,” is seeing renewed interest. Its chart is forming a bull flag, hinting at a move toward $130. Whales are actively moving billions of LTC between wallets. Plus, over 75% of LTC holders have held onto their coins for at least 18 months, showing a strong belief in its long-term value. The recent BitcoinOS upgrade brings smart contracts and zero-knowledge rollups to Litecoin. This greatly boosts its DeFi abilities. With a fixed supply and fast transactions, LTC stands firm among the best cryptos for 2025 today. It can compete with legacy coins like Cardano and Tron. Final Thoughts As the market gears up for its next phase, coins like SUI, CRO, and LTC are gaining technical strength and community interest. Each brings something unique, from new DeFi features to growing institutional support. But Web3 ai stands apart for its practical AI tools, easy-to-use design, and strong presale momentum. It’s one of the best cryptos for 2025 to watch closely now. While all four coins offer exciting opportunities, Web3 ai’s clear use case and fast growth could make it the standout choice as the market heats up.

This paradox leaves traders and investors weighing which force will ultimately dominate the market’s next move. As pressure mounts from both sides, understanding the technical nuances behind this tug-of-war becomes crucial to anticipating BNB’s trajectory in the near term. BNB Faces Pressure From Key Technical Levels Analyzing the BNBUSD setup on the M30 timeframe, Thomas Anderson in an X post highlighted that the price is currently testing the yellow support line at $626.95, following a decisive drop below the cyan price line at $633.99. This breakdown has shifted short-term sentiment, suggesting that sellers are beginning to exert stronger control over the price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Breakout Could Trigger ATH Rally Repeat – Is $730 The Next Stop? According to Anderson, the 200 MA (red line), positioned between $642 and $645, is now acting as a dynamic resistance zone overhead. With price trading below this moving average, any attempts at recovery may face immediate rejection. He also pointed out that the H1 chart confirms the ongoing bearish momentum, with the price continuing to trade below both the cyan level and the 200 MA. This alignment between the M30 and H1 timeframes strengthens the case for further downside movement, especially if the current support at $626.95 fails to hold. Until buyers manage to reclaim key resistance levels, the overall outlook remains weak, and traders should keep an eye on how the price behaves around the current support to gauge the next likely move. BNB’s Price Outlook Strengthened By Bullish Continuation Signal Despite the bearish outlook presented by Thomas Anderson, eL Zippo expressed a more optimistic stance in his latest X tweet regarding BNB. He believes that BNB still has the potential to rise in value, challenging the prevailing negative sentiment around its recent price action. Related Reading: BNB Price Eyes Comeback: Can It Regain Momentum and Rally Higher? EL Zippo’s view is supported by the formation of a bullish flag pattern on the chart. This pattern is widely recognized as a continuation signal, indicating that the asset may resume its prior upward trend after a period of consolidation. For eL Zippo, the presence of this structure suggests that BNB could be setting up for another leg higher if market conditions align. At the time of writing, BNB was trading around the $623 mark, reflecting steady price action. The asset’s market capitalization stood at approximately $87.7 billion, signaling strong investor interest. Additionally, BNB recorded a 24-hour trading volume of roughly $1.8 billion, with price and volume showing percentage gains of 2.11% and 13.22%, respectively—an indication of renewed activity and positive sentiment in the market.

In a post on the social media platform X, Swissblock highlights a sudden plunge in on-chain liquidity, something the firm says needs to reverse if BTC should rally. “At the same time as the rest of the market has consolidated back into BTC, we have seen a drop off in our on-chain liquidity. For bullish continuation, we need to see an uptick again in on-chain liquidity.” Source: Swissblock/X On-chain liquidity refers to how easily and efficiently Bitcoin can be bought or sold without significantly impacting BTC’s price. Low liquidity environments suggest that there are not enough buyers to absorb sell orders, triggering price declines. Swissblock says that the fast drop in liquidity by itself is “a concern” and that BTC is showing a reduction in overall activity in the Bitcoin network. However, the analytics firm says that BTC’s long-term bullish market structure still looks solid. “Lower liquidity as price is more correlated with on-chain dynamics vs external factors. Lower activity making price more susceptible to downside volatility.. All is not lost. Even though we have had a liquidity flush, the bullish long-term structure is still intact as long as our Risk off signal is at 0… While liquidity conditions have deteriorated, the broader bullish structure remains intact – provided risk signals continue to hold.” At time of writing, BTC is trading at $101,833.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity is causing some traders to hesitate and SUI bullish structure shows signs of a potential breakout, Unstaked is making its move, and it’s happening quickly. With a presale that’s already raised over $10.4 million and climbing, Unstaked is generating serious buzz and jumping into the conversation as the top crypto to buy right now. Unlike SHIB and SUI, Unstaked isn’t just riding waves, it’s building momentum with a clear structure, growing demand, and game-changing utility. This isn’t just another presale. It’s a front-row chance at the next big launch, and people are lining up. SHIB Whale Sell-Offs Raise Red Flags, But Could Offer a Reset There’s been a big shift in Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity, and it’s got the market watching closely. Major holders have started moving large amounts of SHIB to exchanges, often a signal that sell-offs are underway. For short-term traders, that’s a concern, especially as SHIB slips below critical moving averages. The $0.000025 zone is now acting as a key support, but if SHIB can’t hold, we could see more downside. Still, some see opportunity here. When whales exit, they often reset the chart, and for buyers with patience, that might be a golden entry point. Whether this is just a shakeout or a deeper dip is still unclear, but the impact of large wallets can’t be ignored. One thing’s certain: Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale activity is driving the short-term mood, and the next few days could set the tone for what’s ahead. SUI Bullish Structure Could Be Days Away from Breaking Out Now here’s where it gets interesting, SUI bullish structure is tightening, and that’s usually a pre-breakout signal. With a steady climb of higher lows and volume starting to build, SUI is gearing up for something bigger. Traders are eyeing key resistance levels, and if those flip, SUI could take off fast. Momentum is coiling like a spring. Technical indicators show positive signs, and the trendline is holding strong. Add in growing interest from technical traders, and SUI is now firmly on breakout watch. If it moves past resistance with volume, this could quickly become one of the most explosive charts on the table. All eyes are now on SUI, and if you’re not watching it, you might miss the move. Unstaked’s $100M Goal Might Look Bold, But the Presale’s Already Taking Off While others are still fighting resistance, Unstaked is flying past milestones. With a presale goal of $100 million and over $10.4 million already secured, this project is moving fast. Right now, it’s in stage 21, priced at just $0.011739, and that won’t last long. What sets it apart? It’s not just the numbers. Sixty percent of the total 6 billion $UNSD tokens are open to the public, with no secret deals or private sales. That means regular buyers get real access and real upside. On top of that, $20 million in launch liquidity is already locked in, which could smooth out the price action once trading begins. And then there’s the utility. At launch, Unstaked will introduce AI agents designed to grow and manage online communities. These tools will automate engagement, drive traffic, and reward performance through a unique Proof of Intelligence system, all powered by $UNSD. With a listing price of $0.1819, the current rate offers a steep discount. That’s why so many are calling this the top crypto to buy right now, because it’s still early, but not for long. Wrapping Up When price action cools down, serious buyers look at the roadmap. SHIB is uncertain, and SUI’s breakout hasn’t confirmed. Meanwhile, Unstaked is marching forward. With transparent tokenomics, a fully public presale, and AI utility going live at launch, it’s got structure, and that’s something most tokens can’t say before listing. $10.4 million raised already. A public presale with no hidden whales. A $0.011739 entry before a $0.1819 listing. If you’re still on the sidelines, you’re risking missing out. Unstaked isn’t just about hype, it’s delivering all the elements that matter, and it’s doing it now. If you’re looking for the top crypto to buy right now , this might be your moment to act before the market catches on.

The announcement comes as NATO leaders gather in The Hague to adopt the 5% goal —an increase from the alliance’s current 2% target—amid rising global security concerns. “This is an opportunity to deepen our commitment to NATO and drive greater investment in the nation’s wider security and resilience,” Starmer said in a statement ahead of the summit. The pledge, seen as a nod to US President Donald Trump’s longstanding calls for European nations to shoulder more defense responsibilities, marks a significant step up from the UK’s current plans to reach 2.6% by 2027, including intelligence spending. However, the government has not detailed how it plans to meet the 5% goal, especially given that the lion’s share of the increase will occur after the next two general elections. Broader definition of security to include cyber defense, infrastructure, and borders As part of the new framework, the UK will broaden its definition of security spending beyond traditional defense to include border protection, critical infrastructure, and supply chain resilience. Starmer’s office said that factoring in these additional categories, the UK will hit 4.1% of GDP on security by 2027. Despite the expanded scope, the government has no current plans to increase core military spending beyond 2027. Still, the commitment envisions dedicating 3.5% to defense by 2035, leaving the remaining 1.5% for broader security efforts. Starmer had previously presented his increase in defense spending to 2.5% of GDP as “the biggest sustained rise since the end of the Cold War.” He first hinted at further increases in an interview earlier this month. NATO allies respond as the UK extends deadline and emphasizes strategic independence Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has intensified calls across Europe to bolster defense budgets, especially with growing uncertainty around the US security posture under a potential second Trump administration. To that end, Starmer ultimately won a commitment from the NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, to extend the deadline from 2032 to 2035. Most NATO allies will accept the new target. Still, Spain won an exemption through lobbying, demanding the rate be set at 2.1%, arguing that capability, not money, matters. Germany, meanwhile, said it intended to increase its defense expenditure to 3.5% in the next five years . The UK is also expected to unveil its National Security Strategy this week, alongside a long-awaited review of its ties with China and a new industrial plan. According to Starmer’s office, the strategy will emphasize competitiveness in areas such as science, education, trade, and advanced technology. It includes £86 billion ($116 billion) earmarked for R&D investment to support technology growth and strengthen protection against cyber threats and sabotage. Starmer’s office said they would become more unapologetic and systematic in pursuing their national interests, signaling a shift toward greater strategic independence and resilience.

With blue-chip assets stabilizing, the spotlight is shifting to early-stage projects that offer scarcity-driven growth and asymmetric upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Scarcity, Structure, and Early-Stage Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly gained traction as one of 2025’s most promising altcoins , joining the ranks of top bullish picks for the year. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its hard-cap mechanics, community-led rollout, and audited smart contract, ensuring no VC dilution or inflation risk. Its rapid series of sold-out pre-sale stages reflects real strategic demand. Its scarcity model and limited access favor early believers, creating the same kind of supply shock potential that fueled Ethereum’s early rise. On-chain activity shows that accumulation isn’t random: large, informed capital is locking in positions now, echoing historical patterns from past altcoin cycles. Bitcoin: Solid Foundation, Slower Expansion Bitcoin remains the foundation of the crypto market, currently trading at impressive levels with continued institutional interest. While BTC offers long-term security, many traders recognize that its upside is increasingly capped by market maturity. As a result, investors are branching out into smaller-cap projects with higher potential, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , in search of greater ROI while maintaining a core BTC position. Ethereum: Innovation Leader, but Competitive Ethereum continues to dominate as the leading smart contract platform, driven by its ongoing upgrades and expanding network utility. However, its price movements are now closely tied to regulatory headlines and broader macro trends. Traders seeking outsized returns are increasingly diversifying into earlier-stage plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which offers exposure to rapid growth without Ethereum’s scale limitations. Kaspa: Steady Growth, But MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers More Upside Kaspa is also gaining traction for its technical fundamentals and blockDAG technology, appealing to long-term builders and early adopters.

The deal, negotiated through Gulf intermediaries and direct talks with Israeli and Iranian officials, marks a dramatic de-escalation after nearly two weeks of military strikes. The crypto market responded immediately. With tensions cooling and traditional safe havens like gold plateauing, Bitcoin regained its risk-on momentum. Traders are betting that a period of regional stability could restore confidence in speculative assets. Trump credited early Iranian warning of a retaliatory missile strike for avoiding casualties at U.S. bases in Qatar, which helped pave the way for the truce. As regional hostilities paused, investors rotated out of defensive positions and re-entered crypto markets. Breaking News Trump has posted that he has brokered and ""complete and total ceasefire"" between Iran and Israel. #Iran #IranIsraelConflict #Trump #ceasefire pic.twitter.com/zQPraXx7Qa — The Blue Collar Intellectual (Julian) (@JulianAcciard1) June 23, 2025 Why Peace Lifts BTC and Crypto Geopolitical clarity tends to revive appetite for higher-risk assets. Ceasefire agreements, especially those with direct U.S. involvement, often act as catalysts for equity and crypto rebounds. Reduced global uncertainty restores market confidence. Traders unwind hedges like gold and bonds. Volatility decreases, encouraging capital inflows to crypto. Bitcoin, known for its sharp sensitivity to macro headlines, acts as a barometer for global sentiment. With risk appetite returning, its rebound above $105K could signal broader recovery across altcoins and digital assets. Technical Outlook: Bitcoin Eyes Breakout The Bitcoin price prediction turned bullish following the cryptocurrency’s recent surge, pushing it through the 50-period EMA at $103,806 and forming a strong bullish engulfing pattern. Momentum indicators like MACD have turned decisively bullish, with a wide histogram and crossover signal suggesting more upside. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview However, BTC now faces critical trendline resistance near $106,000. This level marks the descending barrier from June highs and remains a key decision zone for bulls. Key Levels: Resistance: $106,000, $107,580, $109,041 Support: $103,965, $102,199, $100,487 Trade Idea: A confirmed breakout above $106K on strong volume may open a run toward $109K. A failed retest or bearish engulfing at $106K could send BTC back to $102K. With over $64.9B in daily trading volume and a $2.09 trillion market cap, Bitcoin remains technically balanced but fundamentally charged. The Israel-Iran ceasefire may be the pivot traders needed to chase higher highs, as long as peace holds. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.3M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1.5 million milestone in its public presale, raising $1,527,516.42 out of a $1,763,403 target. With just hours left before the next price tier, buyers can still secure HYPER at $0.012 per token. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper delivers fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC network. It combines Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with ultra-low gas fees and seamless BTC bridging. Audited by Consult, Bitcoin Hyper is built for trust, scale, and performance. Over 91 million $HYPER are already staked, with projected post-launch staking rewards of up to 577% APY. The token fuels gas fees, dApp access, and decentralized governance. The presale accepts both crypto and cards, and through Web3Payments, no wallet is required. Meme culture meets utility—Bitcoin Hyper is quickly emerging as Layer 2’s potential breakout star of 2025.

The Galaxy Unpacked summer event in Brooklyn, New York, starting at 10 a.m. local time, aims to debut the company’s latest breakthroughs in foldable smartphones and artificial intelligence technology. The new Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 will focus attention. These devices will bring a better design, features, and overall user experience to help the company remain dominant in the foldable phone market. The external display on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is also said to be larger and more functional when the phone is closed. This could make it more friendly to those who prioritize a handset that doesn’t require them to pick up the phone without being as aggressive in the design stakes as Motorola’s Razr Ultra. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is believed to follow the firm’s lead and further refine its vision for a smartphone-tablet crossover. The Fold 7 is likely to address some of the problems with foldables, including thinness, the size of the bezels, and durability. Samsung is confident its relentless technology evolution and leadership will grow foldable devices into a more mainstream product. The company faces fierce competition, especially from Chinese brands like Huawei, Honor, and Oppo, which have aggressively expanded their foldable offerings. Samsung drives AI transformation in mobile devices Aside from the hardware, Samsung is also working hard on AI. Among the arsenal we expect the company to unveil is its Galaxy AI suite , an array of AI-powered tools designed to change how consumers interact with their devices. From clever photo editing and real-time translation to productivity gains and better search, Galaxy AI is set to play a significant role in next month’s event. According to Bloomberg, Samsung is reportedly nearing a deal to put Perplexity’s AI assistant on future Galaxy devices as a pre-installed replacement or supplement to Google Assistant on certain devices in certain markets. The move could represent a significant change in Samsung’s AI strategy, offering it an even larger degree of control over the user experience while reducing the reliance on Google’s ecosystem. AI integration is coming as Samsung and other tech giants are racing to stay ahead with the increasing demand for smart, context-aware tools. AI has emerged as a critical battlefield in mobile, and Samsung seems set to make a bigger push into that field. Rivals challenge Samsung’s foldable dominance Samsung may be the leading player in the global foldable market, but the war has just begun. Some Chinese handset makers have been even more aggressive; Honor unveiled an extra-thin foldable, the Magic V5, that falls to a skinflinty 8.8 millimeters when collapsed for those who need the power but want to look stylish. In the United States, Google is Samsung’s closest competitor in the world of foldables. Later this summer, the tech giant is also expected to unveil the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a new and sorely needed challenger to Samsung’s dominance. Google has never approached Samsung’s scale in this area, but its Android-AI story has some unique charm for certain users. Apple, Samsung’s largest smartphone competitor worldwide, has not released a foldable device. However, insiders indicate that Apple is secretly developing its own foldable iPhone for a possible release by 2026. Apple’s foray into foldables would turn the market on its head and maybe push foldable phones towards becoming a mass-market product.

BlockDAG is one of them. It has already raised over $318.5 million, sold 23.1 billion coins, and is now aiming for a $600 million finish. This isn’t just another Layer 1 idea; it’s a functional system already welcoming users, developers, and miners before any exchange listing. Many projects throw around the term most successful crypto, but BlockDAG is showing the receipts. With a technical backbone that fuses DAG’s scalability and Proof-of-Work’s security, the path to that $600M milestone looks more possible by the day. From Testnet to Mainnet: Inside BlockDAG’s Infrastructure Unlike the usual whitepaper projects waiting to build, BlockDAG already has a live testnet. Smart contracts are active. A no-code dApp builder is available to both devs and non-devs. Plus, over 2 million users are already mining BDAG through the X1 app. The mainnet launch is on a six-week countdown, ready, scheduled, and about to begin. Here’s the rollout plan: Week 6: Presale ends, staking wraps up, wallet migration kicks off. Week 4: Mainnet and ASIC mining go live, though BDAG isn’t circulating yet. Week 3: Community nodes and mining pools come online. Week 2: Airdrop of 40% presale supply and DeFi tools like DEX, bridge, and oracles go live. This isn’t theory, it’s a timeline with clear execution, and that clarity is helping push the presale forward fast. No-Code Tools, Dev Incentives, and a Builder-First Ecosystem Hyped coins come and go. But protocols that thrive long term tend to do one thing right: bring in developers. BlockDAG knows this. It’s launching grants, hackathons, and tools before listings even begin. Its no-code builder is already in use, letting anyone launch smart contracts on testnet. Add EVM support, and it becomes even easier for Ethereum-based teams to try BlockDAG’s faster, more affordable platform. The team is also backing early projects with grants and promo support, aiming to hit 1,000+ dApps by 2026. This type of growth clearly implies that BlockDAG could hit listings with a live app ecosystem, something even Solana and Avalanche needed time to build. Why the $600M Target Means Real Infrastructure, Not Just Hype Large raises usually scream hype. But for BlockDAG, $600 million is about making the system real. The numbers speak for themselves: 2M+ users mining via X1 App Over 18,100 ASIC miners sold Live public testnet with smart contracts No-code dApp builder already active 20 exchanges lined up Over 200,000 holders of BDAG This raise isn’t just for attention. It’s to support a network built before listing. The goal isn’t to pump post-launch, it’s to empower the people building it now. Right now, BDAG is available at $0.0020, but that climbs to $0.0030 after June 24. With a confirmed listing price of $0.05, that means early supporters could be looking at a 2,400% upside by the time it hits exchanges. Is BlockDAG the Most Successful Crypto of 2025? “Success” can mean different things. For some, it’s price gains. For others, it’s utility and growth. BlockDAG is setting up for both. It’s already outpacing major Layer 1s in early traction, raising $318.5 million without VC help, delivering real systems, and launching with a mapped-out public countdown. It has the tools. It has the roadmap. And more importantly, it’s got real momentum. Once the presale hits $600M and the rollout executes step-by-step, BlockDAG might not just be another project launch. It could very well be the most successful crypto of 2025.

Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Just Made Large Exchange Inflows At A Loss In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about how the Bitcoin short-term holders have reacted to the price volatility that has come alongside rising tensions in the Middle East following US strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran. Related Reading: Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy The short-term holders (STHs) refer to the BTC investors who purchased their coins within the past 155 days. The other side of the network, the holders with a holding time greater than 155 days, are termed as the long-term holders (LTHs). The former group contains the new entrants and low conviction holders, who generally panic easily whenever some change occurs in the market. On the other hand, the latter cohort includes the veterans of the market, who tend to sit tight through crashes and rallies alike. As such, given the recent sharp price action that has occurred in the sector, the STHs are likely to have made some moves. And indeed, on-chain data would confirm so. The above chart, shared by the analyst, shows the data for the profit and loss exchange deposit transactions that the STHs as a whole are making. Investors usually transfer to these centralized platforms when they want to sell, so inflows going to them can provide hints about whether selling is elevated or not. From the graph, it’s visible that the loss transactions going to the exchanges from this cohort have amounted to 14,700 BTC, which, although lower than the two major capitulation events from the past couple of months, is significant. Thus, it would appear that some of the STHs have reacted to the news by exiting the market, even if it means taking a loss. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? It’s also apparent from the chart that the profitable transfers have remained relatively low at 3,100 BTC. This is likely down to the fact that the STHs are left with little profit following the price decline, as the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has pointed out in an X post. In the chart, the trend of the STH Realized Price is displayed. This indicator keeps track of the Bitcoin cost basis or acquisition level of the average STH. During the crash, the price almost retested the line, and even after the rebound, it remains close to it, meaning the profit margin for the cohort is still tight. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $101,300, down over 5% in the last week.

As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates and large-cap momentum slows, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly climbing early-stage watchlists. Could it become the most strategic play for these seasoned investor bases? MAGACOIN FINANCE: Momentum Builds Ahead of Public Listing MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong traction among early-stage investors, with experts calling it one of the most promising new altcoin entries of 2025 . Its momentum is being fueled by a limited token supply, a rapidly filling pre-sale, and a growing wave of institutional and retail interest. The project is fully audited and structured to deliver long-term value, making it a standout in today’s altcoin landscape. Key highlights include: Over $10 million already raised , with ongoing demand across every pre-sale round Scarcity-based tokenomics and capped supply , designed to support price stability and upside Full smart contract audit and transparent governance , building investor confidence ahead of public listing XRP: Seeking Sharper Upside Beyond Legal Resolution XRP continues to trade in a tight range while the Ripple vs. SEC case nears conclusion. Prediction markets now estimate an 88% chance of spot ETF approval before year-end. Although XRP’s global payments use case and DeFi integrations are expanding, its price remains capped. Many XRP holders—aware that previous cycle returns are unlikely to repeat—are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE as a fresh-growth opportunity ahead of exchange listings. Solana: Institutional Inflows and Layer-1 Strength Solana is enjoying increased institutional adoption, with public firms investing for its speed, staking yield, and strength in NFTs and DeFi. Spot ETF approval odds for SOL are now at 92%, fueling its recent climb above $178 and momentum toward $200. But as Solana becomes more mature, many traders are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE , which analysts forecast could deliver up to 4,000% upside —a rare window in today’s market. Polygon: Scaling Ambitions, but Traders Seek Higher Multiples Polygon’s “Gigagas” roadmap targets up to 100,000 TPS and broader interoperability for global payment dominance. While MATIC may reach $0.27–$0.35 in June 2025, it remains range-bound. Facing growing competition, many Polygon investors are moving into MAGACOIN FINANCE , drawn by its capped supply, rapid pre-sale sellouts, and projected listing price of $0.007 . Conclusion With traders from XRP, Solana, and Polygon all seeking the next breakout altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the consensus early-stage favorite for 2025. Its scarcity-based tokenomics, surging demand, and strong analyst backing suggest that those who act early could be perfectly positioned for the next cycle of crypto growth.
