The plan, effective as of January 3, 2025, marks a major step in resolving the fallout from the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse in November 2022. The initial record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience Classes was also set for January 3, with further dates for other creditor classes to follow. FTX Initial Distributions to Begin Within 60 Days According to FTX Debtors, the initial payments to the creditors in the Convenience Classes will be made within 60 days from the effective date of the plan. As per the release, distribution claims for these assets must also adhere to specific criteria such as the KYC process and tax filing. Similarly, the holders of allowed claims shall have up to January 20, 2025, to meeting the pre-distribution conditions. These are filing of tax forms, choosing of Distribution Service Provider and performing of sanctions checks. Submissions made after the deadline will not be included in the initial distribution but will be included in subsequent distributions. The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization is effective today, January 3, 2025. Today is also the initial distribution record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan's Convenience Classes. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. — FTX (@FTX_Official) January 3, 2025 FTX has developed a Customer Portal where creditors are taken through a step by step procedure of eight steps with step 8 involving the selection of Distribution Service Provider. At the moment, there are only two providers, Kraken and BitGo, however, both of them have certain jurisdictions. Distribution Service Providers and Payment Options Payouts will be processed by Distribution Service Providers BitGo and Kraken, which will support several fiat and crypto options. As for the withdrawal, both providers enable creditors to make the withdrawal in U.S. dollars or request conversion of the distribution to digital assets. For FTX US residents, BitGo provides ACH transfers, wire transfers, and the option to buy digital assets such as stablecoins. Kraken has similar functionalities with extra options for SWIFT and SEPA depending on the rules of the region. However, some jurisdictions are prohibited. For instance, BitGo is prohibited from operating in New York, and Kraken is forbidden from operating in New York, Washington, and Maine. If a jurisdiction of a creditor is not sustainable, distribution will be held until other measures are put in place. Under the reorganization plan, $6.5 billion is set aside for addressing claims submissions dispute. Further adjustments to this reserve amount will be made by the Plan Administrator as and when the disputes are settled. Moreover, the Plan Administrator will also be responsible for overseeing future FTX distributions. These will be financed by the cash that will be available after all the reserves are created and worked on pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. FTX Claims Based on November 2022 Asset Prices The amount creditors receive will be based on the value of their assets at the time of FTX’s collapse in November 2022. For instance, Bitcoin was valued between $15,000 and $17,000 during that period, significantly lower than its current price of around $100,000. Despite this, FTX’s timeline for distributions is considerably faster than previous cases in the cryptocurrency industry. For example, customers of the Mt. Gox exchange, which collapsed in 2014, are still receiving payments after over a decade. FTX’s debtors announced in December that they had between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion available for distribution. Under the plan, approximately 98% of creditors are expected to recover 119% of their allowed claims.

Crypto is no longer just about Bitcoin or Ethereum—it’s the era of meme coins. These coins, often seen as quirky investments, are delivering jaw-dropping returns to those who know when to jump in. Among today’s hottest meme coins are BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Act I: The AI Prophecy. Each has something unique to offer, but BTFD is currently stealing the show with its presale’s massive 50% bonus with the code BIG50—a golden chance you won’t want to miss. BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, selling more than 60 billion tokens to over 7000 holders. When you apply the BIG50 bonus code you get 50% more coins on your purchase—a deal that’s tough to pass up.

Staking is another standout feature, offering a 90% APY. Imagine staking 1 million BTFD coins and earning an additional 900,000 coins annually—it’s a game-changer for passive income seekers. BTFD’s referral programme is equally exciting. By sharing your unique referral code, you can earn 10% of your referrals’ purchases if you make it to the top 20 leaderboard. Plus, those using your code get an extra 10% BTFD on purchases over $50—a win-win for everyone involved. If you’re ready to buy, the process is simple: Go to the BTFD Presale Page . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code BIG50 and apply it. Input the amount of BTFD you want to buy. Confirm the transaction and secure your bonus tokens. With over $4.8 million raised so far and 62 billion coins sold, the BTFD presale is a golden opportunity for those seeking high returns.

In a letter to the Senate Banking Committee, Assistant Secretary for Management Aditi Hardikar says the Treasury Department suffered a “major cybersecurity incident” after receiving a notice from third-party software service provider BeyondTrust on December 8th. According to Hardikar, hackers funded by the state of China had access to a key used by BeyondTrust to provide remote technical support for Treasury Department employees. Hardikar says the thieves used the stolen key to remotely infiltrate employees’ workstations and access unclassified documents maintained by those employees. The Treasury Department says it abruptly sought the assistance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Intelligence Community and outside experts to investigate the origin and overall impact of the attack. “Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor… In accordance with Treasury policy, intrusions attributable to an APT are considered a major cybersecurity incident.” An APT is an exploit executed by state-sponsored hackers with the goal of stealing sensitive information, carrying out cyber espionage or sabotaging critical infrastructure. According to Hardikar, the exploited BeyondTrust service has been shuttered and there’s nothing to suggest that the hackers still have access to the Treasury Department’s records. Meanwhile, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning says China had nothing to do with the data breach, reports CNN. “We have repeatedly stated our position on such groundless accusations lacking evidence. China has always opposed all forms of cyberattacks, and we are even more opposed to spreading false information about China for political purposes.” The Treasury Department is expected to hold a classified briefing about the cybersecurity incident in the coming days with staff members of the House Financial Services Committee.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Solana faces a whale sell-off, XYZVerse is emerging as a top contender, with predictions of a massive rally in 2025. Table of Contents XYZVerse: The rising meme coin star Solana Conclusion Solana is experiencing a notable sell-off from major investors, indicating a possible shift in market sentiment. Meanwhile, XYZVerse is catching attention as a promising contender, with predictions of a massive surge by 2025. XYZVerse: The rising meme coin star XYZVerse is positioning itself as one of the most exciting new projects in the crypto market. As the first all-sports meme token, it aims to blend the viral appeal of meme culture with the massive global interest in sports. This unique approach is drawing in investors and creating a significant buzz. Driving XYZVerse’s massive growth potential: Low entry price with huge upside: Currently priced at $0.001333 during its presale, XYZVerse is projected to reach $0.1 by the final presale stage — a 7,402% increase. Predictions for post-launch growth push potential returns to as high as 15,000%. Robust ecosystem: XYZVerse will offer prediction markets, entertainment-focused dApps, and community-driven rewards, making it more than just a meme coin. Its ecosystem seeks to create lasting value and appeal. Strong fundamentals: Backed by audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and upcoming listings on major exchanges, XYZVerse is built to sustain its growth trajectory. While Solana faces challenges with market sentiment, XYZVerse is gaining momentum as a fresh and transformative alternative. Its focus on sports and meme culture opens doors to untapped markets, setting it apart from other projects. Established projects may still have a role in portfolios, but emerging contenders like XYZVerse offer the kind of explosive growth potential that early investors crave. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale to potentially grow millions . Solana Solana shook up the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Competing with big names like Ethereum and Cardano, it offers a platform where developers can build decentralized apps (dapps) using various programming languages. The potential of SOL shines in its ability to underpin a high-capacity network that can handle busy products and services. This makes it an attractive option for developers and investors looking for efficiency and flexibility. The sell-off in Solana could indicate shifting market sentiment as investors reassess its scalability, network reliability, or competition in the blockchain space. While Solana remains a key player, this trend suggests that large-scale investors are seeking opportunities in emerging projects with higher growth potential. Conclusion While coins like SOL remain strong in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse aims to offer significant growth through community engagement and strategic partnerships in a unique sports-meme ecosystem.

It seeks to aid the formation of “bioDAOs” (decentralized autonomous organizations) that will help fund and self-govern scientific IP internationally from researchers, companies, and universities. One essential element of the protocol is decentralized data sharing, allowing researchers to keep IP and data ownership throughout scientific collaboration.

The support comes as an expansion of trade offerings for Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This development might have a resultant impact on the price outlook of these memecoins as more participants trade in them. Binance Expanded Fiat Pairings Boost Accessibility According to Binance’s official update on the development, the exchange said it would enable trading of the tokens against some selected African fiat currency. These could include ETB (Ethiopia), KES (Kenya), GHS (Ghana), TZS (Tanzania), UGX (Uganda) and RWF (Rwanda). Other fiat are XAF, XOF, and ZAR, which have multiple countries using it as fiat in the region. This development means interested participants could make purchases of these trading pairs using different local payment systems on the P2P channel. This opens the way for more capital inflow into the three aforementioned memecoin ecosystems. Market experts see that as likely to increase trade and impact price direction upward. This and a bullish outlook for 2025 could lead to increased price movement for PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. An expanded global market could support appreciable price growth. Market Reactions and Price Movements These memecoins have experienced different price reactions in the broader cryptocurrency market after the announcement. As of this writing, PEPE suffered a 0.83% decline to trade at $0.00002065. Its market volume also dipped by a significant 24.13% to $1.61 billion. Nonetheless, the current price level is a notable rebound from its low of $0.00002009 in earlier trading. DOGE is trading up by 1.71% at $0.3469 despite a decline in market volume by 22.85% to $2.27 billion. Meanwhile, Dogecoin whales have been active in the market, supporting price movement. Dog-themed Shiba Inu has also displayed the prospect of price upsurge as SHIB is trading at $0.0000232, a 1.88% increase in the last 24 hours. The trading volume has increased slightly by 1.10% to $479.18 million. Regulatory Compliance and Market Stability Analysts anticipated increased gains for the assets as Binance backs the memecoins across the selected African countries. They, however, caution that the leading crypto exchange needs to guarantee stability by ensuring regulatory compliance. This, they maintain, will help avoid repeating the experience it had in Nigeria , one of its largest markets.

With the formation of a classic bull flag pattern and the 1-Day 50 Moving Average (MA) acting as a bullish catalyst, the analyst is increasingly confident that XRP will reach new All-Time Highs (ATH) in 2025. How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Propel XRP Price To $4.93 The 50-day MA is a technical indicator used to track the average closing price of a cryptocurrency over the last 50 trading days. According to Dr. Dovetail, a TradingView crypto analyst, the 1-day 50 MA, indicated by the orange line in his XRP price chart, has risen to the lower boundary of a bull flag pattern. Related Reading: Weekly Chart Shows That Dogecoin Price Is Primed To Cross $11 In 2025, Here’s How The analyst suggested that XRP’s price action, which has been in a consolidation phase after its big pump, triggered the formation of the classic bull flag pattern. This bullish continuation pattern typically occurs after a strong upward movement, followed by a price correction that leads to consolidation. Historically, when a cryptocurrency consolidates near strong moving averages like the 1-day 50 MA, it indicates the readiness for a price breakout. Looking at his technical chart, the 1-day 50 MA plays a crucial role in Dr. Dovetail’s analysis and bullish XRP price prediction. The analyst believes this Moving Average can push the XRP price out of its consolidation nest to its next bullish target. Based on the confluence of technical patterns and indicators, the dotted ascending line in the analyst’s XRP chart indicates a potential price target of $4.93. Dr. Dovetail extended his forecast, highlighting that XRP could achieve this ambitious all-time high before February 2025. The XRP price chart has also indicated a volume bar showing relatively stable activity during the cryptocurrency’s consolidation phase. Additionally, the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) at the bottom of the chart suggests that XRP may be oversold, supporting the potential for a breakout. While Dr. Dovetail acknowledged that his predictions were not financial advice, the TradingView analyst expressed confidence that the current technical setup in the XRP chart could push its price to $4.93 this year. This target would represent a 105% surge from XRP’s current market value, underscoring a significant move upward from its consolidation phase. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price To $0.000045? Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For Update On XRP Price Analysis According to data from CoinMarketCap, the XRP price is presently trading at $2.41, marking a noteworthy 8.79% increase over the past week. Delving deeper into its price action and ongoing consolidation phase, XRP experienced a severe downturn after it surged from $0.5 to above $2 in November 2024. Over the past few weeks, the cryptocurrency has struggled with volatility as it aims to reclaim its all-time high of $3.84, attained during the 2021 bull run.

This legal issue is making investors worried about the Bitcoin Reserve, a project he strongly supported to bring Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system. Just like how Elon Musk’s actions can move crypto prices, Trump’s sentencing could create uncertainty and Bitcoin price may drop. President-elect Donald Trump spoke on January 10 . He would like to return to the White House, but legal issues make his Bitcoin Reserve plans more difficult. President-elect Donald Trump’s legal issues Trump is on course to be back at the White House soon, but his legal issues could make it hard for him to put in place his Bitcoin Reserve concepts. These problems might have a trickle-down effect in the crypto space because the investors are keenly watching the Bitcoin Reserve and the senators that are pro-crypto are rallying behind it. President Elect Donald Trump looks set to be sentenced on January 10 after a trial in Manhattan. He has been convicted of 34 serious crimes for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels, which was intended to silence her about their alleged affair before the 2016 elections. The Bitcoin Reserve has good support from senators who support cryptocurrency and want crypto friendly rules and regulations. It makes it easier and safer for companies of any size and for individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin. The investors liked this, as they believed that Bitcoin Reserve was going to boost the demand for Bitcoin, stabilize its price, and reduce market fluctuations. Over time, it could became an important part of America’s transition into digital finance. What does this mean for the Bitcoin Reserve? Trump’s conviction is going to bring a new wave of uncertainty for the Bitcoin Reserve and the overall cryptocurrency market. Investors are now becoming increasingly concerned that Trump’s legal woes will either choke or even totally end the growth of the Bitcoin Reserve. These might be delayed or even canceled and replaced with completely new rules. Due to this uncertainty, the crypto markets might become less stable. Some may sell their Bitcoins out of fear, which will lower its value. If Trump does not support the reserve, the Bitcoin Reserve could lose its grip and fail. Its future ultimately depends on its ability to overcome legal issues and adapt to the political changes around it. The Bitcoin Reserve intended to incorporate Bitcoin into the financial system. Intial acceptance by the Trump administration had established the U.S. as a front-runner in digital assets. Everyone was busy talking about the effect of Elon Musk on the price of PEPE and Kekius cryptos, but today everyone is discussing Trump’s activities and the court cases he’s facing. M ajor issues that may arise in the country relating to elections or the news surrounding influential individuals impact crypto markets. A portion of the investors are afraid that Trump’s legal problems will influence Bitcoin Reserve, thus lowering the price of Bitcoin and creating uncertain prospects for the future of crypto. This demonstrates how influential politicians can stabilize and also support the crypto market. This could also be a time for many bettings on polymarkets, as well as many political memecoins arising. Crypto enthusiasts were optimistic about the full launch of Bitcoin Reserve. The plan included forming partnerships, investing in infrastructure, and advocating for regulations. This approach aimed to draw more investors, stabilize Bitcoin prices, and lessen market volatility, strengthening digital assets. Market Reaction Political events will always change the financial markets including the cryptocurrencies. Unforeseen political crises always result in great changes in the market since the investors react to such changes. As we know his assassination attempts, his speech on Crypto especially Bitcoin, his election victory, all caused a significant market reaction for each of these moments. Even though Trump’s sentencing is not violent, it can still confuse the market and create uncertainty. This situation may cause more volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Weak hands, which is a term for easily scared investors, might start selling their Bitcoins in fear, and prices could drop. This sell-off would weaken the confidence that Bitcoin Reserve wanted to build, making people worried about Bitcoin’s long-term future and importance. It is not clear what will happen to Bitcoin Reserve after Trump stops promoting it. It needs strong rules and support from politicians to grow and for more people to use cryptocurrency. If Trump’s imprisonment bars him from supporting the project, then the project will lose its momentum, and investors will wonder what the future of the project holds.

With new opportunities emerging daily, knowing where to focus is key. Here’s our list of the Top 5 cryptos to buy right now: BlockDAG (BDAG), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Binance Coin (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX). BlockDAG stands out for its transformative scalability. Litecoin continues to prove its reliability over time. Shiba Inu is evolving with an expanding ecosystem. Binance Coin offers unmatched utility, while Avalanche impresses with its blazing speed. Let’s explore these coins and their features in detail! 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Future of Fast & Scalable Blockchain Tech BlockDAG (BDAG) , a leading layer-1 blockchain project, has captured attention due to its advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This technology allows faster transactions and multiple blocks to be processed at the same time, making the network both quick and reliable while solving common blockchain issues. Due to this capability, the network’s ongoing presale has been remarkably successful, raising over $174.5 million with more than 17.6 billion coins sold, showing strong adoption. Currently priced at $0.0234 in presale batch 26, BDAG provides an affordable entry point into a project poised to deliver some of the largest gains in recent history. For context, early participants who joined BlockDAG’s presale when BDAG was priced at $0.001 in batch 1 have already achieved an impressive 2,240% ROI. This exponential growth positions BlockDAG as one of the Top 5 cryptos to buy right now. 2. Litecoin (LTC): Trusted for Everyday Use Litecoin (LTC) is considered one of the Top 5 cryptos to buy now largely due to its fast transaction speeds (2.5-minute block time), low fees, and a secure Scrypt algorithm. LTC’s capped supply of 84 million coins ensures scarcity and value retention. Recent upgrades, like MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB), enhance privacy and scalability, boosting its utility. Litecoin also remains a go-to cryptocurrency for everyday payments, gaining momentum with ETF filings and adoption in 2024. Currently trading at around $101.28, Litecoin positions itself as a leader in the evolving digital currency ecosystem. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Memecoin to Utility Powerhouse Shiba Inu (SHIB), an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, has evolved from its meme origins into a comprehensive ecosystem featuring tokens like LEASH and BONE, the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, and the Layer-2 solution, Shibarium. The coin is currently trading at approximately $0.000021, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $539 million. Recent developments include significant whale activity impacting on-chain metrics. Given Shiba Inu’s active community and expanding utility, this meme coin is considered among the Top 5 cryptos to buy in 2025. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Gateway to Endless Utility Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, serving as the backbone of the Binance exchange and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BNB offers utility in transaction fee discounts, staking, and participation in token sales. Currently trading at approximately $705.38, BNB’s market capitalization has reached $101.47 billion. Binance Coin remains a top cryptocurrency to consider on account of the introduction of new project tokens on Binance Alpha and the launch of a platform tailored for the Japanese market. Given its robust features and continuous growth, Binance Coin remains one of the top crypto projects to join now. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): A Blockchain for Next-Generation dApps Avalanche (AVAX) is a high-performance blockchain known for its low latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. Utilizing a unique consensus protocol, Avalanche offers sub-second transaction finality, making it a top choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. AVAX’s latest updates include Avalanche’s integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and cross-chain capabilities, enhancing its interoperability. AVAX is currently priced around $14, reflecting its solid market position. Quick Recap: Top 5 Cryptos to Buy Now In conclusion, each of these five crypto projects—BlockDAG (BDAG), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Binance Coin (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX)—brings many strengths to the table, making them worthy of attention. Together, they represent the most promising opportunities in the market today. However, BlockDAG, with its DAG architecture, offers transformative scalability and speed and places itself at the top of the list.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 00:01:22

BREAKING: #Solana Has Achieved Quantum Resistance, per developers pic.twitter.com/BeaqdsJRAM — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) January 3, 2025 Last around $217, the Solana price has now broken above its downtrend from its mid-November highs. If it can also get above its 50DMA at $220, the door is open for a swift push higher towards $260. Crypto markets are likely to retain positive momentum ahead of incoming pro-crypto US President Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House on January 20th. The Trump administration is the most pro-crypto in history, and looks set to kickstart a new golden era for the US crypto industry and broader markets. That’s a complete 180 swivel from the outgoing Biden administration, which, a long with its anti-crypto allies in the SEC , have done everything they can to harm the industry and crypto markets. The Solana price is likely to remain heavily bid on any dips in the coming weeks as investors anticipate a bumper year of growth for crypto markets in 2025. Things could really go into overdrive if the Trump administration and Congress do push hard for the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which would lift the entire crypto market. How High Could the Solana Price Go in 2025? As one of the leading layer-1 crypto protocols, Solana price risks remain heavily tilted towards further gains in 2025. In 2021, Solana’s best year so far since its 2020 launch, Solana saw a stunning more than 170x rally. Having already gained over 25x from its 2022 lows around $8 and reached a market cap of last around $104 billion, per CoinMarketCap , Solana is unlikely to match its 2021 rally in 2025. That said, Solana could definitely still post gains in the 4-5x region and hit the psychologically important $1000 level before this bull market is over. That might seem overly optimistic, but let’s imagine that the US does kickstart a global race to accumulate BTC via announcing a strategic reserve . That could send the BTC price at least 3x higher versus its current levels. And thanks to its higher beta to risk appetite, the Solana price could also see substantial exponential gains. Solana to $1000 pic.twitter.com/CtWJpSbrth — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) January 2, 2025 What Are the Risks to the Bull Thesis? It’s always good to take a moment to consider the risks to the bullish investment thesis for any asset. In Solana’s case, investors must consider the same risks that could negatively impact the entire crypto market. The Fed is one risk. In December, their more hawkish-than-expected policy announcement caused a drop in risk assets, including Solana. As the US economy motors ahead in 2025, the case for further interest cuts, or any liquidity easing for that matter, is very weak right now. So anyone expecting a flood of stimulus like in 2020/2021 to power markets higher is likely to be left wanting. And in the scenario that the Fed needs to start raising interest rates again to deal with an overly hot economy, that would be a serious shock to the market. Elsewhere, what if the incoming administration fails to live up to the hype, failing to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve or generally be as pro-crypto as markets are currently expecting them to be. That could be crushing to a market that has rallied hard since Trump’s election victory on hopes for a much brighter future. But the bulls will be hoping that none of this comes to pass. And if not, its ought to be a very good year for the Solana price . Still priced only just above $220, Solana is a great candidate for best crypto to buy right now.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s popularity vs. limited innovation Lightchain AI Jumping into LCAI Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a mainstay of the cryptocurrency market, attracting investors with its meme-driven popularity and community strength. However, in a rapidly evolving landscape, newer and more innovative projects are stealing the spotlight. Among these, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a promising contender for those looking to capitalize on early-stage growth. Priced at $0.004 in its presale, Lightchain AI offers a unique combination of cutting-edge technology and a low entry point, making it a potential candidate for a 10x profit — outshining even Dogecoin in speculative appeal. Dogecoin’s popularity vs. limited innovation Dogecoin has won the love of many. Its rise has been pushed by celebrity support, online chatter, and community excitement. But, DOGE’s need for its joke style and speculative trading brings up doubts about its lasting power as a real buy. Critics suggest that Dogecoin has limited use and ideas compared to newer blockchain projects. With little change to its tech or plan, Dogecoin’s future is unclear, depending more on how the market feels than real worth. As such, though it is popular, DOGE might not give the same big jumps in growth like it did before.

Mike Johnson of Louisiana has been re-elected as House Speaker with strong support from his Republican colleagues and President-elect Donald Trump. His victory is crucial for the cryptocurrency industry, as Johnson is a key supporter of important crypto legislation like FIT21 and opposes central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). With his leadership, the House is poised to advance favorable regulations that could significantly boost Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the U.S. financial system. Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana has been re-elected as House Speaker. Officially, he began on the first day of the 119th Congress with a strong consensus among his majority of Republican colleagues and especially after President-elect Donald Trump endorsed him. Johnson’s Victory Strengthens Crypto Support in Congress For the cryptocurrency space, this win is important because he has been one of the strongest proponents for digital currencies and the critical crypto legislation. It was an easy and relatively not very contentious path to Speakerhood for Mike Johnson. He received the needed 218 votes during the very first round of voting, easily fending off a minor challenge from Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who chose to vote for another candidate. Further support for Johnson’s victory came from influential Republicans, including Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), the Majority Whip and a strong crypto industry supporter. Johnson’s re-election is a great breakthrough for the cryptocurrency world. He has always supported the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which is the legislation that would encourage new financial technologies, such as Bitcoin. FIT21 provides a framework that streamlines the establishment and use of digital currencies by both businesses and individuals. This approval opens up the door for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to increasingly be part of the national financial system. Mike Johnson rejects CBDCs Johnson also does not favor the issuing of CBDCs, which are e-monies issued by governments. The traditional money they held is its counterpart in digital forms. Hopes of the crypto enthusiasts for safeguarding the independence of the digital currencies become stronger with the refusal of CBDCs from Johnson. His fight for FIT21 and against CBDCs is creating the environment where the acceptance of cryptocurrencies is facilitated. That appears in the form of better regulations, increased innovation, and higher adoption of digital currencies in mainstream finance. As Speaker, Johnson can help in passing laws that will be very helpful to the crypto industry. Such laws may establish safe and regulated places where one can buy and sell their cryptocurrencies, more investors will come in, and price swings are reduced. Congress backing Johnson Several senators who take a stand for cryptocurrency strongly support Johnson’s re-election. These legislators work very closely with Johnson in advocating for legislation that not only fosters the cryptocurrency market but also creates regulations to protect consumers, prevent fraud, and encourage innovation within the cryptocurrency arena. With full backing from Trump and powerful senators, a good foundation has been set to advance crypto-friendly legislation. Trump congratulated “Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary.” The alliance would prove essential in overcoming any hurdles that may befall them as they strive to seize potential opportunities in the crypto space while fostering growth and development thereof. With Johnson returning to the position of Speaker, Important initiatives like Bitcoin Reserve, will stay on track. This is because the House will take urgent action on any issue concerning the crypto market, such as the price volatility of cryptocurrencies and a strong need for security. He places the needs of the crypto community at the forefront, which makes it an environment-friendly hub for the growth and prosperity of digital currencies. This is a big win for the cryptocurrency industry with Mike Johnson being re-elected as the House Speaker. His support for FIT21 along with his stance against CBDCs is testimony to the commitment he makes toward innovation and freedom of the digital currency that Bitcoin represents. Pro-crypto senators supporting him along with the President-elect Donald Trump, Mike Johnson is all set to facilitate the House to create fair and just rules for the crypto market. Digital finance is likely to be very much influenced under Johnson’s leadership, and that will foster growth and acceptance for cryptocurrencies within mainstream finance. Re-election not only bolsters his influence but underscores the critical need for leaders who champion crypto.

Binance Secures Landmark Regulatory Approval The Brazilian government made significant progress in the country’s crypto adoption after it approved a landmark broker-dealer license to the largest crypto exchange by trading volume. Binance announced in a statement that it successfully got regulatory approval from the Central Bank of Brazil that will allow the crypto platform to acquire a local licensed broker-dealer, Sim;paul. #Binance reaches 21st global regulatory milestone after the Central Bank of Brazil approved the acquisition of a licensed broker-dealer institution in the most populous Latin American country. This achievement underscores our dedication to compliance and regulatory excellence… pic.twitter.com/qx0GPyBjrD — Binance (@binance) January 2, 2025 Officials of the cryptocurrency exchange said that Binance considered the approval as a great achievement since they will become the pioneering crypto platform to get such a license in the South American country, adding that the license is essential for Binance because it will give the crypto firm the opportunity to provide enhanced financial services and bolster its regional position. “This achievement marks our 21st global regulatory milestone, further solidifying our status as the cryptocurrency exchange with the biggest number of licenses, registrations, and authorizations across the world,” Binance stated on its website. Compliance With State Regulations Binance said that the acquisition of Sim;paul demonstrates the company’s commitment to align itself with the local regulations in one of the world’s fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets. Binance CEO Richard Teng said that getting the Brazilian licensed broker-dealer institution is considered as an important achievement, allowing the crypto firm to get a foothold in this relevant market. “We are also on the forefront, and have become the first crypto exchange to hold a broker-dealer license in LatAm’s most populous nation, reflecting our continuous efforts with the responsible and sustainable development of the Web3 industry and rising adoption in Brazil and globally,” Teng noted. Off To A Good Start The acquisition showed that the largest cryptocurrency exchange could be off to a good start, hoping that this milestone will serve as the foundation to attain more successful deals throughout the year. Brazil is considered an essential market for Binance because it is among the top global leaders in cryptocurrency adoption, which according to Chainalysis, ranks 10th globally. “Brazil is home to a vibrant and forward-thinking crypto community. This approval reflects our commitment to compliance and security, and we’re excited to bring innovative financial services to users in Brazil,” Teng said. It can be recalled that previously, Binance struggled to get regulatory approval from state authorities in Brazil. However, the crypto exchange was able to address the issues with the Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM), complying with the local regulations that paved the way for the broker-dealer license.

However, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are losing momentum as Bitcoin slides below $100,000. Meanwhile, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is gaining ground as its presale attracts smart money and retail investors. PCHAIN is a tokenization and real estate platform set to transform the traditional real estate industry. The real estate altcoin is tipped to outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in H1 2025. Its mix of investor-friendly tokenomics and value proposition makes it the best altcoin to invest in now. Dogecoin Falters as Market Momentum Wanes A report highlighted that the appetite for meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu was high in 2024. However, Dogecoin is tanking as the market corrects in what analysts are calling a profit-taking period. An analyst claims that Dogecoin is at risk of a major crash. DOGE is trading at $0.3241, indicating a 5% in the past 24 hours. However, Dogecoin is down 23.2% in the past month, indicating heightened selling pressure. Analysts warn that DOGE could slide below $0.23 in Q1 2025 and its comeback will require stronger catalysts. Despite its massive November rally, Dogecoin failed to reach a new peak. PCHAIN to Rise Exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN is positioned to be one of the biggest performers in 2025. It has already gained momentum after raising over $1 million during the ongoing presale. Priced at just $0.011 in its presale phase, early investors are in a prime position to capitalize on massive growth. PCHAIN’s core appeal lies in its innovative approach to real estate tokenization. By offering fractional ownership, the platform makes it easier for investors to gain exposure to the real estate market, democratizing access to property investments. This unique model opens the real estate market to a broader audience. More importantly, retail investors can build life-changing wealth in the real estate market. PropiChain is winning the hearts of investors by incorporating AI. With AI-powered market analysis tools, the platform provides its users with invaluable insights into market trends. This offers them a competitive advantage, making it easy for them to outperform the market. The real estate altcoin also uses AI for automating smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries and manual verification. This makes real estate transactions faster and more efficient. PropiChain has gone the extra mile to secure the safety of its users and investors. The platform had its smart contracts independently audited by BlockAudit. This audit adds a layer of trust and transparency. PCHAIN is also tapping into the metaverse to offer virtual property tours, staging, and meetings. This feature allows investors to view properties remotely, saving time and money. Additionally, PCHAIN uses AI-based automated valuation models to ensure accurate property appraisals for buyers and sellers. Shiba Inu Tanks, Gears for Further Decline Shiba Inu has experienced a 32.4% drop in just one month. This reflects a broader decline in the meme coin market. The correction extends to other meme coins such as Dogecoin. Analysts predict both Shiba Inu could drop an additional 20% in value by Q1 2025, as market interest wanes and speculative trading slows. However, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin could turn things around if the highly-coveted altcoin season arrives sooner. Savvy Investors are Joing PCHAIN’s Presale at $0.011 With meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu losing their momentum PropiChain is shaping up to be an investment of a lifetime. The project has great tokenomics and incentives such as staking rewards of up to 225% APR. PropiChain is on course to $1, marking nearly 9,000% growth in Q1 2025. To bolster its credibility, PCHAIN scored a CoinMarketCap listing. Follow the money and invest in PCHAIN. Join PropiChain’s presale today to create generational wealth and watch a $1,000 investment yield $100K in Q1 2025.

The premiere crypto has demonstrated remarkable success as it ushers in 2025. Registering solid numbers in the last few weeks, analysts have high hopes that it can make further breakthroughs. In fact, based on latest research, Bitcoin has surpassed conventional asset classes such as gold, cementing the optimism behind the coin. The digital coin’s success this year is unsurprising, attributable to several advantageous market conditions, including Donald Trump’s victory in the recent US elections.

According to a report from Creative Planning, and from a post on Twitter/X by Charlie Bilello, Bitcoin’s performance dwarfed the results of other asset classes, with gold offering returns of just 26%. The same data shows the Nasdaq 100 gained 25%, US large caps 24%, mid-caps 13%, and convertible bonds 10%. Although proving showing decent numbers, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset with dramatic price swings. With the exception of Long Duration Treasuries, every major asset finished higher in 2024 with Bitcoin leading the way for the second straight year.https://t.co/l5IYmkf6Ih pic.twitter.com/TyStoT73rp — Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) January 1, 2025 Bitcoin Edges Gold And Other US Indexes Although Bitcoin has received a few criticisms and was the subject of regulatory actions, it remains a top-performing asset class. Since 2011, BTC has led all other asset classes, except for at least three years where it yielded negative returns to holders. For example, in 2018, Bitcoin’s yield was at -73%. But most of the time, Bitcoin was a consistent performer, and there were even some instances when yields topped 1,000%. According to the same chart, Bitcoin even offered yields of 1,437% in 2011, even beating long-term treasuries with a “modest” 34%. There were instances when Bitcoin’s yield disappointed its holders and investors. If we check the asset’s yield this year, we’ll discover that it’s lower than last year’s 156% return. Last year, Bitcoin was also the top performer among major asset classes, also beating gold. Bitcoin Shows Strength, But Volatility Remains While most of the past 14 years have seen great performance of Bitcoin against other asset classes, its volatility still raises questions. Owning Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies always has hazards related to erratic price swings and even policy announcements.

In a new post on the social media platform X to this 172,200 followers, Zeberg says WIF could leap to the $19 range. “Just before the large run of BTC in November we saw the same technical strength as we currently see in WIF – Positive Divergence in RSI – MACD about to Cross in a Bullish manner – RVGI moving higher All this while price has been pushing into a Descending Wedge – in larger wave 2. TRANSLATION: WIF is about to explode higher in larger wave 3 – in an extended move which may reach as high as 18-19 USD in this next move!” Source: Henrik Zeberg/X WIF is trading for $2.02 at time of writing, up 13% in the last 24 hours. A move to $19 would represent a percentage increase of approximately 840%. Yesterday, Zeberg said the crypto market is suddenly flashing bullish for altcoins while warning of worsening macro conditions. “We have had the first initial push in wave one of the BTC Dominance Index. Hardly noticeable! It will be in wave three (which starts now) that we really see the big push in altcoins. And it only ends after another three waves from here in wave three, wave four, wave five.

The famed investor and head of Duquesne Family Office sold all of the firm’s shares of Nvidia (NVDA) last year, along with nearly all of the firm’s stake in Palantir (PLTR). Now, Druckenmiller is beginning to pour some of the firm’s massive cash stockpile into Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), buying 1,427,950 shares worth about $30.3 million, reports the Motley Fool. The stock surged more than 100% in 2024, as the company settled opioid litigation and reported strong growth after centering its efforts on brand-name drugs. As of Q3 2024, the top holdings at Duquesne Family Office include Natera (NTRA) worth $452 million, Coupang (CPNG) valued at $287 million, Coherent (COHR) at $264 million, Woodward (WWD) at $181 million and Seagate Technology (STX) at $179 million. In a recent interview with Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Druckenmiller said his top concern is whether the Federal Reserve started cutting rates too soon. “When this whole inflationary episode started, and I’d say two years ago or a year and a half ago, I was very confident that inflation was going to come down, which I was right on. But I was worried about the economy, which I was completely wrong on. You can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there, I’ve switched to being more worried about inflation going forward than the economy itself. I’m a little worried that the Fed has declared victory too early. I don’t have conviction like I had in 2021 that inflation was going to go up, that’s when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening. But I also don’t have conviction that they’ve snuffed this thing out and won the battle.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But not all coins are created equal, and if you’re searching for the best coins for exponential returns , you’ve got to know where to look. Among the standouts are Qubetics, Solana, and Near Protocol. These aren’t just buzzworthy projects—they’re reshaping the future of blockchain innovation. Let’s start with Qubetics, the rising star in the crypto world that’s taking innovation to the next level. Currently in its 15th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $8.5 million, sold more than 395 million $TICS tokens, and amassed a community of over 13,000 token holders. Analysts are predicting a price surge to $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, and it’s no wonder why. Why Qubetics Is a Game-Changer At the heart of Qubetics’ appeal is its non-custodial wallet , a solution to the problems caused by traditional, third-party-dependent wallets. Centralised wallets often come with risks like limited access, privacy concerns, and regulatory complications. Qubetics flips the script by offering users full control of their assets in a secure, user-friendly interface. This blockchain powerhouse is solving real-world issues with its non-custodial wallet and a game-changing partnership with SWFT Blockchain. Qubetics is all about putting control and security back in users’ hands, while delivering a seamless, cross-chain experience that’s poised to redefine decentralised finance.

And with its cutting-edge tools like the non-custodial wallet and its innovative collaboration with SWFT Blockchain, it’s not just keeping up with industry demands—it’s setting the pace. For investors, this means a rare opportunity to get in early on a project that’s built for longevity and growth.This blockchain powerhouse is solving real-world issues with its non-custodial wallet and a game-changing partnership with SWFT Blockchain. Qubetics is all about putting control and security back in users’ hands, while delivering a seamless, cross-chain experience that’s poised to redefine decentralised finance.

Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain When it comes to speed, Solana is the undisputed king. Known for its ultra-fast transaction capabilities, Solana handles over 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world. This speed, combined with its low transaction fees, has made Solana a favourite for decentralised applications, NFTs, and more. Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism is its secret sauce. By integrating timestamps into its consensus process, Solana delivers unparalleled efficiency without sacrificing security. It’s no surprise that developers and projects flock to this platform to build scalable, high-performance applications. For investors, Solana’s growth potential is massive. Imagine putting $100,000 into SOL today. With ongoing adoption in DeFi and gaming, as well as its robust ecosystem of projects, Solana is positioned for significant price growth in the coming years.

Its focus on usability and scalability positions it as a leader in the next wave of blockchain adoption. A $100,000 investment in NEAR today could yield significant returns as the platform continues to expand and attract high-profile partnerships.

With Qubetics’ groundbreaking wallet t and presale momentum, Solana’s speed, and Near Protocol’s scalability, these are the coins to watch in 2025.

This will enable users to begin receiving repayments. The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization is effective today, January 3, 2025. Today is also the initial distribution record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan's Convenience Classes. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. — FTX (@FTX_Official) January 3, 2025 In a post on X on January 3 , FTX debtors cautioned users requesting funds to be vigilant against phishing emails that appear to come from the exchange. Customers must submit claims to receive reimbursements within 60 days To be eligible for reimbursement, customers must have submitted a claim via FTX’s official website. The exchange stated that the first group of users should receive their payments within 60 days. Under the company’s plan, an initial set of “convenience classes” will be prioritized for repayment, including those claiming $50,000 or less. The plan, which was approved in October, indicated that 98% of users could expect to receive 119% of the declared value of their funds. The repayment process could mark the final chapter in the FTX saga, which began with the exchange’s bankruptcy filing in November 2022 and included the imprisonment of several executives for their role in defrauding users. FTX users criticize the reorganization plan while legal outcomes unfold Still, not all FTX users support the plan. Many creditors have criticized the approach, particularly the decision to base reimbursements on the prices of cryptocurrencies held by the exchange at the time of its bankruptcy in 2022. Bitcoin’s price has surged by more than 400% since then, reaching $98,697 at publication. Among the exchanges’ executives indicted in connection with the exchange’s collapse, only two avoided prison: former engineering director Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, and former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame have all been sentenced to prison terms, although SBF has appealed his conviction. In December, crypto firms BitGo and Kraken announced they would assist in distributing recovery funds to FTX users. If all eligible users file complete claims, the exchange is expected to pay out approximately $16 billion.

This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field.

In a statement shared with Cointelegraph on Jan. 2, Tether announced Hoegner’s retirement and confirmed Hilliard as the new general counsel. “Michael’s deep understanding of both companies’ operations, coupled with his strategic approach to legal and regulatory challenges, has been critical to advancing both Tether and Bitfinex’s mission,” the company stated. Uncertainty Around USDT Compliance in Europe The leadership change comes as Tether faces ambiguity regarding its compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which took effect on Dec. 30. The new rules have left stablecoin issuers, including Tether, in a gray area. “No regulators have explicitly stated that USDT isn’t compliant, but this does not mean that it is,” Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the Technical Committee of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, told Cointelegraph. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has not clarified whether USDT is considered a restricted stablecoin under MiCA. While Coinbase delisted USDT in mid-December to comply with MiCA, the stablecoin continues to trade widely in the EU as exchanges await further guidance. USDT Market Cap Declines USDT’s market cap dropped from $138.8 billion on Dec. 30, 2024, to a weekly low of $136.9 billion on Jan. 1, marking its steepest decline since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Despite this, USDT remains dominant in the stablecoin market, with a share exceeding 65% in the $210 billion sector. Additionally, on Dec. 30, Tether transferred nearly $780 million worth of Bitcoin into its corporate reserves, aligning with its commitment to allocate up to 15% of net profits toward Bitcoin purchases.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 02:13:47

Dogecoin Whales Have Just Increased Holdings By Around $1.08 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, DOGE whales have been participating in buying activities recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of the Dogecoin supply a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are placed into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. In the context of the current topic, the whale group is of interest, which comprises of the holders who own between 10 million and 1 billion DOGE. At the current exchange rate of the memecoin, the upper bound of the range converts to $3.5 million and the lower one to $350 million. Thus, the only investors who would qualify as whales would be among the largest of entities on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Sinks To Lowest Since FTX Crash: Bottom In? Large holdings naturally mean more power in the market, so the whales can occupy a key role in the asset’s price action. This makes these holders’ supply worth keeping an eye on, as any changes in it may end up reflecting in the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the Dogecoin whales over the past month or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin whales took their supply to a high at the start of December, but then they reversed course toward a gradual selloff. The slow distribution suddenly turned into a sharp plunge in the indicator during the second half of the month, alongside which the memecoin’s price also suffered a notable drawdown. Given the timing, it’s probable the former was at least in part responsible for the latter. After one last selling push around Christmas, the whales finally stopped selling, but they also didn’t begin accumulation as their supply showed a sideways trajectory.

More specifically, the whales have purchased a total of $1.08 billion worth of coins during this surge in the metric. Once again, the trend in the whale Supply Distribution appears to be translating to Dogecoin’s value, which is displaying a recovery rally. It now remains to be seen whether the whales will keep supporting this run or if they would take some quick profits, potentially killing the momentum. DOGE Price Dogecoin briefly surpassed the $0.350 level earlier in the day, but the coin has since seen a small retrace to $0.349.
