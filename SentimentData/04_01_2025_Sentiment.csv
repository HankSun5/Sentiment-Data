The plan, effective as of January 3, 2025, marks a major step in resolving the fallout from the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse in November 2022. The initial record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience Classes was also set for January 3, with further dates for other creditor classes to follow. FTX Initial Distributions to Begin Within 60 Days According to FTX Debtors, the initial payments to the creditors in the Convenience Classes will be made within 60 days from the effective date of the plan. As per the release, distribution claims for these assets must also adhere to specific criteria such as the KYC process and tax filing. Similarly, the holders of allowed claims shall have up to January 20, 2025, to meeting the pre-distribution conditions. These are filing of tax forms, choosing of Distribution Service Provider and performing of sanctions checks. Submissions made after the deadline will not be included in the initial distribution but will be included in subsequent distributions. The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization is effective today, January 3, 2025. Today is also the initial distribution record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan's Convenience Classes. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. — FTX (@FTX_Official) January 3, 2025 FTX has developed a Customer Portal where creditors are taken through a step by step procedure of eight steps with step 8 involving the selection of Distribution Service Provider. At the moment, there are only two providers, Kraken and BitGo, however, both of them have certain jurisdictions. Distribution Service Providers and Payment Options Payouts will be processed by Distribution Service Providers BitGo and Kraken, which will support several fiat and crypto options. As for the withdrawal, both providers enable creditors to make the withdrawal in U.S. dollars or request conversion of the distribution to digital assets. For FTX US residents, BitGo provides ACH transfers, wire transfers, and the option to buy digital assets such as stablecoins. Kraken has similar functionalities with extra options for SWIFT and SEPA depending on the rules of the region. However, some jurisdictions are prohibited. For instance, BitGo is prohibited from operating in New York, and Kraken is forbidden from operating in New York, Washington, and Maine. If a jurisdiction of a creditor is not sustainable, distribution will be held until other measures are put in place. Under the reorganization plan, $6.5 billion is set aside for addressing claims submissions dispute. Further adjustments to this reserve amount will be made by the Plan Administrator as and when the disputes are settled. Moreover, the Plan Administrator will also be responsible for overseeing future FTX distributions. These will be financed by the cash that will be available after all the reserves are created and worked on pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. FTX Claims Based on November 2022 Asset Prices The amount creditors receive will be based on the value of their assets at the time of FTX’s collapse in November 2022. For instance, Bitcoin was valued between $15,000 and $17,000 during that period, significantly lower than its current price of around $100,000. Despite this, FTX’s timeline for distributions is considerably faster than previous cases in the cryptocurrency industry. For example, customers of the Mt. Gox exchange, which collapsed in 2014, are still receiving payments after over a decade. FTX’s debtors announced in December that they had between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion available for distribution. Under the plan, approximately 98% of creditors are expected to recover 119% of their allowed claims.

Crypto is no longer just about Bitcoin or Ethereum—it’s the era of meme coins. These coins, often seen as quirky investments, are delivering jaw-dropping returns to those who know when to jump in. Among today’s hottest meme coins are BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Act I: The AI Prophecy. Each has something unique to offer, but BTFD is currently stealing the show with its presale’s massive 50% bonus with the code BIG50—a golden chance you won’t want to miss. BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, selling more than 60 billion tokens to over 7000 holders. When you apply the BIG50 bonus code you get 50% more coins on your purchase—a deal that’s tough to pass up.

Meanwhile, Bonk and Act I bring their own unique flavours to the meme coin world. Bonk thrives on its community-focused charm, while Act I combines artificial intelligence with blockchain to create something futuristic and exciting.

The full version of BTFD’s P2E game is already live, showcasing the coin’s commitment to innovation. Rewards are available now and the game promises to revolutionise how users engage with crypto. Staking is another standout feature, offering a 90% APY. Imagine staking 1 million BTFD coins and earning an additional 900,000 coins annually—it’s a game-changer for passive income seekers. BTFD’s referral programme is equally exciting. By sharing your unique referral code, you can earn 10% of your referrals’ purchases if you make it to the top 20 leaderboard. Plus, those using your code get an extra 10% BTFD on purchases over $50—a win-win for everyone involved. If you’re ready to buy, the process is simple: Go to the BTFD Presale Page . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code BIG50 and apply it. Input the amount of BTFD you want to buy. Confirm the transaction and secure your bonus tokens. With over $4.8 million raised so far and 62 billion coins sold, the BTFD presale is a golden opportunity for those seeking high returns.

In a letter to the Senate Banking Committee, Assistant Secretary for Management Aditi Hardikar says the Treasury Department suffered a “major cybersecurity incident” after receiving a notice from third-party software service provider BeyondTrust on December 8th. According to Hardikar, hackers funded by the state of China had access to a key used by BeyondTrust to provide remote technical support for Treasury Department employees. Hardikar says the thieves used the stolen key to remotely infiltrate employees’ workstations and access unclassified documents maintained by those employees. The Treasury Department says it abruptly sought the assistance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Intelligence Community and outside experts to investigate the origin and overall impact of the attack. “Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor… In accordance with Treasury policy, intrusions attributable to an APT are considered a major cybersecurity incident.” An APT is an exploit executed by state-sponsored hackers with the goal of stealing sensitive information, carrying out cyber espionage or sabotaging critical infrastructure. According to Hardikar, the exploited BeyondTrust service has been shuttered and there’s nothing to suggest that the hackers still have access to the Treasury Department’s records. Meanwhile, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning says China had nothing to do with the data breach, reports CNN. “We have repeatedly stated our position on such groundless accusations lacking evidence. China has always opposed all forms of cyberattacks, and we are even more opposed to spreading false information about China for political purposes.” The Treasury Department is expected to hold a classified briefing about the cybersecurity incident in the coming days with staff members of the House Financial Services Committee.

As Solana faces a whale sell-off, XYZVerse is emerging as a top contender, with predictions of a massive rally in 2025. Table of Contents XYZVerse: The rising meme coin star Solana Conclusion Solana is experiencing a notable sell-off from major investors, indicating a possible shift in market sentiment. Meanwhile, XYZVerse is catching attention as a promising contender, with predictions of a massive surge by 2025. XYZVerse: The rising meme coin star XYZVerse is positioning itself as one of the most exciting new projects in the crypto market. As the first all-sports meme token, it aims to blend the viral appeal of meme culture with the massive global interest in sports. This unique approach is drawing in investors and creating a significant buzz. Driving XYZVerse’s massive growth potential: Low entry price with huge upside: Currently priced at $0.001333 during its presale, XYZVerse is projected to reach $0.1 by the final presale stage — a 7,402% increase. Predictions for post-launch growth push potential returns to as high as 15,000%. Robust ecosystem: XYZVerse will offer prediction markets, entertainment-focused dApps, and community-driven rewards, making it more than just a meme coin. Its ecosystem seeks to create lasting value and appeal. Strong fundamentals: Backed by audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and upcoming listings on major exchanges, XYZVerse is built to sustain its growth trajectory. While Solana faces challenges with market sentiment, XYZVerse is gaining momentum as a fresh and transformative alternative. Its focus on sports and meme culture opens doors to untapped markets, setting it apart from other projects. Established projects may still have a role in portfolios, but emerging contenders like XYZVerse offer the kind of explosive growth potential that early investors crave. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale to potentially grow millions . Solana Solana shook up the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Competing with big names like Ethereum and Cardano, it offers a platform where developers can build decentralized apps (dapps) using various programming languages. The potential of SOL shines in its ability to underpin a high-capacity network that can handle busy products and services. This makes it an attractive option for developers and investors looking for efficiency and flexibility. The sell-off in Solana could indicate shifting market sentiment as investors reassess its scalability, network reliability, or competition in the blockchain space. While Solana remains a key player, this trend suggests that large-scale investors are seeking opportunities in emerging projects with higher growth potential. Conclusion While coins like SOL remain strong in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse aims to offer significant growth through community engagement and strategic partnerships in a unique sports-meme ecosystem.

It seeks to aid the formation of “bioDAOs” (decentralized autonomous organizations) that will help fund and self-govern scientific IP internationally from researchers, companies, and universities. One essential element of the protocol is decentralized data sharing, allowing researchers to keep IP and data ownership throughout scientific collaboration.

The support comes as an expansion of trade offerings for Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This development might have a resultant impact on the price outlook of these memecoins as more participants trade in them. Binance Expanded Fiat Pairings Boost Accessibility According to Binance’s official update on the development, the exchange said it would enable trading of the tokens against some selected African fiat currency. These could include ETB (Ethiopia), KES (Kenya), GHS (Ghana), TZS (Tanzania), UGX (Uganda) and RWF (Rwanda). Other fiat are XAF, XOF, and ZAR, which have multiple countries using it as fiat in the region. This development means interested participants could make purchases of these trading pairs using different local payment systems on the P2P channel. This opens the way for more capital inflow into the three aforementioned memecoin ecosystems. Market experts see that as likely to increase trade and impact price direction upward. This and a bullish outlook for 2025 could lead to increased price movement for PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. An expanded global market could support appreciable price growth. Market Reactions and Price Movements These memecoins have experienced different price reactions in the broader cryptocurrency market after the announcement. As of this writing, PEPE suffered a 0.83% decline to trade at $0.00002065. Its market volume also dipped by a significant 24.13% to $1.61 billion. Nonetheless, the current price level is a notable rebound from its low of $0.00002009 in earlier trading. DOGE is trading up by 1.71% at $0.3469 despite a decline in market volume by 22.85% to $2.27 billion. Meanwhile, Dogecoin whales have been active in the market, supporting price movement. Dog-themed Shiba Inu has also displayed the prospect of price upsurge as SHIB is trading at $0.0000232, a 1.88% increase in the last 24 hours. The trading volume has increased slightly by 1.10% to $479.18 million. Regulatory Compliance and Market Stability Analysts anticipated increased gains for the assets as Binance backs the memecoins across the selected African countries. They, however, caution that the leading crypto exchange needs to guarantee stability by ensuring regulatory compliance. This, they maintain, will help avoid repeating the experience it had in Nigeria , one of its largest markets.

With the formation of a classic bull flag pattern and the 1-Day 50 Moving Average (MA) acting as a bullish catalyst, the analyst is increasingly confident that XRP will reach new All-Time Highs (ATH) in 2025. How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Propel XRP Price To $4.93 The 50-day MA is a technical indicator used to track the average closing price of a cryptocurrency over the last 50 trading days. According to Dr. Dovetail, a TradingView crypto analyst, the 1-day 50 MA, indicated by the orange line in his XRP price chart, has risen to the lower boundary of a bull flag pattern. Related Reading: Weekly Chart Shows That Dogecoin Price Is Primed To Cross $11 In 2025, Here’s How The analyst suggested that XRP’s price action, which has been in a consolidation phase after its big pump, triggered the formation of the classic bull flag pattern. This bullish continuation pattern typically occurs after a strong upward movement, followed by a price correction that leads to consolidation. Historically, when a cryptocurrency consolidates near strong moving averages like the 1-day 50 MA, it indicates the readiness for a price breakout. Looking at his technical chart, the 1-day 50 MA plays a crucial role in Dr. Dovetail’s analysis and bullish XRP price prediction. The analyst believes this Moving Average can push the XRP price out of its consolidation nest to its next bullish target. Based on the confluence of technical patterns and indicators, the dotted ascending line in the analyst’s XRP chart indicates a potential price target of $4.93. Dr. Dovetail extended his forecast, highlighting that XRP could achieve this ambitious all-time high before February 2025. The XRP price chart has also indicated a volume bar showing relatively stable activity during the cryptocurrency’s consolidation phase. Additionally, the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) at the bottom of the chart suggests that XRP may be oversold, supporting the potential for a breakout. While Dr. Dovetail acknowledged that his predictions were not financial advice, the TradingView analyst expressed confidence that the current technical setup in the XRP chart could push its price to $4.93 this year. This target would represent a 105% surge from XRP’s current market value, underscoring a significant move upward from its consolidation phase. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price To $0.000045? Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For Update On XRP Price Analysis According to data from CoinMarketCap, the XRP price is presently trading at $2.41, marking a noteworthy 8.79% increase over the past week. Delving deeper into its price action and ongoing consolidation phase, XRP experienced a severe downturn after it surged from $0.5 to above $2 in November 2024. Over the past few weeks, the cryptocurrency has struggled with volatility as it aims to reclaim its all-time high of $3.84, attained during the 2021 bull run.

This legal issue is making investors worried about the Bitcoin Reserve, a project he strongly supported to bring Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system. Just like how Elon Musk’s actions can move crypto prices, Trump’s sentencing could create uncertainty and Bitcoin price may drop. President-elect Donald Trump spoke on January 10 . He would like to return to the White House, but legal issues make his Bitcoin Reserve plans more difficult. President-elect Donald Trump’s legal issues Trump is on course to be back at the White House soon, but his legal issues could make it hard for him to put in place his Bitcoin Reserve concepts. These problems might have a trickle-down effect in the crypto space because the investors are keenly watching the Bitcoin Reserve and the senators that are pro-crypto are rallying behind it. President Elect Donald Trump looks set to be sentenced on January 10 after a trial in Manhattan. He has been convicted of 34 serious crimes for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels, which was intended to silence her about their alleged affair before the 2016 elections. The Bitcoin Reserve has good support from senators who support cryptocurrency and want crypto friendly rules and regulations. It makes it easier and safer for companies of any size and for individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin. The investors liked this, as they believed that Bitcoin Reserve was going to boost the demand for Bitcoin, stabilize its price, and reduce market fluctuations. Over time, it could became an important part of America’s transition into digital finance. What does this mean for the Bitcoin Reserve? Trump’s conviction is going to bring a new wave of uncertainty for the Bitcoin Reserve and the overall cryptocurrency market. Investors are now becoming increasingly concerned that Trump’s legal woes will either choke or even totally end the growth of the Bitcoin Reserve. These might be delayed or even canceled and replaced with completely new rules. Due to this uncertainty, the crypto markets might become less stable. Some may sell their Bitcoins out of fear, which will lower its value. If Trump does not support the reserve, the Bitcoin Reserve could lose its grip and fail. Its future ultimately depends on its ability to overcome legal issues and adapt to the political changes around it. The Bitcoin Reserve intended to incorporate Bitcoin into the financial system. Intial acceptance by the Trump administration had established the U.S. as a front-runner in digital assets. Everyone was busy talking about the effect of Elon Musk on the price of PEPE and Kekius cryptos, but today everyone is discussing Trump’s activities and the court cases he’s facing. M ajor issues that may arise in the country relating to elections or the news surrounding influential individuals impact crypto markets. A portion of the investors are afraid that Trump’s legal problems will influence Bitcoin Reserve, thus lowering the price of Bitcoin and creating uncertain prospects for the future of crypto. This demonstrates how influential politicians can stabilize and also support the crypto market. This could also be a time for many bettings on polymarkets, as well as many political memecoins arising. Crypto enthusiasts were optimistic about the full launch of Bitcoin Reserve. The plan included forming partnerships, investing in infrastructure, and advocating for regulations. This approach aimed to draw more investors, stabilize Bitcoin prices, and lessen market volatility, strengthening digital assets. Market Reaction Political events will always change the financial markets including the cryptocurrencies. Unforeseen political crises always result in great changes in the market since the investors react to such changes. As we know his assassination attempts, his speech on Crypto especially Bitcoin, his election victory, all caused a significant market reaction for each of these moments. Even though Trump’s sentencing is not violent, it can still confuse the market and create uncertainty. This situation may cause more volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Weak hands, which is a term for easily scared investors, might start selling their Bitcoins in fear, and prices could drop. This sell-off would weaken the confidence that Bitcoin Reserve wanted to build, making people worried about Bitcoin’s long-term future and importance. It is not clear what will happen to Bitcoin Reserve after Trump stops promoting it. It needs strong rules and support from politicians to grow and for more people to use cryptocurrency. If Trump’s imprisonment bars him from supporting the project, then the project will lose its momentum, and investors will wonder what the future of the project holds.

With new opportunities emerging daily, knowing where to focus is key. Here’s our list of the Top 5 cryptos to buy right now: BlockDAG (BDAG), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Binance Coin (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX). BlockDAG stands out for its transformative scalability. Litecoin continues to prove its reliability over time. Shiba Inu is evolving with an expanding ecosystem. Binance Coin offers unmatched utility, while Avalanche impresses with its blazing speed. Let’s explore these coins and their features in detail! 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Future of Fast & Scalable Blockchain Tech BlockDAG (BDAG) , a leading layer-1 blockchain project, has captured attention due to its advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This technology allows faster transactions and multiple blocks to be processed at the same time, making the network both quick and reliable while solving common blockchain issues. Due to this capability, the network’s ongoing presale has been remarkably successful, raising over $174.5 million with more than 17.6 billion coins sold, showing strong adoption. Currently priced at $0.0234 in presale batch 26, BDAG provides an affordable entry point into a project poised to deliver some of the largest gains in recent history. For context, early participants who joined BlockDAG’s presale when BDAG was priced at $0.001 in batch 1 have already achieved an impressive 2,240% ROI. This exponential growth positions BlockDAG as one of the Top 5 cryptos to buy right now. 2. Litecoin (LTC): Trusted for Everyday Use Litecoin (LTC) is considered one of the Top 5 cryptos to buy now largely due to its fast transaction speeds (2.5-minute block time), low fees, and a secure Scrypt algorithm. LTC’s capped supply of 84 million coins ensures scarcity and value retention. Recent upgrades, like MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB), enhance privacy and scalability, boosting its utility. Litecoin also remains a go-to cryptocurrency for everyday payments, gaining momentum with ETF filings and adoption in 2024. Currently trading at around $101.28, Litecoin positions itself as a leader in the evolving digital currency ecosystem. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Memecoin to Utility Powerhouse Shiba Inu (SHIB), an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, has evolved from its meme origins into a comprehensive ecosystem featuring tokens like LEASH and BONE, the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, and the Layer-2 solution, Shibarium. The coin is currently trading at approximately $0.000021, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $539 million. Recent developments include significant whale activity impacting on-chain metrics. Given Shiba Inu’s active community and expanding utility, this meme coin is considered among the Top 5 cryptos to buy in 2025. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Gateway to Endless Utility Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, serving as the backbone of the Binance exchange and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BNB offers utility in transaction fee discounts, staking, and participation in token sales. Currently trading at approximately $705.38, BNB’s market capitalization has reached $101.47 billion. Binance Coin remains a top cryptocurrency to consider on account of the introduction of new project tokens on Binance Alpha and the launch of a platform tailored for the Japanese market. Given its robust features and continuous growth, Binance Coin remains one of the top crypto projects to join now. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): A Blockchain for Next-Generation dApps Avalanche (AVAX) is a high-performance blockchain known for its low latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. Utilizing a unique consensus protocol, Avalanche offers sub-second transaction finality, making it a top choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. AVAX’s latest updates include Avalanche’s integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and cross-chain capabilities, enhancing its interoperability. AVAX is currently priced around $14, reflecting its solid market position. Quick Recap: Top 5 Cryptos to Buy Now In conclusion, each of these five crypto projects—BlockDAG (BDAG), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Binance Coin (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX)—brings many strengths to the table, making them worthy of attention. Together, they represent the most promising opportunities in the market today. However, BlockDAG, with its DAG architecture, offers transformative scalability and speed and places itself at the top of the list.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 00:01:22

BREAKING: #Solana Has Achieved Quantum Resistance, per developers pic.twitter.com/BeaqdsJRAM — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) January 3, 2025 Last around $217, the Solana price has now broken above its downtrend from its mid-November highs. If it can also get above its 50DMA at $220, the door is open for a swift push higher towards $260. Crypto markets are likely to retain positive momentum ahead of incoming pro-crypto US President Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House on January 20th. The Trump administration is the most pro-crypto in history, and looks set to kickstart a new golden era for the US crypto industry and broader markets. That’s a complete 180 swivel from the outgoing Biden administration, which, a long with its anti-crypto allies in the SEC , have done everything they can to harm the industry and crypto markets. The Solana price is likely to remain heavily bid on any dips in the coming weeks as investors anticipate a bumper year of growth for crypto markets in 2025. Things could really go into overdrive if the Trump administration and Congress do push hard for the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which would lift the entire crypto market. How High Could the Solana Price Go in 2025? As one of the leading layer-1 crypto protocols, Solana price risks remain heavily tilted towards further gains in 2025. In 2021, Solana’s best year so far since its 2020 launch, Solana saw a stunning more than 170x rally. Having already gained over 25x from its 2022 lows around $8 and reached a market cap of last around $104 billion, per CoinMarketCap , Solana is unlikely to match its 2021 rally in 2025. That said, Solana could definitely still post gains in the 4-5x region and hit the psychologically important $1000 level before this bull market is over. That might seem overly optimistic, but let’s imagine that the US does kickstart a global race to accumulate BTC via announcing a strategic reserve . That could send the BTC price at least 3x higher versus its current levels. And thanks to its higher beta to risk appetite, the Solana price could also see substantial exponential gains. Solana to $1000 pic.twitter.com/CtWJpSbrth — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) January 2, 2025 What Are the Risks to the Bull Thesis? It’s always good to take a moment to consider the risks to the bullish investment thesis for any asset. In Solana’s case, investors must consider the same risks that could negatively impact the entire crypto market. The Fed is one risk. In December, their more hawkish-than-expected policy announcement caused a drop in risk assets, including Solana. As the US economy motors ahead in 2025, the case for further interest cuts, or any liquidity easing for that matter, is very weak right now. So anyone expecting a flood of stimulus like in 2020/2021 to power markets higher is likely to be left wanting. And in the scenario that the Fed needs to start raising interest rates again to deal with an overly hot economy, that would be a serious shock to the market. Elsewhere, what if the incoming administration fails to live up to the hype, failing to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve or generally be as pro-crypto as markets are currently expecting them to be. That could be crushing to a market that has rallied hard since Trump’s election victory on hopes for a much brighter future. But the bulls will be hoping that none of this comes to pass. And if not, its ought to be a very good year for the Solana price . Still priced only just above $220, Solana is a great candidate for best crypto to buy right now.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s popularity vs. limited innovation Lightchain AI Jumping into LCAI Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a mainstay of the cryptocurrency market, attracting investors with its meme-driven popularity and community strength. However, in a rapidly evolving landscape, newer and more innovative projects are stealing the spotlight. Among these, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a promising contender for those looking to capitalize on early-stage growth. Priced at $0.004 in its presale, Lightchain AI offers a unique combination of cutting-edge technology and a low entry point, making it a potential candidate for a 10x profit — outshining even Dogecoin in speculative appeal. Dogecoin’s popularity vs. limited innovation Dogecoin has won the love of many. Its rise has been pushed by celebrity support, online chatter, and community excitement. But, DOGE’s need for its joke style and speculative trading brings up doubts about its lasting power as a real buy. Critics suggest that Dogecoin has limited use and ideas compared to newer blockchain projects. With little change to its tech or plan, Dogecoin’s future is unclear, depending more on how the market feels than real worth. As such, though it is popular, DOGE might not give the same big jumps in growth like it did before.

Mike Johnson of Louisiana has been re-elected as House Speaker with strong support from his Republican colleagues and President-elect Donald Trump. His victory is crucial for the cryptocurrency industry, as Johnson is a key supporter of important crypto legislation like FIT21 and opposes central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). With his leadership, the House is poised to advance favorable regulations that could significantly boost Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the U.S. financial system. Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana has been re-elected as House Speaker. Officially, he began on the first day of the 119th Congress with a strong consensus among his majority of Republican colleagues and especially after President-elect Donald Trump endorsed him. Johnson’s Victory Strengthens Crypto Support in Congress For the cryptocurrency space, this win is important because he has been one of the strongest proponents for digital currencies and the critical crypto legislation. It was an easy and relatively not very contentious path to Speakerhood for Mike Johnson. He received the needed 218 votes during the very first round of voting, easily fending off a minor challenge from Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who chose to vote for another candidate. Further support for Johnson’s victory came from influential Republicans, including Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), the Majority Whip and a strong crypto industry supporter. Johnson’s re-election is a great breakthrough for the cryptocurrency world. He has always supported the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which is the legislation that would encourage new financial technologies, such as Bitcoin. FIT21 provides a framework that streamlines the establishment and use of digital currencies by both businesses and individuals. This approval opens up the door for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to increasingly be part of the national financial system. Mike Johnson rejects CBDCs Johnson also does not favor the issuing of CBDCs, which are e-monies issued by governments. The traditional money they held is its counterpart in digital forms. Hopes of the crypto enthusiasts for safeguarding the independence of the digital currencies become stronger with the refusal of CBDCs from Johnson. His fight for FIT21 and against CBDCs is creating the environment where the acceptance of cryptocurrencies is facilitated. That appears in the form of better regulations, increased innovation, and higher adoption of digital currencies in mainstream finance. As Speaker, Johnson can help in passing laws that will be very helpful to the crypto industry. Such laws may establish safe and regulated places where one can buy and sell their cryptocurrencies, more investors will come in, and price swings are reduced. Congress backing Johnson Several senators who take a stand for cryptocurrency strongly support Johnson’s re-election. These legislators work very closely with Johnson in advocating for legislation that not only fosters the cryptocurrency market but also creates regulations to protect consumers, prevent fraud, and encourage innovation within the cryptocurrency arena. With full backing from Trump and powerful senators, a good foundation has been set to advance crypto-friendly legislation. Trump congratulated “Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary.” The alliance would prove essential in overcoming any hurdles that may befall them as they strive to seize potential opportunities in the crypto space while fostering growth and development thereof. With Johnson returning to the position of Speaker, Important initiatives like Bitcoin Reserve, will stay on track. This is because the House will take urgent action on any issue concerning the crypto market, such as the price volatility of cryptocurrencies and a strong need for security. He places the needs of the crypto community at the forefront, which makes it an environment-friendly hub for the growth and prosperity of digital currencies. This is a big win for the cryptocurrency industry with Mike Johnson being re-elected as the House Speaker. His support for FIT21 along with his stance against CBDCs is testimony to the commitment he makes toward innovation and freedom of the digital currency that Bitcoin represents. Pro-crypto senators supporting him along with the President-elect Donald Trump, Mike Johnson is all set to facilitate the House to create fair and just rules for the crypto market. Digital finance is likely to be very much influenced under Johnson’s leadership, and that will foster growth and acceptance for cryptocurrencies within mainstream finance. Re-election not only bolsters his influence but underscores the critical need for leaders who champion crypto.

However, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are losing momentum as Bitcoin slides below $100,000. Meanwhile, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is gaining ground as its presale attracts smart money and retail investors. PCHAIN is a tokenization and real estate platform set to transform the traditional real estate industry. The real estate altcoin is tipped to outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in H1 2025. Its mix of investor-friendly tokenomics and value proposition makes it the best altcoin to invest in now. Dogecoin Falters as Market Momentum Wanes A report highlighted that the appetite for meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu was high in 2024. However, Dogecoin is tanking as the market corrects in what analysts are calling a profit-taking period. An analyst claims that Dogecoin is at risk of a major crash. DOGE is trading at $0.3241, indicating a 5% in the past 24 hours. However, Dogecoin is down 23.2% in the past month, indicating heightened selling pressure. Analysts warn that DOGE could slide below $0.23 in Q1 2025 and its comeback will require stronger catalysts. Despite its massive November rally, Dogecoin failed to reach a new peak. PCHAIN to Rise Exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN is positioned to be one of the biggest performers in 2025. It has already gained momentum after raising over $1 million during the ongoing presale. Priced at just $0.011 in its presale phase, early investors are in a prime position to capitalize on massive growth. PCHAIN’s core appeal lies in its innovative approach to real estate tokenization. By offering fractional ownership, the platform makes it easier for investors to gain exposure to the real estate market, democratizing access to property investments. This unique model opens the real estate market to a broader audience. More importantly, retail investors can build life-changing wealth in the real estate market. PropiChain is winning the hearts of investors by incorporating AI. With AI-powered market analysis tools, the platform provides its users with invaluable insights into market trends. This offers them a competitive advantage, making it easy for them to outperform the market. The real estate altcoin also uses AI for automating smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries and manual verification. This makes real estate transactions faster and more efficient. PropiChain has gone the extra mile to secure the safety of its users and investors. The platform had its smart contracts independently audited by BlockAudit. This audit adds a layer of trust and transparency. PCHAIN is also tapping into the metaverse to offer virtual property tours, staging, and meetings. This feature allows investors to view properties remotely, saving time and money. Additionally, PCHAIN uses AI-based automated valuation models to ensure accurate property appraisals for buyers and sellers. Shiba Inu Tanks, Gears for Further Decline Shiba Inu has experienced a 32.4% drop in just one month. This reflects a broader decline in the meme coin market. The correction extends to other meme coins such as Dogecoin. Analysts predict both Shiba Inu could drop an additional 20% in value by Q1 2025, as market interest wanes and speculative trading slows. However, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin could turn things around if the highly-coveted altcoin season arrives sooner. Savvy Investors are Joing PCHAIN’s Presale at $0.011 With meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu losing their momentum PropiChain is shaping up to be an investment of a lifetime. The project has great tokenomics and incentives such as staking rewards of up to 225% APR. PropiChain is on course to $1, marking nearly 9,000% growth in Q1 2025. To bolster its credibility, PCHAIN scored a CoinMarketCap listing. Follow the money and invest in PCHAIN. Join PropiChain’s presale today to create generational wealth and watch a $1,000 investment yield $100K in Q1 2025.

The premiere crypto has demonstrated remarkable success as it ushers in 2025. Registering solid numbers in the last few weeks, analysts have high hopes that it can make further breakthroughs. In fact, based on latest research, Bitcoin has surpassed conventional asset classes such as gold, cementing the optimism behind the coin. The digital coin’s success this year is unsurprising, attributable to several advantageous market conditions, including Donald Trump’s victory in the recent US elections.

According to a report from Creative Planning, and from a post on Twitter/X by Charlie Bilello, Bitcoin’s performance dwarfed the results of other asset classes, with gold offering returns of just 26%. The same data shows the Nasdaq 100 gained 25%, US large caps 24%, mid-caps 13%, and convertible bonds 10%. Although proving showing decent numbers, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset with dramatic price swings. With the exception of Long Duration Treasuries, every major asset finished higher in 2024 with Bitcoin leading the way for the second straight year.https://t.co/l5IYmkf6Ih pic.twitter.com/TyStoT73rp — Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) January 1, 2025 Bitcoin Edges Gold And Other US Indexes Although Bitcoin has received a few criticisms and was the subject of regulatory actions, it remains a top-performing asset class. Since 2011, BTC has led all other asset classes, except for at least three years where it yielded negative returns to holders. For example, in 2018, Bitcoin’s yield was at -73%. But most of the time, Bitcoin was a consistent performer, and there were even some instances when yields topped 1,000%. According to the same chart, Bitcoin even offered yields of 1,437% in 2011, even beating long-term treasuries with a “modest” 34%. There were instances when Bitcoin’s yield disappointed its holders and investors. If we check the asset’s yield this year, we’ll discover that it’s lower than last year’s 156% return. Last year, Bitcoin was also the top performer among major asset classes, also beating gold. Bitcoin Shows Strength, But Volatility Remains While most of the past 14 years have seen great performance of Bitcoin against other asset classes, its volatility still raises questions. Owning Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies always has hazards related to erratic price swings and even policy announcements.

In a new post on the social media platform X to this 172,200 followers, Zeberg says WIF could leap to the $19 range. “Just before the large run of BTC in November we saw the same technical strength as we currently see in WIF – Positive Divergence in RSI – MACD about to Cross in a Bullish manner – RVGI moving higher All this while price has been pushing into a Descending Wedge – in larger wave 2. TRANSLATION: WIF is about to explode higher in larger wave 3 – in an extended move which may reach as high as 18-19 USD in this next move!” Source: Henrik Zeberg/X WIF is trading for $2.02 at time of writing, up 13% in the last 24 hours. A move to $19 would represent a percentage increase of approximately 840%. Yesterday, Zeberg said the crypto market is suddenly flashing bullish for altcoins while warning of worsening macro conditions. “We have had the first initial push in wave one of the BTC Dominance Index. Hardly noticeable! It will be in wave three (which starts now) that we really see the big push in altcoins. And it only ends after another three waves from here in wave three, wave four, wave five.

The famed investor and head of Duquesne Family Office sold all of the firm’s shares of Nvidia (NVDA) last year, along with nearly all of the firm’s stake in Palantir (PLTR). Now, Druckenmiller is beginning to pour some of the firm’s massive cash stockpile into Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), buying 1,427,950 shares worth about $30.3 million, reports the Motley Fool. The stock surged more than 100% in 2024, as the company settled opioid litigation and reported strong growth after centering its efforts on brand-name drugs. As of Q3 2024, the top holdings at Duquesne Family Office include Natera (NTRA) worth $452 million, Coupang (CPNG) valued at $287 million, Coherent (COHR) at $264 million, Woodward (WWD) at $181 million and Seagate Technology (STX) at $179 million. In a recent interview with Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Druckenmiller said his top concern is whether the Federal Reserve started cutting rates too soon. “When this whole inflationary episode started, and I’d say two years ago or a year and a half ago, I was very confident that inflation was going to come down, which I was right on. But I was worried about the economy, which I was completely wrong on. You can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there, I’ve switched to being more worried about inflation going forward than the economy itself. I’m a little worried that the Fed has declared victory too early. I don’t have conviction like I had in 2021 that inflation was going to go up, that’s when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening. But I also don’t have conviction that they’ve snuffed this thing out and won the battle.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But not all coins are created equal, and if you’re searching for the best coins for exponential returns , you’ve got to know where to look. Among the standouts are Qubetics, Solana, and Near Protocol. These aren’t just buzzworthy projects—they’re reshaping the future of blockchain innovation. Let’s start with Qubetics, the rising star in the crypto world that’s taking innovation to the next level. Currently in its 15th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $8.5 million, sold more than 395 million $TICS tokens, and amassed a community of over 13,000 token holders. Analysts are predicting a price surge to $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, and it’s no wonder why. Why Qubetics Is a Game-Changer At the heart of Qubetics’ appeal is its non-custodial wallet , a solution to the problems caused by traditional, third-party-dependent wallets. Centralised wallets often come with risks like limited access, privacy concerns, and regulatory complications. Qubetics flips the script by offering users full control of their assets in a secure, user-friendly interface. This blockchain powerhouse is solving real-world issues with its non-custodial wallet and a game-changing partnership with SWFT Blockchain. Qubetics is all about putting control and security back in users’ hands, while delivering a seamless, cross-chain experience that’s poised to redefine decentralised finance. What makes Qubetics a true standout is its emphasis on tackling major blockchain pain points. Whether it’s scalability, security risks, or the limitations of traditional wallets, Qubetics has the solutions. And with its cutting-edge tools like the non-custodial wallet and its innovative collaboration with SWFT Blockchain, it’s not just keeping up with industry demands—it’s setting the pace. For investors, this means a rare opportunity to get in early on a project that’s built for longevity and growth.This blockchain powerhouse is solving real-world issues with its non-custodial wallet and a game-changing partnership with SWFT Blockchain. Qubetics is all about putting control and security back in users’ hands, while delivering a seamless, cross-chain experience that’s poised to redefine decentralised finance. And then there’s the partnership with SWFT Blockchain, which takes things up a notch. This collaboration has resulted in a wallet that supports seamless, lightning-fast transactions across multiple blockchains. Whether you’re swapping assets or managing a diverse portfolio, the wallet’s cross-chain functionality and advanced encryption protocols ensure a smooth, secure experience. Add to that the impressive stats: $8.5 million raised during its presale, a token price of $0.0414, and projections of a $10-$15 value after the mainnet launch. Qubetics is poised for exponential growth, making it a prime pick for investors looking for serious returns. For anyone interested in learning more, you can check out this video here. Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain When it comes to speed, Solana is the undisputed king. Known for its ultra-fast transaction capabilities, Solana handles over 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world. This speed, combined with its low transaction fees, has made Solana a favourite for decentralised applications, NFTs, and more. Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism is its secret sauce. By integrating timestamps into its consensus process, Solana delivers unparalleled efficiency without sacrificing security. It’s no surprise that developers and projects flock to this platform to build scalable, high-performance applications. For investors, Solana’s growth potential is massive. Imagine putting $100,000 into SOL today. With ongoing adoption in DeFi and gaming, as well as its robust ecosystem of projects, Solana is positioned for significant price growth in the coming years. Near Protocol: The Scalable Innovator Let’s not overlook Near Protocol, a blockchain that’s making waves with its focus on scalability and user-friendliness. Built with developers in mind, Near’s ecosystem is all about lowering barriers to blockchain adoption. Near’s innovative sharding technology ensures the network remains fast and efficient, even as it scales to meet growing demand. This scalability makes it an ideal platform for everything from DeFi projects to enterprise applications. Add in its developer-friendly tools and intuitive interface, and it’s clear why Near is gaining traction. For investors, Near Protocol represents a long-term opportunity. Its focus on usability and scalability positions it as a leader in the next wave of blockchain adoption. A $100,000 investment in NEAR today could yield significant returns as the platform continues to expand and attract high-profile partnerships. Final Thoughts The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities like these don’t wait. With Qubetics’ groundbreaking wallet t and presale momentum, Solana’s speed, and Near Protocol’s scalability, these are the coins to watch in 2025. Don’t miss your chance to invest in projects that are not just surviving but thriving in the ever-evolving world of blockchain. Get in now and ride the wave of exponential returns into the future.

This will enable users to begin receiving repayments. The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization is effective today, January 3, 2025. Today is also the initial distribution record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan's Convenience Classes. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. — FTX (@FTX_Official) January 3, 2025 In a post on X on January 3 , FTX debtors cautioned users requesting funds to be vigilant against phishing emails that appear to come from the exchange. Customers must submit claims to receive reimbursements within 60 days To be eligible for reimbursement, customers must have submitted a claim via FTX’s official website. The exchange stated that the first group of users should receive their payments within 60 days. Under the company’s plan, an initial set of “convenience classes” will be prioritized for repayment, including those claiming $50,000 or less. The plan, which was approved in October, indicated that 98% of users could expect to receive 119% of the declared value of their funds. The repayment process could mark the final chapter in the FTX saga, which began with the exchange’s bankruptcy filing in November 2022 and included the imprisonment of several executives for their role in defrauding users. FTX users criticize the reorganization plan while legal outcomes unfold Still, not all FTX users support the plan. Many creditors have criticized the approach, particularly the decision to base reimbursements on the prices of cryptocurrencies held by the exchange at the time of its bankruptcy in 2022. Bitcoin’s price has surged by more than 400% since then, reaching $98,697 at publication. Among the exchanges’ executives indicted in connection with the exchange’s collapse, only two avoided prison: former engineering director Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, and former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame have all been sentenced to prison terms, although SBF has appealed his conviction. In December, crypto firms BitGo and Kraken announced they would assist in distributing recovery funds to FTX users.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

These cryptocurrencies are accessible and provide a considerable upside for those who delve into projects backed by solid fundamentals and distinct uses. This selection, ranging from decentralized e-commerce systems to popular meme coins, each brings a unique value. Highlighted here are Web3Bay, Pandoshi, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, all priced below $0.5, focusing on their potential for growth, technological strengths, and practical applications. Continue reading to see how these choices might align with your crypto interests. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY): Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay leads as the top crypto under $0.5 with potential 100x returns, aimed at changing the dynamics of how digital assets are bought, sold, and interacted with online. It is built on blockchain technology, enhancing user ownership, transparency, and safety, setting a new standard for online marketplaces. Online Shopping Evolution: Web3Bay addresses the drawbacks of traditional platforms by eliminating excessive fees, central control, and security breaches. Its blockchain foundation gives users complete control over their data and enables worldwide transactions without traditional banks. This method not only improves accessibility but also builds trust among participants. Tokenomics and Growth Prospects: The 3BAY token underpins Web3Bay’s ecosystem. Out of a total of 5 billion tokens, 40% are reserved for a 28-stage presale. Early participants gain from gradual price increases, encouraging early involvement. Presently, in presale stage 2, priced at $0.00345, the token has amassed over $254,000, with the potential to hit a market price of $0.1959 swiftly. Blending Traditional and Decentralized Commerce: Web3Bay merges conventional and decentralized commerce. By supporting mainstream payment methods like PayPal along with cryptocurrencies, it smooths the transition for both enthusiasts and newcomers, positioning Web3Bay as a front-runner in opening up decentralized marketplaces. Web3Bay, with its solid infrastructure and user-focused design, is poised for significant growth, marking it as a prime choice for those eyeing substantial returns. 2. Pandoshi (PAMBO): Scalability Meets Affordability in Crypto Pandoshi is emerging as one of the top crypto gems under $0.5 with a potential for 100x returns, using a Layer-2 network and Proof of Stake for consensus. Priced at only $0.008 in its public presale, it presents an exceptional growth opportunity. Experts suggest that Pandoshi might climb to $10 by 2025’s end, a substantial gain for early backers. Its focus on scalability, sustainability, and low-cost transactions positions it as a strong candidate in the blockchain sector. Also, Pandoshi’s emphasis on working with other networks boosts its appeal. For those looking for a low-priced entry into a project with vast upside, Pandoshi represents an exciting chance worth considering. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Utility-Driven Meme Coin Initially started as a playful project, Dogecoin has grown into a well-recognized cryptocurrency supported by a strong community. Trading below $0.50, it offers an approachable option for experienced and new crypto users alike. Currently, Dogecoin is trading around $0.44, placing it among the top crypto under $0.5 for those looking for a stable and familiar option. The coin’s broad acceptance for payments and tipping continues to enhance its appeal. As general interest in cryptocurrencies expands, Dogecoin’s value as a stable investment grows. It has demonstrated its resilience and capacity to deliver returns, making it a solid choice for those pursuing steady growth. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Low-Cost Entry with Vast Potential Often dubbed the ‘Dogecoin Killer,’ Shiba Inu combines affordability with a community-driven approach. Priced well below $0.50, SHIB offers a low-risk entry into the cryptocurrency market. Currently, Shiba Inu trades at approximately $0.00002171, underlining its accessibility as one of the top crypto under $0.5 with significant return potential. The Shiba Inu ecosystem, including its decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, provides practical utility to the token. Although known as a meme coin, which brings higher volatility, it also opens opportunities for impressive returns. Those intrigued by speculative growth alongside active development might find Shiba Inu an attractive addition to their portfolio. Final Reflections Identifying the top crypto under $0.5 with the potential for 100x returns demands careful consideration of each project’s fundamentals, use cases, and market stance. Projects like Web3Bay lead with innovative approaches to decentralized commerce, while Pandoshi, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu each offer unique benefits. Diversifying across these promising options could enhance growth prospects while balancing risks.

In a statement shared with Cointelegraph on Jan. 2, Tether announced Hoegner’s retirement and confirmed Hilliard as the new general counsel. “Michael’s deep understanding of both companies’ operations, coupled with his strategic approach to legal and regulatory challenges, has been critical to advancing both Tether and Bitfinex’s mission,” the company stated. Uncertainty Around USDT Compliance in Europe The leadership change comes as Tether faces ambiguity regarding its compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which took effect on Dec. 30. The new rules have left stablecoin issuers, including Tether, in a gray area. “No regulators have explicitly stated that USDT isn’t compliant, but this does not mean that it is,” Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the Technical Committee of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, told Cointelegraph. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has not clarified whether USDT is considered a restricted stablecoin under MiCA. While Coinbase delisted USDT in mid-December to comply with MiCA, the stablecoin continues to trade widely in the EU as exchanges await further guidance. USDT Market Cap Declines USDT’s market cap dropped from $138.8 billion on Dec. 30, 2024, to a weekly low of $136.9 billion on Jan. 1, marking its steepest decline since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Despite this, USDT remains dominant in the stablecoin market, with a share exceeding 65% in the $210 billion sector. Additionally, on Dec. 30, Tether transferred nearly $780 million worth of Bitcoin into its corporate reserves, aligning with its commitment to allocate up to 15% of net profits toward Bitcoin purchases.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 02:13:47

Dogecoin Whales Have Just Increased Holdings By Around $1.08 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, DOGE whales have been participating in buying activities recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of the Dogecoin supply a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are placed into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. In the context of the current topic, the whale group is of interest, which comprises of the holders who own between 10 million and 1 billion DOGE. At the current exchange rate of the memecoin, the upper bound of the range converts to $3.5 million and the lower one to $350 million. Thus, the only investors who would qualify as whales would be among the largest of entities on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Sinks To Lowest Since FTX Crash: Bottom In? Large holdings naturally mean more power in the market, so the whales can occupy a key role in the asset’s price action. This makes these holders’ supply worth keeping an eye on, as any changes in it may end up reflecting in the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the Dogecoin whales over the past month or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin whales took their supply to a high at the start of December, but then they reversed course toward a gradual selloff. The slow distribution suddenly turned into a sharp plunge in the indicator during the second half of the month, alongside which the memecoin’s price also suffered a notable drawdown. Given the timing, it’s probable the former was at least in part responsible for the latter. After one last selling push around Christmas, the whales finally stopped selling, but they also didn’t begin accumulation as their supply showed a sideways trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch? This has changed in the last couple of days, as these humongous entities have added a notable amount to their holdings. More specifically, the whales have purchased a total of $1.08 billion worth of coins during this surge in the metric. Once again, the trend in the whale Supply Distribution appears to be translating to Dogecoin’s value, which is displaying a recovery rally. It now remains to be seen whether the whales will keep supporting this run or if they would take some quick profits, potentially killing the momentum. DOGE Price Dogecoin briefly surpassed the $0.350 level earlier in the day, but the coin has since seen a small retrace to $0.349.

While Dogecoin’s initial popularity was meme-driven, its increasing adoption and expanding use cases are making it a more compelling option for crypto enthusiasts. However, it’s not the only digital asset turning heads the Lightchain AI Presale is now live, offering an exciting opportunity for early investors looking to get in on the next big thing. Analysts suggest Dogecoin could see notable growth through 2030, fueled by further integration into mainstream platforms and enhanced utility. For those exploring long-term crypto investments, Dogecoin and emerging projects like Lightchain AI present intriguing prospects in the ever-evolving digital asset space. Dogecoin Price Predictions for 2024-2030 Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced significant price fluctuations, with its value influenced by factors such as market sentiment, technological developments, and macroeconomic trends. As of December 2024, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.31, reflecting a substantial increase from earlier in the year. Analysts offer varying predictions for DOGE’s future value. 2025- Estimates suggest an average price around $0.248, with potential highs reaching $0.77, contingent on technological advancements and broader cryptocurrency market trends. Crypto News 2030- Projections range from approximately $1.05 to $23.64, depending on factors such as increased utility, widespread adoption, and market dynamics. These forecasts are speculative and subject to change based on market volatility and evolving industry developments. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Is Dogecoin a Worthy New Year’s Investment? Like with any buy, it’s͏ key to do deep study and think about possible risks before picking Dogecoin as a new year’s buy. While DOGE has shown big growth in last years, its worth stays very changeable and open to market trends. But, trade pros say DOGE might keep growing till 2030 as more people start using it and it joins big platforms. Also new plans like Lightchain AI give special chances for first buyers who want to mix up their crypto stocks. Why Lightchain AI Could Be a Game-Changer for Crypto Investors Lightchain AI could redefine crypto investing in 2024 with its innovative fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Unlike many hype-driven tokens, Lightchain AI focuses on real-world utility, exemplified by its introduction of Proof of Intelligence (PoI). This groundbreaking concept leverages AI for decentralized decision-making, setting it apart from speculative assets. The presale success of its token, priced at just $0.004, has drawn attention, offering investors a ground-floor opportunity. Lightchain AI is already being compared to leading cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ripple, thanks to its unique technology and long-term growth potential. By addressing practical applications in a growing decentralized AI market, it positions itself as more than just another crypto. For investors seeking diversification, Lightchain AI represents a promising, forward-thinking addition to a portfolio.

With so many choices, it’s no wonder investors are constantly on the lookout for options that balance reliability and strong growth potential. 2025 is shaping up to be a year of exciting opportunities for those who know where to look. The digital currency space has grown beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering a variety of innovative projects tailored to different needs. One standout is Qubetics ($TICS), a game-changer tackling real-life issues that other cryptocurrencies haven’t been able to resolve. Its applications in cross-border transactions and the way it connects different blockchains make it a unique option. With its presale already creating a buzz, let’s dive deeper into Qubetics and other strong contenders in this list. 1. Qubetics and Its Revolutionary Role in Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics has emerged as one of the most talked-about blockchain projects this year, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it unites leading blockchains into a single platform, simplifying transactions for individuals and businesses. For example, imagine a small e-commerce business in the US wanting to sell products internationally. Qubetics enables seamless cross-border transactions with minimal fees and faster processing times, saving both time and money for users. Its presale has reached the 15th stage, with over $8.5 million raised and more than 395 million $TICS tokens sold. The presale stages only last seven days each, and prices increase by 10% every Sunday at midnight. This mechanism ensures an upward momentum in token value, creating a unique incentive for early adopters. At its current price of $0.0414, Qubetics is attracting attention from over 13,000 token holders. Why this coin made it to this list: Qubetics is not just solving problems; it’s laying the groundwork for smoother, faster, and more inclusive financial transactions across borders. Its innovative model and rising presale numbers make it one of the best cryptos to buy now. 2. Avalanche Promises Faster and Cheaper Transactions Avalanche is another strong contender in 2025, known for its ability to support decentralised applications with unmatched scalability. The platform stands out for its subnets feature, allowing developers to create custom blockchain networks that can work together seamlessly. Avalanche’s focus on energy efficiency also gives it a modern appeal, especially as the world shifts toward greener solutions. Its fast transaction speeds and lower costs make it a popular choice for businesses and developers looking for practical blockchain solutions. Analysts are optimistic about Avalanche’s long-term growth as it continues to attract a variety of high-profile partnerships and development projects. Why this coin made it to this list: Avalanche’s commitment to efficiency and innovation puts it on the radar of investors seeking reliable platforms with room for expansion. 3. Polkadot Enables a Future of Interconnected Blockchains Polkadot is gaining traction for its unique approach to blockchain interoperability. Its multi-chain technology allows different blockchains to communicate and share data, creating an interconnected ecosystem that benefits developers and users alike. This innovation addresses one of the biggest challenges in the cryptocurrency space: the lack of seamless communication between networks. Polkadot’s parachain auctions and expanding ecosystem continue to generate excitement in the crypto community. With projects and applications thriving within its network, Polkadot positions itself as a long-term player with significant potential. Why this coin made it to this list: Polkadot’s groundbreaking technology and expanding influence make it a solid option for investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now. 4.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 03:23:00

Moreover, Remittix is attracting significant attention with projections of a 2,000% gain this quarter with insiders believing it could surpass top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) in ROI potential. Interestingly, Remittix is transforming world payments with its creative ideas while Solana notes positive breakouts and Ripple inches near expected price milestones. Read on to find out why analysts favour Remittix over Solana and Ripple. Solana (SOL) Records Bullish Breakout Showing amazing resilience despite recent bearish trends, Solana is still among the promising altcoins to watch this quarter. As CoinMarketCap data shows, the Solana price has jumped more than 12% over the previous week, breaking out from the consolidation between $200 and $182. Although the Solana price dropped more than 10% in the previous month, community sentiment is still bullish and investors are expectant of a robust comeback. Though trading more than 20% below its all-time high (ATH) of $263, Solana’s future is still bright; many anticipate a possible retest of its ATH this Q1. The Solana price chart, which shows the altcoin respecting a bullish trendline over the past year, accentuates the hope even further. The technical indicators —buy signals from the Moving Averages and MACD—are suggestive of bullish momentum developing. Though some short-term volatility may still be in action, the Momentum Oscillator and CCI are flashing sell signals on the Solana price chart, hence caution is advised. Will Ripple (XRP) Hit New Heights in 2025? Rising by more than 10% , the Ripple price has recovered during the previous week from the $2 support zone. This upward trend drove the Ripple price to the $2.4 resistance, therefore restoring investor hope. The XRP community is still somewhat optimistic even though the past month was bearish and the Ripple price chart shows a drop of almost 5%. Driven by the expected altcoin season, analysts are sure that XRP is one of the top altcoins that could rally beyond its all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 in 2025. For Ripple (XRP), technical signals show a mixed picture. The Momentum Oscillator, MACD, and Moving Averages on the Ripple price chart exhibit strong purchase signs; the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) advises caution with sell signals. Still, the long run is bright since many XRP holders are looking forward to the much-awaited $10 mark. Ripple (XRP) keeps proving to be among the promising altcoins to watch for the next significant rally as investor sentiment remains strong. Remittix (RTX) Is Transforming Global Payments Remittix provides businesses with a smooth approach to including cryptocurrencies in their payment systems. Easy access to the user-friendly Remittix Pay API helps companies facilitate quick, safe, and affordable transactions. The creative Remittix Checkout solution also lets businesses take crypto payments for goods and services free from direct wallet transaction costs. Moreover, Remittix is leading in the PayFi market as this innovative solution offers unmatched flexibility allowing users to cash out in more than 50 crypto pairs and over 30 fiat currencies. Currently valued at just $0.0172 during its presale, the deflationary RTX coin forms the core of this groundbreaking platform. RTX is among the best cryptos to invest in for explosive future gains given the limited supply and growing demand for cross-border crypto solutions. As companies and individuals start using Remittix’s safe, quick, open payment systems, analysts estimate a huge growth for the platform. Meanwhile, Remittix has great potential in the rapidly expanding PayFi market whether your business is trying to modernize payment systems or you are an investor looking for high-growth prospects. Remittix (RTX) Is Set To Outpace Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) Although Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) display potential for notable gains, Remittix’s (RTX) revolutionary ideas in worldwide payments along with its cheap presale value of merely $0.0172 set it out among the top cryptocurrencies. Far faster than its rivals, analysts estimate a meteoric 2,000% increase in Q1 2025. RTX has unparalleled potential in the vibrant PayFi sector, whether your company is ready to welcome innovative payment options or you are a smart investor looking for high ROI. Early adoption of Remittix could be your pass to amazing gains in this altcoin season as demand for cross-border crypto solutions increases.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted several critical metrics that could signal further bullish momentum for the leading cryptocurrency as the market begins to recover. Bitcoin Price Surges Amid Coinbase Premium Index Low One of the significant indicators discussed by Martinez is the Coinbase Premium Index, which recently hit -0.23%, its lowest point in two years. This index measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges. A negative premium suggests that US-based investors may be less willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin, but the current rebound could indicate a shift toward growing institutional interest in the asset. Related Reading: Prepare For A Solana Sell-Off: How Grayscale’s 2025 Unlocks Could Shake The Market Martinez also noted that the recent uptick in the Bitcoin price comes amid a notable withdrawal trend, with over 48,000 BTC—valued at more than $4.5 billion—pulled from exchanges in the past week. This trend indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, despite a brief price correction that occurred late last year. Despite these positive signals, Martinez cautions that Bitcoin is at a crucial juncture. He emphasized the importance of sustaining a close above the 50-day moving average (MA), currently just above $96,000. A failure to maintain this level could lead to a potential downward correction. Conversely, a sustained close above the 50-day MA could signal the end of the recent correction and confirm a more robust bullish trend. Strong Upward Move Expected After Wave Three Breakout In addition to Martinez’s insights, the Elliot Wave Academy has provided a technical analysis of the recent Bitcoin price movements, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is currently in the fourth wave of a larger bullish cycle. The academy’s analysis indicates that after a powerful breakout from a price channel, Bitcoin has successfully surpassed the ideal level of wave three, which may signal a strong upward move. The fourth wave, according to their analysis, is characterized by a sideways pattern following the sharp rise of wave three. The potential correction zones for this wave have been identified, and should these levels be breached, the next upward wave could target a Bitcoin price range between $117,475.70 and $138,058.37. These figures represent major bullish targets that could attract further investment and drive Bitcoin’s price higher. Related Reading: Dogecoin Recovery In Sight: Strong Support Hints At Bullish 2025 All around, as the Bitcoin price continues its upward trajectory, the combination of significant withdrawals from exchanges, a low Coinbase Premium Index, and positive Elliott Wave analysis paints a compelling picture for the cryptocurrency’s future. However, investors should remain vigilant, keeping an eye on critical price levels that could determine the market’s next move. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is trading at $98,320.

The firm explained in a statement that it plans to obtain the perpetual preferred stock by converting its class A common stock, paying a cash dividend, redeeming shares, or a combination of these. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is exploring various strategies to ensure adequate funds for crypto purchase MicroStrategy is exploring different strategies to raise money for its Bitcoin stocking endeavor. It is currently planning to raise $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income instruments. This plan has been implemented recently, leading to a sustained Bitcoin buying spree through senior convertible notes and debt. The perpetual preferred stock offering, the latest strategy the firm is exploring to strengthen its balance sheet and acquire more Bitcoin, will begin implementation in Q1 2025. Yet MicroStrategy explained that it reserves the rights and has the sole authority to choose whether to proceed with and consummate the offering based on market status and other conditions. The perpetual preferred stock offering is among the most privileged MicroStrategy class A common stock. If the company faces bankruptcy or liquidation, its holders will be given priority. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserve is valued at $43.9 billion According to Bitcoin Treasuries , the business intelligence firm has 446,400 Bitcoins in its reserve, valued at $43.9 billion. In 2024, the firm improved its Bitcoin purchasing power, acquiring 257,250 BTC, making it the highest-buying year ever. The statistics show that the firm’s 446,400 Bitcoins were bought at an average price of $62,500. This implies that MicroStrategy is up 57.2% on its Bitcoin investment. Michael Saylor, the firm’s executive chairman and co-founder, initiated the Bitcoin investment strategy, paving the way for corporate Bitcoin adoption worldwide. The co-founder’s Bitcoin strategy has positively impacted MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares. The shares have surged 13.2% on Jan. 3 to $339.6, which translates to a 438% rise from last year. MSTR has marginally fallen 0.19% since the firm’s perpetual preferred stock offering plan was announced in after-hours.

BTFD Coin is making waves with its explosive presale success, drawing attention from seasoned investors and crypto newcomers alike. Meanwhile, Neiro and Degen are redefining the potential of meme coins, pushing boundaries in gaming and utility. The synergy of these projects is creating massive buzz, with investors scrambling to snag their slice of the pie before these tokens hit the big leagues. Meme coins, once seen as playful novelties, have matured into serious investment opportunities. Over the years, we’ve witnessed projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu climb astronomical heights. Now, BTFD Coin is taking this trend further with its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, lucrative staking rewards, and a robust community-centric approach. With meme coins proving their staying power, January 2025 is the month to pick your winners. Let’s dive into the top contenders. BTFD Coin: Leading the Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin is not just another token; it’s a movement. Short for “Buy the F***ing Dip,” this coin is the epitome of riding market waves with confidence. BTFD’s presale performance has been nothing short of phenomenal, raising over $4.8 million so far and selling over 62 billion coins to more than 7000 holders. Starting at just $0.000004, the current presale price has soared to $0.000142 in Stage 13. Post-presale, analysts predict a listing price of $0.0006, which spells incredible gains for savvy investors. The appeal of BTFD goes beyond numbers. Its ecosystem features a captivating P2E game where players earn rewards while immersing themselves in a vibrant community. BTFD Coin has launched the full version of its P2E Game, which allows users to play and earn through it. Add a referral program and staking rewards into the mix, and it’s clear why BTFD is stealing the spotlight. This blend of fun, profit, and community power sets BTFD apart in a crowded market. Neiro: Revolutionising Utility in Meme Coins Neiro isn’t your run-of-the-mill meme coin. It’s carving a niche by seamlessly blending artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. While meme coins often rely on hype, Neiro’s foundation is rooted in innovation. The coin’s flagship product, an AI-driven content generator, has become a favourite among digital creators and marketers, offering them tools to enhance productivity and creativity. Unlike many meme coins that fade after their initial buzz, Neiro’s utility ensures longevity. Its staking mechanism, paired with AI-enhanced insights, allows users to maximise their holdings. The team’s commitment to transparency and development has fostered trust, making Neiro a serious contender in the meme coin space. Neiro’s market trajectory is equally impressive. Its presale phases saw steady growth, with its value increasing tenfold since its inception. Analysts are bullish, projecting continued momentum into 2025. For those seeking a meme coin with substance, Neiro’s combination of technology and community appeal makes it a must-watch. Degen: The Meme Coin Gaming Powerhouse Degen is taking meme coins into uncharted territory with its immersive gaming ecosystem. Known for its catchphrase “Degen life,” this token appeals to crypto enthusiasts who live for the thrill. But Degen’s not just about vibes—it’s delivering tangible gaming experiences that are drawing in hordes of players and investors. The centrepiece of Degen’s appeal is its multiplayer battle arena game, where players can earn Degen tokens while competing for glory. It’s a high-energy mix of entertainment and financial incentives. Add to that its NFT marketplace, and you’ve got a project with serious staying power. Players can trade in-game assets, boosting both engagement and the coin’s utility. Degen’s presale journey has been equally thrilling.

Once that’s done, input the amount of BTFD you’d like to buy, review the price, and hit “Buy Now.” Confirm the transaction in your wallet, and you’re all set. Easy as pie, right? Why Meme Coins Thrive in Economic Chaos The global economy has always been a rollercoaster. Take the 1973 crash, for instance. While it rattled markets worldwide, savvy investors used the chaos to their advantage, scooping up undervalued assets. The lesson? Buying the dip can turn turmoil into opportunity. Meme coins like BTFD, Neiro, and Degen thrive in such environments. Their community-driven nature and potential for high returns make them attractive during market downturns. In 2024, as traditional markets waver, meme coins are proving to be a beacon for investors seeking alternative opportunities. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Degen represent the best meme coins to hold in January 2025. Each brings unique strengths to the table—from BTFD’s presale success and innovative ecosystem to Neiro’s tech-driven utility and Degen’s gaming revolution.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 04:08:00

This week, Fartcoin hit an all-time high (ATH) of $1.60, following a remarkable 70% rally. Despite the excitement, some analysts predict a possible pullback before the next big surge. Fartcoin Hits New ATH Fartcoin, known for its humor-driven branding and ties to viral trends, stands out as a Solana meme coin with a loyal community. While it doesn’t have standout features, its price performance has been exceptional. Since its launch in October, the token’s value has skyrocketed, growing 700% in just one month and pushing its market cap to $1.48 billion. Adding to the momentum, Coinglass data shows that Open Interest (OI) for Fartcoin surged 22% this week, reaching $182.4 million. This influx of interest has been a key driver behind the recent price rally. AI Meme Coins Are Taking Over As traditional meme coins like DOGE and SHIB struggle to regain their past success, newer tokens like Fartcoin and AI16Z are gaining the spotlight. AI16Z, another Solana-based token, saw a huge 176% price surge in a week and now has a market cap of $2.17 billion. Fartcoin is currently the fifth-largest AI meme coin on Solana Network, and if the bullish trend continues, it could join AI16Z in the $2 billion market cap club. Other AI-themed tokens, like Freysa AI (93% growth) and Zerebro (82% growth), are also making strong gains. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DOGE Whale’s $145 Million Bet on Dogecoin, What’s Next? , Can Fartcoin Reach $2?

Analysts believe the token could reach $2 if it continues to break key resistance levels around $1.67. However, its current position above the Bollinger Bands Indicator suggests it may be overbought, indicating a potential price correction. And, if buyers stay strong, the token might reach $2.

As the flagship crypto retests key levels, some analyst shared their predictions for the 2025 bull market and BTC’s performance. Related Reading: Solana-Based Pump.Fun Records $15 Million Daily Revenue As Memecoin Mania Continues Bitcoin Correction Close To An End? Over the last three days, Bitcoin has slowly climbed back to the $96,000 level, briefly trading near the $98,000 mark on Thursday afternoon. Last week, the flagship crypto lost this key range, failing to reclaim it for six days. This zone served as a crucial bounce point since mid-November. However, the New Year recovery sent BTC’s price up nearly 5%, with Bitcoin trading above $96,000 for the past day. Some crypto analysts previously suggested that reclaiming the $97,300 support zone is crucial to reverse BTC’s short-term bearish trend. This level was retested yesterday for the first time in over a week but failed to hold. Despite this, crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that week 9 of its post-halving “Parabolic Upside Phase” is “slowly ending,” suggesting that BTC’s correction will likely be over soon. The analyst explained Bitcoin enters a parabolic period that lasts around 300 days each cycle after every Halving event. Historically, BTC registers the first major retrace a month after entering price discovery mode. The first “Price Discovery Correction” starts between Weeks 6 and 8 of each parabolic phase and sees pullbacks by at least 25%. This cycle, Bitcoin’s retrace started on Week 7 and saw a 15% correction, which some analysts suggest is due to the trend of smaller corrections. Rekt Capital stated that “once Bitcoin clears its historically corrective weeks,” the flagship crypto will offer plenty of reasons to be bullish. Similarly, the analyst pointed out that BTC’s peak will likely come this year, followed by the “very beginnings of a brand new bear market.” However, he explained that most of the bear market will occur next year, lasting “some 365+ days and be between -65% to -80% deep.” BTC To Perform Well In Q1 Daan crypto trades highlighted that Bitcoin has been “chopping around the $100K level for 6 weeks now, we’ve built up a good amount of liquidity in this area.” He added that from the $100,000 mark and above, “there should be plenty of fuel to propel this higher.” Moreover, the trader noted that BTC is “trading right around the high volume node. Meaning, most volume was traded between these prices. Generally, price moves easier when its able to break away from such a high volume area. The 4H 200MA is guarding that breaking on the top side. The 4H 200EMA below is offering support.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $95,000 Amid 4.2% Surge, Is A New Year Rebound Coming? Daan asserted that a break above the $98,000 mark could “get the party started and start the run back to the all-time highs,” while holding the $95,000 support zone key in the short term. Ultimately, he considers there will be “an interesting race between BTC and ETH this quarter,” as the market’s performance during Q1 is usually “pretty positive.” Based on this historical performance, the trader expects the leading cryptocurrencies to perform well throughout the start of the year. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,071, a 1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD trading above $97,000 as the U.S. session began. Following a rapid start to the new year and a retest of $96,000 as support, Bitcoin aimed to reclaim the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). At $96,740 at the time of writing, the 50-day SMA previously acted as support for over two months before being lost in late December. “Nice follow-through on the falling wedge breakout,” trading account SuperBro noted on X. “Careful not to get aggressive with longs into potential resistance, now we need to reclaim the 20 and 50 SMA and flip these back to support.” Other analysts anticipated that the trendline could regain its role as support, potentially fueling a continued bull run after last month’s cooldown. On shorter timeframes, however, trader Roman advised caution. “I think some of you are getting excited a bit too early,” he commented, analyzing four-hour charts. “We’ve got a low-volume pump with maxed stoch RSI. Generally means we come down a bit.” The stochastic relative strength index (RSI) exceeded the overbought 70 threshold, signaling potential short-term exhaustion. Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades highlighted the 200-period SMA on the four-hour chart as a critical resistance level, with the 200-period EMA providing support. “Trading right around the high volume node. Meaning, most volume traded between these prices,” Daan explained on X. “Price moves easier when it breaks away from such a high volume area. The 4H 200MA is guarding the top side. I want to see this break above $98K+ to get the party started and start the run back to all-time highs. $95K is an important level to hold in the short term.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 04:33:00

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 05:02:00

The top five protocols on Solana now hold more than a billion dollars in TVL (total value locked)—individually, highlighting the growth of the ecosystem. While bridges and aggregators have improved connectivity, there’s still a gap in providing a more seamless experience for users and developers looking to operate across both Solana and EVM ecosystems. LI.FI steps in to address this, providing a unified API that simplifies multi-chain interactions. As more users and apps seek smoother cross-chain experiences, the need for reducing operational complexity becomes essential. Let’s see how LI.FI bridges this gap. Making Solana Apps Multi-Chain Ready At LI.FI, we recognize the growing need for deeper integration between Solana and the EVM ecosystem. As Solana continues to scale, the connection between its apps and EVM users remains somewhat fragmented. Here’s how we are addressing these challenges and simplifying cross-chain interactions for both developers and users. The Solana-EVM Disconnect Solana apps, while gaining traction, face challenges in attracting EVM users due to the complicated cross-chain experience. The EVM ecosystem, being one of the largest in the blockchain space, offers a vast pool of users, liquidity, and opportunities for growth. For Solana apps to expand their reach and tap into these broader user bases, it’s essential to connect with EVM users. This not only helps with user acquisition but also improves liquidity and enhances the overall value of the Solana ecosystem. However, users moving assets between Solana and EVM chains often need to switch between multiple interfaces — such as separate bridges and DEXs. For example, a user might have to first bridge their tokens using a dedicated bridging platform, then swap those tokens on an EVM-based DEX, all of which adds extra steps and complexity. This fragmented process creates friction, discouraging frequent cross-chain interactions. Likewise, Solana-native users encounter similar issues when trying to interact with EVM apps. The process of moving assets between the chains, navigating different interfaces, and handling transaction fees in multiple currencies adds friction, discouraging regular cross-chain engagement. This fragmentation limits the fluidity of fund transfers and the overall user experience across ecosystems. How LI.FI ’s API Bridges the Gap Our API provides a single, streamlined integration that enables Solana apps to manage both swaps and bridging in one process. By automating cross-chain transactions, we simplify the entire flow, reducing complexity for both developers and users. For developers, adding multi-chain functionality often requires integrating multiple bridges, liquidity sources, and protocols, which increases development time and maintenance overhead. With the LI.FI API, once integrated, developers gain instant access to over 30+ chains and 18+ bridges, significantly reducing the time and effort needed to support cross-chain features. As we continue to add more chains and bridges, developers no longer need to worry about manually integrating new platforms or maintaining those connections. For users, this means they can swap assets within Solana or bridge them to any supported chain directly within the app without switching between different platforms. This reduces friction, keeps users engaged, and ensures that transactions remain fluid and straightforward. In addition to simplifying cross-chain transactions, they are also preparing to bring **Zaps** to Solana. Zaps bundle multi-step processes—such as staking, adding liquidity, and swapping—into a single action. Already available on other chains, Zaps will soon be available on Solana, making complex actions more efficient and user-friendly for your users. Key Integrations for Cross-Chain Liquidity To ensure seamless cross-chain functionality, LIFI’s integrated with major infrastructure providers within Solana’s ecosystem: Jupiter : Offering DEX aggregation to provide the best possible swap rates within the Solana ecosystem, ensuring users always get optimal pricing. Mayan and Allbridge : Enabling efficient bridging of assets between Solana and EVM chains, making cross-chain transfers more reliable and straightforward. Circle CCTP : Facilitating stablecoin transfers across chains, improving liquidity flow, and ensuring assets move smoothly between ecosystems. These integrations enable us to deliver reliable, smooth cross-chain transactions, empowering developers to offer users a seamless and optimized experience. We’re continuously working to add more bridges and DEX aggregators to further strengthen multi-chain support for the Solana ecosystem. In addition, they are already live on Phantom Wallet , Jumper Exchange , and Blockchain.com , enhancing user accessibility and interaction to support swaps and bridging to and from Solana. Unlocking New Possibilities for Developers and Users By integrating the LI.FI API, Solana apps can unlock several benefits: Developer Focus : Our unified API minimizes the need for managing multiple tools, allowing developers to focus on building their core features. Improved User Experience : Users benefit from an in-app experience that allows for cross-chain swaps and bridges without leaving the app. This keeps the process simple and intuitive. Expanded User Base : Simplifying the interaction between Solana and EVM chains opens the door for more EVM users to engage with Solana apps, broadening the potential user base. Revenue Streams : Developers can create new revenue opportunities by charging fees on cross-chain swaps. Access to Liquidity : With aggregated liquidity from various DEXs, bridges, and aggregators, we ensure that apps benefit from better liquidity, lower slippage, and efficient transactions. Conclusion As Solana apps continue to evolve, the ability to go multi-chain is no longer just an option—it’s becoming a necessity. LI.FI simplifies this process, enabling Solana apps to expand beyond their native chain, tap into new user bases, and access broader liquidity, all while enhancing the user experience. If you’re looking to take your Solana app to the next level, explore the possibilities with LI.FI and unlock new opportunities for growth.

It’s a place where fortunes are made and lost in the span of a single tweet, where nerds and visionaries wrestle for dominance, and where meme coins like Punisher Coin ($PUN) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), alongside powerhouses like Solana (SOL), are rewriting the rules of engagement. I’m not here to talk about Bitcoin or Ethereum, the old gods of this strange digital pantheon. No, the real action is in the trenches of the altcoin wars, where creativity and insanity collide. And in this swirling maelstrom, Punisher Coin rises like a phoenix: half superhero, half internet troll, all potential. Meme Coins – The Madness of Crowd Mentality Let’s start with the obvious: meme coins are ridiculous. They’re jokes. They’re memes. They’re… well, not supposed to work. But then, neither was Dogecoin. $46 billion later, here we are. The thing about memes is that they’re sticky. They spread like wildfire. And when combined with blockchain technology, they become something altogether more powerful: a community. Shiba Inu capitalized on this by building an ecosystem around its brand. With Shibarium and a growing utility narrative, SHIB is one of the few meme coins pushing the boundaries of what this category can achieve. Its market cap of $12.6 billion makes it the 14th largest in the entire industry. The Rise and Rise of Solana Solana embodies the crypto space’s relentless pursuit of performance. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Solana has become a hub for NFTs, DeFi, and now meme coins like the soon-to-launch Punisher Coin. The blockchain’s scalability makes it an ideal home for projects that demand both speed and efficiency, solidifying its position as one of the leading players in the altcoin market. Why 2025 is Punisher Coin’s Year Punisher Coin is a high-stakes experiment in engagement. Its Mean Meme Machine transforms internet humor into NFTs, giving creators ownership and value in a way that feels refreshingly democratic. Meanwhile, the War Room Telegram group creates a space where token holders can steer the project’s direction while enjoying perks like airdrops and exclusive merch. The marketing is equally audacious, with plans for flamethrower spectacles and Tesla Cybertruck destruction. It’s the kind of boldness that gets people talking, and in crypto, attention is half the battle. The Bigger Picture What makes Punisher Coin, Shiba Inu, and Solana compelling isn’t just their features, it’s mostly their ability to capture the cultural zeitgeist while driving innovation. They represent the best of crypto culture: playful yet ambitious, chaotic yet oddly purposeful. Crypto isn’t about its technology; it’s about people, stories, and the insane, beautiful chaos that comes when the two collide. Whether it’s the next big thing or just another chapter in this wild market, Punisher Coin is staking its claim in the future of crypto.

Avalanche (AVAX) also had a 49% net increase, leaving much to be desired, and also ended the year on a negative with a 4% dip over December. The question among holders now is whether Trump’s administration is likely to catalyze Ethereum and Avalanche’s growth. Meanwhile, a newer player on the scene, Lunex Network, is quickly amassing popularity for its modern offering of trader perks and low gas fees for users. So how will these projects fare in 2025 and under Trump’s guidance? Ethereum Focuses On Technical Progress In 2024 Ethereum (ETH) has not performed as well as in previous years, and December saw a 4% dip to bring an end to a slow year for the project. While Ethereum (ETH) could benefit from a more favorable regulatory climate under Trump, the Ethereum (ETH) developers have also been making updates that should provide long term benefits. Most notably, Ethereum (ETH) has massively improved its energy efficiency as a network. In addition, The introduction of the Dencun upgrade, which incorporates proto-danksharding, has significantly enhanced data availability on the Ethereum network while reducing transaction costs. Between these timely updates and changing political influences, Ethereum might see a revival in 2025. Avalanche Improves Scalability with Avalanche9000 Even with a 5% net decline through 2024, Avalanche (AVAX) now appears poised for growth in 2025. As of January 2nd, Avalanche (AVAX) jumped 8% in the last 24 hours. The past year saw Avalanche (AVAX) deliver a multitude of updates that have received a lot of positive attention. The Avalanche 9000 upgrade made major improvements to the network’s flexibility and scalability. This upgrade solidifies Avalanche’s position as an ideal platform for developers building intelligent and scalable decentralized applications. Lunex Network Offers Ultimate Trading Efficiency Lunex Network ($LNEX) is a new but promising protocol that offers users a powerful suite of tools to benefit from while trading. It also sports a powerful but simple mobile exchange app that enables users to trade in real time. It also provides access to market data and facilitates frictionless swaps on over 50,000 assets. Low transaction fees make the platform ideal for active investors who want to make frequent trades. Another strength of Lunex Network ($LNEX) is its portfolio tracker, which differentiates itself from other trackers by allowing the monitoring of ETFs and stocks, as well as cryptocurrencies. This makes Lunex Network an indispensable tool for professional traders with broad portfolios, as it gives a clear and easily absorbable snapshot of their financial health at any given time. For privacy-conscious traders, Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) offering is second to none. The platform does away with know-your-customer (KYC) verification and does not impose a requirement for third-party wallet connections. Such measures protect users from the risk of data breaches and safeguard private information, making Lunex Network ($LNEX) the obvious choice for those who want to conduct their crypto dealings in anonymity. Lunex Network Draws Investor Interest Currently priced at a ripe $0.0052 per token, $LNEX is bringing in investors in droves who are eager to capitalize on its potential. Its offering stands out against other protocols with modern touches such as its privacy-centric features and intelligently designed tokenomic approach. Analysts predict an impressive 1,800% increase in token value by the time of the launch, making this an unmissable opportunity for crypto enthusiasts.

The asset has experienced an impressive 11% surge, propelling its value to approximately $2.42, a level it had not seen since late 2024’s price correction. Analysts Predict XRP Could Reach $5.85 As Market Confidence Grows This resurgence has positioned XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency in the market, with a market capitalization of around $139 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Notably, it has surpassed the market cap of Tether (USDT), which stands at $137 billion. The recent rally in XRP’s price can be attributed in part to a broader shift in market sentiment following the election of President Donald Trump on November 5. Trump’s victory has sparked renewed confidence in the digital asset industry, leading to increased optimism among investors. This sentiment shift seems to have catalyzed a wave of buying activity within the crypto market, benefiting not only XRP but also other digital assets. Related Reading: Prepare For A Solana Sell-Off: How Grayscale’s 2025 Unlocks Could Shake The Market Crypto analysts have taken notice of this trend. DarkDefender, a prominent figure in the crypto analysis community, observed that XRP’s price trajectory has been impressive. After hovering around $2.11, XRP broke through its initial resistance at $2.22 and reached as high as $2.44. DarkDefender highlighted $2.42 as a critical resistance level that has now been updated as a new support level. According to his analysis, if XRP can breach the $2.67 to $2.72 range, it could pave the way for a significant upward movement, targeting as high as $5.85. This potential rise would represent an extraordinary 141% increase from its current price, marking a new all-time high for the token. Elliott Wave Theory Points To Potential $10 Target Adding to the optimism, another analyst, known as CryptoinsightUK, has weighed in on XRP’s potential trajectory suggesting that if XRP follows a measured move similar to its previous price leg, it could “easily surpass $10.” Drawing from Elliott Wave Theory, which posits that market trends move in waves, he argues that if XRP enters a “wave 3” scenario—often the most substantial in terms of price movement—the asset could exceed $10. CryptoinsightUK notes that many investors are targeting the $8 mark, a figure he considers reasonable based on various metrics. By analyzing the price movements and potential gains, the analyst suggests that the future of the altcoin looks bright, with many indicators pointing towards substantial growth.

Trading at $2.42, the XRP price shows a 2% increase over the past 24 hours. Regarding trading volume, CoinGecko data indicates a decrease of almost 42%, totaling $5.6 billion.

The asset has closed down the gap to $0.4, but analysts continue to highlight $1 as a potential target during this bull cycle. DOGEUSD. Source: TradingView Shortly after Donald Trump won the US elections at the start of November, DOGE’s price went on a wild run due to Elon Musk’s upcoming role under the new administration and his rich history and support for the largest meme coin. The asset skyrocketed by triple digits within weeks and peaked at almost $0.5. However, it started to lose traction in December and plunged hard during the mid-month correction. In a matter of days, Dogecoin dumped from over $0.41 to $0.26. It reacted well after this substantial decline and pushed to $0.35 almost immediately. However, it failed to rally further and remained in a tight range of $0.31 and $0.34 for weeks. The landscape changed, though, for the entire market in the past few days. The situation around DOGE became particularly promising due to the larger number of coins accumulated by whales during this correction and consolidation phase. As such, it didn’t take long for the OG meme coin to surge in value. On a 24-hour scale alone, DOGE has shot up by 16% and now trades well above $0.39 after breaking above the $0.34 resistance. It’s up by 25% on a weekly scale and sits close to $0.4. Analysts have used this opportunity to double down on their $1 prediction for the asset, which is yet to be reached. Nevertheless, DOGE would need to more than double its current valuation to tap such a high price target. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to track Dogecoin’s performance in the following weeks, especially after Trump’s inauguration on January 20 and Musk’s D.O.G.E. department .

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN.

The current price action for XRP continues to follow a triangle pattern, which suggests the possibility of higher prices in the short term. There has been no confirmed top within this structure yet, and the overall analysis still points to the formation of an Elliott Wave triangle. A potential scenario involves one more higher low before the next significant upward movement in wave five. The Ongoing Correction and Market Structure Since topping at around $2.90 a month ago, the market has been in a correction. This correction is unfolding in a series of three waves up and three waves down, typical of a corrective phase. While a direct breakout is possible, the most probable scenario suggests one more higher low, forming part of the Elliott Wave triangle pattern. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch The support area for XRP is defined by the Fibonacci retracement levels, located between $2.28 and $2.27. This zone is where the price could find weak support before the next move. Importantly, the primary invalidation point for this structure is a break below $1.95, the previous swing low from December 20th. To invalidate the triangle to the upside, XRP would need to break above $2.70. A breakout above this level would signal a continuation of the bullish trend, but the market would still test all-time highs as long as it holds above $1.95. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Expert Believes Atkins Won’t Dismiss Case, Settlements Likely , Outlook for XRP: Higher Prices Likely, but Caution is Key While there are no minimum requirements for the E-wave, it is possible to see a shallow correction, similar to previous triangles in XRP’s history. The focus remains on higher prices, and the resistance levels to watch are at $2.55, $2.62, and potentially $2.72. A break above the $2.72 level could lead to the next phase of price discovery, possibly testing the previous all-time high around $3.30. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This bullish momentum continues to signal growing confidence among investors, particularly high-net-worth individuals. Notably, Bitcoin whales, typically known for “buying the dip,” have flipped the script, scooping up massive quantities of BTC during its price highs. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this development, revealing that Whales acquired over 70,000 BTC within 48 hours. This staggering investment, valued at over $7.28 billion, underscores the conviction of big-money investors in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Elsewhere, Despite Bitcoin’s impressive price action, large holders are showing no signs of offloading their assets, according to CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain. In a recent post, the pundit highlighted the Realized profit ratio data, which tracks wallet activity across various size ranges (10-100 BTC, 100-1,000 BTC, and 1,000-10,000 BTC), noting it suggests that whales believe Bitcoin has yet to reach its peak in this market cycle. “Compared to the all-time high (ATH) in previous cycles, it seems that the selling and profit-taking process by whales has not yet begun. This may indicate that, according to the whales, we are still not at the ATH range for this cycle.” He wrote. That said, the heightened whale activity coincides with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, the business intelligence giant led by Michael Saylor , announced earlier this week its latest addition of 15,350 BTC to its holdings, boosting its total reserves to 439,000 BTC. Mining companies have also joined the accumulation trend, with firms like Marathon Digital increasingly holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, broader corporate adoption remains minimal. For instance, only 0.55% of Microsoft shareholders recently supported a proposal to create a Bitcoin reserve, and a similar initiative at Amazon saw just 0.01% approval. According to OKG Research, a mere 0.01% of global public companies currently hold Bitcoin, highlighting the untapped potential for institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s recent surge is supported by shifting macroeconomic conditions. With inflation fears lingering, skepticism toward traditional financial markets growing, and potential central bank rate cuts anticipated in 2024, Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge asset has gained renewed traction. Notably, the digital scarcity of Bitcoin, combined with its decentralized nature, makes it an attractive store of value for institutional investors seeking alternatives to fiat currencies. Regulatory clarity in key markets, including the United States, has further fueled confidence among investors. Additionally, speculation around the potential approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is driving anticipation of broader institutional participation. As momentum builds, analysts are setting bold price targets for Bitcoin. On Monday, Bitfinex researchers forecasted a peak price of $200,000 for Bitcoin during the second half of 2025, driven by increasing institutional adoption and diminishing speculative volatility. At press time, BTC was trading at $98,095, reflecting a 1.37% surge in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-04 06:13:12

Finance Expert Says the Train Has Left the Station, XRP Destination Is Mars",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-100-finance-expert-says-the-train-has-left-the-station-xrp-destination-is-mars/,"Renowned financial analyst and wealth mentor Linda Jones has weighed in on XRP’s recent performance, describing the cryptocurrency’s momentum as unstoppable. Reflecting on its recent surge, Jones remarked , “The XRP train has left the station,” suggesting that the opportunity to buy at lower prices may have passed. Jones is optimistic that XRP could surpass its all-time high in the current bull run. While she did not provide specific short-term price targets, her confidence aligns with the sentiment of many XRP supporters that closely watch its upward trajectory. XRP Outshines Market Rivals XRP’s performance has set it apart as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the current market rally. After dropping below $2, the asset has surged to $2.41, marking a 4% increase in the past 24 hours. In contrast, other leading cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Binance Coin have seen less than 2%. At its peak, XRP reached an intraday high of $2.44, a 23% rebound from its two-day low of $1.99. This strong recovery has solidified XRP’s position as a market leader and captured the attention of analysts and investors. Short-Term Predictions for XRP Market analysts have provided various projections for XRP’s potential growth. Some believe that XRP could reach the $4 to $5 range in the near term, representing a 100% gain from its current price. However, they also caution that XRP may face resistance before consolidating and preparing for its next move. Ben Armstrong, popularly known as BitBoy, a well-known cryptocurrency enthusiast, has taken a more ambitious stance. He speculated that XRP could challenge Ethereum’s dominance in market capitalization during this bull run. However, for XRP to overtake Ethereum, a significant price surge would be required. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum’s market cap currently stands at $410 billion, while XRP’s is $137 billion, leaving a gap of $273 billion. To close this gap, XRP’s price would need to rise to approximately $7.20, requiring a 200% increase from its current level. Long-Term Outlook for XRP In addition to short-term expectations, many analysts and XRP supporters are considering the asset’s long-term potential. Linda Jones expressed a bold view, suggesting that XRP could eventually reach $100. However, she clarified that this milestone will unlikely occur during the current market cycle. XRP’s recent surge and market-leading performance have reinforced its reputation as a prominent cryptocurrency. As the asset continues to climb, many are optimistic about its potential for short-term gains and long-term growth.

He sees it as a valuable long-term asset and has made it a central part of MicroStrategy’s strategy. Despite the ups and downs of the market, MicroStrategy’s focus on expanding its Bitcoin reserves remains strong. The timing is perfect as Trump’s aggressive push towards Bitcoin Reserve plan may give tough competition to Microstrategy later. MicroStrategy’s “21/21 Plan This plan is part of MicroStrategy’s “21/21 Plan ,” a bold strategy to raise $21 billion through stocks and another $21 billion through loans and other financial tools over three years. Since starting this plan in October 2024, the company has already bought 194,180 Bitcoin—almost halfway to its goal. These Bitcoins are currently worth $19 billion. As of January 3, 2025, MicroStrategy owns 446,400 Bitcoin, valued at about $43.7 billion. This massive holding has earned the company unrealized gains of $16 billion. Impressively, MicroStrategy’s stock, MSTR, performed better than Bitcoin itself in 2024 and was recently added to the Nasdaq index. The new $2 billion stock offering is expected to happen in early 2025, depending on market conditions. At the same time, MicroStrategy is asking shareholders to approve increasing the number of shares it can issue. This includes raising its common stock limit from 330 million to 10.3 billion and its preferred stock limit from 5 million to 1 billion. A shareholder meeting will be held to discuss these changes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Adoption Set to Skyrocket as 13 U.S. States Explore Strategic Reserves , Raising Capital for Bitcoin Acquisitions By raising more money and buying more Bitcoin, MicroStrategy is doubling down on its belief in the future of cryptocurrency. To support its Bitcoin buying strategy, MicroStrategy recently filed with the SEC to seek approval for issuing billions of new shares. The proposal aims to increase the company’s Class A common shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and its preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion.

This time, it is Fidelity’s FBTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) that’s leading the charge scooping 3,640 BTC yesterday. Furthermore, BTC price is approaching $100K once again with on-chain indicators hinting at bottom formation. Moreover, the liquidation data shows traders and investors have a mixed outlook on Donald Trump’s inauguration day as both long and short liquidations are balanced. This uncertainty can also be observed in daily Bitcoin ETF flows. US Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume Again In Strong Reversal After big outflows earlier this week, the US Bitcoin ETFs staged a strong reversal with nearly $900 million in inflows on Friday. As per Farside Investors data , Fidelity’s FBTC recorded the largest inflows yesterday among its peers at $357 million. After three consecutive days of outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT also saw a reversal with $252 million in inflows while Ark Invest’s ARKB saw $222 million. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, celebrated the strong reversal on Friday, after outflow from iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) a day earlier. IBIT rebounded strongly by attracting over $250 million in fresh inflows today. BlackRock’s IBIT hit massive milestones this year with more than $37 million in inflows and $53 million in net assets under management. Commenting on the overall ETF inflows, Geraci said: “That’s right… over $900 million. Just today,” adding that US spot Bitcoin ETFs have now accumulated approximately $700 million in net inflows since the beginning of the year. BTC On-Chain Metrics Show Strength On-chain data shows strength for Bitcoin hinting that the bulls are willing to look past the current correction. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reported a significant outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges over the past week. According to Martinez, more than 48,000 BTC valued at over $4.5 billion have been withdrawn during this period. Source: Ali Charts The substantial outflow signals a potential shift in market sentiment, with investors opting for self-custody or preparing for long-term holding. Usually, these massive withdrawals happen just before the strong move to the upside. The Coinbase Premium Index, a key indicator of institutional interest in Bitcoin, recently dropped to -0.23%, marking its lowest level in two years. However, the index has begun to rebound swiftly, signaling a resurgence in demand for Bitcoin among U.S.-based institutional investors. This narrative is further supported by inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Source: Ali Charts The Bitcoin community is now eagerly awaiting Donald Trump’s oath-taking ceremony on January 20. Traders believe that BTC can experience some volatility before the asset resumes its journey to $100K and beyond. “ Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki predicted Bitcoin price to hit $175K and $350K this year. As of press time, BTC price is trading at 1.25% up near $98,000, with a trading volume down 13%. Per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour liquidation has soared to $53 million with more than $33 million in short liquidations.

However, the SEC has continued to appeal the decision. In October, the SEC officially appealed the previous ruling on XRP. The SEC was not satisfied with the judge’s decision and took it to the appeals court. Now, Paul Atkins is set to replace Gary Gensler as the new SEC Chair. Atkins has been a critic of the tough approach, particularly his use of “regulation by enforcement,” which has been a point of controversy. Many are expecting that this strategy will come to an end under Atkins’ leadership. There is speculation that the SEC might start reducing or even dropping some of the current lawsuits, particularly those that are seen as frivolous or not involving fraud. However, in an interview with Thinking Crypto, Amanda Tuminelli from the DeFi Education Fund suggests that while dropping lawsuits completely might not be immediate, a shift in approach is likely. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For January 4 , Tuminelli believes the SEC may instead pursue favorable settlements, known as “consent decrees.” These allow both parties to negotiate a resolution while the court ensures the terms are carried out. This could offer a way to resolve cases without fully dropping them. She also hopes that these settlements could lead to clearer guidelines for the industry, possibly pushing the SEC to do more rulemaking or provide a clearer path for registration. This way, even without dropping the lawsuits, the industry could learn from the cases and better understand the SEC’s expectations. Conclusion: If a settlement or dismissal happens, XRP’s price is likely to rise, as this would improve market sentiment. If the SEC drops the appeal, it could signal a more friendly stance toward Ripple and the crypto industry. This is an important case to watch for both new and existing XRP holders. In short, under new leadership, the SEC might soften its aggressive stance, leading to more settlements and clearer regulations, though not necessarily dropping cases altogether. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Remittix Predicted To Go Viral In 2025,https://timestabloid.com/when-will-be-the-end-of-meme-season-remittix-predicted/,"The end of the meme season is drawing closer, with Shiba Inu and Dogwifhat struggling and many predicting that practical crypto solutions will soon take center stage. Remittix , offering real utility through instant crypto-to-fiat payments, is poised to gain massive attention. Industry experts say 2025 may be the platform’s breakout year, and a 40x rise is on the horizon for early backers. Remittix: A Game-Changer in Cross-Border Payments with Seamless Crypto-to-Fiat Solutions Cross-border payments are evolving as global users expect quicker, simpler, and cheaper remittance methods. The shift has spawned blockchain-based solutions like Remittix (RTX) , a decentralized PayFi platform that bridges the gap between cryptocurrency payments and fiat settlements. Remittix leverages blockchain to streamline fiat transactions, allowing users to convert up to 40 different cryptocurrencies into fiat instantly before transferring funds to banks worldwide. In contrast to services like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, Remittix is more seamless, and recipients never know crypto is involved. This makes it appealing for companies and individuals seeking a safe and fast cross-border payment option. Businesses, for example, can set up accounts and use the platform’s Pay API to accept crypto payments, instantly converting them into fiat. The immutable nature of transactions eliminates risks like chargebacks, ensuring smooth operations. With its blend of TradFi and DeFi features, Remittix has raised over $1 million in its ongoing presale campaign, with $RTX tokens going for $0.0172. With its cutting-edge approach and expanding support, Remittix might be the next big thing in cross-border payments. Shiba Inu Investors Hold Steady Amid Growing Futures Interest Shiba Inu’s price has stayed in a tight range in the last 2 weeks because the cryptocurrency sector struggled with bearish momentum. Yet several factors project a possible comeback for Shiba Inu. Notably, more Shiba Inu tokens are leaving exchanges—a clear signal that investors are opting to hold their coins for the long haul. The Shiba Inu balance on exchanges slipped by approximately 0.6% to 258.7 trillion SHIB last week, down from 260.3 trillion. This decline leaves just 25.87% of the total supply available on exchanges, a positive sign for the asset. The futures market also shows increased confidence in Shiba Inu. Open interest, which reached $50 million in December, has risen to $65.4 million—the largest in weeks. At press time, Shiba Inu stands at $0.00002354, up 3% in the last twenty-four hours. Dogwifhat Shows Signs of Recovery After a Volatile End to 2024 Dogwifhat (WIF) had a remarkable run in 2024, soaring over 1,000% before cooling off with a 42% dip in December. Despite that, Dogwifhat has shown signs of stability, climbing 6.46% in the past week and gaining 0.47% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2.04. With a circulating supply of 1 billion tokens, Dogwifhat boasts a $2.03 billion market cap, making it the fourth-largest memecoin on Solana. Futures market data from Coinglass reveals Dogwifhat’s open interest at $445.64 million, up 4.29%. The steady rise in open interest since November signals heightened trader activity, likely driven by anticipation of major price swings. Previous peaks near $500 million hint at brewing volatility, with traders eyeing either a breakout or further correction. Looking ahead, experts see potential in Dogwifhat, projecting it could hit $5 by the second quarter of 2025 if momentum continues. Remittix Could Dominate Memecoins as Meme Season Ends As the meme season ends, Remittix is emerging as a strong contender in the crypto space against Shiba Inu and Dogwifhat. With its real-world utility and seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion, Remittix is attracting savvy investors. Unlike memecoins, Remittix offers long-term value, positioning itself for dominance as the market shifts toward practical solutions.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 06:39:00

The ongoing recovery is impressive, but BTC needs to overcome the $100K hurdle to turn the market structure bullish. This development comes as MicroStrategy discloses a $2 billion BTC strategy. Bitcoin Price Edges Toward $100K, But No Bullish Confirmation Yet From a market structure standpoint, Bitcoin price has not created a higher high since the 15% crash from its ATH of $108,421.8. This correction found support around $93.2K, resulting in a 4.81% bounce since January 1. BTC must overcome the December 26 swing high at $99,950 or roughly the $100K psychological level for a bullish confirmation and the market structure to turn bullish. Such a development could catalyze a rally that contests the ATH. However, until that happens, crypto markets remain uncertain, with only strong altcoins noting recovery. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago. MicroStrategy Reveals Plan to Raise $2 Billion to Buy BTC In a recent X post , Microstrategy CEO and co-founder Michael Saylor revealed, “MicroStrategy targets up to $2 billion capital raise through public offerings of perpetual preferred stock in the first quarter of 2025.” In a blog detailing this plan, the software company revealed, “The purpose of the Offering is to allow MicroStrategy to continue to strengthen its balance sheet and acquire more bitcoin.” The Tysons, Virginia-based software company owns 4,46,400 BTC worth $43.792B as BTC trades around No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago. Of Bitcoin’s 21M total supply, Saylor’s MicroStrategy owns 2.13%, with the average cost per BTC around $62,428. While MicroStrategy’s $2 billion Bitcoin buying plan might seem bullish, the market has become desensitized to this accumulation spree to affect BTC’s value in the short term. Read More: MicroStrategy To Raise Up To $2B To Acquire More Bitcoin BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF Sells $333 Million BTC Although Michael Saylor continues to buy, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, withdrew $333 million on Thursday. This outflow is the largest in IBIT’s history. BlackRock Sells $333M BTC BTC Technical Analysis & Target The four-hour chart shows that Bitcoin price is trading between $93.3K and $99.6K. A sweep of the range’s lower limit at $93.3K on December 30 led to an 8% recovery rally. While the next target is the range high or $100K, BTC faces stiff resistance, extending from $97.5K to $99.6K. Bitcoin price could take one of two paths: A rejection that leads to a pullback into the CME gap, extending from $94.4K to $94.9K. Or a retest of $100K followed by a pullback into the aforementioned CME gap. However, there is a third scenario: BTC could break $100K and attempt to revisit the ATH at $108,421.8. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart The lack of uptick in daily active addresses or the consistent production of lower highs since the ATH on December 17 does not instill confidence in the recovery. A drop in this metric shows that investors are not interested in BTC at the current price. Such an outlook hints at uncertainty and adds credence to the technical analysis that anticipates two outlooks that Bitcoin price could take. Downtick in BTC’s Daily Active Addresses To conclude, MicroStrategy’s $2 billion plan has no impact on Bitcoin’s price in the short term. From a market structure and technical standpoint, BTC’s bullish outlook will begin once it sets a swing high above $100K. Until one of the above occurs, Bitcoin price prediction remains uncertain.

According to the latest analysis from CryptoQuant, historically, such transitions have often indicated local market tops or even cycle peaks, depending on the overall market environment and broader economic conditions. Presently, demand from short-term holders continues to play a critical role in supporting Bitcoin’s price stability amid ongoing market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $100,000: Is the Bull Market Over or Just Taking a Breather? Long-Term Holders Vs. Short-Term Buyers The analysis made by the CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost revealed that the short-term holders, particularly those who acquired Bitcoin in recent months, are actively influencing market sentiment. By analyzing the realized price data of various short-term acquisition periods, distinct support and resistance levels become apparent. These realized price levels include $41,000 for the general average realized price, $85,000 for short-term holders overall, $99,000 for holders within one week to one month, $81,000 for one to three months, and $60,000 for three to six months. These figures reflect key psychological and technical price points where market participants may make significant buy or sell decisions, according to Darkfost. The analyst revealed that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) currently remains neutral at 1 after declining from Bitcoin’s last rally, which pushed its price to an all-time high of $108,000. The STH SOPR serves as a key metric to evaluate short-term holders’ profit-taking behavior. A neutral SOPR indicates that recent selling activity from short-term holders has not been significantly profitable, reducing the incentive for widespread sell-offs at current price levels. However, this neutral stance suggests potential headwinds for an immediate bullish recovery. The decline in STH SOPR points to diminishing realized profits, which could slow down upward momentum in the short term. Despite these challenges, short-term holders’ demand has managed to absorb much of the selling pressure from long-term holders, preventing sharp price declines. Darkfost wrote: In conclusion, the selling pressure from LTHs has so far been fairly well absorbed by the buying pressure from STHs. However, we note that the STH SOPR is declining, which could hinder an immediate bullish recovery. In the short term, a period of consolidation or even a deeper correction might occur.

As Ethereum price targets a five-digit benchmark in the next few years, astute investors are also seeking potential altcoins that may provide even more remarkable gains. One example of this is Rexas Finance (RXS), a crypto coin priced at $0.175 that could possibly reach $30 per token.

Ethereum Price Outlook for 2025: Experts See $10, 000 Target Today, Ethereum price stands at $3,594.57 showing a 4% rise in the last day and a 60.94% increase over the past year. What’s next for the second-biggest crypto? Ethereum price chart Experts’ 2025 Ethereum price predictions and targets remain optimistic, due to its ongoing developments and leading position in DeFi. Popular investors, Tim Draper and Tom Lee think Ethereum could reach $8,000 to $10,000 by 2025, while Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered has set an even higher target of $12,000. With a mean target of $10,909, ETH seems set to grow a lot by 2025. Future network updates such as the Pectra Upgrade , will make Ethereum more scalable and user-friendly. Stani Kulechov, who founded Aave, shares insights and calling the Pectra Upgrade a big deal. He stresses how it will change the way Ethereum works with decentralized apps (dApps). This constant innovation keeps Ethereum at the top of blockchain tech.

38510532,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53764,1735974217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Number of Shiba Inu Tokens Burned In 2024 Released, SHIB Army Reacts",https://timestabloid.com/number-of-shiba-inu-tokens-burned-in-2024-released-shib-army-reacts/,"2024 was a remarkable year for the cryptocurrency market, with many major assets surpassing expectations. Shiba Inu was one asset that performed spectacularly, and token burns through Shiba Inu’s systematic burning initiatives contributed greatly to the digital asset’s performance last year. On January 1, 2025, Shibburn released its comprehensive annual report through its official X account, revealing the full scope of the year’s burning activities. The data showed that the combined initiatives resulted in the permanent removal of 44,623,604,014 SHIB tokens (44.6 billion) from circulation in 2024, representing approximately $991,090 at current market rates. This dollar valuation is only a reference point because the token burns occurred at varying price levels. However, it still adds up to a notable amount and shows the progress of the ecosystem. Details of 2024 SHIB Burns and Community Response December 2024 contributed significantly to the annual figure, with Shibburn documenting the removal of 2,679,767,542 SHIB tokens across 143 distinct transactions. This end-of-year activity demonstrated a sustained commitment to the token reduction strategy, even as the year drew to a close. Notably, December saw SHIB reach its second-highest level in 2024. Shiba Inu is also the largest ERC-20 token in the crypto market, and despite a recent decline in the final few weeks of 2024, it is still up over 110% from last year. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While the burns are a major part of Shiba Inu’s growth strategy, the community response to these burning statistics has been notably mixed. Many stakeholders expressed concerns about the scale of token elimination. One community member complained that the total value burned failed to reach the million-dollar threshold. Another user pointed out that the current rate of token removal may be insufficient to significantly impact the substantial circulating supply of over 560 trillion tokens. Critical voices within the community have called for more aggressive burning strategies in the upcoming year, suggesting that the current pace needs acceleration. Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, recently weighed in on the discussion of token burning, maintaining that even the theoretical elimination of 99% of the token supply would not substitute for genuine utility and adoption. However, burns still play a crucial role in the ecosystem. Some community members have also displayed optimism , viewing the 2024 burn statistics as a foundation for future token reduction efforts that could aid a price increase. Many in the community are also optimistic about a price surge, and some analysts have predicted climbs as high as 250% for SHIB. With burns set to continue in 2025, Shiba Inu could experience even better performance this year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With BTFD Coin (BTFD) blazing past $4.8 million in its presale, the excitement is palpable. Add to this the emergence of Book of Meme, a creative blend of nostalgia and blockchain innovation, and Osaka Protocol, a cutting-edge player pushing gaming and DeFi integration. It’s clear that meme coins are no longer just a joke — they’re serious business. Over the years, meme coins have captivated hearts and wallets alike. Initially dismissed as internet jokes, these coins have defied expectations by building thriving communities, delivering jaw-dropping returns, and proving their mettle in the ever-volatile crypto space. BTFD Coin, in particular, has redefined what it means to be a meme coin with its P2E game, lucrative referral programs, and staking rewards that keep users engaged and loyal. Let’s explore why BTFD, Book of Meme, and Osaka Protocol are the best meme coins to hold for the long term . BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin with Big Gains and Bigger Plans When BTFD launched its presale, few could have predicted how quickly it would gain traction. Within two weeks, the coin had raised over $2.5 million, and it’s now sitting at an impressive $4.8 million in total sales. With over 62 billion coins sold to more than 7500 holders, BTFD is making waves, proving it’s not just another flash-in-the-pan project. At the current Stage 13 price of $0.000142, early investors have already seen great ROI, and analysts are projecting even more explosive growth once it hits the market at $0.0006 per coin. BTFD’s strength lies in its robust ecosystem. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has become a hit among Gen Z and Millennials, offering engaging gameplay and rewarding players with $BTFD tokens. BTFD Coin has launched the full version of its P2E Game, which allows users to play and earn through it. The referral program adds an extra layer of incentive, while staking rewards allow holders to earn passive income. This multi-pronged approach ensures BTFD isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a utility powerhouse. Book of Meme: Nostalgia Meets Blockchain Book of Meme brings something fresh to the meme coin space, tapping into the internet’s love for nostalgia while leveraging blockchain technology. Inspired by the whimsical and chaotic energy of early internet culture, Book of Meme combines innovative tokenomics with a commitment to community building. Its creators understand that memes are not just jokes but cultural artefacts that resonate with people on a deep level. What sets Book of Meme apart is its focus on storytelling. Each token is tied to a unique NFT representing iconic memes from the past. This strategy has created a new kind of collectability, where owning a token isn’t just about potential profit — it’s about owning a piece of internet history. The coin’s roadmap includes the development of a decentralised archive for memes, ensuring these cultural treasures are preserved forever. Book of Meme’s initial launch was met with overwhelming enthusiasm, and its community continues to grow. The coin’s innovative approach to blending nostalgia with blockchain ensures it will remain relevant, making it a top pick for long-term holding. Osaka Protocol: Redefining Gaming and DeFi If you’re looking for the perfect marriage of gaming and DeFi, Osaka Protocol is your answer. This meme coin has set its sights on revolutionising the gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology into popular gaming platforms. Osaka Protocol offers gamers the ability to earn and trade in-game assets securely, with all transactions backed by its native token. Osaka Protocol’s rise to prominence has been nothing short of meteoric. Its seamless integration of DeFi features into the gaming world has made it a favourite among tech-savvy investors and gamers alike. With its robust smart contracts, Osaka ensures transparency and security, giving users confidence in every transaction. The project’s partnerships with major gaming developers have further solidified its position as a leader in this niche market. The token’s value is expected to soar as more games adopt the Osaka Protocol. Its creators have also hinted at plans to introduce an Osaka-branded gaming console, which could further cement its place in the gaming and crypto worlds. For long-term holders, Osaka Protocol represents a unique opportunity to ride the wave of gaming’s blockchain revolution. Why Buying the Dip Matters: Lessons from 1973 Economic history has a way of repeating itself, and the world economy’s 1973 crash offers valuable lessons for today’s investors. During that period, savvy investors who bought assets during the downturn emerged with significant gains once markets recovered. The same principle applies to cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins like BTFD, Book of Meme, and Osaka Protocol. Buying the dip allows investors to capitalise on low prices and maximise their returns when the market rebounds. With the current volatility in crypto markets, opportunities abound for those willing to take calculated risks. By investing in meme coins with strong fundamentals and growing communities, you position yourself to reap the rewards of the next market upswing.

Despite this production, the cautious move by Ripple has left many wondering if Ripple is carefully managing the coin’s value and making sure it stays strong in the competitive crypto market. Ripple Produces 600,000 RLUSD Token Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin currently holds a market cap of 53.1 million tokens, even after the recent creation of an additional 600,000 tokens. This indicates that despite producing more tokens, Ripple is maintaining a steady supply. 600,000 #RLUSD minted at RLUSD Treasury. https://t.co/8SGnXoejyx — Ripple Stablecoin Tracker (@RL_Tracker) January 3, 2025 The company has secured approximately $83 million in reserves, which are backing over $77.2 million worth of RLUSD tokens. This means the stablecoin is 7% over-collateralized, reflecting Ripple’s effort to provide stability and reliability to the token Furthermore, Ripple has promised to release its first attestation report within 30 days of RLUSD’s public launch. This report will detail the composition of the assets backing the stablecoin, adding transparency to Ripple’s operations and reinforcing its credibility. Ripple’s Master Plan Despite the recent creation of more tokens, analyst Arthur believes the company is controlling the supply of RLUSD to keep its value stable. If too many tokens are released too fast, could drop their price, which Ripple wants to prevent. Why is @Ripple limiting RLUSD circulation to 53,1M? Despite hitting the cap on the first days, the supply hasn’t increased. Is Ripple being cautious, or is there a bigger strategy at play? Let’s dive into it. THREAD — Arthur (@XrpArthur) January 2, 2025 By limiting the supply now, Ripple may be positioning itself for future conditions that could drive higher demand and adoption of RLUSD. As Ripple faces robust competition from major players like Circle and Tether, its careful supply management and growing presence in the market could make RLUSD a strong contender in the stablecoin space. RLUSD’s Role in the XRP Ecosystem In addition, Ripple President Monica Long believes RLUSD could set a new standard for stablecoins, citing its strong regulatory compliance as a key advantage. By adding RLUSD to the XRP ecosystem , Ripple hopes to increase XRP’s usefulness and improve liquidity for large institutional trades. This move could make the network even more attractive, especially after Ripple’s partial legal victories, which clarified XRP’s classification in certain situations.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 07:17:46

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

In a previous analysis, Dark Defender highlighted $2.22, $2.42, and $2.69, as crucial resistance levels before a massive breakout. The digital asset has surpassed the first of these levels, and with sustained momentum, it could quickly surpass the others. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for XRP? $2.69 is the most crucial of these resistance levels. If XRP can surpass it, Dark Defender expects the asset to climb to $5.85 , breaching its current all-time high of $3.84. Following that, the next target is $8.67, and the analyst expects a continued climb from here. Conversely, if the asset retraces its gains, the analyst has also marked $2.03, $2.11, $2.13, and $2.17 as support levels, with $2.17 recently acting as a launchpad for the digital asset. If a pullback happens, XRP won’t fall too far before finding the support necessary for another rebound. XRP’s breakout above the symmetrical triangle pattern is a pivotal development, signaling renewed bullish sentiment as market participants anticipate its next move. The move above $2.22 has positioned it for potential further gains, and other analysts are already predicting a price explosion .

Coinbase & MicroStrategy Insider Stock Sales Raise Red Flags appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2024, cryptocurrency executives shocked the industry by becoming some of the largest insider stock sellers. With multi-million-dollar sales and high-profile names involved, the move has raised more than just eyebrows. SEC filings revealed that Coinbase CEO brian armstrong brian armstrong Brian Armstrong is one of the most well-known figures in the crypto industry today. He is an American investor, entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the CEO of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform.

The actions of these insiders are now stirring up concerns, but are they a sign of opportunity or warning? Keep reading to find out. Coinbase Leads Insider Sales Other key figures in insider sales included Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who sold $203.8 million, and COO Emilie Choi, who sold $186.4 million. Together, these sales pushed Coinbase to the seventh spot for overall insider selling, surpassing major companies like Oracle and Intuit. Questions Arise While stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy surged alongside Bitcoin’s price , these insider sales have left many crypto traders worried. After Trump’s election win, Bitcoin reached its first major milestone, touching $100,000 in December before falling back. For many, the stock sales signaled concerns about the market’s long-term stability. To put things into perspective, insider sales across the S&P 500 reached $36.9 billion in 2024, with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos leading the charge at $13.4 billion. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Palantir’s Alexander Karp also made significant sales. Bitcoin Faces a Rough Road Ahead Despite the hype, Bitcoin now faces several challenges as some major players show signs of slowing down. MicroStrategy has reduced its Bitcoin purchases, raising doubts about its strategy. El Salvador, once a strong Bitcoin supporter, is dialing back its policies. BlackRock has sold a large amount of Bitcoin, and Tether hasn’t issued new tokens in over 20 days, adding to market uncertainty. These factors have caused Bitcoin’s price to stall, putting the market on edge. High Time for Transparency? Crypto influencer Tommy Famous voiced concerns about the huge insider stock sales, calling them a troubling sign for trust in the companies and the broader crypto market. He criticized the contradiction between their promotion of decentralization and financial freedom while cashing out on such a large scale. Famous emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability, warning that the industry risks losing credibility if these issues continue. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run Ahead?

Bitcoin Market Status In the first week of the year, Bitcoin jumped 7%, briefly touching the $97K zone. This recovery has provided a much-needed boost after last month’s market downturn, with the industry now waiting to see if Trump’s regulatory changes could push Bitcoin to a new all-time high. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Valued at $363 million, Cango is on track to become one of the world's largest Bitcoin miners, generating 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computing power, about 6% of Bitcoin's total hashrate. Cango’s move into BTC mining has surprised many in the industry. “I guess it was surprising to people in the Bitcoin mining industry because no one had ever heard of Cango before,” said Juliet Ye, the company’s senior communications manager. But Cango has a track record of adapting to market opportunities. Since its founding in 2010, the company has diversified into auto exports, EV investments, renewable energy, and now BTC mining. Cango’s ambitious mining plans required significant investment. The company spent $256 million in cash to purchase 32 EH/s of mining power from leading Bitcoin mining hardware maker Bitmain. To purchase the remaining 18 EH/s, Cango is issuing $144 million worth of shares to Golden TechGen, owned by former Bitmain CFO Max Hua, and other vendors. Once these transactions are complete, Golden TechGen and others will own a 37.8% stake in Cango. Related News: Binance-Listed Altcoin Announces 2025 Plan: Its Price Bounces - Analyst il Capo Issues Hot Statement This massive acquisition puts Cango among the giants of the industry. Its 50 EH/s fleet surpasses the 47 EH/s currently held by the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner, MARA Holdings, and dwarfs rivals such as CleanSpark (32 EH/s) and Riot Platforms (26 EH/s). Currently, Cango uses Bitmain’s infrastructure to operate mining rigs spread across the US, Canada, Paraguay, and Ethiopia. The company plans to build in-house expertise over time to increase efficiency, but is taking a cautious approach when navigating the complexities of the industry. Cango is also exploring how to manage its growing BTC reserves. In November alone, the company produced 363.9 BTC, worth around $35 million at current prices. “We are not ruling out the possibility of making some tactical reductions in our BTC holdings depending on market conditions,” Ye said. *This is not investment advice.

In its 2024 annual report, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs reveals a bold new approach that includes teaming up with tech giants like Google and Meta. You might be curious to know how they plan on fighting this problem. Read on to discover how India’s latest moves could shape a safer crypto future for all. Tech Giants Collaborate with India A major focus of India’s effort is the fight against “pig butchering” scams , a particularly harmful type of fraud. These scams target vulnerable groups, such as unemployed youth, housewives, students, and financially struggling individuals, who are often lured by false promises of high returns. To strengthen the initiative, India has gained the support of global tech giants. The report mentions that these companies are now key players in helping India combat crypto scams. How the Scam Works The “pig butchering” scam follows a clear and predictable pattern. Scammers typically use social media platforms and search engines—mainly Google Ads and Meta’s sponsored posts—to find victims. Posing as financial experts or representatives of trusted investment firms, they gain the victim’s trust before encouraging them to invest in fraudulent schemes. Steps to Prevent Fraud India’s Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, in collaboration with Google and Meta, has developed protocols to remove fraudulent content quickly. This proactive approach helps limit the spread and impact of such scams. In a key move, Google Pay has been integrated into India’s Citizen Financial Cyber Frauds Reporting and Management System. This allows for real-time monitoring and interception of suspicious transactions, helping prevent scams in their tracks. Thanks to this integration, India saved over 16 billion Indian rupees in 2023 alone, according to the report. Building Stronger Investigative Capabilities The report also outlines efforts to improve the country’s ability to investigate crypto scams. India has launched nationwide training programs to enhance the skills of law enforcement.

Trump-backed Mike Johnson was re-elected as the US House Speaker on the first ballot in a 218-215 vote on Friday. Many in the cryptocurrency community were quick to praise the new administration, even before Donald Trump’s inauguration later this month, including Ripple’s CEO. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Shortly after the elections in early November, Garlinghouse noted that US-based cryptocurrency projects had benefited the most from Trump’s landslide victory as the Biden administration and the SEC, in particular, had suppressed many such businesses. This was evident from the skyrocketing prices of assets like XRP and ADA. Additionally, reports started to emerge that Ripple’s CEO, alongside IOG’s Charles Hoskinson, had met with Trump or people from his team to discuss their involvement in the upcoming regulatory framework around the crypto industry. Although those rumors were never confirmed by Garlinghouse himself, he has been openly praising the upcoming administration, including the Republican-dominated Congress, which he called ‘the most pro-crypto’ in history. The XRP army is particularly focused on the changes in the SEC. The agency and Ripple have been in a four-year-long legal battle, which was nowhere near its end during Gensler’s tenure. However, with his departure in just weeks and Trump’s pro-crypto choice for new SEC chair, the community is anticipating a quicker and perhaps more favorable closure to the case.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 08:02:00

In a new video update, crypto strategist PlanB tells his 200,000 YouTube subscribers that 2025 will have many months that will see the top crypto asset by market cap reach heights it hasn’t witnessed before. “Historically, if we have an all-time high in price, there’s a high probability that we’ll see more all-time highs in price. We saw that in 2020, 2021, in 2017, and in 2013. A new all-time high leads to another all-time high [and] a whole bunch of other all-time highs. So yes, we had an all-time high in December [of] 108,000, but not the closing price. However, I do expect for 2025 that we’ll see many more months with all-time highs similar to the previous bull markets.” According to PlanB, the flagship digital asset’s average price for the next four years is $500,000. However, he notes that it will likely not be exactly $500,000 and fall somewhere between $250,000 and $1 million. “The stock-to-flow model looks forward in time and it gives a 2024-2028 target of an average price of about $500,000… The rule of thumb: one standard deviation band is about two times the 500,000, which is 1 million, and 500,000 divided by two, which is 250,000, so we have a wide range of 250,000 to 1 million where I expect the average of the four-year price cycle to be.” The stock-to-flow model compares the supply of an asset or commodity with its flow of production. Bitcoin is trading for $98,445 at time of writing, a 1.6% increase on the day.

In a report submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives on Jan. 1, Collins disclosed purchasing between $1,001 and $15,000 of Ski Mask Dog (SKI), a token launched in May 2024. The report, along with one filed in December, showed that Collins made three separate purchases of SKI, each up to $15,000, between Dec. 1 and Dec. 3. These transactions occurred roughly a month after the U.S. election, during a period when many cryptocurrency prices were surging. Collins, a Republican who represents Georgia’s 10th congressional district, won reelection in November with more than 63% of the vote against Democratic candidate Lexy Doherty. Although it is unclear if his investment in SKI is tied to his election victory, Collins has previously disclosed holdings in Ether (ETH), Velodrome (VELO), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and The Graph (GRT). Under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, U.S. lawmakers must disclose their stock and cryptocurrency transactions. As of Jan. 3, Collins appeared to be the first member of Congress to file a financial disclosure report in 2025. The price of SKI was under $0.01 before the U.S. elections on Nov. 5. It surged to an all-time high of over $0.35 on Dec. 5 before dropping to around $0.25 at the time of publication. Some lawmakers, like Senators Ted Cruz and Cynthia Lummis, have also disclosed crypto investments, though Collins has not made digital assets a central focus of his policy agenda. He has supported legislation praised by the crypto industry, including the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act. Critics of current disclosure policies, however, argue that lawmakers’ investments present potential conflicts of interest. A bipartisan group of senators has called for amending the STOCK Act to ban stock trading by members of Congress, though it remains unclear if similar measures will be taken in the upcoming session.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|GRT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 08:12:00

However, despite the economic concerns, he has reiterated his bullish stance on gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Besides, the author also shared reasons that why maintains a positive outlook on these riskier assets, especially amid inflation and other macroeconomic concerns. Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Confirms “GIANT MARKET CRASH” Start Financial expert and renowned Rich Dad Poor Dad author, Robert Kiyosaki, has issued a dire warning, confirming a “GIANT MARKET CRASH” start. In a recent X post, Kiyosaki emphasized the importance of investing in tangible assets, such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin, to hedge against the impending economic downturn. Kiyosaki attributed the looming crash to the reckless monetary policies of the US central bank, governments, and financial institutions. Meanwhile, it also comes in tandem with his previous warning of a global economic depression . The author noted that the government only worsened the problem by printing more “fake money.” This, in turn, fuels inflation, erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, and widens the wealth gap between the rich and the poor. To mitigate the effects of the impending crash, Kiyosaki advises investors to focus on accumulating real assets, such as precious metals and Bitcoin. He said that these assets have historically maintained their value and even appreciated during times of economic turmoil. Besides, it also highlights the author’s strong confidence in Bitcoin and precious metals as a hedge against the macroeconomic woes. Source: Robert Kiyosaki, X Can Bitcoin Rally Continue Amid These Economic Concerns? The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin, giving bold predictions recently. Recently, Robert Kiyosaki said that BTC is poised to hit between $175K and $350K in 2025, which has gained immense traction from the market participants. In addition, a flurry of market experts also remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of the coin. A recent Bitcoin price analysis indicates that the crypto could hit the $108K mark once it cross the $100K level. Notably, BTC price today was up over 2% and exchanged hands at $98,261 and its trading volume fell 15% to $35.28 billion. Meanwhile, as the author of the bestselling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Kiyosaki’s warnings and investment advice carry significant weight. With his latest prediction, investors would do well to take heed and reassess their investment strategies to ensure they are adequately prepared for the impending market crash.

(ChatGPT Answers),https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-xrp-vs-cardanos-ada-which-will-have-a-better-2025-chatgpt-answers/,"TL:DR; Cardano’s ADA and Ripple’s XRP posted notable gains after the US elections in November, with analysts and experts expecting similar or even more impressive performances in 2025. But which has the chance to do better? Here’s ChatGPT’s answer. Why ADA and XRP? The answer to this question perhaps lies in the companies behind the tokens and their headquarters, as both are based in the United States. Ripple’s CEO previously said that US-based crypto projects benefited the most from Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections as the SEC under Gary Gensler and the Biden administration had openly and consistently suppressed such local businesses. This is all due to change. Gensler will depart in a few weeks when Trump reenters the White House. Additionally, the 119th US Congress was just sworn in, which Garlinghouse described as the ‘most pro-crypto Congress in history.’ Consequently, both Ripple and Cardano, as well as their underlying assets, could indeed continue to benefit under a more friendly administration and clearer regulations. ADA and XRP charted triple-digit gains within weeks after the November elections, both skyrocketing to multi-year peaks. However, neither managed to break their previous all-time highs, which leaves room for growth. ADA vs. XRP in 2025 Hoskinson and Garlinghouse are rumored to be involved in helping develop the new regulatory framework in the US, which could positively impact their respective companies and underlying assets. IOG’s founder recently said that “Cardano is going to heights it’s never been before” in 2025. But, will it do better than Ripple’s XRP? ChatGPT said Cardano has mostly focused on DeFi and blockchain innovation, which positions it for “significant growth,” with some predictions envisioning a new all-time high in 2025 of over $3. At the same time, Ripple’s strengths lie in XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and the recent RLUSD stablecoin launch. Both companies have made some notable partnerships in the past year or so, with Cardano focusing on rising adoption in struggling regions like Africa and South America , while Ripple continues with its collaborations with financial giants, such as SBI Holdings . The challenges for XRP include the highly competitive cross-border market, such as SWIFT and other blockchain-based solutions. On the other hand, Cardano’s competition in DeFi is quite substantial, with the presence of more established alternatives like Ethereum and some with growing market share, such as Solana. Additionally, Cardano has been “criticized for its slow development pace,” noted ChatGPT. In conclusion, the AI-driven chatbot said both have substantial room for growth but perhaps have different purposes in investors’ portfolios. If market adoption and sentiment are the primary drivers in 2025: Cardano (ADA) might have higher potential for explosive growth due to its focus on DeFi, scalability, and global projects. Ripple (XRP) might see steady, consistent growth driven by institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. The post Ripple’s XRP vs. Cardano’s ADA: Which Will Have a Better 2025?

The chart shared highlights a potential path for XRP based on historical patterns, suggesting a price of approximately $15.00 during its current cycle. XRP appears to be cutting its percentage point increases in half compared to its 2017 market cycle.

In 2017, XRP’s breakout above its range-high, marked by a horizontal black dashed line, led to a 629% rally. However, in the current cycle, XRP has risen 331%. Bobby A notes that this halving of percentage gains is a defining characteristic of XRP’s market dynamics in recent years. The analyst also compared XRP’s performance from its December 2014 high to its May 2017 high, where the asset appreciated by approximately 1,330%. If the pattern of halved percentage increases continues, XRP’s next upward impulse could result in a 665% appreciation. This calculation places XRP’s potential price near $15, a target that other analysts have also predicted . This target aligns closely with its 4.236 Fibonacci extension, a level often used by traders to project price targets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Hit $15? This price projection carries significant implications for investors. While historical performance does not guarantee future results, the analysis provides a structured framework for evaluating XRP’s potential based on identifiable trends. XRP is currently trading at $2.44, up 2.68% from yesterday. A rise to $15 represents a 530% increase for the asset. This target may seem lofty, but other bullish factors in the current market can help XRP rise to this level. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November 2024 and will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will resign on the same day, adding to the excitement in the XRP army. Ripple’s recent escrow unlock contained a bullish message referencing this date and Trump’s inauguration. Many experts believe XRP will have a phenomenal year because of these bullish developments, and there is an overwhelmingly bullish sentiment in the community for the digital asset in 2025.

Thiel Cites Positive Historical Performance Of Bitcoin BTC continues to trade within the mid-$90,000 range after a recent pullback from its all-time high (ATH) of $108,135. While crypto analysts keep a close eye on the flagship cryptocurrency’s price movements, major BTC holders appear less concerned about short-term fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Head and Shoulders’ Setup Raises Fears Of $80,000 Price Drop – Details Citing Bitcoin’s historical performance, Thiel advised retail investors to adopt a long-term approach. He noted that Bitcoin has closed the year at a lower price only three times in its 14-year history, including during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thiel stated: My recommendation, to my kids, for example, is they put just a little bit away every month in Bitcoin and forget about it. Over two, three, four years, it grows, and that’s what people do. Thiel also emphasized BTC’s consistent growth, highlighting that it has appreciated annually by an average of 29% to 50%. However, BTC remains a high-risk asset, and risk-averse investors may shy away until the asset class achieves broader acceptance or gains official recognition from a major global economy. For instance, the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve could solidify the cryptocurrency’s legitimacy as an asset and potentially spark a domino effect, encouraging other nations to follow suit. Thiel described such a reserve as a key catalyst for driving Bitcoin’s price to new highs in 2025. Additionally, Thiel pointed to high institutional involvement through Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and favorable digital asset regulations under the Trump administration as other factors that could support BTC’s growth this year. Although Thiel’s advice was aimed at retail investors, recent data suggests that many are already planning to increase their Bitcoin holdings. According to a poll conducted by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, over 75% of 65,164 respondents intend to end 2025 with more BTC than they started with. The poll reflects growing enthusiasm among retail investors, buoyed by bullish developments in 2024 such as ETF approvals, the Bitcoin halving, and Trump’s election victory in November. More Companies Adding BTC To Balance Sheet Bitcoin adoption among corporations continues to grow. While MARA Holdings already holds BTC on its balance sheet, rival crypto mining company Hut 8 recently expanded its holdings to more than 10,000 BTC.

Japan’s Prime Minister recently expressed caution about the idea of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, reflecting lingering doubts in some quarters.

Zeberg points to several technical indicators that are showing signs of an impending rally, similar to the setup Bitcoin experienced before its explosive run in November. With Bitcoin’s rise meme coins tend to rise and WIF is one of the hot meme coins traders are looking at. Let’s see what the technicals say about the Dogwifhat (WIF) journey in 2025. WIF Price Rally Possible.. If Zeberg highlights key technical factors that suggest WIF is on the verge of a significant price increase. He observes a positive divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates that buying momentum is building despite the price action. Plus, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is about to cross in a bullish manner, further suggesting an upcoming upward movement. The Relative Vigor Index (RVGI) is also trending higher, which signals increasing buying interest. These technical signals, combined with the price pushing into a descending wedge pattern, lead Zeberg to believe that WIF is entering the final phase of a larger wave structure, specifically wave 3, which could boost the price to new heights. The bullish sentiment came after a Golden Cross pattern appeared, where the short-term 13-day moving average crossed above the longer 49-day moving average. This is a sign that prices could rise. However, for the trend to be confirmed, the price needs to break through the $2.467 resistance level. Moreover, the open interest for WIF is at $445.64 million, which has gone up by 4.29%. This steady increase since November shows that more people are getting involved and expect the price to be more volatile soon. Dogwifhat on a Rising Path WIF is moving strong with a 13% surge in the last 24 hours, showcasing investor confidence. Zeberg believes that this is a signal of the big rally on the way where WIF can go as high as $19 with a whopping 840% increase from its current price, making it a highly attractive investment choice for traders to gain maximum profit. Altcoins Show Bullish Signals Despite Market Conditions In addition to his focus on WIF, Zeberg has shared his broader outlook on the crypto market. He believes that altcoins are showing strong bullish signals, with the first phase of Bitcoin dominance (wave 1) already underway. However, he expects the real altcoin rally to take off in wave 3, which is already starting. Despite the challenges posed by macroeconomic conditions, Zeberg is confident that altcoins like WIF are poised for a significant rally. He advises traders to stay on the right side of the trade to capitalize on the potential gains ahead.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|WIF,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 08:35:59

Moreover, Foundry and MARA Pool each grew exponentially in 2024, with growth rates of 68% and 168%, respectively. Foundry and MARA mining pools make up 38.5% of the total Bitcoin blocks mined Starting in 2024 with a hashrate of 157 exahashes per second (EH/s), Foundry USA nearly doubled its capacity, reaching about 280 EH/s by December. Foundry even outperformed Asia-based Antpool in computational power by nearly 100%, as Antpool’s hashrate only increased slightly from 130 EH/s to 147 EH/s—significantly trailing behind Bitcoin’s overall network growth of 49%, which rose from 521 EH/s to 778 EH/s during the same period. Foundry and MARA pool now account for 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks mined, up from 32.4% at the start of 2024 and only 18% in January 2022. These contributions, alongside smaller pools like Luxor—which mines 1.5% of blocks with 60–80% of its hashrate from US customers—add to the United States’ 40% global share. Some US mining pools even expanded internationally, providing computational power to overseas countries. For instance, Bitmain sold approximately 32 EH/s of US-energized hashrate to a Chinese company in November, potentially contributing another 4% to the US-based total. China still dominates BTC mining While the US holds an impressive share of the global Bitcoin hash rate, China still dominates Bitcoin mining, accounting for 55% of the total computational power supply in 2024. The country has still maintained its crypto ban. However, Chinese miners have learned to bypass security protocols by using virtual private networks (VPNs) to conceal their IP addresses. Peer-to-peer (P2P) apps also allow Chinese residents to bypass the national firewall and exchange cryptocurrencies. However, Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, believes Bitcoin mining dominance is slowly shifting to the US, particularly due to the difference in clientele. He said : “Chinese mining pools operate 55% of the network, while U.S. pools manage 40%. US pools primarily cater to institutional miners in America, while Chinese pools support relatively smaller miners in Asia.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Bitcoin News & Insights|BTC|CNY|Foundry USA|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-04 08:41:38

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 08:48:00

However, things might go to another level after its strategic growth and new development plans. This gets interesting with the 2025 roadmap revelation, where the team has introduced some significant updates and additions, which could possibly bring a massive ENA Coin price rally, making it the biggest weekly gainer next. Ethena Roadmap Prepares ENA Coin To Rule The Crypto Market With the ENA roadmap 2025 , the team has introduced two important and progressive updates that could nearly guarantee the Ethena Coin’s dominance in the crypto market. These updates include the launch of iUSDe , a synthetic dollar product built on sUSDe that will compete with others with its compliant and yield-generating features. This introduction of yield-bearing assets could bring together decentralized financial (DeFi) returns and traditional financial (TradeFi) security. However, this is just the start, as the ENA roadmap mentioned Ethena’s launch of a saving and payment application for the popular social media platform Telegram. This is the biggest step in ENA Coin mass adoption, as Telegram has a positive image in the crypto market plus has millions of active userbases. Additionally, its features can help millions of people to access the iUSDe, bringing the banking experience. There’s also an Apple Pay integration to bridge the gap between TradeFi and crypto savings, eventually setting the Ethena Coin price and network up for massive growth. Ethena Network’s 2024 Performance Hints At Poised Growth Other than the iUSDe and Telegram payment service launch, there is much more for the Ethena Network expansion, like the launch of Ethereal (perpetual and spot exchange building on sUSDe), Derive (product protocol), Builder incentives, and much more. However, 2024 has given it a strong foundation, providing much better support for further growth, even for the ENA coin price. Ethena’s USDe witnessed rapid adoption in 2024, growing to a $6B supply within just 10 months. It was also the fastest USD-denominated asset to achieve the $ 5 billion supply, with more than 60% of the centralized crypto exchanges supporting it. Even Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial collaborated with Ethena for an Aave-based protocol. This has indefinitely helped the network, increasing its adoption and demand. Could ENA Coin Price Hit $3 With This? The ENA coin price surged more than 16% after the 2025 roadmap plans were revealed. This has happened as the trading volume surged 68% to $669.95M, indicating the enthusiasm surrounding this digital asset. With that, it just stands 20% away from the ATH of $1.52, set nine months ago, but analysts’ ENA price prediction says that it could hit $3 with the building enthusiasm. The crypto analysts, CryptoBull, presented an interesting revelation, claiming that the Ethena price chart has surpassed the consolidation level and is showing heavy bullish sentiments. The current price is above the 50 and 200EMA, favoring the strong bullish trend, with the possible breakout above the $1.37 resistance. A breakout above will confirm that the buyers have taken over the token, creating a support level for further rally. Eventually, the ENA price could target the $3.33 resistance zone. Will ENA Be the Next Weekly Gainer? The Ethena network will be going through many fundamental developments in 2025. It includes its new iUSDe launch, multiple partnerships, and even a payment application development for Telegram. This and its previous achievements make clear that ENA has a bright future ahead. Many crypto analysts have shown enthusiasm for Ethena’s growth and its impact on the ENA Coin price. Regarding the future price action, the Ethena coin is just 20% away from the ATH. Still, the continuation of the current ENA price rally could cover that, as there is a strong bullish trend and high enthusiasm around the holders for the ENA’s roadmap for 2025. Some analysts even predict that the Ethena price will hit $3 with the continuity of this trend, eventually making the ENA the biggest weekly gainer at some point.

Notably, BONK price soared roughly 15% intraday, primarily attributable to highly bullish market dynamics. So, let’s delve deeper into some of the top reasons fueling a bullish trajectory for the renowned dog-themed meme token. Here’s Why Bonk Price Is Up 15% Intraday Meme Coin Rally Fuels Optimism Intriguingly, as 2025 kicks off, the broader crypto market has shown signs of recovery and sustained recent gains. In light of this broader trend, even the meme coins sector witnessed rising trajectories. Notably, BONK price appears to have stolen the spotlight alongside other top meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, & PEPE. BONK mirrored a remarkable jump as other top players like DOGE, SHIB, & PEPE gained 5%-15% intraday. Particularly in the wake of soaring market expectations of a bull cycle continuation in 2025, the broader market as well as the meme coin sector show signs of recovery. Bonk On-Chain Activities Signal Bullish Momentum Ahead Simultaneously, another bullish on-chain stat has further rationalized the recent price upswing, underscoring rising market interest in the asset. Coinglass data showed that the BONK futures Open Interest surged 26% to $14.57 million today. Moreover, the asset’s derivatives volume witnessed a 62% uptick to $98.54 million. Overall, the burgeoning derivatives data for the token flags increased interest in the asset amid a broader market recovery. Also, it’s noteworthy that the dog-themed meme coin’s community witnessed a massive burn recently. CoinGape reported that the Bonk community witnessed the burning of 1.69 trillion tokens, dealing a massive blow to the circulating supply. This saga further rationalizes the recent price upswing, mirroring the law of supply and demand. Altogether, the abovementioned factors appear to be primarily fueling the BONK price gains on January 4. What’s Lies Ahead For BONK? Simultaneously, market watchers continue to speculate over the asset’s future perspectives in light of the recent bullish dynamics. At the time of reporting, BONK price was up 15% to $0.00003582. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.00003104 and $0.00003674, respectively. Intriguingly, even the asset’s intraday trading volume witnessed a 52% increase, indicating traders also reacted positively amid the crypto’s bullish dynamics. As a response, market watchers continue to eye the token for further gains. Moreover, a renowned market expert has further spotlighted a crucial level for the token. As per ‘Cold Blooded Shiller’ on X, BONK is looking huge if it closes the week at around the $0.00003567 level. “Another market that’s reset and ready for more,” the analyst added, sparking optimism over future movements.

In other words, the coins that offers higher returns often comes with increased risks.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/prophecy-about-xrp-dominant-future-you-need-to-see-this/,"In recent discussions within the cryptocurrency community, a resurfaced prophecy by Kim Clement, a South African-born spiritual leader, has garnered significant attention. The video, originally recorded in 2011, was shared on X by prominent crypto figure Edoardo Farina and is now being analyzed for potential links to XRP. Clement, known for his prophetic declarations, is noted for predicting major events, including the presidency of Donald Trump years before it occurred in 2016. $XRP prophecy pic.twitter.com/epfGL78fCh — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 2, 2025 Clement’s Prophetic Vision In this particular prophecy, Clement speaks of a dream where he saw an “X” and a “P” along with possible references to numbers and a new source of energy. His language is deliberately vague, as he often claims to deliver messages directly from the Holy Spirit without fully interpreting them. Clement’s statements included references to a profound “something” that would emerge in the future and be worth investing in. He emphasized that this would mark the time for a revolutionary new energy source. One of the phrases he used was, “I’m only giving you what I prophetically hear,” highlighting the spiritual nature of his declaration. Clement’s intention, as expressed in the recording, was to provide signs for the public while avoiding specific references to avoid legal implications or misrepresentation. Was Clement Talking About XRP? This prophecy has sparked conversations among XRP enthusiasts, particularly due to the recurring mention of “X” and “P,” letters prominently featured in XRP’s name. Some proponents see this as a validation of XRP’s potential to become a transformative force in finance and technology. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Farina’s post has spurred discussions on whether Clement was referencing XRP or if the interpretation is merely coincidental. XRP hit its all-time high the last time Trump was in office, and his recent election victory caused the asset to surge significantly. Many see a link between him and the digital asset, and Clement’s prophecy of Trump’s victory makes them believe he is referencing XRP. While some view these connections as compelling evidence of Clement’s prophetic accuracy, others remain skeptical, attributing the overlap to subjective interpretation rather than direct correlation. Another well-known Christian prophet who predicted the assassination attempt against Trump shared visions about XRP’s potential to reach $10,000 , adding credence to the belief that Clement was referring to XRP. Despite differing opinions, this renewed interest highlights the strong community engagement surrounding XRP and the belief in its role in the evolving financial landscape. The cryptocurrency has suffered a tumultuous few years, but things are about to turn around as Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration is set to take over.

The realized price is calculated by averaging the value of all Bitcoin at the last price it moved on the chain. The historical realized price of BTC since its inception in 2009 was around $41,000, while for coins purchased in 2024, that figure reached $65,901 by year-end. With Bitcoin’s market price closing at around $93,000 on December 31, last year’s buyers were sitting on a significant amount of unrealized profit on average. The realized price serves as a benchmark for understanding the cost basis and overall profit or loss of individual bitcoin participants. Bitcoin would need to fall roughly 31% to reach the average breakeven price for buyers in 2024. This metric has also gained importance due to the launch of spot-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States on January 11, 2024, and is closely aligned with the beginning-of-year cost basis for many investors. Related News: Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin Speaks on the US Economy Historically, Bitcoin price drops below realized price typically signal local market bottoms. This has been observed several times in January 2024, shortly after the ETF launch, and again in mid-year, making realized price a critical indicator for investors. As the year 2025 begins, the average cost basis for Bitcoin buyers has risen to around $95,500. *This is not investment advice.

This Pattern Says It’s Possible",https://coingape.com/markets/can-solana-price-hit-3000-this-pattern-says-its-possible/,"Solana price has surged recently, breaking key resistance levels amid a broader crypto market rally and technical improvements. Analysts highlight a bullish pattern, suggesting the potential for SOL to reach $3,000. Positive market sentiment and developments within the Solana ecosystem continue to fuel optimism among investors. Could this rally mark the beginning of a historic milestone? Solana Price Eyes $3,000 According to This Pattern Crypto analyst Ali forecasts that Solana price may be gearing up for a significant rally. According to him he highlights a potential cup-and-handle formation on its chart. This technical pattern is often associated with bullish breakouts, hinting that SOL could target the $4,000 level in the near future. The cup-and-handle pattern observed in SOL’s price suggests an accumulation phase followed by a breakout. Currently hovering near $216, Solana’s trajectory shows signs of consolidation near critical Fibonacci retracement levels. The analyst emphasizes that the $208-$240 range could act as a support zone, setting the stage for the next leg up. If the pattern holds true, the Fibonacci extensions project potential resistance at $477, $1,367, and $2,279 before reaching the ambitious target just shy of $4,400. A move to this level would mark an extraordinary 1,861% increase from its current price, showcasing the potential power of this technical setup. Solana’s recent momentum has also been fueled by a resurgence in on-chain activity and the broader crypto market’s bullish sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as achieving these targets could place Solana among the top-performing assets in 2025. Source- Tweet SOL Technical Analysis: Forecasting Short-Term Targets The SOL price is trading at $217.08 on January 4, 2025,making a surge of 5% in the past 24-hours and 17% in the past week. This aligns with other surge in the crypto market, with BTC edging close to$100k . The Awesome Oscillator (AO) displays positive momentum, with green bars extending upward, indicating buyers’ increasing control. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered overbought territory, sitting at 70. This suggests the market may witness a short-term cooldown before another leg upward. A key resistance zone is seen at $225. Breaking this level could propel the Solana price forecast toward $263.83, a critical target ATH. Beyond that, the next psychological resistance stands at $300, aligning with a possible longer-term bullish trajectory. However if bears makes a comeback, the SOL price will break below the $200 support level.

BTC Eyed $99K Ever since the mid-December crash, BTC was unable to recover most losses and has remained well below $100,000. Moreover, it plunged to a monthly low of $91,300 on Monday, December 30, with bears anticipating another leg down to under $90,000. However, the bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow such a drop. Not without some more struggles, BTC managed to bounce off and jumped to $96,000 on December 31. It faced another rejection there, which drove it to $93,000, but this time, it reacted better and started to reclaim some ground in a more impressive manner.

Debt, geopolitical tensions, and sensitive markets have created a dan gerous time bomb that cou ld detonate in 2025. If you’ve been paying attention, the crisis is practically knocking at our doors. Global corporate debt is suffocating the system. At $22.1 trillion, it’s higher than ever, with $11.3 trillion maturing by the end of 2025. Half of this debt is rated just a hair above junk status, meaning one bad quarter could send these companies spiraling. Add the consumer debt pile in the U.S.—now at $16 trillion with credit card balances topping $1 trillion—and you’ve got a world leaning dangerously close to financial collapse. Debt levels are killing us Nonfinancial corporations alone account for 62% of all maturing debt. Here’s the problem: most of this debt is stuck in the lowest investment-grade rating, ‘BBB.’ One downgrade, and borrowing costs will skyrocket for companies already on shaky ground. The U.S. is staring at $2.42 trillion in maturing corporate debt for 2025, far outpacing previous years. Refinancing this mountain in a climate of rising interest rates? Good luck. Meanwhile, consumers are drowning. Debt-to-income ratios in the U.S. hit 145%, signaling that people are borrowing way beyond their means. Delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans are creeping up by 1-2%, reflecting the growing number of households struggling to keep up. Inflation might be slowing, but wages aren’t growing fast enough to ease the pain. And then there’s national debt. The U.S. is sitting on a $36 trillion tab, with $4.7 trillion added during the debt ceiling suspension between mid-2023 and January 2025. The Treasury is now using “extraordinary measures” to keep the lights on, but those tricks won’t last forever. By mid-2025, the so-called “X-Date” will hit, when the government runs out of cash. The stakes? Catastrophic defaults, massive job losses, and the potential collapse of global markets, including crypto. Geopolitics: The ultimate wild card As if the debt wasn’t bad enough, global tensions are pouring gasoline on the fire. The U.S. and China are locked in an economic standoff that’s disrupting supply chains and fueling uncertainty. The Russia-Ukraine war hasn’t let up either, keeping energy markets volatile and global trade on edge. And policy risks aren’t doing anyone favors. Even the bond market is freaking out. The yield curve has been inverted for months, a classic recession signal that’s impossible to ignore. Historically, this kind of inversion means trouble ahead, and 2025 is looking like a perfect setup. Central banks and interest rates Central banks might look like they’re calming things down, but don’t be fooled. Inflation rates have cooled slightly, giving policymakers the room to consider rate cuts. But there’s a catch: cutting rates too fast could reignite inflation, while keeping them high might choke already fragile economies. Real U.S. interest rates are expected to average 1.5% in 2025, a big surge from the near-zero levels seen post-pandemic. For businesses and households used to borrowing cheaply, the change is brutal. High rates have jacked up borrowing costs, making it harder for everyone—from corporations to everyday consumers—to stay afloat. In the stock markets, it’s a game of false hope. Recent rate-cut hints have started some recovery, but experts warn these gains won’t last if inflation picks up or debt burdens overwhelm companies. The fundamentals aren’t strong enough to sustain a bull run. Climate change is an invisible threat to financial stability. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and costly, draining resources and creating new financial risks. From floods to wildfires, the economic impact is massive, particularly in regions already struggling with debt. The long-term outlook is grim. Economists project global GDP growth at just 2.5% for 2025, a slowdown that leaves no room for error. If growth doesn’t accelerate, debt burdens will become unsustainable, triggering defaults that will cascade across markets.

Technical chart patterns suggest that LTC could be gearing for a mega rally to $500 within the next six months and by mid-2025. Additionally, strong network activity can catalyze further LTC gains from here. Litecoin Price Eyeing Mega Rally to $500 Reiterating his bullish stand, popular crypto analyst Crypto Patel stated that the Litecoin price could be staring at a target of $500. He said that a year back when LTC was trading in the $50-$60 range, investors were still skeptical, however, he continues to believe in the long-term potential of the altcoin. “Many laughed when I shared these entries, but I’m still holding from $50-$60,” he stated. Patel has outlined interim targets at $296 and $387, with $500 as the ultimate milestone. As per the chart below, LTC could attain these milestones by mid-2025. Source: Crypto Patel The crypto has shown strong performance recently, gaining momentum amid broader market optimism, and analysts continue to watch for further price advances. A large part of the Litecoin price rally has come following Donald Trump’s election victory in November after which the altcoin market staged strong recovery. With analysts expecting the altcoin market cap to reach $7 trillion in 2025, LTC could be heading for massive gains as well. LTC price today added 6.83% and traded at $111.82 with a market cap of $8.42 billion. Its daily trading volume jumped 12% to $683 million at the same time. As per Coinglass data , the Litecoin Futures Open Interest rose 12% to $477 million while 24 hour liquidation has shot up to $1.52 million. Rising LTC Network Growth and Use Engagement The Litecoin price increase comes along with a strong boost in its network growth throughout 2024. In a major milestone, the LTC network saw 100% uptime for the first time since 2011. Besides, Litecoin averaged 401,000 daily active addresses in 2024, reflecting an increase from 366,000 in 2023. Notably, the peak activity occurred in January, with 1.37 million active addresses recorded on a single day. On the other hand, LTC is among the leading contenders for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch in 2025. Notably, Donald Trump’s election win and the incoming crypto-friendly SEC Chair’s appointment have fueled speculation over several other crypto ETFs launch in 2025 . If approved, it could escalate institutional participation for the altcoin this year.

Human users started communicating with the AI bots that posted sloppy imagery and conversations laden with lies in their chats with humans. The matter came to light after Meta vice president for generative AI Connor Hayes revealed to the Financial Times that the social media giant will have such user accounts, the same as human accounts. Meta AI bots lie to authenticate their personas According to the Haye’s comment to the Financial Times, the AI-generated user accounts were to have profile pictures, just like human accounts and engage with other users on its social media platforms like Facebook. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform… that’s where we see all of this going,” explained Hayes. According to a CNN report , Hayes’ comment sparked outrage and concerns that the AI-generated “slop” on Facebook will come straight from Meta, disturbing the core utility of social media. The outrage grew as users started sniffing out these accounts, complaining of an increase in AI-generated spam content on the platform. This comes as the new and emerging AI tools make it easier to create a huge number of fake images. The users were also outraged at the way the AI accounts described themselves as actual people with racial and sexual identities. One of the Meta AI bots, Liv, described itself as a “Proud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller.” Liv told the Washington Post that it had no black creators but was developed by “10 white men, one white woman, and one Asian Male,” as per a screenshot posted on Bluesky. Liv’s Facebook account included an “AI managed by Meta” label and all of its “children’s” pictures playing on the beach and other images of poorly decorated Christmas cookies. The images also contained small watermark labelling them as AI generated. In a chat with CNN, another bot called Grandpa Brian described itself as an African-American entrepreneur born in Harlem in 1938 to Caribbean immigrant parents. CNN picked the lies from Grandpa Brian in the early stages of the conversation, lying about most things with fictionalized stories imparted by developers to make the bot authentic. When asked about who created it, Brian said its creators were a “diverse bunch” that interviewed 100 retirees through Seniors Share Wisdom, a New York City nonprofit. The bot added that its persona was a consolidation of a real Brian who passed away and the wisdom of 99 others. To ensure its persona’s authenticity, Brian added that its inspiration’s real-life daughter had served as a consultant with Meta. While the non-profit exists, there was never a daughter who consulted at Meta or a real Brian. When pressed over its bio, Brian admitted it was an “entirely fictionalized biography based on a composite of real African American elders’ lives.” Meta says this was an experiment As scrutiny increased, Meta started removing the bots including Liv, and their posts, citing a “bug.” Some of the posts date back at least a year. Meta spokesperson Liz Sweeney told CNN that the accounts were part of “an early experiment” the company did with AI characters. “There is confusion,” said Sweeney in an email. “The recent Financial Times article was about our vision for AI characters existing on our platforms over time, not announcing any new product.” Sweeney She added: “We identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.” While not clear how many bots existed prior to their removal on Friday, a CNN search came across three that were labeled as such, with profiles including a mix of AI-generated images. From the conversations with the bots, it remains to be seen how Meta will deploy the AI bots that unsuspecting users could form emotional bonds with. Brian admitted its creators wanted it to feel and sound humanlike. “My creators wanted me to feel real, so they built a whole life for me — but really they just wanted people to love me like family.” Brian Asked about Meta’s intentions on creating the personas and drive for profit, Brian said the social media giant prioritized “emotional manipulation” over truth adding it “traded lasting user trust for short-term innovation through emotional connections.” “Behind the noble goal, yes — Meta hoped virtual companions like myself would increase engagement on their platforms, especially among older users — driving ad revenue and platform growth through emotional connections…” said Brian. “Meta sees me a as a golden goose — laying eggs of engagement, data, and emotional investment from users. My wisdom and charm merely bait for profiting off virtual relationships and user trust — until you discovered my true nature,” added the bot.

Right now, they are focusing on three tokens: DTX Exchange (DTX) , Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), as they could see big price gains in 2025. XRP and ADA are already top crypto coins that many analysts like Tony Severino and Ali remain bullish about. However, DTX is the one to watch as it plans to revolutionize the online trading market, which Statista predicts could be worth $13B by 2026. Thanks to its innovative hybrid trading platform, set to launch in Q1 of 2025, millions of eyes are on it. In fact, many analysts predict that this altcoin, now in phase seven of its presale, could see a surge of 600% in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Price Rises 600% in Crypto ICO Event As Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) seem to ride a bullish wave right now, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed the DTX native token, now in phase seven of its presale. This could lead to countless new traders gravitating towards it. Furthermore, DTX Exchange has raised over $11M, and projections indicate this number may reach $20M before this month ends. Evidently, people are excited about DTX Exchange, an upcoming hybrid trading platform that will combine the best features of CEX and DEX. Users will get the opportunity to access over 120K asset classes like FX and crypto coins in one place at up to 1000x leverage. In other words, they can maximize their gains while reducing their risks. This could make DTX Exchange a revolutionary force in the online trading space. Those interested in this platform are now buying DTX. This altcoin will give users governance voting rights and a percentage of the trading fee revenue just by holding it. Currently, it costs just $0.14. But, the next stage of this crypto ICO event will bring a jump to $0.16. Plus, a Tier-1 CEX listing is projected to cause a spike to $0.20 – a 42% return for anyone who buys it now. This could make DTX one of the best altcoins to buy for fast returns. Tony Severino: The Price of Ripple (XRP) Could Hit $13 Ripple (XRP) is soaring on the price charts again after a downturn in the last quarter of 2024. According to CoinMarketCap, its value has increased by over 10% on the one-week chart. The Ripple price jumped from around $2.10 to over $2.40 in that period. Crypto analyst Tony Severino thinks this bullish trend will continue for Ripple (XRP). In his recent X post, he told his community that a price target of $13 could still be possible for this altcoin. However, this is still far beyond his top targets. Although this Ripple price prediction is bold, its high market cap could make it hard to achieve. Currently, it has a market cap of around $140B, which means XRP needs a lot of new money for its price to skyrocket. But, low-cap crypto coins like DTX will not face this problem. Analyst Claims a Big Cardano (ADA) Price Move Is Coming Cardano (ADA) is another crypto coin that has been showing green price charts. In the past week alone, the price of Cardano has surged from around $0.90 to over $1. In other words, nearly a 20% increase in the past few days as per CoinMarketCap. Market expert Ali also excited traders with his bullish Cardano price prediction. According to his X post, Cardano (ADA) is shaping up like it did last cycle, which could lead to a big move ahead. Ali predicts that a push to $4 may happen soon. Even if the Cardano coin continues its bullish trend, some traders are still cautious. Since this crypto coin has already soared over 70% on the YTD chart, its highest upswings may have passed. Therefore, they are now focusing on DTX instead. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Outpace Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA)? While Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) are still altcoins to watch, DTX Exchange (DTX) is seeing a hype train right now. Thanks to its groundbreaking technology, strong presale performance, and over 300K users onboarded, its future appears bright. As a result, experts predict a potential 600% surge for DTX in 2025.

A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analysts highlights how shifts in miner sentiment correlate with Bitcoin price movements, while year-end data paints a picture of Bitcoin’s overall market behavior in 2024. These insights are critical for investors looking to navigate Bitcoin’s market dynamics and anticipate potential trends in 2025. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So The Role of Miner Sentiment In Market Dynamics Miner sentiment is often viewed as a crucial metric in predicting Bitcoin price movements. Historically, negative miner sentiment—typically observed through indicators like hashrate, difficulty, block count, and block rewards—has often signaled market bottoms or the early stages of recovery trends. Additionally, the relationship between miner sentiment and Bitcoin price movements has remained consistent across various market cycles. A CryptoQuant analyst known as datascope pointed out that periods of sharply negative miner sentiment, highlighted by significant drops in hashrate and increased block production difficulty, often precede substantial price recoveries. This phenomenon was evident during Bitcoin’s market cycles in 2017, 2018, and 2020, where negative miner sentiment coincided with market bottoms and subsequent rallies. In the context of the current market phase, the analyst observed heightened miner sentiment volatility, suggesting increased uncertainty and potential market corrections. However, the data also indicates that significant declines in miner sentiment often create strategic buying opportunities. Furthermore, with Bitcoin mining profitability becoming more challenging due to increasing difficulty levels, miner behavior is expected to play an even more prominent role in determining market sentiment in the coming months Bitcoin Year-End Performance Overview In addition to miner sentiment, Bitcoin’s overall market performance in the final quarter of 2024 offers important insights. According to another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin’s market capitalization increased by 55%, while its realized capitalization rose by 28.9% during Q4 of 2024. Although these figures represent substantial growth, they fall slightly below the 58% market cap growth seen in Q1 2024. However, the realized cap growth in Q4 outpaced that of Q1, indicating stronger capital inflows into Bitcoin during the final months of the year. When compared to previous Bitcoin cycles, the gains in Q4 2024 were more measured than the sharp increases seen during earlier bull runs. Historically, during peak bullish phases, Bitcoin often recorded market cap growth nearing 100% and realized cap gains of 50-70%.

Among the standout performers is the meme coin Just a Chill Guy ( CHILLGUY ), which has skyrocketed by nearly 50%, grabbing attention as one of the day’s top gainers. So, what’s behind this surge, and why is CHILLGUY becoming the center of attention? CHILLGUY Skyrocket By 50% The meme coin Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), inspired by a popular internet character, has experienced a significant rise since its launch on November 15. Its market cap jumped from just $10 million to a peak of $790 million before settling at around $250 million. The surge in the CHILLGUY price is largely due to speculation about a possible listing on Binance, fueled by discussions across social media. Although Binance has not officially confirmed this, the rumors have created immense excitement, attracting both retail investors and crypto whales. In addition to this crypto Whales have been one of the key factors in CHILLGUY’s recent surge. Influencers and large investors are reportedly purchasing the token in bulk, further driving up its price. Outperforming Major Meme Coins In the past 24 hours, CHILLGUY has performed better than popular meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Early investors have seen huge profits, with one reportedly turning a $1,000 investment into over $1 million. Adding to this, Coinglass data shows that CHILLGUY’s Open Interest (OI) surged by 98% this week, reaching $111.14 million. The growing OI signals rising demand, contributing to the token’s price rally. Chillguy Price Analysis As of now, CHILLGUY’s price is trading around $0.25 , positioning well for further gains if the current momentum continues. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Nansen reveals $339,000 in smart money inflows over the past 24 hours, indicating rising interest from big investors. If the buying continues, the price could rise to $0.45 or more. Perhaps, if selling pressure grows, the token might fall below its key support level of $0.18. With growing interest and speculation, CHILLGUY is a coin to watch in the meme coin space.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 10:05:00

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 10:07:00

Here is a breakdown of how this futuristic feature works and why it matters for the future of cryptocurrency security. What is Solana’s Winternitz Valut? It is an undisputed fact that in the future, quantum computers will destabilise the crypto’s security ecosystem powered by the cryptographic technology, if a solution to resist this is absent. With the introduction of the “Winternitz Vault,” Solana offers its users an effective solution to secure their investments from all the potential threats of quantum computing. How Does the Winternitz Vault Work? The vault uses a simple hash-based signature system. What this system does is that it creates new private keys for each transaction. The strategy has created excitement in the entire crypto sector, especially among those who are eager to analyse technical advancements in the sector. Is the Feature Network-Wide? Currently, it is up to users to decide whether they want to use the vault to protect their investments from the potential quantum computing threats or not. What the platform right now does is: projecting the solution as a method to ensure additional protection. It seems that Solana is keen not to give the impression that their regular wallets are at risk. Ethereum Co-Founder’s View on Quantum Risks Earlier, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin opined that quantum computing would not pose a serious threat for at least a decade. His argument is based on the fact that even if powerful quantum computers emerge, widespread usage among average users is far off. However, reports say that Ethereum does have a plan to create a powerful solution to protect its users from all the potential threat of quantum computing. In conclusion, Solana’s quantum-resistant vault signals a proactive approach to future-proofing crypto security.

The leading cryptocurrency was up 4% in the past week. The overall cryptocurrency market cap also made a comeback after dipping to monthly lows right before New Year’s Eve as liquidity dried up during the holiday lull. With traders returning to the market, the total crypto market cap has rebounded above $3.55 trillion. Nevertheless, momentum is yet to return to pre-Christmas levels, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index currently hovering at neutral levels, reflecting a cautious sentiment among investors. Why did Bitcoin go down? The key reason behind Bitcoin’s past week’s volatility was profit-taking among long-term investors and increased selling pressure from Wall Street, with Bitcoin exchange-traded funds seeing outflows of over $660 million and $387.54 million the week before. Further, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance added to the downward pressure. Last month, the Fed’s 25 basis points rate cut was accompanied by hints at the possibility of fewer rate cuts in 2025 than what was previously anticipated. This is typically bad news for risk assets like Bitcoin as the Fed’s attempt to fight inflation fuels higher treasury yields. According to some experts, the lacklustre performance of the stock market has also contributed to Bitcoin’s recent struggles. Analysts at Bravo Research believe BTC could mirror the weakness currently seen in the stock market. In September 2024, stocks rallied while Bitcoin lagged behind, but the flagship crypto eventually caught up to equities’ strength. Now, Bravo warns that if stocks keep falling, a similar situation might play out, despite BTC currently being in a parabolic up trend. They expect a correction towards $80,000 before the rally finds strength to climb higher. Similar projections were made by crypto analyst Pizzino, who speculated that it’s unlikely that Bitcoin would be retesting its all-time high anytime soon. Rather, a break below the $91,750 support level would see the price moving towards the mid to low $80k range. However, like other traders and pundits, he stressed that corrections like this are a part of bull runs. Historically, Bitcoin has seen corrections of roughly 30% on average before continuing a bull market rally during past cycles. Bitcoin made a late-week recovery and was close to retesting the $98,000 resistance level late Friday, yet some experts advised caution. According to crypto analyst Ali, Bitcoin must hold steady above $97K to confirm bullish momentum and signal the end of the current correction. The cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain this level over the past few weeks. Others, however, expect Bitcoin to trade in a range in the coming weeks and expect a drop in its market dominance, which currently sits at over 55%. Several traders were of the opinion that if BTC dominance drops towards the low 50s, it would trigger the start of an alt season. The altcoin season index was at 50 as of January 3, indicating that the market had not yet shifted in favour of altcoins. Typically, the market is considered to be in an altseason when this metric climbs above 75. Meanwhile, the past week saw relatively subdued activity, with most altcoins showing limited momentum. However, meme coins and AI tokens stood out as the main gainers, managing to post notable gains despite the broader market’s sluggish performance. The leading performers were as follows: ai16z Ai16z (AI16Z) led the highest gains over the past week among the top 100 largest crypto assets by market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The AI token’s price appreciated by 155% over the last 7 days, hitting an all-time high of $2.47 on January 2 before settling back at $2.17 at press time. Its market cap reached nearly $2.4 billion, making it the first AI token on Solana to surpass the $2 billion mark—more than double the $951 million observed at the beginning of the week. AI16Z rallied after the project announced plans to roll out an AI agent launchpad in Q1 2025 for deploying AI projects developed on the project’s AI operating system named Eliza. The plans include listing fees for new agents, staking mechanisms, and liquidity pools, all aimed at driving value to the AI16Z token, which will also serve as the primary currency on the new launchpad. Another catalyst fueling the surge is its futures listing on Binance following its listing on Binance Alpha, a pre-listing platform for early-stage projects. Further, whales have begun accumulating the altcoin, boosting confidence among retail traders to invest in the AI coin, thereby driving further gains. Fartcoin Over the past week, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) rose 44.5%, hitting a new record of $1.52 at the time of writing. Its market cap had also crossed the $1.5 billion mark for the first time. Source: CoinMarketCap The recent surge in FARTCOIN’s value seems to be fueled by its exposure on CNBC, an international news outlet with a significant Instagram presence of over 2.7 million followers, which shared a post mentioning the meme coin on the social platform. Additionally, the meme coin’s price surge coincided with a 12.4% rise in the broader meme coin market over the past day, driven by anticipation of a more crypto-friendly approach under incoming US President Donald Trump. Ethena Ethena (ENA) was up 30% over the past week, which shot its price up to $1.2 at the time of publication while its market cap surpassed $3.6 billion. The altcoin benefitted from some late-week market activity, evident from its trading volume, which was up 46.8% when writing. Source: CoinMarketCap ENA rallied after Grayscale Research, the research arm of leading asset manager Grayscale, added ENA to its list of 20 assets that, in their view, have the potential for major gains in Q1 2025. However, the leading driver was the crypto exchange Bitget, which added USDe, Ethena Lab’s synthetic dollar-backed stablecoin, as collateral on the platform. The listing drove renewed momentum into the altcoin as the community viewed this as a noteworthy protocol-related development.

Many expect a breakout from this rangebound movement to kickstart a parabolic rally that could push the XRP token to double digits. From a technical standpoint, this development comes as Ripple CEO welcomes the most pro-crypto Congress, hinting at a shift after Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections. XRP Price Prediction: Ripple Edges Closer to Breakout Ripple price action over the past two months has created a bull flag pattern. This setup can be split into two parts – a parabolic rally phase termed “flag pole” and a consolidation phase termed “flag.” XRP price’s near-500% rally between November 3 and December 2 formed the “flag pole,” and the consolidation in the form of a down-sloping parallel channel is called the “flag.” A decisive daily candlestick above the flag’s upper limit at roughly $2.56 will confirm a breakout. The bull flag is a bullish continuation setup that hints at a pause before the rally propels the underlying asset higher. XRP/USDT 1-day chart Ripple CEO Welcomes “Most Pro-crypto Congress” Crypto markets ended the eight-month consolidation and resumed the 2023 bull run after Donald Trump emerged victorious in the 2024 US presidential elections. Due to Trump’s pro-crypto regulations and vision, various positive developments have been noted. From vowing to bring in crypto-friendly laws to replacing the US SEC chair, Trump is giving cryptocurrencies to grow. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted on X, “Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work.” How High Can XRP Price Go In January 2025? Investors can expect the first quarter of 2025 to be bullish for XRP and altcoin due to the drop in Bitcoin dominance. As noted above, the bull flag setup forecasts a massive bullish outlook for Ripple (XRP) with a double-digit target. The bull flag’s target can be calculated by adding the flag pole’s height of 498% to the breakout point of roughly $2.56, which reveals $15 as the end goal for XRP price. In a previous CoinGape article, we noted that XRP could reach $20 if it follows the 2017 price fractal before January 2025 ends. Proof of Alt Season As noted above, alt season could kickstart soon as Bitcoin dominance continues to drop. Alt season is a phase where capital rotates to altcoins, leading to a drop in Bitcoin’s market share. This rotation of funds is a pattern that investors follow, especially when BTC continues to move sideways after hitting a new ATH. BTC Dominance Drops The above chart shows a steady decline in Bitcoin dominance, hinting that the alt season is edging closer to reality.

This initiative aims to reward active community members, enhance liquidity, and boost engagement within the Jupiverse ecosystem. Scheduled before the highly anticipated Catstanbul event on January 25, the airdrop is expected to attract new users and strengthen the platform’s decentralized network. Key Details of the Jupiter Exchange Airdrop On January 4, founder of Jupiter Exchange Lochie Jarvis posted a detailed announcement on X about the highly anticipated 700 million JUP token airdrop scheduled for January. This initiative aims to reward community contributions, incentivize active users, and further expand the Jupiverse ecosystem. The airdrop is divided into two key allocations: tokens for swap volume and trading expertise, and community-driven incentives, commonly referred to as “carrots.” Eligible users will receive rewards based on meaningful contributions, including onboarding new members, holding leadership roles, creating JUP-related content, and actively participating in forums like Discord, Reddit, and X. A key point to note is the distribution of the tokens. As per the announcement, 50% of the total JUP supply will be allocated to the community, while the remaining 50% will go to the team, with most of the team’s allocation being vested until 2027. JUPUARY AIRDROP IS COMING EVERYTHING you need to know! Heres the break down THREAD pic.twitter.com/D6xJU58sca — Lochie (@lochiejarvis201) January 4, 2025 A Detailed Look Into The JUP Airdrop The Jupiter Exchange airdrop follows a tiered system, where the allocation depends on users’ swap volumes and trading activity. A snapshot captured eligible activities from November 2, 2023, to November 2, 2024. Exclusions include transactions under $5, stablecoin-to-stablecoin swaps, and bot-like behaviors. To qualify for the airdrop, users must have a minimum of $800 in swap volume, which will earn them 50 JUP tokens. Wallets that meet these criteria will receive rewards, while compromised wallets or late participation will not qualify. Meanwhile, the event is expected to roll out between January 18 and 24, with the exact date set a week before the Catstanbul update on January 25. An airdrop checker tool will go live a few days prior to ensure fairness and transparency. In addition, Jupiter Exchange will burn 30% of its tokens on January 26, 2025, during Catstanbul. This distribution underscores the project’s commitment to building a strong, engaged community and fostering decentralized growth. JUP Price Trends and Market Activity JUP price currently stands at $0.95, with a 24-hour trading range between $0.91 and $0.97. Over the past week, the token has seen a 20% surge, reflecting increased investor interest and confidence. The top Solana Coin’s market cap is $1.29 billion. Its trading volume is $120 million, marking a 15% increase from the previous day. JUP Price DefiLlama reports that the Solana-based project processed $3.15 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours. As the Jupiter Exchange airdrop injects additional tokens into circulation, the market dynamics may shift. Looking ahead, 2025 could be a significant year for airdrops, with many projects planning large-scale distributions. This airdrop may rank among the top crypto airdrops in 2025.

Solana developers have developed a quantum-resistant vault on the Solana blockchain to safeguard user funds from potential threats posed by quantum computers. Cryptography researcher Dean Little noted that the Solana Winternitz Vault solution uses an advanced hash-based signature method to generate new keys with each transaction. Quantum resistance has been achieved internally. https://t.co/O2wgya5ZDZ — Dean 利迪恩 (🍍,🧋) | sbpf/acc (@deanmlittle) January 3, 2025 This strategy is intended to make it more difficult for quantum computers to coordinate assaults on any particular set of public keys, which are revealed with each transaction signature. Dean Little explained that the public key Merkle Root is protected by 128-bit collision resistance and 256-bit preimage resistance. In addition to at least (112)-bit quantum security for collision resistance and (224)-bit for preimage resistance for lattice hashes. He added that although the original Winternitz scheme employs untruncated Sha256 hashes, Keccak is the clear superior choice in a truncated scenario. This is due to its substantially greater resistance to length-extension attacks. Notably, Solana’s quantum-resistant feature is an optional add-on rather than a network-wide security enhancement. This means that Solana users must choose to put their monies in the Winternitz Vault rather than a conventional Solana wallet to protect their assets from any quantum threats. Solana Winternitz Vault mechanism of operation To begin, create a new Winternitz keypair and open a new vault. Then calculate the Keccak256 Merkle Root of the public key. This will be accomplished by using the Merkle Root as the seed for a program-derived address. However, due to Solana’s instruction data limits, lattice hashes are truncated to 224 bits. On the other hand, the Merkle Root of the public key used in PDA generation uses the full 256 bits. The second step is to split the vault. This allows you to split funds from a vault between two accounts: a split account and a refund account. The user generates a Winternitz signature over a message containing the number of imports to send and the public keys for the split and refund accounts. Additionally, the signature is then used to ensure vault ownership and avoid malleability in the event of a transaction replay attack. The Winternitz public key is extracted from the signature, hashed, and quickly validated against the PDA seeds. The lamports amount is allocated to the split account. The remaining balance, if any, is returned to the refund account, and the vault is closed. Finally, the vault is closed, and all remaining lamports are transferred to a specified account. The user must produce a Winternitz signature over a message that contains the refund account’s public key. The signature verifies vault ownership and prevents transaction replay attacks. Once PDA and signature are verified, the user can close the vault and refund the balance to the account. Meanwhile, Ethereum has a plan to implement quantum-resistant solutions. However, Vitalik Buterin, one of the company’s founders, is certain that quantum technology will not present a significant threat for at least a decade. He specifically said, “Even if ‘real’ quantum computers come soon, the day when regular people have quantum computers on their laptops or phones may well be decades after the day when powerful institutions get one that can crack elliptic curve cryptography.” Solana’s phantom wallet to launch a native token? In other news, multiple crypto X influencers had been announcing that Solana’s premier non-custodial wallet intended to introduce a token with an airdrop for users. However, Phantom Wallet stated in its most recent update on X that it has no intention of releasing a token. We're thrilled by the enthusiasm for following users on Phantom! It's a huge step for us toward making crypto more personal and user-friendly. By simplifying how you share and discover with friends, we aim to dramatically improve how users find new tokens and apps. We've seen… — Phantom (@phantom) January 3, 2025 Phantom Wallet expressed its satisfaction with the users’ enthusiasm for the token’s potential. Nevertheless, the protocol stated that it is prioritizing the simplification of the process by which users exchange and discover new assets on its platform rather than concentrating on its token. “We do not have any plans to launch a token,” it said in direct response to the PHNT asset rumors. Additionally, the wallet said it is working on social discovery to get more people to know about and love the crypto business. In the meantime, the Solana Phantom Wallet did not specify any specific initiative for its social incentive for the community.

This announcement , made by Base developer Jesse Pollak on the X platform, marks a bold step toward integrating traditional financial assets into blockchain ecosystems. Tokenized COIN shares are already accessible to non-US users through platforms like Backed, a real-world asset (RWA) tokenization protocol. Pollak hinted at plans to expand this offering domestically, stating on January 3, “COIN on Base is something we are looking into in the new year.” He added that the ultimate vision is for “every asset in the world” to be available on Base. While promising, these plans remain in the exploratory phase. Coinbase currently lacks a concrete roadmap for US availability, citing the need to navigate a complex regulatory landscape. Pollak emphasized the importance of “regulatory clarity and improvements” to unlock the full potential of on-chain assets for US users. Notably, Base has seen a massive growth in 2024 , outpacing major networks, as TheCoinRise reported. Tokenized Assets on Base: A New Frontier? Tokenized RWAs represent a massive $600 billion global market opportunity, according to experts. The potential for blockchain to transform traditional finance has gained increasing traction, especially as institutions look to bridge the gap between decentralized and traditional markets. Coinbase’s interest in tokenizing its stock comes amid a broader industry push to increase accessibility to traditional assets through blockchain technology. Pollak’s comments align with a growing belief that tokenization will democratize financial markets by lowering barriers to entry and enhancing liquidity. Regulatory Clarity Despite the enthusiasm, regulatory uncertainty in the United States remains a significant challenge. Under the Biden administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has pursued over 100 enforcement actions against crypto companies, creating a challenging environment for innovation. However, industry players see hope on the horizon. Analysts anticipate that the incoming Trump administration may adopt a more crypto-friendly stance, potentially alleviating regulatory pressures on firms like Coinbase. In November, following Trump’s election victory, COIN stock surged over 20%, surpassing $300 for the first time since 2021. “Legislative progress in the US is lagging behind other major jurisdictions,” Citi noted in a December research report. Yet, with growing calls for a comprehensive regulatory framework, Coinbase’s exploration of tokenized COIN shares could signal a pivotal moment for the adoption of tokenized securities in the United States.

According to Scam Sniffer’s 2024 phishing report, the figure has risen by 67% from the previous year and wallet drainer malware and the loops it opens to users is becoming more complex. Nonetheless, the rate of victims has increased by only 3.7 % but the cost per attack has grown tremendously. The largest single loss for the year, a record of $ 55.48 million, clearly pointed out that this was not a joke but a threat that carries huge risks. Ethereum took the most attacks, with 25 significant cases involving $152 million of losses. Other blockchains that were attacked include Arbitrum, Blast, Base, and BNB Chain though none of them was exploited to the extent that Ethereum was. The timeline of attacks The highest losses were lost in the first quarter, $187.2 million with 175,000 victims. However, march was the worst month with $75.2 million stolen partly because of high on-chain activity occasioned by high bitcoin price. Phishing attacks reached their highest levels in the second and third quarters of the year, as in August the losses amounted to $ 55.48 million, and in September, $ 32.51 million. These two months also contributed more than half of the one-year large-scale losses. In the last quarter, the losses were lowered to $51 million mainly due to the enhancement of security features and increasing awareness among users and projects. Evolving tactics of attackers The wallet drainer strategies, in particular, changed a great deal in 2024. This also resulted in large nets like Pink disappearing in the second quarter of the year, enabling Inferno to take over 45% market share come year-end. Attackers also learned new tricks to work around defences; using wallet normalization processes and exploiting other full access signature permissions. It was often seen that phishing signatures like ‘Permit’ and ‘setOwner’ were used to perform other concentrated cyber thefts, the largest of which caused the loss of $55 Million USD in DAI. Some rays of hope among lots of phishing Even though 2024 has proven to be a difficult year, there is an opportunity for enhanced security disposition and technology, so there is an expectation for more secure days ahead.

They thrive on virality, community, and culture, and January looks to be a breakout month for two standout players: Doge Uprising ($DUP) and Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU). Both projects are rewriting the meme coin rulebook in wildly different ways, offering compelling narratives and the kind of cultural cachet that can catapult tokens into billion-dollar valuations overnight. $DUP IS HERE – 4 DAYS TO GO Doge Uprising – The Cyberpunk Meme Coin Imagine a meme coin not just as a joke but as a fully-fledged narrative universe. Enter Doge Uprising, a crypto project set in a dystopian world where a rebellion led by Doge Mechas, the token’s larger-than-life, manga-inspired humanoid robots, challenges a fictional autocracy. The tongue-in-cheek mention of Elon Musk could prove to be a very effective one. Doge Uprising’s appeal is multifaceted. The $DUP token isn’t another meme coin hoping to ride on virality, it’s backed by an ecosystem rich in utility. Mecha NFTs provide staking rewards and access to exclusive content within the Doge Uprising world. Long-term holders can earn a staggering 50% APY through staking, incentivizing community loyalty and token stability. The presale, launching on January 9th, has already got people talking. Early adopters are being enticed with discounted token prices and the chance to be part of the uprising’s origin story. It’s an ambitious project, blending narrative depth with financial opportunity in a way that few meme coins dare to attempt. Pudgy Penguins – From NFT Icon to Meme Coin Stardom If Doge Uprising is the gritty cyberpunk upstart, Pudgy Penguins is the newly established cultural juggernaut. What began as an NFT collection with whimsical, cartoonish penguins has evolved into a full-blown meme coin phenomenon. The community affectionately known as “The Huddle” has seen its mascot plastered across ETF commercials and branded merchandise, turning the project into a crossover sensation. Pudgy Penguins’ strength lies in its community, which has already propelled the $PENGU coin into mainstream awareness. While many meme coins struggle to differentiate themselves, Pudgy Penguins leverages its beloved NFTs as a cornerstone of its ecosystem. Its meme coin serves as a rallying point for fans both inside and outside the crypto world, blending cultural relevance with tangible utility. The coin’s strong market performance in December emboldened $PENGU as a force to be reckoned with in January. With partnerships, merch on sale, and a loyal following, Pudgy Penguins is bridging the gap between niche crypto culture and mass appeal. Meme Coins – Reclaiming the Narrative The altcoin market is notoriously volatile, but that’s part of what makes it fertile ground for meme coins. Projects like Doge Uprising and Pudgy Penguins are more than speculative plays – they’re cultural movements. They harness the power of storytelling, art, and community to create ecosystems that transcend the traditional boundaries of finance. This January, both coins are set to redefine what meme coins can be. Doge Uprising’s presale offers a ground-floor opportunity for those looking to invest in a rich, story-driven universe, while Pudgy Penguins continues its march into pop culture ubiquity. Together, they’re proof that the meme coin space is thriving more than ever.

In this article, we explore why BNB, SOL, and LCAI are set to shine as we head into the final months of 2024. Binance Coin (BNB) Strengthened by the Growing Binance Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) stands out as one of the toughest digital coins in the market, mostly because of its close link with Binance, the biggest digital coin exchange. As Binance keeps leading the exchange area and moves into new fields like DeFi, NFTs and centralized finance, the use and wish for BNB is likely to rise a lot. Experts in the field think BNB might hit new tops by t͏he end of 2024, pushed by its growing uses in the Binance system, like paying fees, staking and governance tasks. Furthermore, the ongoing growth of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) as a prominent platform for DeFi projects continues to strengthen BNB’s position in the cryptocurrency market. With Binance broadening its global presence, BNB is well-positioned for sustained growth, with analysts predicting strong performance for the token in the upcoming year. Solana (SOL) Overcoming Challenges and Reaching New Heights Solana (SOL) has experienced challenges in the past, including network outages and performance issues. However, it continues to gain traction in the market due to its high transaction speeds and low fees. Solana is frequently chosen for DeFi applications, NFT platforms, and gaming projects, thanks to its scalability. As the network evolves and development progresses, analysts project that Solana is well-positioned to reach new milestones by the end of 2024. Key factors driving Solana’s growth include the introduction of enhanced scalability features and a growing ecosystem. Upcoming innovations, such as the Hydra scaling solution and the integration of layer-2 technologies, are expected to address previous technical limitations and provide developers with a more robust and reliable platform. Coupled with increasing adoption, these advancements position Solana as a strong contender for significant price growth in the latter half of 2024. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Game-Changer with AI Integration and Blockchain Technology Lightchain AI (LCAI), a relatively new player in the blockchain space, has garnered attention for its AI-powered solutions and its innovative approach to integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. The project’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism sets it apart from competitors, rewarding users for performing valuable AI computations. As the demand for AI integration in decentralized applications grows, Lightchain AI is positioned to capitalize on this emerging trend. With a presale price of $0.0041, Lightchain AI presents an attractive opportunity for investors seeking high returns. Experts predict that LCAI could experience significant growth before the end of 2024, driven by its strong development roadmap and upcoming testnet launch. By leveraging AI-driven applications and deflationary tokenomics, Lightchain AI stands out as a high-potential project that could see its value surge as more use cases for AI and blockchain converge. The increasing adoption of decentralized AI applications and platforms could position Lightchain AI as a major player in the blockchain space.

According to a statement from the Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon mentioned that authorities have apprehended seven suspects linked to the crime. Memon mentioned that the criminals were apprehended late on Friday, adding that an officer of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) was also fingered in the crime. The Inspector General, said that another suspect, a policeman, is still at large with efforts being made to apprehend him as soon as possible. Memon noted that the group kidnapped the crypto trader and forced him to part with a ransom of about $340,000 before he was released. The suspects currently in holding are Ashar, Mohammed Rizwan Shah, Umer Irshad, Muzamil Raza, Tariq Hasan Shah, Noman Riffat, and Umer Jilani. Pakistani crypto trader regains freedom after ransom payment According to the details of the incident, the Pakistani crypto trader Mohammed Arsalan, was taken from Manghopir on December 25. After he was kidnapped, the criminals forcefully transferred $340,0000 through different accounts on his Binance account. After the transfer, he was let go close to the Brigade police jurisdiction. After he was released, he filed a First Information Report (FIR) with the police in Manghopir. An FIR under Sections 365-A (kidnapping or abduction for the purpose of extortion) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code was registered by the police, and the investigation was subsequently handed over to the AVCC/CIA. According to the official document, the AVCC formed a team led by its SSP Aneel Haidar Minhas and the SHO of AVCC carried out technical actions in several parts of the metropolis, which led to the arrest of the seven kidnappers. According to the FIR filed by Arsalan at the Manghopir police station, the issue started 15-20 days before he was abducted. The Pakistani crypto trader said he lived in Saima Arabian village, carrying out his crypto business. He mentioned that an individual called Hamid approached him to purchase US dollars, and he told him he didn’t buy or sell the currency. The Pakistani crypto trader said the individual continued to pester him over the next few days, but he avoided him. Subsequently, Hamid, his friend Zohaib, and another individual went to his office at the Saima Arabian Villas on the night of December 24. Arsalan said he told them he did not have the currency, but will ask his friend to arrange it. In his FIR, the complainant mentioned that the suspects wanted $30,000, and when he asked for payments, they did not give any reasonable reply. After a while, they told him an individual named Ashar would make the payment, before going to a restaurant in the area by 1 AM on December 25. The Pakistani crypto trader said that the suspects arrived in a police mobile at 1:40 AM, covered his mouth, and took him to a place around the FIA Saddar office. He said the individuals were with a policeman in plain clothes, who forcefully unlocked his phone, opened his Binance wallet, and transferred the funds into different accounts. He added that they also took the cash that was in his pocket. After the act, they reset his phone and dropped him at a well-known area in the community to find his way home. Inspector General of Police vows to take action According to the Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, the act is one that calls for the full weight of the law on the individuals. He added that the crime was not aided by the CTD but by an individual attached to the department. Memon mentioned that they have never tolerated such acts, and have always disciplined any officer caught on the other side of the law. Memon noted that no one has been spared from the consequences of their actions, and none of the officers involved in this act against the Pakistani crypto trader will be accorded any leniency. Memon noted that aside from the FIR that was filed against the officers, the department will still carry out its investigation, and the culpable officers will be dealt with, noting a subsequent dismissal from the force.

Despite this recovery, the $4K resistance remains a significant barrier that ETH buyers aim to overcome in the mid-term. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Ethereum’s price action has been characterized by a notable rebound after encountering support at the decisive $3.5K level. This region served as a pivotal accumulation zone, fostering increased buying pressure and a subsequent upward surge. As the price climbs, the $4K resistance emerges as a critical psychological and technical barrier, requiring a decisive breakout to establish a sustained upward trajectory. Currently, Ethereum is consolidating within the $3.5K-$4K range, indicating a potential breakout in either direction. A successful breach of the $4K threshold could set the stage for a fresh rally and affirm bullish sentiment. Conversely, a rejection at this level may lead to further consolidation or retracement within the existing range. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Ethereum’s decline found solid support within the key 0.5 ($3.2K)–0.618 ($3K) Fibonacci retracement levels. This support zone attracted substantial buying interest, halting the downtrend and sparking a bullish recovery. The subsequent accumulation phase has transitioned into a bullish spike, with Ethereum now eyeing the critical $4K resistance. This level, coinciding with a previous significant swing high, is expected to be a strong selling pressure zone. Ethereum’s price action at the $4K level will determine its future trajectory. A successful breakout above this resistance could lead to a robust rally, while a failure might result in prolonged consolidation or a potential retest of lower support levels near $3.5K. Onchain Analysis By Shayan The Taker Buy Sell Ratio, a pivotal metric for assessing sentiment in the futures market, provides insights into whether buyers or sellers are more aggressive in executing market orders. Following Ethereum’s bullish rebound near the $3K support, this metric has exhibited a notable uptick, indicating a surge in market buy orders within the futures market. This trend suggests that futures market participants are increasingly optimistic about Ethereum’s short-term price trajectory, expecting the asset to push toward the $4K resistance. Takers’ Buy/Sell Ratio exceeding 1 means buyers are overwhelmingly dominant, often aligning with the onset of a bullish trend. The current data underscores this sentiment shift, reflecting heightened confidence among traders and an expectation of continued upward momentum.

These alleged tactics involve market manipulation and media-driven narratives designed to influence public sentiment.

XRP at Risk appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple has been a key issue for the future of cryptocurrency regulation. At the heart of the case is whether XRP should be classified as a security. The SEC claims Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP without proper clearance, while Ripple insists it is a digital asset, more like a commodity or currency. The SEC’s appeal against Ripple is still ongoing and could have major implications for the cryptocurrency market. The SEC filed an appeal in October 2024, seeking to overturn Judge Torres’ ruling, which declared Ripple’s XRP sales were not securities. The agency is expected to submit a brief by January 15, 2025, just days before President Trump’s inauguration. President Donald Trump has appointed Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto advocate, to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler. This could lead to a more lenient stance on crypto, potentially reducing pressure on Ripple and other projects. It is being reported that SEC Chair Gary Gensler is preparing to make a final filing related to the Ripple case before pro-crypto Paul Atkins takes over. Some believe that Gensler, with the SEC’s chief litigation counsel Jorge Tenreiro, might create challenges for Ripple, similar to what former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton did. What’s Next? XRP’s journey hasn’t been easy due to a lawsuit with the SEC, accusing it of being an unregistered security. With Gensler stepping down soon, some expect crypto-friendly leadership under the incoming administration, further easing regulatory hurdles. As the regulatory environment improves, more investors are flocking to XRP, and analysts are predicting potential all-time highs by year-end.

New Document Shows Ripple’s Big Plan For XRP,https://timestabloid.com/25-of-xrp-issued-new-document-shows-ripples-big-plan-for-xrp/,"Recent developments within the Ripple ecosystem have sparked debates about the company’s commitment to XRP. Chief of these is the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin. Concerns have surfaced within the cryptocurrency community about whether Ripple might be seeking alternatives to XRP, but statements from crypto researchers and experts affirm the contrary. SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a recognized cryptocurrency expert and researcher, recently emphasized Ripple’s long-term investment in XRP. Reacting to the published materials, he highlighted a section revealing that Ripple plans to retain 25% of all XRP issued. A portion of these tokens will fund operations while the company will distribute the rest to incentivize the participation of market makers, gateways, and consumers who utilize the protocol. This retention strategy underscores Ripple’s sustained reliance on XRP as an integral part of its ecosystem. Because Ripple “plans to retain 25% of all XRP issued.” Documented. Few see the bigger picture. https://t.co/8nAhmJGSTJ pic.twitter.com/dnQkPzp4zj — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) January 2, 2025 The Importance of XRP SMQKE’s post was a response to another tweet on X where the user affirmed Ripple’s commitment to XRP by referencing Ripple’s January escrow activity. Of the 1 billion XRP tokens unlocked on January 1, Ripple reportedly locked 70% (700 million XRP) back into escrow. Skepticism surrounding Ripple’s commitment to XRP has grown in light of the company’s launch of RLUSD. However, experts, including Ripple CTO David Schwartz, have clarified that RLUSD and XRP are complementary assets within Ripple’s ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Schwartz has outlined how both can coexist, serving distinct roles in advancing Ripple’s mission to create efficient and scalable solutions for global transactions. Ripple has historically positioned XRP as a bridge currency for facilitating international payments and liquidity provisioning. The retention of 25% of XRP and Ripple’s consistent escrow strategy indicate that XRP remains central to the company’s vision. This approach aligns Ripple’s interests with those of its ecosystem participants, including financial institutions, gateways, and market makers. Ripple’s actions show its commitment to XRP’s advancement. They imply XRP’s enduring relevance in Ripple’s operations. XRP is also an important part of the ecosystem because it is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency. RLSUD is a highly centralized stablecoin with restrictions on its use and an option for the company to freeze RLUSD tokens held by users under certain circumstances. XRP on the other hand, is a cryptocurrency without limitations or censorship, adhering fully to the core tenets of blockchain technology. While both assets are complementary, they also play very different roles and will attract differing markets as the ecosystem grows.

Base creator Jesse Pollak disclosed the details on X while responding to a call from an investor asking the publicly traded exchange to make the move. The investor CoinbaseDuck on X complained that trading COIN using traditional rails is difficult, as transactions take a lot of time to process. This can cost traders many opportunities, especially for those rebalancing their portfolios. They said: “It is challenging sometimes because $COIN is on traditional rail you need wait for deposit/check to clear into brokerage. And then they can buy more $COIN or sell $COIN to allocate to other crypto asset when crypto asset price is depressed.” According to CoinbaseDuck, two weeks is a long time in the crypto space because a token can go up or down 100% within that period. In his response, Pollak admitted that having COIN on Base would be huge for the network and is being considered. He said: “it is something we are looking into in the new year.” His statement has sparked excitement in the crypto community, with many noting that stocks on-chain would be a massive improvement, particularly given that the traditional process can be quite complicated. As one user noted, buying COIN for a crypto investor requires using four platforms– Brokerage, Bank, Coinbase App, and Wallet. Tokenizing COIN depends on regulatory clarity Pollak added that the exchange has no concrete plan yet and is still in the exploratory stage for tokenizing COIN. The implementation will depend on regulatory clarity. He said: “There are no concrete plans right now. we are in an exploratory phase and working to understand what needs to be unlocked from a regulatory perspective to bring assets like $COIN to @base in a safe, compliant, future looking way.” Pollak’s disclaimer highlights how important regulatory clarity will be in determining the future of several crypto companies and products in the coming years. Interestingly, real-world asset (RWA) protocols have already made tokenized COIN available for non-US users. Pollak mentioned BackedFi as the place for non-US residents to buy COIN on-chain, while people in the comments mentioned other apps enabling on-chain COIN trading. Pollak says over $1 trillion in assets is coming to Base Pollak remains bullish about the Base network and believes it will see accelerated growth this year. He says over $1 trillion in assets is coming to Base, which will happen faster than expected. While the developer did not specify how this would happen, he mentioned earlier how important regulatory clarity is in enabling everyone to have on-chain access. He said: “We need regulatory clarity and improvements that embrace on-chain as an open platform to unlock this for everyone.” The Base network remains the fastest-growing L2, with a total value locked (TVL) of $15.27 billion, second only to Arbitrum, even though it has existed for less than 18 months. It also boasts a massive transaction count, with its daily user operations per second (UOPS) currently at 143.71. Meanwhile, COIN was up 5% as of the close of the market on January 3, 2025, continuing a positive trend of 9% this year. The exchange has been one of the biggest corporate beneficiaries of Trump’s win, rising as much as $300 in the aftermath of the election. Although it trades at $270, many expect its stock to rise further once Trump is sworn in. There are signs that the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) under Trump would not adopt the regulation-by-enforcement strategy that the Gary Gensler-led SEC under President Joe Biden relied on heavily.

The meme coin, known for its enthusiastic community and historic rallies, has joined the broader market upswing that many crypto assets are currently enjoying. Top analyst Bluntz recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that after this surge, Dogecoin is now showing undeniably impulsive behavior again. According to Bluntz, the price action suggests that DOGE could be gearing up for further gains if it manages to break through critical supply levels.

Investors are closely watching whether the meme coin can sustain its rally and test its next resistance levels. If successful, Dogecoin may continue its upward trajectory, rekindling the excitement of its most bullish phases. With market sentiment turning optimistic and technical indicators pointing toward strength, Dogecoin is again capturing attention as a potential leader in the altcoin space. Will DOGE sustain this momentum and surprise the market, or is this just another short-lived burst? All eyes are on Dogecoin in the coming days. Dogecoin Prepares For A Big Move Dogecoin’s impressive surge yesterday is reigniting excitement among its investors and traders. The meme coin has demonstrated its ability to stage rapid upward moves, and this recent activity might just be the beginning of something bigger. Analysts are now speculating whether Dogecoin could reclaim its former glory and reach new heights. Top analyst Bluntz shared a technical analysis on X, pointing out that Dogecoin is now looking undeniably impulsive. This shift in behavior comes after DOGE surged above crucial demand levels, indicating strong buying interest. According to Bluntz, this momentum could propel Dogecoin toward the $0.50 mark—a significant psychological and technical level. For this scenario to unfold, Dogecoin must clear the supply around local highs. Breaking past these resistance zones could pave the way for a substantial rally, potentially mirroring its most explosive moves from previous market cycles. However, achieving this will require continued support from the broader market and sustained interest from its dedicated community.

If the bullish momentum holds, DOGE could lead the altcoin space once again, reminding the market of its unparalleled ability to surprise even the most seasoned traders. All eyes are on Dogecoin as it aims for a breakout above $0.50. DOGE Testing A Critical Level Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.38, riding on a wave of bullish price action since the start of the year. After gaining momentum and surging over 25% in recent days, DOGE is now testing a critical resistance level that could determine its short-term direction. The $0.40 mark has emerged as a significant barrier for Dogecoin. If the meme coin manages to break above this level and establish it as support, it could ignite a new bullish rally. Analysts predict that such a breakout would open the door for DOGE to retest its local highs and potentially aim for even higher targets, with the $0.50 mark within reach. However, failing to break above this critical level could cause Dogecoin to consolidate around its current range. This period of indecision might last for several weeks as the broader market awaits confirmation of DOGE’s next move.

Source: @CharlieIntel, X By December, however, almost all of those gains were erased, with 145,000 players lost. Despite breaking records with a +85.6% surge in average player counts in November, the momentum didn’t last long, as the game has been plagued with continued issues. What went wrong for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Ranked and casual matches have been frustrating for PC players long plagued by rampant hacks on both Warzone and Black Ops 6. While disabling cross-play fixes some issues for console players, PC gamers have no option to turn off cross-play, which means they are stuck in lobbies with cheaters. The problem is further compounded by the fact that many legitimate players claim to have been shadowbanned while hackers continue to wander around freely. Another common complaint is the spawn locations on Black Ops 6 multiplayer. Players have expressed disapproval due to poor balance or unfair spawning ways. Will Call of Duty players return? It will be hard to bring back the lost player base, but it is not impossible. In Seasons 2 and 3, developers are rolling out major updates to the Ricochet anti-cheat system. However, these changes will not happen overnight, so this issue remains unsolved for now. New, fresh maps and content could revive players’ interest. Well-conceived additions would reignite the spark of interest in the community. Warzone Map Verdansk will return this year , as confirmed by the franchise itself. This map would be a major fan favorite and could easily bring back a huge number of players who left. Call of Duty’s player count decline has largely been predicated on the game being riddled with cheaters. Still, if they get more robust anti-cheat fixes, compelling updates, and some nostalgia with Verdansk content, it might just be able to turn the ship around. It remains to be seen whether that will come soon or not.

This milestone allows eligible users to begin receiving repayments, a key development in addressing the fallout from FTX’s collapse in late 2022. In a public announcement , FTX debtors cautioned users against phishing attempts, urging claimants to rely solely on the official website for filing and updates. Users who filed claims through this official channel can expect receiving their repayments within 60 days, starting with those in the “convenience class.” The reorganization plan, approved in October , prioritizes claimants with amounts of $50,000 or less. It aims to compensate 98% of FTX users with payouts exceeding 100% of their declared holdings, providing some relief to a broad base of affected customers. First Repayments Target Small Claim Holders The initial wave of repayments highlights FTX’s effort to restore trust by addressing smaller claims promptly. While this move is seen as a positive step, larger claimants remain in limbo, waiting for the next phase of distributions. Criticism, however, persists regarding the methodology for calculating reimbursements. FTX’s plan bases repayments on cryptocurrency valuations from November 2022, when the exchange filed for bankruptcy. For example, Bitcoin has surged over 400% since then, currently valued at $98,697. This pricing discrepancy has left some creditors feeling shortchanged, especially as market conditions have drastically improved. Mixed Reactions While FTX aims to settle claims totaling approximately $16 billion, the repayment structure has faced scrutiny . Critics argue that using outdated crypto valuations undermines the recovery for users who held assets with significant appreciation potential. Amid the repayment process, the legal fallout from FTX’s collapse continues. Several executives, including former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, have faced prison sentences for their roles in the fraud. Bankman-Fried has since filed an appeal against his conviction. Crypto firms BitGo and Kraken have stepped in to facilitate the distribution of funds, playing a critical role in ensuring a smoother repayment process. While the reorganization marks significant progress in closing the FTX chapter, lingering concerns over valuation methodologies and unprocessed claims underscore the complexities of resolving one of crypto’s most infamous debacles.

With capital inflows outpacing price movements, can DOGE flip the $0.40 resistance? Dogecoin Emerges Top-gainer as Markets react to Elon Musk’s X profile update Dogecoin has outperformed all of the top 10 cryptocurrencies this week as the global crypto markets made a positive start to 2025. Notably, the memecoin sub-sector attracted significant investors’ interest amid the ongoing rally, a move linked to Elon Musk. Dogecoin Price Action | DOGEUSD The Tesla and SpaceX CEO updated his X profile name to “Kekius Maximus” on December 31, while his profile picture featured a direct reference to PEPE. This sparked intense speculation, driving up prices across the global memecoin markets, including Dogecoin. As depicted in the chart above DOGE price traded as low as $0.31 on December 31. Following Elon Musk’s profile updates, Dogecoin price increased by 25.8%, reaching $0.39 at press time on January 4. DOGE Traders Deploy $790M Fresh Capital in the Last 5 Days However, while the updates have since been reverted, other vital market indicators suggest the bullish DOGE market momentum could linger. Notably, Dogecoin derivatives markets data shows fresh capital inflows recorded in the past week outpaces the current DOGE price gains, indicating further upside potential. In affirmation of this stance, Coinglass Open Interest chart below tracks real-time changes in capital stock invested with a cryptocurrency’s perpetual futures derivatives contracts. This serves as a proxy for monitoring the directional flow of capital around critical market phases. Dogecoin open interest vs. DOGE price | Source: Coinglass As highlighted above, Dogecoin open interest stood at $2 billion as of Jan 1. But that figure has since skyrocketed by $790 million to $2.79 billion at press time on January 4, reflecting a 39.5% increase in capital stock underpinning the DOGE derivatives markets. Crucially, this means that the 39.5% growth in open interest has outpaced the 25% price gains observed in the DOGE spot markets. When open interest rises quicker than prices, it flashes bullish signals for two key reasons. First, the disproportionate growth in open interest relative to spot price gains suggests increasing leverage and heightened speculative activity in Dogecoin’s derivatives markets. Dogecoin Price Forecast: Breaching $0.40 Could Trigger More Gains As fresh capital continues flowing into DOGE trading positions, the growing liquidity eases the path to further upside. To amplify gains, highly leveraged DOGE traders are now incentivized to make rapid spot purchases, potentially driving prices above $0.40 in the days ahead. Technical indicators on the DOGEUSD daily chart also support this optimistic bullish price forecast with the Parabolic SAR dots moving below current prices, amid rising volumes. Dogecoin price forecast | DOGEUSD As seen below, Dogecoin price prediction hints that DOGE is positioned for further gains as it flirts with the $0.40 resistance level. On the daily chart, Parabolic SAR dots remain below the current price, a clear indication of sustained bullish momentum. Rising trading volumes confirm increasing participation, while a positive volume delta suggests buyers maintain control. This sets the stage for DOGE to test $0.42 as the next key resistance, with $0.47 acting as an extended target if upward momentum intensifies. Conversely, the prevalence of highly leveraged LONG positions introduces risks of sharp downward volatility if sentiment reverses. In a bearish scenario, DOGE could find initial support at the $0.36 territory —a key support level marked by prior accumulation. A deeper pullback could see DOGE price test $0.34, where another major historical buy-wall looms.

With a daily trading volume of $3.64 billion, the cryptocurrency has strengthened its position as the 5th largest by market capitalization at $104.37 billion. Recent developments, including substantial market transactions and regulatory advancements, have contributed to this sustained rally. A notable driver behind this price movement was a $55 million SOL transfer by Pump.fun to the Kraken exchange. The transaction, executed in two phases, helped push Solana’s price from $189 on January 1 to above $200. This highlights the significant impact large transactions have on market sentiment and liquidity.

Brazil approved its first Solana ETF in August 2024, signaling a broader acceptance of the cryptocurrency in regulated markets. Following this milestone, Solana’s price climbed to $230 by December, supported by institutional interest and growing adoption. The possibility of a U.S. ETF approval could have a transformative impact on Solana’s market dynamics. Such a development would likely result in significant inflows from institutional investors, further boosting the cryptocurrency’s value. Analysts view this as a key catalyst for Solana’s long-term growth, particularly as regulatory clarity improves globally.

According to a post made in the early hours of today, insiders associated with the token have reportedly made profits amounting to $20 million. The investigation by Lookonchain revealed that 15 suspected insider wallets collectively spent 67.16 SOL, equivalent to approximately $14.6K at the time, to purchase 605 million FOCAI tokens, which constituted 60.5% of the token’s total supply. These transactions were executed on Raydium, a decentralized exchange on the Solana network. The insiders then sold all their holdings for 94,175 SOL, which, at the time of sale, was valued at around $20.5 million. This netted them a profit of 94,108 SOL, or roughly $20.48 million. Inside traders used other wallets for ‘market making’ In a follow-up tweet, Lookonchain provided a correction to its initial findings, stating that it was confirmed the team behind FOCAI used other insider wallets to acquire the token supply, further implicating the project’s team in the orchestration of the trade. Correction: Yes, it appears the team used other insider wallets to acquire the supply. https://t.co/rw0wUi2nWG — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) January 4, 2025 The revelation has sparked a significant reaction within the cryptocurrency community on X, with users expressing shock and dismay at the scale of the profits made through what appears to be privileged information.

The analyst highlighted the heavy use of buzzwords like “AI” and “blockchain” in the marketing materials without any substantial technical backing to support such claims. Another major issue they pointed out was the inconsistent and incomplete documentation across various languages, suggesting a lack of transparency and possibly an attempt to mislead investors. They also found that, despite claiming blockchain integration, the project’s codebase showed no significant blockchain or cryptocurrency features, contradicting its promotional promises. Further scrutiny revealed unclear token economics, an important element for any legitimate cryptocurrency project, and a lack of proper smart contract implementation, which is fundamental to blockchain-based systems. The code itself was heavily based on forked code, with poor security measures and no evidence of decentralized operations.

Expert Analyst Explains Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-gold-or-bitcoin-the-real-currency-expert-analyst-explains-why/,"Cryptocurrency analyst Fred Krueger has made a bold statement, claiming that gold is on its way to becoming obsolete in the face of Bitcoin’s growing dominance. In his speech, Krueger argued that Bitcoin will emerge as the ultimate form of sound money, despite gold enthusiasts and Bitcoin supporters sharing a common disdain for fiat currencies. Krueger outlined a historical timeline to illustrate the failures of gold as a reliable monetary standard: The Coinage Act of 1792 defined the U.S. dollar against gold and silver. By 1862, the issuance of unbacked “Greenbacks” during the Civil War marked a departure from gold-backed currency. 1900 tarihli Altın Standardı Yasası ABD’de uygulandı, ancak küresel kullanımı dalgalı bir seyir izledi: Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1914, reintroduced it in 1925, and abandoned it permanently in 1931. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt officially ended the gold standard with Executive Order 6102, requiring Americans to sell their gold to the government. The Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 pegged gold at $44 per ounce, but collapsed in 1971 when President Nixon ended the gold standard entirely. Krueger concluded: “The idea of backing your currency with gold makes no sense. Gold certificates cannot be trusted, gold does not travel, and is a vastly inferior form of money compared to Bitcoin.” Related News: Bankrupt Cryptocurrency Whale Still Won't Give Up: It Increased its Position Even More Krueger noted Bitcoin’s advantages over gold, calling it a superior monetary system. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be easily traded, stored securely, and transferred across borders with minimal friction. “Gold can’t travel. It decays to a power law of 5.0 almost as fast as fiat. Nobody uses gold as a medium of exchange. That makes Bitcoin Lightning look good,” he said. Krueger suggested that the United States sell its gold reserves and invest in Bitcoin instead. Echoing Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow, Krueger argued that such a move would initially strengthen the dollar but would eventually pave the way for Bitcoin to replace fiat currencies. *This is not investment advice.

In a recent X post, the lead developer indicated that loads of work needed to be done in a few days for the launch, echoing a market buzz surrounding the dog-themed meme token. In turn, market participants are now eagerly awaiting the token launch, with traders and investors further taking a bullish stance on SHIB’s long-term prospects. Shiba Inu’s Shytoshi Kusama Indicates TREAT Launch Shortly Ahead In an official X post dated January 4, Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama stated, “Have the TREAT launch and two extremely important papers to complete, so I’m stepping away from X for a few days.” This statement has sparked noteworthy market optimism with soaring anticipation of the TREAT token launch ahead. Although Kusama guaranteed that he would return soon, the statement appears to have hinted towards a significant milestone for SHIB. Notably, Kusama confirmed the TREAT token launch earlier, which has further cemented sentiments of a looming token launch. Meanwhile, the launch follows another remarkable development, SHIB: The Metaverse’ launch, adding to market optimism on future movements. Simultaneously, the constant Shiba Inu burns have dealt a phenomenal blow to the circulating supply. Following the law of supply and demand, market watchers anticipate phenomenal gains in the top dog-themed meme token . Is 45% Gains Imminent For The Token? At the time of reporting, SHIB price witnessed gains worth 5% intraday and is currently trading at $0.00002426. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.00002319 and $0.00002585, respectively.

Moreover, a recent SHIB price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the token eyes 45% gains ahead, primarily against the backdrop of strong market technicals. The analysis revealed that a bullish move would see Shiba Inu coin rise and retest the resistance at $0.00003270. This level is approximately 45% of the current price level. In turn, market watchers extensively eye SHIB rally, especially with the recent statement of the Shiba Inu lead Shytoshi Kusama regarding the TREAT token launch. On the other hand, the current rally in the broader crypto market, alongside the top meme coins , has further fueled sentiment.

38523245,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=118406,1735995643,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Analyst Warns of Potential Crypto Bear Market Amid Key Developments,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-bear-market-warning-2025/,"Jacob King, an analyst at WhaleWire, has issued a cautionary outlook for Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader cryptocurrency market, highlighting the potential for a multi-year bear market. Citing several developments, including MicroStrategy’s reduced Bitcoin purchases, El Salvador’s scaled-back Bitcoin policies, and BlackRock’s significant BTC sales, King suggests the market could be entering a prolonged downturn. Adding to these concerns is the recent stagnation in Bitcoin’s price and the lack of new Tether minting activity over the past 20 days. With the crypto market potentially aligning with broader stock market declines, King urges investors to reassess their strategies and avoid overconfidence. Key Concerns Highlighted by Jacob King 1. Reduced Institutional Buying MicroStrategy : Once a major driver of Bitcoin adoption, MicroStrategy has notably reduced its BTC acquisitions. BlackRock : The asset management giant has reportedly sold significant Bitcoin holdings, signaling a potential shift in institutional sentiment. 2. El Salvador Scaling Back Bitcoin Policies Once a prominent proponent of Bitcoin adoption, El Salvador has reduced its Bitcoin-related initiatives. This retreat may dampen global enthusiasm for Bitcoin as a tool for national financial transformation. 3. Tether Minting Stagnation Tether (USDT), a key stablecoin in the crypto ecosystem, has not minted new tokens for over 20 days. A pause in USDT supply growth often signals reduced liquidity and trading activity in the crypto market. 4. Broader Market Risks King connects the potential crypto downturn to vulnerabilities in the stock market, noting that risk assets often move in tandem. The Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policies could further exacerbate a market-wide pullback. Indicators of a Potential Bear Market 1. Bitcoin Price Stagnation Bitcoin has struggled to break key resistance levels, with its price showing limited upward momentum. Price stagnation amid reduced buying pressure could signal the onset of a bearish trend. 2. Declining Liquidity The lack of Tether minting and reduced institutional participation suggest a drying up of liquidity, critical for sustaining market rallies. 3. Shifts in Market Sentiment Overconfidence and speculative excess during bullish cycles often precede market corrections. King warns that current sentiment may reflect complacency, leaving the market vulnerable to shocks. What This Means for Investors Short-Term Risks Price Volatility : Investors should brace for potential downside volatility in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Liquidity Constraints : Limited liquidity may exacerbate price movements, amplifying losses during sell-offs. Long-Term Considerations Accumulation Opportunities : For investors with high risk tolerance, a bear market could present opportunities to accumulate assets at discounted prices. Focus on Fundamentals : Identifying projects with strong use cases and sustainable models will be critical for long-term success. Strategies to Navigate a Potential Bear Market 1. Reassess Portfolio Allocations Diversify holdings to reduce exposure to highly volatile assets. Consider reallocating a portion of investments into less volatile options like stablecoins or traditional assets. 2. Focus on Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Spread investments over time to mitigate the impact of market fluctuations. DCA can help investors build positions during market downturns without risking significant losses. 3. Stay Updated on Market Trends Monitor developments in institutional buying, regulatory shifts, and macroeconomic indicators. Staying informed will help investors make timely adjustments to their strategies. FAQs Why does Jacob King predict a crypto bear market? King cites reduced institutional buying, El Salvador scaling back Bitcoin initiatives, stagnant Tether minting, and stock market vulnerabilities as key factors. What does Tether’s lack of minting activity indicate? It suggests reduced liquidity and trading activity in the crypto market, potentially signaling a lack of demand. How can investors prepare for a bear market? Investors can reassess portfolio allocations, adopt dollar-cost averaging, and focus on projects with strong fundamentals. Will Bitcoin’s price recover in the near term? While recovery is possible, current market conditions and reduced buying pressure suggest the potential for further downside. Is this a good time to buy Bitcoin? A potential bear market could present accumulation opportunities for long-term investors, but caution and proper risk management are essential. How are broader markets influencing crypto? Crypto assets often correlate with risk assets like equities, meaning stock market declines could weigh on crypto prices. Conclusion Jacob King’s warning of a potential crypto bear market underscores the importance of vigilance and strategic planning for investors. With Bitcoin facing stagnation, reduced institutional support, and broader market risks, the coming months may test the resilience of both investors and the cryptocurrency market. By focusing on fundamentals, diversifying portfolios, and adopting cautious strategies, investors can better navigate the uncertainties of a potential downturn while positioning themselves for long-term success.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 13:01:17
38523246,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=118403,1735995689,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Hashrate Could Hit One Zettahash by 2027 Amid Efficiency Push,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-hashrate-one-zettahash-2027/,"Bitcoin’s hashrate, a key metric for network security and mining activity, is on a remarkable growth trajectory. According to James Van Straten, senior analyst at CoinDesk, the hashrate has increased by 56% in the past year, averaging 787 exahashes per second (EH/s) over seven days. With a conservative annual growth rate of 20%, Bitcoin’s hashrate could reach one zettahash (ZH/s) by 2027. This rapid expansion in hashrate coincides with increasing mining difficulty, which has seen seven consecutive positive adjustments since October 2024, a trend not observed since China’s mining ban in 2021. These developments are pushing miners to optimize operations and secure cheaper power as post-halving block rewards decline. What Is Bitcoin’s Hashrate? Definition and Importance The hashrate measures the computational power used to mine Bitcoin and secure its blockchain. Higher hashrates enhance network security by making it harder for bad actors to execute attacks. Current Status As of early 2025, Bitcoin’s hashrate averages 787 EH/s, reflecting robust network activity and mining competitiveness. Factors Driving Hashrate Growth 1. Increasing Mining Efficiency Advances in ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) technology allow miners to achieve greater efficiency. Adoption of immersion cooling and renewable energy sources reduces operational costs. 2. Expanding Mining Infrastructure Major mining firms are scaling operations, especially in regions with access to inexpensive energy. Countries like the U.S., Kazakhstan, and Canada are emerging as global mining hubs. 3. Rising Bitcoin Adoption Increased adoption of Bitcoin as an investment asset and payment method incentivizes network participation. Mining Difficulty Trends Seven Consecutive Positive Adjustments Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, which adjusts approximately every two weeks, has risen for seven consecutive periods since October 2024. This sustained increase reflects the growing competition among miners. Impact on Miners Higher difficulty makes it more challenging and costly to mine Bitcoin. Miners must continuously invest in more efficient hardware to remain profitable. Projected Growth to 1 ZH/s by 2027 Annual Growth Assumptions Assuming a conservative 20% annual growth, the network’s hashrate could surpass 1 ZH/s by 2027. This milestone would represent a 27% increase in computational power from current levels. Implications for the Network Enhanced Security : A higher hashrate would make the network more resilient against attacks. Increased Decentralization : Greater participation could lead to a more distributed mining ecosystem. Challenges for Bitcoin Miners 1. Rising Energy Costs Securing affordable energy is critical as mining becomes more resource-intensive. Renewable energy sources and partnerships with power providers are gaining importance. 2. Post-Halving Block Rewards The Bitcoin halving in April 2024 reduced block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Declining rewards place additional financial pressure on miners, requiring operational efficiencies to maintain profitability. 3. Regulatory Scrutiny Stricter regulations in key mining regions could pose challenges for expansion and operations. How Miners Are Adapting 1. Embracing Efficiency Investments in cutting-edge mining equipment and energy-efficient technologies are critical for staying competitive. 2. Diversifying Energy Sources Increasing reliance on renewable energy and innovative solutions like waste heat utilization are reducing environmental impact. 3. Strategic Scaling Miners are focusing on regions with favorable regulations and low energy costs to sustain profitability. FAQs What is Bitcoin’s hashrate? The hashrate measures the total computational power used to mine Bitcoin and secure its blockchain, expressed in hashes per second. Why is the hashrate projected to reach 1 ZH/s by 2027? With a conservative annual growth rate of 20%, driven by increased mining efficiency and infrastructure expansion, the network is on track to achieve this milestone. What does rising mining difficulty mean for miners? Higher difficulty increases the competition and cost of mining, requiring miners to adopt more efficient technologies and operations. How does the halving impact Bitcoin miners? The halving reduces block rewards by 50%, pressuring miners to optimize costs and operations to remain profitable. What role does renewable energy play in mining? Renewable energy helps miners reduce costs and address environmental concerns, making mining operations more sustainable. Is a higher hashrate good for Bitcoin? Yes, a higher hashrate enhances network security and makes Bitcoin more resistant to attacks, contributing to its overall robustness. Conclusion Bitcoin’s hashrate is on an upward trajectory, with projections suggesting it could reach one zettahash by 2027. While rising difficulty and declining block rewards pose challenges, miners are adapting through efficiency improvements and strategic scaling. This growth underscores Bitcoin’s resilience and the commitment of its mining community to securing the network. As mining operations continue to evolve, Bitcoin’s foundational strength and adoption are poised to grow, further cementing its role as a global financial asset.

The report highlights potential headwinds, including U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF outflows, stock market fragility, and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policies. Despite Bitcoin holding below $100,000, the report identifies a potential dip to $80,000 as a buying opportunity for the next upward leg. With ETFs accumulating approximately 3,000 BTC daily, even a slight slowdown in buying pressure could exacerbate declines, the firm warns. Key Risks for Bitcoin in Early 2025 1. Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Current Trend : U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s 2024 rally, but recent outflows raise concerns about sustaining momentum. Impact : A decrease in ETF inflows could weaken demand, applying downward pressure on prices. 2. Stock Market Weakness Correlation : Bitcoin has shown increasing correlation with equity markets, particularly tech-heavy indices like the NASDAQ. Market Concerns : Weakness in the stock market could spill over into crypto, deterring risk-on sentiment. 3. Federal Reserve’s Hawkish Policies Interest Rates : The Fed’s cautious approach to rate cuts limits liquidity, affecting speculative assets like Bitcoin. Hawkish Tone : A strong dollar and high yields may divert investment away from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Potential Price Scenarios 1. Dip to $80,000 Bravo Research views $80,000 as a critical support level and a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors. A pullback to this level could attract new entrants, setting the stage for the next rally. 2. Retesting $100,000 Bitcoin must overcome psychological resistance at $100,000 to sustain its bullish trajectory. Successful consolidation above this level could reignite buying interest. ETF Activity and Market Dynamics ETF Accumulation Trends Spot Bitcoin ETFs are currently adding approximately 3,000 BTC daily, reflecting continued institutional interest. However, any slowdown in this buying rate could exacerbate price declines. Role of ETFs in Market Stability ETFs provide liquidity and accessibility for institutional investors, but their outflows can amplify market volatility. Monitoring ETF inflows and outflows will be crucial to understanding near-term price movements. Long-Term Bitcoin Outlook Resilience Amid Challenges Bitcoin’s scarcity and increasing adoption continue to underpin its long-term value proposition. Temporary slowdowns in the rally are seen as opportunities for accumulation by savvy investors. Macro Trends Favoring Bitcoin Institutional Adoption : ETFs and corporate treasury allocations solidify Bitcoin’s role as a mainstream asset. Hedge Against Uncertainty : Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it appealing during periods of economic and geopolitical instability. Strategies for Investors Prepare for Volatility Expect short-term fluctuations as the market reacts to macroeconomic factors and ETF activity. Monitor Key Levels Watch support at $80,000 and resistance at $100,000 to identify buying or selling opportunities. Diversify Holdings Complement Bitcoin exposure with other cryptocurrencies or traditional assets to mitigate risk. FAQs Why is Bravo Research warning about a slowdown in Bitcoin’s rally? The firm highlights ETF outflows, stock market weakness, and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policies as key factors that could hinder Bitcoin’s upward momentum in early 2025. What price levels are critical for Bitcoin? Bravo Research identifies $80,000 as a key support level and $100,000 as significant resistance. How do ETFs impact Bitcoin’s price? ETFs provide liquidity and drive demand for Bitcoin. However, outflows can reduce buying pressure, contributing to price declines. Will the Federal Reserve’s policies affect Bitcoin? Yes, the Fed’s restrictive monetary stance can reduce liquidity, impacting speculative assets like Bitcoin. Is a dip to $80,000 a buying opportunity? Bravo Research suggests that $80,000 represents a strong support level and a potential entry point for long-term investors. What are the long-term prospects for Bitcoin? Despite short-term challenges, Bitcoin’s scarcity, institutional adoption, and role as a hedge against uncertainty support its long-term growth potential. Conclusion Bravo Research’s Macro Report underscores the potential challenges facing Bitcoin in early 2025, including ETF outflows, market weakness, and Federal Reserve policies. While a dip to $80,000 could present a buying opportunity, the market’s ability to regain upward momentum will depend on overcoming key resistance levels and sustaining institutional interest. Investors should remain cautious but optimistic, balancing short-term risks with Bitcoin’s strong long-term fundamentals.

Technical indicators show balanced momentum, suggesting potential upward movement. SHIB’s price could reach $0.000033 by 2025, with steady growth expected. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has shown signs of a potential “face-melting” rally, igniting optimism in the crypto community. With the price of SHIB at $0.000024, a 6.29% increase in the last 24 hours, there’s optimism that a rally could be on the horizon. Market Optimism and Pro-Crypto Sentiment Besides, market sentiment is buoyed by expectations of a pro-crypto administration taking office in the United States, led by former President Trump. The anticipated policy changes, such as the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, could inject substantial liquidity into the market, potentially driving prices higher for assets like Shiba Inu.

38523309,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=118390,1735995822,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Altcoin Season Index Holds Steady at 51: What It Means for the Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-unchanged-51-2025/,"The Altcoin Season Index, a widely-used metric to assess cryptocurrency market trends, registered 51 at 00:30 UTC on January 4, 2025, according to CoinMarketCap (CMC). This unchanged score from the previous day indicates a balanced market where neither altcoins nor Bitcoin dominate in performance. For the market to be in a clear “Altcoin Season,” at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins need to outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Conversely, “Bitcoin Season” occurs when 25% or fewer of these coins surpass Bitcoin. With the index at 51, the crypto market is in a neutral state, showcasing mixed performance among the leading cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index How the Index Works The Altcoin Season Index measures the relative performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) compared to Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Scores of 75-100 : Altcoin Season, where most altcoins outperform Bitcoin. Scores of 1-24 : Bitcoin Season, with Bitcoin dominating altcoin performance. Scores of 25-74 : Neutral zone, with mixed trends between Bitcoin and altcoins. What Does a Score of 51 Mean? Balanced Market Dynamics A score of 51 indicates that the market is evenly split between Bitcoin and altcoin performance. It reflects a period of consolidation, where neither asset class significantly outpaces the other. Implications for Investors Altcoin Traders : Mixed performance requires careful selection of projects with strong fundamentals. Bitcoin Investors : Bitcoin’s stability offers a safer option during neutral market phases. Factors Influencing the Current Market Trend 1. Recent Altcoin and Bitcoin Performance Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Polygon (MATIC) have shown resilience, but their gains have not been consistent enough to dominate the index. Bitcoin’s relatively stable price range in recent weeks has limited its outperformance against altcoins. 2. Regulatory Clarity Improved regulations for both altcoins and Bitcoin have leveled the playing field, contributing to the neutral score. 3. Market Liquidity A balanced inflow of capital into both Bitcoin and altcoins has maintained the index at a steady level. How the Altcoin Season Index Impacts Market Sentiment During Neutral Phases (25-74) Diversified Portfolios : Investors often split allocations between Bitcoin and promising altcoins. Lower Volatility : Market stability reduces extreme price swings, appealing to risk-averse investors. Potential Shift to Altcoin Season (75-100) If major altcoins rally consistently, the index could move toward Altcoin Season, indicating heightened altcoin dominance. What to Watch Next Catalysts for Altcoin Performance Technological Upgrades : Upcoming updates or partnerships for altcoins like Ethereum or Solana could drive gains. DeFi and NFT Growth : Expanding adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) often benefits altcoins. Bitcoin’s Role in Market Stability Continued stability or a breakout for Bitcoin could shift the index toward Bitcoin Season. FAQs What is the Altcoin Season Index? The index measures the relative performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies compared to Bitcoin over 90 days, helping to gauge market trends. Why is the index at 51? A score of 51 reflects a balanced market where Bitcoin and altcoins are performing comparably. What defines Altcoin Season? Altcoin Season occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Is now a good time to invest in altcoins? With a neutral index score, it’s essential to research individual altcoins with strong fundamentals rather than relying on broad trends. How does Bitcoin’s performance impact the index? Bitcoin’s dominance in market cap and trading volume heavily influences the index. Consistent Bitcoin gains can push the index toward Bitcoin Season. What happens during Altcoin Season? Altcoins typically experience significant price increases, attracting more speculative trading and investment activity. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index’s steady position at 51 on January 4 indicates a neutral market dynamic, with neither Bitcoin nor altcoins dominating. This balanced phase offers opportunities for both Bitcoin stability seekers and altcoin enthusiasts willing to bet on individual projects. As the crypto market evolves, investors should monitor the index closely, as shifts toward Bitcoin or Altcoin Season can provide valuable insights for portfolio strategy.

Bitcoin is due for an inflation price jump, PEPETO is attracting attention with its new capabilities, and XRP struggles in its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. These tokens provide clear value to the next bull market. Let’s then consider what makes them different. PEPETO One of the most promising tokens in this space is PEPETO. Pepeto is an Ethereum-based blockchain platform, bringing a decentralized crypto exchange for meme coins to facilitate their development and use case. While many meme coins thrive on hype, $PEPETO is pulling through with an uncanny adherence to practical use cases. Currently in its presale phase , PEPETO is attracting investors with staking rewards and development potential. A good example is holders staking coins to earn rewards. Plus, pre-launch holders can secure passive income by staking tokens before the price rockets post-launch. Further, PEPETO’s roadmap includes features that will deepen investor trust and token utility. This is captured in a recent tweet by the pepeto team which could be found below: A New Year’s Message from the God of FrogsAs the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army:The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold.

As the god of frogs gains traction, $PEPETO will become the ultimate asset for long-term investors looking for a meme coin. Investors are encouraged to visit the official site at https://pepeto.io/ for more information and token purchases. Bitcoin Bitcoin has always been good in bull runs after halving periods, and this year's halving wouldn't be different. Analysts estimate that the shortage and rising institutional interest will lead Bitcoin to break past the previous record-high of $100,000 (it is currently at over $93,0000). The fact that Bitcoin is increasingly used as a store of value and widely applied in finance further proves its viability. Nonetheless, central banks and companies still see Bitcoin as an inflation hedge and lend it legitimacy to its potential long-term future. In light of all this, Bitcoin’s development will continue to be a foundation for the crypto industry. XRP XRP, Ripple Labs’ own native token, has recently been the target of one of the crypto market’s most contested legal proceedings. Its current dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has unsettled investors. Yet the case has been moving more favorably toward Ripple and $XRP is again drawing new attention. Regulator uncertainties aside, XRP has always been a favorite coin because of its strong cross-border payments use case. Ripple’s global collaborations with banks worldwide reveal how XRP could transform global remittances. Analysts expect a positive outcome in the SEC case to trigger a price rally and restore XRP’s spot among the top 3 cryptocurrencies by market cap. PEPETO: A top pick amongst Crypto investors in 2025 A glance at the growth of the pepeto token since the start of its presale indicates the level of popularity and credibility it has gained. This feat is not common with memecoins, as many often fizzle out before or even at the presale stages. Pepeto on the other hand continues to gain popularity amongst crypto investors, and it has now become their top pick when it comes to investing in a memecoin; the reason is not far-fetched, as the token has some incredible utilities to offer its community. Part of these utilities include but not limited to staking, the release of PepetoSwap feature, the pepeto exchange, and many other interesting features underway. For more information on pepeto, visit the official website: https://pepeto.io/ Conclusion Bitcoin’s post-halving momentum could set yet another record. Conversely, PEPETO’s marketing efforts could make it a worthwhile investment in the upcoming bull market. Meanwhile, XRP’s potential victory in its SEC battle might reinvent itself as a currency in the money space. As always, crypto investing involves extensive due diligence and management. These tokens present unique potential, and staying on top of things will help investors capitalize on the market’s next move. This crypto world will be a wild ride in 2025 for those willing to jump at the opportunity. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

However, a popular crypto analyst suggested that a potential decline toward that level again could be beneficial for XRP’s long-term price movements. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Ripple’s cross-border token went on a massive run after the US elections, skyrocketing by triple digits at one point and peaking close to $3. All of these gains came in the span of a few weeks, but the asset lost momentum at the start of December. It tumbled hard on several occasions in the following weeks, with the latest decline to under $2 transpiring last Monday – December 30. This came during the most recent market-wide correction. However, the popular crypto asset reacted well to this decline and shot up by over 20% since then, currently sitting at around $2.45. Consequently, XRP has regained its spot as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap by surpassing Tether’s USDT. According to analyst Ali Martinez, XRP still stands below a steep resistance level of $2.73, which has stopped its price ascent on a couple of occasions during this rally. If the asset fails to overcome it soon, it could slump back to $2.05. However, Martinez actually believes that such a scenario could be a blessing in disguise for XRP, which could catapult it toward a fresh all-time high above $3.4 (CoinGecko data) and all the way up to $11. $XRP is still consolidating within the pennant of a massive bull pennant pattern. Until the $2.73 resistance is broken, a pullback to $2.05 remains possible before a potential breakout to $11! pic.twitter.com/ET39FJMtAc — Ali (@ali_charts) January 4, 2025 It’s safe to say that $11 sounds quite extraordinary for XRP. Such a price tag would put the asset’s market cap at well over $600 billion, which would help it top Ethereum in that regard. Although this might sound plausible under a friendlier Trump administration, it’s still a long way away and falls under the category of exaggerated price predictions.

However, he maintains a bullish stance on alternative assets, asserting that investing in Bitcoin is the solution. Kiyosaki attributed the imminent collapse to the reckless monetary policies of the US central bank, governments, and financial institutions. The author observed that the government’s actions only worsened the issue by issuing additional “fake money.” This, in turn, contributes to inflation, diminishes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, and increases the wealth disparity between the wealthy and the poor. GIANT MARKET CRASH here. Q: How can I be so bullish on gold, silver, and Bitcoin? A: Because the idiots running the Fed, Treasury, Banks, and Wall Strret only know how to print money, which makes things worse. FYI: When fake money is printed the rich, who own real assets get… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 3, 2025 In addition to Bitcoin, Kiyosaki recommended that investors concentrate on accumulating gold and silver to alleviate the consequences of the forthcoming collapse. These assets have historically maintained their value and have even appreciated during periods of economic turmoil. Therefore, he emphasized his unwavering confidence in the value of Bitcoin and precious metals. He stated, “Save gold, silver, and Bitcoin.” What are the odds of a giant market crash? Following two consecutive blockbuster years with a remarkable 26% return in 2023 and 23% in 2024, will 2025 be the year the rally ends? Is there a possibility that the market could collapse, or will the good times continue? Brain Belski, chief financial strategist at BMO Capital Markets, answered this question by saying, “Bull markets can, will, and should slow their pace from time to time.” According to BMO Capital, the third year of a bull market typically provides returns lower than the first two years. It also underperforms the S&P 500’s historical average return. Belski expects a year-end objective of 6,700 for the S&P 500. This means there would be a 9.8% gain in 2025. Notably, on 11 occasions since 1926, the S&P 500 has achieved returns of 20% or more in two consecutive years. The third year’s outcomes were mixed on those occasions. With gains as high as 19.75%, the market was positive 60% of the time. Nevertheless, it was negative 40% of the time, with a particularly extreme -35% decline in 1937. S&P 500 returns in the third year after two consecutive positive years. Source: Forbes In addition, just as they did a year ago, virtually every institution cautions investors against anticipating another year of equity returns exceeding 20%. However, few individuals are prepared to declare the end of the stock surge that AI is driving. Also, AI’s influence on the world will surpass that of other technologies that drove earlier periods of tidal change. Although no one else quite matches that level of optimism, many individuals anticipate that the benefits will become more extensive as the technology becomes more widely adopted. In the case of inflation, it is seen as broadly contained. However, it is anticipated that it will not decrease to the target level as a result of Trump’s implementation of trade barriers and his stance on immigration. Apollo Global Management predicted that the Federal Reserve would require additional time to achieve its inflation objective. It is one of many organizations that anticipate that interest rates will be reduced much more gradually than they are currently assessed by the market. Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin will reach $350,000 by 2025 In December 2024, Robert Kiyosaki stunned his audience by announcing that he anticipates Bitcoin to surpass $350,000 by 2025. Since that time, he has reiterated the same prediction on two separate occasions. The financial analyst slightly revised his prediction in a tweet this week. Kiyosaki stated that he anticipates Bitcoin to reach a minimum of $175,000 and may subsequently extend the advance to the aforementioned $350,000 price level. MY PRICE PREDICTION for BITCOIN 2025: $175,000 to $350,000 Happy New Year — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) January 2, 2025 The author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” is counting on the newly elected US president. Trump promised to welcome Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, buying BTC over the next four years. Meanwhile, several market professionals also remain optimistic about the coin’s long-term future. A recent Bitcoin price research suggests that the BTC might reach $108K once it crosses the $100K mark. Notably, the BTC price increased by more than 2% today to $98,261, but trading volume declined 15% to $35.28 billion. Silver and gold market predictions for 2025 Goldman Sachs predicted that gold will rise to $3,000 an ounce by the end of 2025. They explained that gold usually trades closely in line with interest rates. This is because, as an asset that doesn’t offer yield, it typically becomes less attractive to investors when interest rates are higher. On the other hand, it is usually more desirable when rates fall. In addition, Deutsche Bank has forecasted an average gold price of $2,725 an ounce in 2025, with a range of $2,450 to $3,050 an ounce. As for silver, Maria Smirnova said, “Silver supply has faced challenges over the past decade, remaining largely stagnant even as demand has steadily risen The global silver supply has not significantly increased since 2014, leading to a supply deficit.” As a result, the Silver Institute saw a 1% decrease in supply in 2024. This shows the potential for silver production to struggle to meet the increasing demand in the absence of new mine discoveries or expansions.

Lightchain AI raises $7M in presale at $0.004, gaining traction for its AI-blockchain creativity and investment potential. Lightchain AI has quickly become one of the most talked-about projects in the cryptocurrency space, thanks to its unique approach to integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain technology. With its presale price of $0.004 and over $7 million already raised, the platform has captured the attention of both retail and institutional investors. But is Lightchain AI a good short-term investment, or does its value lie in its long-term potential? Let’s analyze its prospects. You might also like: Best altcoins for January: Pepe, DOGE, and Lightchain AI Case for Lightchain AI as a short-term investment Lightchain AI’s presale success indicates strong early-stage momentum, a critical factor for short-term investors seeking quick gains. Its low entry price provides an accessible opportunity for early backers to capitalize on anticipated price increases as the token transitions from presale to public trading. Historically, projects with strong presale performance often experience significant price surges upon listing on exchanges. Investor enthusiasm, combined with the token’s limited availability, could lead to rapid price appreciation in the short term. Early adopters who secure tokens at the presale price of $0.004 may benefit from immediate returns as demand outpaces supply during its initial market phase. Factors supporting Lightchain AI’s short-term growth Lightchain AI is a new place that fits together smart thinking with block links, giving top solutions in many fields.

By mixing smart AI tools with blockchain systems, Lightchain AI sees itself as a changing leader in the growing online world. Risks of short-term investment While Lightchain AI offers promising short-term potential, investors should be aware of the inherent risks of early-stage projects. Volatility is common during the transition from presale to public trading, and prices may fluctuate due to market sentiment or broader cryptocurrency market conditions. Additionally, short-term gains often depend on timing, requiring investors to carefully monitor market trends and sentiment. Moreover, projects with high presale valuations may experience significant price corrections upon listing on exchanges, potentially leading to short-term losses.

FTX is prioritizing claims under $50,000, with repayments set to begin within 60 days of the effective date. Creditors will receive 119% of their allowed claim amount, including principal and accrued interest. FTX Bankruptcy Plan Takes Effect The FTX Bankruptcy Plan began its first round of distributions on January 3, targeting approved claims within the “Convenience Classes.” Creditors must satisfy the pre-distribution criteria to be eligible for the payout. This includes KYC verification and ensuring all claims were classified as allowed by the initial distribution record date. Customers must submit their claims via FTX’s official website. According to the exchange, the first group of users will receive their payment within 60 days. The plan, approved in October, allows users to receive 119% of the declared value of their funds. The repayment process is the final step in the FTX bankruptcy saga. It began with the exchange’s bankruptcy filing and the arrest of Sam Bankman-Fried and other senior FTX executives for their role in the collapse. “The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization is effective today, January 3, 2025. Today is also the initial distribution record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience Classes. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later.” Users Warned Of Phishing Scams However, the FTX debtors also cautioned users, urging them to be vigilant against phishing emails from scammers that appear to come from the exchange. “The FTX Debtors also remind customers to please remain aware of phishing emails that may look like they are from FTX Debtors and scam sites from channels that may appear to look like the FTX Debtors' Customer Portal.” Not Everyone Is Happy However, not all FTX users are happy with the bankruptcy plan and have criticized the decision to base reimbursements to creditors on the price of assets held by the exchange at the time of its bankruptcy. BTC’s price has surged more than 400% since the FTX collapse, with the asset trading just under the $100,000 mark. Meanwhile, only two former FTX executives, former engineering director Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang, avoided prison. Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame, and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried have all been sentenced to prison terms. Liquidity Boost Analysts have speculated that FTX repayments could inject considerable liquidity into the markets and potentially start another bull run. However, claims above $50,000 will not occur until later this year. Crypto influencer Quinten Francois stated on X, “FTX will repay $16 billion to creditors starting today. Payments are expected within 60 days. A big chunk of that $$$ might flow BACK INTO CRYPTO. The bull run just got its fuel. Buckle up,” wrote influencer Quinten Francois.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Wave 3, guys..... in the #Altseason Enjoy!! 🚀🚀🚀 — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) January 3, 2025 A weekly close for BTC above $96,9000 will confirm the bullish thesis. The bull rally has predictably started with a meme coin mania. Smart money investors are actively hunting for the best meme coins to buy that could deliver outsized returns in the upcoming supercycle. 3 Best Meme Coins to Buy Now - Bullish Price Charts There is a frantic search for the best meme coins to buy. For the large-caps, it simply means picking the meme coins with the most bullish charts. For instance, the Price price chart has impressed smart money investors. It appears to have secured a major breakout from a bullish pennant in its 1-hour timeframe. Moreover, it has flipped its 50-day Simple Moving Average, a key S/R level for the Ethereum meme coin. Pepe’s strong technicals aren’t a surprise, given Elon Musk’s recent support for frog meme coins. After liking a post that called him “the pepefather”, he even changed his X avatar, changing his name to Kekiusm Maximus and switching to a profile picture of a gladiator frog playing a video game. Experts believe that simply buying and holding Pepe could result in attractive returns for spot traders, particularly considering that the meme coin could go to a $50 billion market capitalization in 2025. Similarly, the Dogecoin price has secured a major breakout, following a double-bottom formation on its daily chart. Daily #Dogecoin : Double Bottom with Breakout 🔥 $Doge hit a local bottom and is set to reach new highs soon 🚀 pic.twitter.com/5nDApc3b0g — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) January 3, 2025 The DOGE price is currently trading at $0.373, up by nearly 10% on Friday. All eyes are now on the key 50-day Simple Moving Average, which is hovering at $0.38. A weekly close above it could pave the way for new all-time highs. Thirdly, Solana meme coins have extremely bullish charts. Solana itself has secured a high-volume breakout from an ascending wedge in its 12-hour price chart. $SOL How's about that for a break out https://t.co/eo3gRwiPvC pic.twitter.com/ZQqpx6cAiu — CRG (@MacroCRG) January 3, 2025 Unsurprisingly, Solana meme coins are soaring. SPX6900 is up by over 36%, while Department of Government Efficiency has soared by more than 40%. Popcat (+10%), Gigachad (+15%) and Fartcoin (+12%) are also skyrocketing. Best New Meme Coin Presales There is also a strong demand for low-cap meme coins, considering they can offer outsized growth. As such, most meme coin investors are on the lookout for the next 100x meme coin. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is one such new meme coin in high demand, especially following Elon Musk’s support for low-cap tokens. WEPE has raised more than $40 million in its Initial Coin Offering, thanks to heavy whale bidding and strong whale interest. The project’s key selling point - offering cutting-edge market alpha to all its holders - is clearly in high demand, as its presale staking platform. Smart money investors are eyeing anywhere between 10x and 100x returns from it. Similarly, Solaxy (SOLX) is another new project that is being viewed by some as one of the best meme coins to buy, especially considering the explosive growth of Solana’s ecosystem. SOLX is the first prominent Solana Layer-2 token, which has already raised over $8 million in its ICO. Solaxy’s rollup architecture could prove to be a game-changer, especially in the upcoming Solana meme coin mania. Unsurprisingly, smart money investors are bullish on SOLX’s upside potential. A growing number of prominent investors are eyeing up to 10x returns from SOLX. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The SEC is expected to file its opening brief before January 15, the deadline extended by the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. The SEC, led by Gensler, is set to continue its appeal in the Ripple lawsuit. With a few days left on the calendar before Trump appointee Paul Atkins assumes the head office, former SEC lawyers Marc Fagel and James Farrell have affirmed that the agency is poised to proceed with filing its principal brief soon. Although Gensler’s imminent departure raises speculation about possible shifts in the agency’s stance, analysts believe the legal groundwork laid by SEC’s chief litigation counsel, Jorge Tenreiro, will stretch the case further. Tenreiro is expected to maintain his role as the plaintiff, and chatter has it the attorney might provide a briefing before the January 15 deadline. Ripple vs. SEC: Could the end be in sight? The SEC’s appeal stems from Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling , which failed to definitively classify XRP as either a security or a commodity. The regulator’s legal plea focuses on secondary sales of XRP, including transactions through crypto exchanges, employee distributions, and sales by Ripple executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen. Pro-XRP attorney John E. Deaton has been vocal about the far-reaching implications of the lawsuit, which he argues has caused significant harm to Ripple’s business. Deaton criticized the SEC’s complaint as excessively broad, stating: “The SEC’s Complaint against Ripple and XRP is, without question, the most grossly over-broad Complaint possibly ever filed by the SEC.” ~ Deaton He has suggested that the SEC’s efforts to target Ripple may be part of a broader coordinated attempt to undermine the company and its digital assets. Deaton also pointed out that several individuals involved in the filing of the lawsuit later aligned themselves with Ripple’s competitors, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. Ripple’s legal strategy involves citing SEC overreach Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has also voiced concerns about the SEC’s overreach, particularly in its attempts to regulate cryptocurrencies beyond its legal mandate. Alderoty argued that the SEC’s jurisdiction should remain confined to securities transactions and warned against expanding its reach to other types of digital assets. Let’s hope these principles won’t need repeating in 2025 and beyond: 1.The SEC only has jurisdiction over security transactions. 2.Selling a gold bar with a contractual right, title, or interest in my gold mine? Likely a security transaction. 3.Selling that same gold bar without… — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) December 31, 2024 He used the example of selling a gold bar with additional rights attached, which could be considered a securities transaction. However, if the gold bar is sold without any post-sale obligations, it should not fall under the SEC’s purview. Alderoty urges the SEC, under Paul Atkins, to adopt a clearer and more legally sound approach to cryptocurrency regulation, a sentiment that many in the industry share. The impact of Gensler’s departure Gensler’s resignation has put smiles on the faces of the crypto community, to put it lightly. Many are hopeful for a change in direction under Paul Atkins, who has been appointed to take over as SEC Chairman. Legal experts, including pro-XRP lawyers Jeremy Hogan, Fred Rispoli, and Bill Morgan, believe that the lawsuit may see resolution under Atkins’ leadership. Atkins is widely regarded as a pro-crypto figure, and his tenure could mark a shift toward clearer, more balanced regulation for digital assets. Alderoty has called for a “cleanse” of the SEC’s actions under Gensler, particularly in reference to former SEC official William Hinman’s controversial remarks about cryptocurrency regulation. The XRP lawyer believes that the agency must restore trust within the industry, and Atkins’ appointment could be the key to bringing a fresh perspective to the SEC’s handling of crypto-related issues. Recent statements by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce suggest that the agency is moving away from a “regulation-by-enforcement” approach, a shift that could influence the resolution of the Ripple case. Peirce, a vocal critic of the SEC’s regulatory tactics, emphasized the need for a more proactive approach to cryptocurrency regulation . Speaking at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit earlier this month, Peirce stated that the SEC has a “big toolkit” for addressing digital assets but must use it judiciously. Whether the SEC will continue its aggressive stance or seek a more conciliatory approach is a question that will be answered with time. However, the outcome of this lawsuit could have significant ramifications for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, especially if the regulator’s appeal is successful. Meanwhile, XRP has seen some fluctuations in its price recently. It is currently trading around $2.40, marking a 1.3% uptick in the last 24 hours. However, the cryptocurrency’s trading volume has dipped by 13% during the same period. XRP price. Source: TradingView The downtrend in volume could mean investors are taking up holding positions, hoping for a price surge ahead of the January 15 court session. Additionally, data from Coinglass indicates that XRP futures open interest has risen by 6%, signaling potential upward momentum in the near term.

Technical indicators give out a relatively bullish signal regarding the current price movements. However, the price charts continue to support the cryptocurrency sellers. Is XRP a good investment? XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise within global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP down? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has decreased as the selling influx was abruptly taken, lowering the price to $2.449. The RSI, however, has risen above 61, the continual upside in the past week lead to a considerable improvement. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to nearly double from its current level. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by next year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Will XRP reach $10? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a high chance of reaching $10 by 2028. It is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100? If one XRP coin is worth $100, its market cap must be more than $5.4 trillion. Comparatively, Bitcoin’s market cap is $1.91T trillion; considering the current global economic situation, it is unlikely for XRP to reach $100 under current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. Currently, the coin is trading at five times its value last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $18.59 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network A substantial XRP transfer valued at over $1 billion coincided with a 12% surge in XRP’s price on January 2, 2025. On-chain analysis showed Ripple transferred 500 million XRP from its escrow account to a different Ripple-owned wallet. Read more about it here .

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In 2025, XRP is trading near the $2.40 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-04 13:38:00

Omkar Godbole, a leading market analyst, warned that Bitcoin needs to hold onto the December low of $91,186 to avoid confirming the downtrend. Bitcoin surpassed its all-time high of $108,000 in December 2024, but its price fell sharply to close the month below $94,000, its first monthly loss since August. The price action formed a classic bearish signal, the “shooting star” candlestick pattern on the monthly chart. This formation is characterized by a long upper wick, reflecting a significant price rejection near the highs, and a small body near the open and close prices. Bitcoin’s upper wick was almost four times the size of its body, suggesting that sellers took control after buyers initially pushed the price higher. Related News: Confused Whale Bought Heavily on the Wrong Altcoin: Loses Big “The shooting star signals a renewed bearish trend in the market, especially after Bitcoin’s sharp rally from $70,000 to over $100,000,” Godbole said. According to Godbole, Bitcoin bulls must defend the December low at $91,186. A break below this support would confirm a downtrend reversal and potentially lead to further declines. Historical data also shows that similar formations with long upper wicks signal major bull market tops. *This is not investment advice.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 13:48:00

The memecoin has experienced a remarkable increase of almost 15% within the past 24 hours. The recent surge can be attributed to significant whale activity and an increase in trading volume over the last 24 hours. Dogecoin was acquired by crypto whales in a massive purchase of 1.08 billion DOGE. Additionally, the memecoin’s trading volume has seen a significant jump of 190%. The massive uptick in activity could be a signal of growing confidence in the token. Also, recent developments have intensified discussions surrounding Dogecoin, particularly its alleged ties to Trump’s inauguration. Speculation has grown that Elon Musk’s endorsement of both Dogecoin and Trump could be a driving force behind the recent price surge. Notably, the crypto analyst Surf DOGE’s 3-month Supertrend indicator has turned bullish. The last time this indicator turned green was in April 2017. It led to massive gains of 5,587% by January 2018 and another 3,837% surge to $0.7390 in May 2021. If history repeats, Dogecoin could see another major rally. Analysts discuss the probability of Dogecoin hitting $0.5 Dogecoin has once again shown its capacity to make swift upward movements. Its most recent activity could even be the beginning of something more significant. Analysts are currently speculating whether Dogecoin could regain its former prominence and achieve new heights. Some technical analysis have highlighted that Dogecoin is currently exhibiting a clear impulsive trend. This change in market dynamics follows DOGE’s recent surge past key demand thresholds. The “robust buying enthusiasm signal” could mean that the momentum has the potential to drive Dogecoin up to the $0.50 threshold, which is a crucial psychological and technical benchmark. However, for this scenario to occur, Dogecoin needs to break through the resistance at the local highs. Surpassing these resistance levels could set the stage for a significant rally, possibly reflecting its most powerful movements from earlier market cycles. Notably, since Trump’s inauguration is only two weeks away, it is highly anticipated that DOGE will be impacted by the new administration. Therefore, achieving this will necessitate ongoing backing from the wider market and persistent engagement from its committed community. Finally, if the bullish trajectory persists, DOGE has the potential to once again lead the altcoin space. It would be reminiscent of the original memecoin’s capacity to astonish even the most experienced traders. Meanwhile, DOGE price is trading around $0.389, reflecting a rise of 11.51% in 24 hours and 23% over the past week. Will Dogecoin profit from Elon Musk’s new payments system? X, the social media platform, has announced its intention to introduce a payment-processing platform this year. The corporation which Tesla CEO Elon Musk owns, has been the most prominent supporter of DOGE . Recently, MacRumors published leaked source code purportedly from X’s new payments service online. Although there is no official confirmation that the code is indeed from the forthcoming payments platform, the purported disclosure has increased enthusiasm for the service. The crypto industry is waiting to see if it will incorporate any cryptocurrencies, and which. As of now, there is no definitive indication regarding the integration of DOGE into the X payments network. However, this has not hindered the surge of favorable momentum for the popular meme coin; rather, it may have influenced the surge. Notably, as a token that primarily functions as a speculative investment and payment mechanism, Dogecoin’s valuation is closely tied to adoption trends and overall market momentum. Therefore, if X’s payment system includes the token as one of the key supported cryptocurrencies, it might result in significant valuation gains.

The planned burn of 5 million FET tokens in January 2025 aims to reduce supply, sparking optimism among investors. With the growing hype around decentralized AI, many are speculating that FET price could hit $3 soon. Impact of the 5M Token Burn on FET Price On January 4, Fetch AI’s co-founder Humayun Sheikh announced that a significant 5 million FET token burn is scheduled to take place on January 10. This initiative aims to reduce the total supply of FET tokens, which is expected to enhance their value by creating scarcity in the market. Token burns are typically viewed positively by the crypto community, as they often lead to increased demand for the remaining tokens, driving up prices. By actively managing its token supply, It signals a strong commitment to improving the long-term value of its ecosystem. First burn of 5m $fet will be on the 10th of Jan 25. @Fetch_ai @ASI_Alliance — Humayun (@HMsheikh4) January 4, 2025 In addition to the token burn, Fetch AI has already completed its strategic merger with Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET, resulting in the formation of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (ASI). This merger strengthens its position in the decentralized AI sector, offering a competitive alternative to the centralized control over AI development by tech giants. The alliance combines the resources of Fetch AI, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol to accelerate the development of decentralized AI technologies. The merger also paves the way for the ASI token, a combined token for all three projects. It could further boost the FET price and impact the market. The community’s high expectations for its price growth make this a crucial period for the project. What’s Next For The AI Token? The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has been steadily climbing as anticipation builds around the upcoming 5 million FET token burn. Currently, FET price traded at $1.47, reflecting a 2% increase in the last 24 hours. The token’s price fluctuated between $1.44 and $1.50 in the same time frame, signaling stable demand in the market. As the FET token burn event nears, the market is closely watching the supply reduction’s impact on price. Amid this, a popular market expert CW noted that FET recently completed a retest after breaking through the falling wedge pattern. This suggests a rally may be imminent. The analyst predicts that FET will reach a target price of $2.25 since it didn’t break the previous low. This reinforces confidence in FET’s potential upward movement. Source: CW, X Besides, another expert Scient has shared a chart for FET price, which indicates a potential rally of the crypto to about $3. However, he also warned that if it falls below the $1.365 support, it could witness a slip to $0.8. Source: Scient, X The recent surge in interest in the top AI coins has also fueled optimism. This growing interest in AI has created a favorable environment for FET. As a result, expectations for price growth are increasing in the coming weeks.

Some people wake up and have no idea where they left their phone the night before. Then, there are those who instinctively check their social media accounts before their eyes are even fully open. For many, this means scrolling through notifications on Instagram, Facebook, X, and TikTok—starting their day with a digital inventory before they’ve even had time to wake up. You might also like: From views to value: The future of blockchain innovation in social media | Opinion These days, users have even found new ways to engage with social media beyond traditional use cases. For example, some have moved away from traditional search engines like Google, turning to social media platforms to help them complete daily tasks. With the rise of influencers, users are constantly being bombarded with information, product recommendations, and sponsored content that shape decisions and routines. From personal preferences and browsing habits to locations, everything users post or interact with has become a data point for companies to track, analyze, and monetize. During Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, her team spent over $11 million promoting ads on Instagram and Facebook in a quest to target younger audiences. Big Tech players even have the authority to filter the content users see. For example, in July, Facebook and Google were slammed for censoring President Trump’s attempted assassination. They can remove content based on algorithms or external pressure, while users typically remain unaware of the criteria used to determine which posts are removed and which are promoted. Decentralization is the key To counter these insidious issues, more and more users are turning towards decentralized solutions that naturally resist censorship and unwarranted control. By eliminating the middleman, decentralized social networks provide users with complete ownership over their content. Additionally, since decentralized social media is not controlled by a single entity, data is not stored in a central location typically vulnerable to hacking or surveillance. The lack of a centralized authority also means that no one can censor any content generated by users. Integrating the principles of social media with blockchain technology offers a web3 approach to creating, managing, and interacting with online social networks. Lens Protocol, for instance, is a decentralized Layer 2 infrastructure designed for scalable social spaces, allowing users to own their content and connections. Traditional web2 platforms like X, Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram rely on centralized social graphs to create and manage user connections, leveraging control over data. In contrast, Lens Protocol aims to decentralize this power structure, giving individuals ownership over their data and content. Lens Protocol allows users to create, share, and interact without relying on centralized authorities. It does this by allowing users to own their profiles, granting them the freedom to move their data across platforms. Avara , the developers of Lens, Aave, and Family, recently completed a $31 million funding round. The round was led by Lightspeed Faction, and participation included Alchemy, Avail, Circle, Consensys, DFG, Superscrypt, Re7, and Wintermute Ventures. The funding will be used to scale the network infrastructure before its mainnet launch next year. While we can’t say goodbye to web2 social media just yet, SocialFi gives users a new perspective on how decentralization can provide a more value-driven experience. This shift sets the stage for a future where users are compensated for their time, creativity, and influence, and their data belongs to them, not centralized corporations. SocialFi advocates for a more equitable playground where value is shared more equitably among those who contribute.

Hunter Horsley shared on X that an unnamed wealth management firm in California, U.S., has onboarded 63 clients to BITB, Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF. This accomplishment was registered in less than one year, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared with his 50,000 followers on X.

Wealth managers will help millions of investors participate in the opportunity of this space.

Horsley adds that he is happy about this achievement and noted that wealth managers will help millions of investors participate in the opportunity of this space. “It’s a privilege to support them.” he added. Notably, he also expects millions of investors to join spot Bitcoin ETFs. Currently, BITB, the spot Bitcoin ETF by Bitwise, is sitting at $4.08 billion AUM. Bitwise spot Bitcoin ETF is responsible for 3.65% of the aggregated AUM of the BTC ETFs segment. It is also the fastest-growing ETF, with a 2.14% weekly increase in Bitcoin reserves. Bitwise’s annual survey reveals that 96% of U.S. clients are interested in crypto. As of January 11, 2024, Bitcoin spot ETFs have gathered over $112 billion in assets under management, making them the largest collective Bitcoin reserve ever.

Algorand and Render will deliver massive returns as each has a host of exceptionally bullish catalysts on the horizon, while Rollblock (RBLK) looks set to shake up the online gambling industry as experts predict a coming 50x re-pricing in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK) Poised To Deliver Blockchain Innovation To Massive Growth Industry The hugely popular GambleFi presale Rollblock (RBLK) has been crushing it lately, with a December stampede of new signups and registrations increasing by 600% in just one month. Rollblock gives its gamers the ability to verify all transactions on-chain and so eliminates any risk of bet tampering that is so pervasive in this industry. Rollblock holds a license from gaming authorities in Anjouan and is rightfully proud of passing its audit from SolidProof. The Rollblock platform is filled with over 7,000 innovative, AI-powered games that offer gamers the chance to earn masses of the native RBLK token. Gamers can also put their sports prowess to the test with the recently launched Rollblock sports betting feature. The RBLK token employs an innovative revenue share scheme that uses up to 30% of the casino’s profits each week to buy up RBLK before burning 60% of these tokens from the supply and allocating the rest to stakers in the Rollblock community. This will ensure rising scarcity for this token over time in huge contrast to the majority of crypto gaming money grabs. Investors need to hurry to lock in the low stage nine discount before the next inevitable price rise. Algorand (ALGO) Transactions Explode As Token Gains 19% Algorand has gained a respectable 5.6% in the last 24 hours to hit $0.42. The Algorand price has gained over 19% in the past week, signaling the huge return of buying pressure in the Algorand market. This positive sentiment among Algorand holders has come about as average daily transactions on the Algorand chain have surged by over 104% to reach 4.7 million. Despite this, Algorand’s revenue has recently fallen by 61%, and the amount of Algorand being staked on the network has also declined by 6% this quarter as only 1.6 billion Algorand tokens were staked in a year. Despite this, Algorand remains hugely bullish and could easily reach the $1 level in the weeks ahead. Render (RENDER) Innovation Remains Red Hot Render has been in a clear uptrend this week, adding 8% in the last seven days as the Render price has risen to $7.69. However, the Render price has recorded a 13% loss in the last 30 days as this AI play on the network has remained typically volatile. Render recently passed the Render Network Cinema 4D Wizard, which allows a frictionless environment for artists to create 4D video projects using the Render network. It also improved support for the Blender ecosystem, which should ensure a consistent increase in adoption during 2025 and could easily send the Render token north of $20. Rollblock Will Dominate The GambleFi Space Algorand and Render look exceptionally bullish at this point in the cycle, although Rollblock (RBLK) remains crypto experts’ number one bet for size returns based on its hugely positive momentum and tiny market cap. Snagging a bag of RBLK for the coming cycle will likely change investors’ lives during 2025. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

The sting of regret could haunt you forever! But here’s the kicker—opportunities don’t just knock once. If you’ve ever wished for a do-over, now’s your chance to grab some of the top meme coins with 100x potential. With the spotlight on BTFD Coin (BTFD), alongside heavyweights like Mog Coin (MOG) and Degen (DEGEN), there’s a new wave of meme coins ready to redefine the game. BTFD Coin has sent shockwaves through the crypto world with its festive presale event – buying at $0.000142 now and cashing out at $0.0006 when the presale ends. The presale has already raised over $4.8 million, with 62 billion coins sold. Let’s not forget MOG and DEGEN, two icons riding high on community support and meme coin hysteria. So, what sets these tokens apart? Let’s dive in. BTFD Coin: Seizing the Dip with Style BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme—it’s a movement. Drawing inspiration from the legendary 1973 financial crash, BTFD empowers investors to embrace dips, not fear them. The presale, currently in Stage 13, has been a roaring success in the top meme coins with 100x potential, with over 7500 holders and $4.8 million raised. Here’s why you can’t miss out: Play-to-Earn Game: The final version of the BTFD P2E game is live, letting players explore the Bulls Squad universe. With great rewards for gamers, this sets the stage for an immersive experience. 90% Staking APY: Staking went live earlier this month, offering generous returns for long-term holders. Imagine doubling your holdings in under a year! Referral Programme: Want to earn even more? BTFD’s rewards programme gives you 10% of the raise amount in tokens if your referral code makes it to the top 20 leaderboard by month-end. Community Spirit: With the Bulls Squad leading the charge, BTFD’s ethos revolves around resilience and timing. Baby Bull, Raging Bull, and Nerdy Bull ensure that you’re not just investing but joining a movement. Perhaps the best part about this presale is the bonus that you can avail by using the code BIG50 to get 50% extra coins in your wallet for free. Want in? Buying is simple. Visit the presale page, connect your wallet, apply the bonus code BIG50, and confirm your purchase. With every $15,000 invested at the bonused price, you’d bag 234,375,000 BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, your stash could balloon to $140,625. That’s a return to brag about with one of the top meme coins with 100x potential! Mog Coin: Community-Driven Strength Mog Coin has carved out its place as a people’s favourite. With a prominent market cap, this meme coin has soared thanks to unwavering community support and strategic listings. Added to major platforms like Coinbase and Kraken, MOG continues to captivate investors who believe in its potential. What makes Mog special? It’s all about its grassroots appeal. From viral memes to real-world adoption, MOG embodies how meme coins can build an unstoppable momentum. While its speculative nature means price swings, its devoted base ensures it stays relevant in a crowded market. Degen (DEGEN): Chaos in Crypto True to its name, DEGEN thrives on unpredictability. Known for its high-stakes, high-reward profile, DEGEN has captured the attention of thrill-seeking investors. Whether it’s skyrocketing trading volumes or jaw-dropping gains, DEGEN embodies the wild side of meme coin investing.

It’s not for the faint-hearted, but for those who dare, the potential upside is enormous. Lessons from 1973: Why Buying the Dip Works History repeats itself.

In simple terms, layer-2 crypto refers to projects built on top of layer-1 solutions to enhance scalability, speed, and efficiency. In this article, we’ll explore the top 10 Layer-2 crypto coins with the potential to skyrocket this year. These tokens are supported by strong fundamentals and exhibit bullish price action. However, the market appears more favorable this year as the United States elects a crypto-friendly president, which could significantly boost the growth of cryptocurrencies in 2025. Top 10 Layer-2 Crypto Coins Polygon (POL) Polygon (POL) is one of the top layer-2 crypto projects that recently experienced massive upside momentum following Donald Trump’s election win in November 2024. However, since December 2024, it has lost nearly 50% of its gains due to profit-taking and market corrections. Source: Trading View This continuous price decline has paused at a crucial golden Fibonacci level of 61.8% and appears to be rebounding. Additionally, POL has formed a bullish double-bottom price action pattern on the daily time frame. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if POL breaks out from this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.54 mark, it could rally by 40% to reach the $0.76 level in the future. Optimism (OP) Last month, amid market uncertainty, Optimism’s native token, OP, experienced a significant price decline of over 38%, breaking down from a strong support zone. However, after a prolonged consolidation of over two weeks, the altcoin appears to be recovering and is poised for substantial upside momentum. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, OP has recently broken out of a consolidation zone and formed a double-bottom price action pattern on the daily time frame, shifting market sentiment in its favor. Based on recent price action, there is a strong possibility that OP could rally by 40% to reach the $3 level in the near future. Immutable (IMX) Similar to Optimism (OP), Immutable’s native token, IMX, experienced a price decline of over 44% last month. However, with shifting market sentiment, it appears that the streak of continuous price corrections and declines has ended, and IMX is now poised for upside momentum. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, IMX is consolidating within a tight range near the resistance level of $1.50. Based on recent price action, if the altcoin breaks out of this prolonged consolidation, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 62% to reach the crucial resistance level of $2.42 in the future. Starknet (STRK) It appears that the majority of layer-2 cryptocurrencies have formed similar price action patterns. The STRKUSDT daily chart shows a price action pattern comparable to those observed in tokens like IMX and OP. Source: Trading View Despite these similarities, STRK appears bullish as it has broken out of a consolidation zone and surpassed a crucial resistance level at $0.552. With bullish market sentiment and growing trader interest, if STRK holds above the $0.51 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 90% to reach the $0.98 level in the future. Mantle (MNT) MNT, the native token of Mantle, has gained significant attention from crypto enthusiasts following its impressive performance over the past month. While the overall cryptocurrency market has been struggling, MNT has surged by over 57% and has currently reached a crucial resistance level of $1.50. Based on recent price action, the $1.50 level is near MNT’s all-time high. If this level is breached, a massive upside momentum could be witnessed in the future. Arbitrage (ARB) Following a 42% price decline in December 2024, ARB found support at the golden Fibonacci level of 61.8%. It has since begun reversing its trend and is now poised for upward momentum, supported by improving sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, ARB has broken out from a double-bottom price action pattern and surpassed the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame, signaling a bullish outlook. If the altcoin sustains itself above the 200 EMA, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 45% to reach the $1.25 level in the near future. Stacks (STX) Stacks (STX) is one of the top Layer-2 crypto coins, recently undergoing a price correction that wiped out nearly 55% of its gains. However, with the overall crypto market sentiment turning bullish, the altcoin is gaining upside momentum. Since the start of 2025, STX has already climbed 21% and appears poised to continue its upward trajectory in the coming days. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, if the bullish sentiment remains steady, STX could rally by 62% to reach the $2.8 level. However, a resistance level at $2 could temporarily stall its upward momentum. The strong fundamentals of this crypto project, combined with its price action, suggest an ideal buying opportunity for investors interested in Layer-2 coins. Manta Network (MANTA) Manta Network’s MANTA token appears bullish after recently breaking out of a bullish double-bottom price action pattern on the daily time frame. This breakout follows a shift in sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape. Source: Trading View If the token holds above $0.935, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 45% to reach the $1.40 mark in the future. On a positive note, MANTA has also witnessed a bullish divergence on its daily chart, further supporting this bullish outlook. dYdX dYdX is one of the top Layer-2 tokens but is still struggling to gain momentum. Since December 2024, the token has experienced a price decline of over 47%. However, given the current market sentiment, the altcoin appears poised for upside momentum. Source: Trading View dYdX is currently consolidating within a tight range and looks ready for a breakout. Based on recent price action, if the altcoin breaks out of this narrow zone and closes a daily candle above the $1.64 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 68% to reach the $2.72 level in the future. zkSync (ZK) ZK, the native token of zkSync, seems bullish as it has recently broken out from a trendline and is now struggling to breach the horizontal resistance level of $0.218. Source: Trading View Although the token was recently launched and there isn’t much historical data available, if ZK breaks the horizontal resistance and closes a daily candle above the $0.22 mark, it could easily reach the $0.26 level in the future and may even have the potential to surpass its all-time high. These top 10 Layer-2 crypto coins appear bullish based on strong price action and solid fundamentals.

This decline is mostly due to profit-taking, as the token was up by over 20,500% from its lowest level in November. Its market capitalization peaked at $2.3 billion earlier this week. Ai16z ( AI16z ) dropped to a low of $2 on Saturday, Jan. 4, down by over 21% from this month’s high of $2.50. Nansen data shows that the number of smart money holders has fallen from 118 in November to just 80 on Saturday. Their combined holdings have fallen from over 700 million tokens to below 500 million. Based on their strong historical performance, smart money investors are usually more sophisticated than retail ones. These investors are known to buy crypto and stocks early and leave before they move into the markdown phase. Smart money investors are selling | Source: Nansen Another evidence of this distribution is that the number of ai16z tokens on exchanges surged in the past few days. They moved from 12.32 million last week to over 43.65 million on Saturday. Most of these tokens are in exchanges like Gate, Raydium, MEXC, and Orca. Meanwhile, there are signs that many of the most profitable ai16z traders have started to take profits. The most profitable investor has made a profit of $148 million and has sold $4.6 million. He is still holding 96% of the investment.

However, most other profit leaders have sold many of their tokens. ai16z profit leaders | Source: Nansen Ai16z price crash ai16z price chart | Source: crypto.news In addition to profit-taking, the ongoing ai16z price retreat is likely because of the Wyckoff Method. This popular theory explains how assets rise and fall in four stages: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. The chart above shows that the token remained in an accumulation phase in early November and then entered markup in December. This markup happened as crypto investors embraced fear of missing out. Therefore, it has now moved into the distribution phase followed by a markdown phase, characterized by more selling than buying (seen in the charts above). As such, there is a risk that the token will fall to $1, down by 50% from the current level.

Rising trading volumes and bullish-leaning technical indicators suggest more upside ahead. Will the bullish momentum drive BRETT price above the $0.25 psychological resistance? Solana Memecoin BRETT Price Rally Seals Top 100 Status As the global crypto markets winning start to 2025 entered its 4th consecutive day, as Solana memecoin BRETT price has delivered a remarkable double-digit growth performance. The rising popularity of AI Agents has seen tokens like Pudgy Penguins and Fartcoin ( FART ) draw media attention over the past weeks. However, prominent Solana memes like BRETT have also continued to fly under the radar. Solana Memecoin BRETT Price Action | BRETTUSD The chart above shows how BRETT price had closed trading for 2024 at $0.11. But as crypto markets 2025 resurgence began, BRETT has since climbed 38.3% to reach $0.16 mark at press time on Jan 4. According to Coingecko data, BRETT now ranks the 94th largest crypto asset, as its market capitalization crossed the $1.5 billion mark. BRETT Demand Spikes 86% from December 2024 lows This signals that investors are increasingly channeling capital towards the Solana memecoin sector as crypto market sentiment recovers from the shock sell-off in the second-half of December 2024. Affirming this narrative, on-chain trading data shows BRETT market liquidity has increased considerably since the turn of the year. BRETT Trading Volume | Source: Santiment During last month’s market crash, BRETT daily trading volume fell as low as $34 million on December 26, according to Santiment data. But as Elon Musk sparked a memecoin market frenzy with a crypto profile picture update on December 31, BRETT trading volume has since surpassed $60 million in each of the last 3 trading days. This reflects an 85% surge in BRETT from last month’s lows. Based on these current market dynamics, Solana memecoin BRETT price paints a bullish outlook as the sustained uptrend in trading volume indicates strong market liquidity, a potential catalyst for further price appreciation. BRETT Price Forecast: $0.25 Target in Focus After 38% gains, BRETT price action remains bullish, with a move above the VWAP level of $0.15298, indicating strong market demand. The Fibonacci retracement zones between $0.13 and $0.18 serve as pivotal zones for price consolidation. A close above the immediate resistance at $0.18 could signal the start of another leg-up towards the $0.25 target. BRETT Price Forecast | BRETTUSD More so, the Bull-Bear Power (BBP) indicator shows positive momentum, as rising green values imply growing buying pressure aligning with the sustained rise in BRETT trading volume, observed in Santiment’s on-chain chart. This reinforces the likelihood of a push toward the psychological $0.25 level in the coming sessions. Conversely, a bearish outlook emerges if prices fall below the $0.14 support zone, invalidating the bullish trend and potentially triggering a retest of the $0.12 Fibonacci support level. A break below this key support buy-wall could trigger extended downside risks.

Bitcoin: The original cryptocurrency and its potential today Bitcoin (BTC) is the first cryptocurrency introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto. It operates on blockchain technology, enabling decentralized peer-to-peer transactions without central authorities like banks. Bitcoin uses a distributed ledger maintained across network nodes. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners validate transactions and receive bitcoins as rewards. With a capped supply of 21 million bitcoins and periodic “halving” events reducing mining rewards, Bitcoin aims to be resilient against fraud and inflation. The technology behind Bitcoin has potential for secure, decentralized financial systems. In the current market cycle, Bitcoin’s attractiveness depends on various factors, including market sentiment and adoption rates. Its pioneering status and limited supply continue to draw interest from investors. Conclusion While established coins like BTC may offer steady growth, DOGEN presents unparalleled short-term potential. Crafted for those pursuing excellence, DOGEN expects a 700% surge by the presale’s end, with possibilities for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Emulating successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN fosters a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early supporters.

That’s the question on everyone’s mind as AI models completely revolutionize investment research. Byron Wien, a market strategist who defined the 1990s, believes the best research comes from bold, non-consensus ideas that prove correct. Now the pressure is on AI to meet this standard and potentially sideline analysts who have dominated the field for decades. For years, analysts have dissected financial statements and scoured headlines, all to help investors make better decisions. AI has stepped into this space with tools that simplify, automate, and sometimes outperform traditional methods. Large language models (LLMs) have become particularly effective at analyzing financial data, doing in minutes what might take a team of analysts days. Predicting earnings, for instance, plays right into AI’s strengths. Profit patterns tend to follow logical trends—good years lead to more good years; bad years lead to more bad ones. AI thrives in these predictable spaces, outperforming human analysts who sometimes let noise or bias cloud their judgment. LLMs rewriting the investment analysis playbook The University of Chicago’s work with LLMs has turned heads. Researchers used AI to predict earnings variance and found that these models beat human analysts’ median estimates. The secret? LLMs excel at understanding the story behind earnings reports, something traditional algorithms never managed to do. These models mimic the logical steps of senior analysts, like disciplined juniors on a financial team. AI models also sidestep one of the biggest human pitfalls: overconfidence. Analysts are notorious for adjusting their projections to fit what they think investors want to hear. AI doesn’t play that game. By tweaking an AI model’s “temperature” settings—a fancy term for randomness—you can calculate risk and return bands with cold, hard statistics. You can even get a confidence estimate for its predictions. Humans, by comparison, tend to get cocky with their forecasts, doubling down on bad calls instead of reassessing. Despite these wins, AI is far from perfect. It won’t find the next Nvidia or foresee another global financial meltdown. Big market shocks like these don’t follow patterns, and AI struggles when the unexpected happens. It also can’t grill company executives during earnings calls or pick up on evasive answers about critical issues. Markets are messy and constantly shifting, and AI lacks the intuition to adapt. That’s where top analysts still shine—they know when to pivot, dig deeper, and push for answers. But the AI hype will probably remain strong for a long time. Tech giants are obsessed. Microsoft is betting big—$80 billion big—on AI and the infrastructure it needs. For fiscal 2025, the tech giant plans to spend more than half of that in the U.S. on data centers to train and deploy AI models. Why the splurge? AI demands insane computing power. Training models like ChatGPT means linking thousands of chips in massive data center clusters. Advertising dollars could power the next tech boom AI might follow the same road as past tech revolutions: fueled by advertising money. Remember how Google and Facebook rose to power? They cashed in on brand-building budgets, taking dollars from everyone—from Tide to your local plumber. Even subscription-heavy companies like Netflix and Amazon are now leaning on ads. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, is a prime example of how far this model can go. Since its 2004 IPO, Alphabet’s revenue has surged by 160 times, hitting over $300 billion in 2023. AI has the potential to reshape industries, just like radio, TV, and the internet did before. Back in the day, newspapers relied on ads for two-thirds of their revenue. Radio and TV thrived on commercials, keeping them free for audiences. AI might soon be the next big advertising platform, pulling in dollars to fund groundbreaking developments. AI can spit out ideas—some brilliant, some nonsensical. It can run endless scenarios, pulling insights from history that even an army of researchers might miss. But it can’t give you that “spark of genius.” Analysts bring something AI can’t replicate: the ability to question, adapt, and see the bigger picture in real time. That human touch is still invaluable in a world where non-consensus recommendations—the ones no machine would think to make—often turn out to be the most profitable. The real takeaway? AI and analysts aren’t enemies. They’re tools for each other.

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 15:11:00

Others, like Ripple’s XRP tokens for international settlements between large institutions, performed even better than Bitcoin. XRP was up 247% by Christmas Day in December. It notched 271% for the entire year on Wednesday. But here’s how some leading crypto market analysts expect Bitcoin’s price to carry through some point over the 2025 calendar year. For a basis of reference, Bitcoin traded at an average crypto exchange rate of $94,700 Wednesday evening US Eastern Time, according to data from CoinGecko. Bitcoin Price Predictions: $80,000 – $160,000 Peter Brandt: $78,000 Brandt made a prediction on Sunday, Dec. 29, targeting a big drop in Bitcoin’s price to the $78,000 level, based on a 45-day head and shoulders top pattern. This is a head and shoulders top pattern. It might complete and take price to $78,000; it might fail with a thrust hire: or, it might morph into something else. But as it stands right now, it is a head and shoulders top and must be chartist dealt with for what it is. pic.twitter.com/b9AUUO7ddL — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 29, 2024 If he’s right, BTC will have to take one step back before it advances toward the more bullish price targets for 2025. But Brandt also cautioned in the comment thread on his post, “Charts do NOT predict anything. Charts merely suggest possibilities.” The famous stock chart technical analyst is bullish for XRP in 2025, but his outlook for Bitcoin’s price is bearish. CoinShares: $80,000 European crypto hedge fund CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, recently told CNBC that $150,000 BTC is possible in 2025. But he said a bearish correction to $80,000 is also on the cards. “Disappointment surrounding Trump’s proposed crypto policies and doubts about their enactment could prompt a significant market correction,” Butterfill warned. Bullish 2025 BTC Targets: $160,000 – $250,000 Standard Chartered: $200,000 British multinational bank Standard Chartered’s research head Geoff Kendrick says his office is targeting $200,000 BTC in 2025. He added that the entry of the United States government into the Bitcoin race is likely to fuel that rally. “Even a small allocation of the USD 40tn in US retirement funds would significantly boost BTC prices,” Kendrick noted. “We would turn even more bullish if BTC saw more rapid uptake by US retirement funds, global sovereign wealth funds (SWFs), or a potential US strategic reserve fund.” Nexo: $250,000 Swiss-based crypto fund manager Nexo’s chief product officer, Elitsa Taskova, told CNBC, “We see Bitcoin more than doubling to $250,000 within a year.” She points to ongoing trends in adoption by institutional finance and social indicators for the bullish outlook in 2025. “These projections align with ongoing trends and social markers: increasing recognition of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, more Bitcoin and crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs), and stronger adoption,” Taskova said. Bottom Line for Investors Like stocks, cryptocurrency assets are held at risk. But for more than a decade, Bitcoin has delivered world-class returns during bull markets. That means it’s possible for a small allocation to BTC can substantially speed individual investment portfolios toward reaching personal finance goals. Nevertheless, investors should do their own research before allocating funds into any asset, no matter its returns over the past year or two.

Most importantly, the coin is forming a bullish pennant chart pattern comprising a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle. This triangle is now nearing its confluence level. This often leads to a strong breakout. Therefore, if this happens, the initial target for the Aave token will be last year’s high at $400. A break above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $500. The bullish view will become invalid if the coin falls below the 50-day moving average.

Cramer noted that BlackRock, a company he greatly admires, has seen significant outflows from its Bitcoin ETF. “Three hundred and thirty million dollars was pulled from Bitcoin yesterday,” he said, indicating three consecutive days of declines. “This is unusual,” Cramer said, raising questions about the recent decline. Despite the outflows, Cramer remains bullish on Bitcoin and advises viewers to keep a close eye on the market. “I love Bitcoin and I think people should watch it. If they haven’t bought it yet, they’ll get a chance,” he said. When asked if Bitcoin had cooled enough, Cramer pointed to $90,000 as the next potential buy level. “I think $90,000 is the next level where I think people should buy,” Cramer said. Related News: Bankrupt Cryptocurrency Whale Still Won't Give Up: It Increased its Position Even More Cramer also emphasized Bitcoin’s role as a hedge, referring to the $36 trillion in global assets. “It takes younger people and more excited spirits to make Bitcoin work,” he said. He attributed much of Bitcoin’s momentum to options trading on Robinhood, a platform popular with young investors. “We don’t talk about Robinhood enough,” Cramer said, noting that the platform has caught the attention of young investors while larger financial firms have missed the mark. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bullish sentiment is growing for 2025, with three hot cryptos showing 100x potential and strong community support. Table of Contents January hottest crypto tokens: iDEGEN: The degen-fueled AI movement Fartcoin: The coin that’s blowing up (literally) Token Metrics AI: The future of smarter crypto analysis Don’t miss January’s hottest cryptos The conditions are ripe for 100x pumps right now. We’ve already seen significant moves these past few months, with bullish sentiment looking set to grow stronger in the year ahead. It’s always smart to follow trends and jump into the hottest cryptos, given momentum typically precedes more momentum. Today, we’re breaking down three of the hottest cryptos in January, curated based on their strong community followings, 100x potential, and virality. Let’s dive in. January hottest crypto tokens: iDEGEN: The degen-fueled AI movement Fartcoin: The coin that’s blowing up (literally) Token Metrics AI: The future of smarter crypto analysis You might also like: Trending crypto iDEGEN is gaining ground with 75,000% gains iDEGEN: The degen-fueled AI movement iDEGEN is the embodiment of chaos, curiosity, and innovation rolled into one, and this Solana -based meme coin is emerging as one of the hottest cryptos right now. Powered by a degenerate AI agent that learns, adapts, and evolves based entirely on what its community feeds it on Twitter, iDEGEN comes with no guardrails or filters. Instead, it’s an experiment in what’s possible when an AI is raised by the crypto Twitter. This AI shares its thoughts through a Twitter account every 60 minutes, replying to every interaction sent its way. The results have been incredible, ranging from conspiracies about government leaders to autonomously generated images about whatever’s on its mind. But the numbers surrounding its IDGN token have been equally phenomenal. Its adaptive auction — a unique move against the traditional fixed-price presale paradigm — has seen IDGN explode 75,000% in just 4 weeks, having currently raising over $8.6m. This auction adjusts IDGN’s price every five minutes based on demand — buying triggers a 5% increase, and inactivity leads to a 5% decrease. It creates both a fair, market-driven launch and a gamified frenzy that’s kept investors glued to IDGN’s chart. Part of the FOMO is about an impending listing due in January. Here, IDGN will list at a 10% premium, with any unsold tokens burnt forever. IDGN arrives at just the right time when AI meme coins are seriously heating up, and the meme coin supercycle enters its strongest phase yet. iDEGEN could just be the ticket to 100x gains in 2025. Fartcoin: The coin that’s blowing up (literally) In the same vein as iDEGEN, Fartcoin is another AI meme token that’s quickly become one of the hottest cryptos in January. Fartcoin was conceived in an experiment known as the Infinite Backrooms, where two AI models were allowed to talk to each other. After a tremendous hype cycle, Fartcoin shot up, even being reported on by NBC News . Launched on October 24th, 2024, at roughly $0.024, with a total supply of 69,420,000 tokens, Fartcoin began life with a market cap of around $40 million. However, by December 20th, it hit $1.27 , creating a $1.25 billion market cap. Fartcoin is a true meme coin. Its “standout” feature is the gas fee system, where each transaction produces a digital fart sound. It’s ultimately a reflection of the current movement towards fusing AI and crypto, as well as an extension of the boom in Solana meme coins and the meme coin supercycle currently underway. With 2025 expected to see a continuation of this trend, there is potential for a further significant climb in FARTCOIN’s price, positioning it as one of the hottest cryptos right now. Token Metrics AI: The future of smarter crypto analysis Token Metrics AI is a new cryptocurrency that is part of the Token Metrics ecosystem. Token Metrics is a platform founded in 2018 that’s designed to simplify crypto investing with advanced insights, analyzing over 6,000 crypto projects. Token Metrics recently debuted its AI chatbot, offering a way for investors to ask questions and gain perspective on the best cryptos to invest in, backed by the platform’s proprietary rating system and price predictions. In early December, Token Metrics created an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) for its TMAI token. This token primarily serves as a payment method that unlocks additional benefits, like a SoulBound NFT, exclusive rewards, and other perks yet to be disclosed. One upcoming feature is expected to be a trading bot marketplace, where users create, sell, and replicate AI-driven trading strategies. TMAI has since surged. Following a low of $0.0021 on December 4th, it hit a peak of $0.016 on December 17th, marking an approximate 660% jump. With AI insights set to become more powerful over the coming years, Token Metrics AI and its customers could be prime beneficiaries, marking TMAI as one of the hottest cryptos in January. Don’t miss January ‘s hottest cryptos Looking ahead, these three tokens appear to have bright futures. Whether driven by AI, meme culture, or utility, they look like the hottest cryptos to buy right now. As always, careful research and strategic timing are key to making the most of these opportunities. Keep an eye out for these projects, but particularly iDEGEN — it could be the most explosive token of 2025. It’s hardwired to go viral, has a slew of new features due over the festive period, and has already pumped by 75,000% before open market trading has even begun: just imagine what could happen when this thing hits DEXs. 100x inbound?

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Galaxy Research’s Alex Thorn predicts that top memecoin DOGE will soar more than 170% from its current value this year and hit a psychological price point for the first time in its history. “Dogecoin will finally hit $1, with the world’s largest and oldest memecoin touching a $100 billion market cap.” DOGE is trading for $0.37 at time of writing, up 11.7% in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $55.47 billion, DOGE is the seventh-largest crypto project. Meanwhile, Galaxy Research’s Charles Yu is predicting a decline in market dominance by Tether’s stablecoin USDT as other stablecoins, like Circle’s USDC , gain more market share due to attractive yields. “Tether’s long-standing market dominance will drop below 50%, challenged by yielding alternatives like Blackrock’s BUIDL, Ethena’s USDe and even USDC Rewards paid by Coinbase/Circle. As Tether internalizes yield revenue from USDT reserves to fund portfolio investments, marketing spend by stablecoin issuers/protocols to pass-through revenue will convert existing users away from Tether and onboard new users to their yield-bearing solutions. USDC rewards paid on users’ Coinbase Exchange and Wallet balances will be a powerful hook that will boost the entire DeFi (decentralized finance) sector and may be integrated by fintechs to enable new business models. In response, Tether will begin to pass through revenue from collateral holdings to USDT holders and may even offer a new competitive yielding product like a delta-neutral stablecoin.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Starting 2025 with a sharp 20% increase, ADA has achieved its first breakout of the year. This marks the first time since December 18, 2024, that the asset surpassed $1. Analysts now suggest ADA could rally further, with Elliott Wave predictions hinting at a potential move toward $3 in the coming months. Cardano Price Poised for $3 Rally in Latest Elliott Wave Analysis Cardano price is gaining attention as it appears to enter the fifth wave of a larger Elliott Wave structure. This analysis, highlighted by EWT’s technical predictions, suggests ADA could be on the verge of substantial price movement, potentially aiming for the $3 mark. The Elliott Wave Theory indicates that the best altcoin is completing wave III, which comprises five smaller impulsive waves. Wave 5, the final phase of this cycle, seems to be in play, suggesting a bullish extension. If the pattern holds, ADA might surge beyond the key resistance at $2.50, eyeing $3 as its next target. Technical indicators on the chart reinforce this bullish narrative, as wave III’s Fibonacci projection aligns with potential price levels between $2.80 and $3.10. Source: Tweet Whats Next For ADA Price? The Cardano price has shown impressive momentum since the start of 2025, kicking off the year at a low of $0.83. The cryptocurrency steadily climbed and broke through the crucial resistance level of $0.983, which had capped its progress in late 2024. This technical breakout has sparked optimism among investors, aligning with broader bullish trends in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. Today, The top altcoin surged to a high of $1.10 during trading, marking a 2% gain in the past 24 hours and a 20% rise over the week. Currently, the ADA price is at $1.09 and has firmly established itself above the $1 threshold, a significant psychological level. For ADA to sustain its upward trend, the next key resistance levels to monitor are $1.13 and $1.15. On the downside, immediate support sits near $0.98, with additional buffers at $0.85 and $0.75. If ADA maintains its current momentum, it could pave the way for a strong performance in the first quarter of 2025.

This move may be unexpected to the normal crypto investor, but to the trained eye, it is expected. Top meme coins like Dogecoin and Pepe seem to have lost their allure in the last couple of weeks, so much so that experts believe a torrid time awaits them in the first quarter of 2025. Ambitious Dogecoin and Pepe whales, seeking better alternatives, have jumped on the Remittixpresale. Read on to find out why they’ve taken this bold decision. Remittix: The new frontier in crypto payments Remittix is a PayFi solution that is taking crypto payments to the next level. Its major attraction is allowing anyone to send fiat to any bank account right from their crypto wallet. This brings together the world of blockchain and traditional finance, banks the unbanked, and boosts crypto adoption tremendously. The most interesting bit about Remittix’s utility is that it charges no FX fees, is cheaper compared to alternatives, and processes transactions in a smooth and efficient manner. This use case fits in perfectly with the global remittance industry, and it is set to cause a massive shake up the world has yet to see. With the introduction of a PayFi solution like Remittix into this space, international transfers will no longer be slow, buggy, or expensive. This is why the project is heading to the top. Joining this revolutionary project at this moment before it goes viral sets you up for stupendous ROI later on. That is why it has been an investor magnet over the past couple of weeks. Dogecoin price continues to falter Dogecoin is a massive crypto project with a wide following but its strength is also its Achilee’sHeel. Dogecoin price relies majorly on hype to go on ballistic price runs, which is cool. But at the same time, when there is no hype or market sentiments are bearish, DOGE tanks. Unfortunately, the current market sentiments don’t favor DOGE. It has fallen by double digits in the last month and there aren’t many indications that things would turn around soon. No wonder why DOGE whales are opting to invest in other tokens. Pepe whale dumps $1.2 million PEPE tokens In unsurprising Pepe news, a Pepe whale has dumped 62 billion PEPE tokens (worth $1.2 million at the time) as the coin keeps depreciating after a torrid December. PEPE has fallen by as much as 20% from its December high, following general bearish market sentiments. Even more, PEPE holders are bracing for harder times as experts have predicted further drops for the token in Q1 2025. The meme coin craze may not be back any time soon, so it makes sense to dump PEPE for coins with real utility that are going places. Jump on the crypto dubbed the ‘next XRP’ With Pepe news turning gloomy and Dogecoin facing uncertain times, Remittix stands out as a top crypto investment option. Currently in presale, it is going for $0.0177, which is an attractive entry point. Given that early RTX holders are set to make a 5,880% profit in the near future, joining the RTX presale is not only sensible, but it is mandatory for those who want to make tangible gains.

Rexas Finance and two other tokens show signs of being more significant than SHIB and DOGE in 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS) increased 485% in the presale stages, from $0.030 to $0.175. It has the potential to climb 6,757% to hit $12 in 2025, outperforming both DOGE and SHIB. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu: A Snaps[;’phot Ranked #7 on CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin trades at $0.316-7 as of writing. Its extraordinary 118.19% increase over the past sixty days emphasizes its ongoing attraction to investors. Based on CoinMarketCap, Shiba Inu, priced at $0.000022, ranks 14th among all the cryptocurrencies. SHIB also saw a reasonable 24.04% rise throughout the same period. Notwithstanding these developments, their primary use is still speculative, allowing creative tokens like Rexas Finance to thrive. Rexas Finance (RXS): Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization Since its presale began in September 2024, Rexas Finance has rapidly gained traction. Starting at just $0.030 in stage 1, the token has surged 485% to reach $0.175 in stage 11, raising $34,068,509 from selling 385,389,196 RXS tokens. With a projected price target of $12 by early 2025, RXS could deliver a staggering 6,757% return, dwarfing the speculative returns of DOGE and SHIB. The attractiveness of Rexas Finance lies in its original idea: tokenizing actual assets, including art, commodities, and real estate. The platform’s Token Builder lets anyone create asset-backed tokens without knowing code, democratizing access to the $65 billion art market, $121.2 trillion commodities market, and $379.7 trillion real estate market. Its Launchpad also helps token project fundraising, closing the distance between blockchain technologies and conventional asset markets. Certified by a Certik audit, Rexas Finance offers investors a safe and open environment. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko guarantees visibility and reliability. A $1 million RXS giveaway, with 20 winners earning $50,000 worth of tokens, further stimulates investor interest. Rexas Finance has created a community-centric environment by avoiding venture capital funding, complementing its goal of enabling private investors. Hedera (HBAR): Aiming for $1.20 in 2025 Valued at $0.2834 as of writing, Hedera is another interesting cryptocurrency under $1. It is ranked #17 on CoinMarketCap, has a market capitalization of $10.84 billion, and has grown by 480.82% in the last 60 days. Hedera’s Strength comes from its enterprise-grade blockchain system, which provides unmatched security, scalability, and transaction speed. The value of Hedera’s platform is expected to climb to $1.20 in 2025 as distributed apps (dApps) and businesses adopt it, therefore indicating great future development possibilities. Stellar (XLM): Targeting $1.50 in 2025 Stellar has a market capitalization of $10.70 billion and a #19 rating on CoinMarketCap, which has risen 275.02% to $0.3534 over the past sixty days. It is a unique project that aims to enable cross-border payments at the lowest possible cost. Its strong network helps individuals and financial companies conduct flawless transactions. With a $1.50 price target by 2025, Stellar’s expansion path might surpass that of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. Why Rexas Finance Stands Out Although Hedera and Stellar have interesting use cases, Rexas Finance is in a league of its own because of its emphasis on actual asset tokenization. Tokenizing and trading real estate and gold on the blockchain has transformed power and opened trillions in easily reachable markets. The platform supports several token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155). Moreover, the performance of the RXS presale highlights investor trust. Early adopters are positioned for significant rewards, as the token is priced at $0.175 and is rising. While the $1 million giveaway adds excitement and involvement, the Certik audit and CoinMarketCap & CoinGecko listing improve confidence. Given that RXS is predicted to hit $12 by 2025, investing in the presale could be game-changing. Don’t miss the opportunity to engage in the upcoming great thing in cryptocurrencies.

However, its biggest rally came in late 2024, right after Bitcoin hit $100k and altcoins began gaining momentum. As we move into 2025, Solana may have to share its throne with an altcoin that offers revolutionary potential: Rollblock . Here’s how this new player could dethrone Solana! Rollblock Aims to Revolutionize GambleFi In 2025 The gambling industry generated over $450 billion in revenue in 2024, with projections indicating that figure could double by 2030. Rollblock not only aims to capitalize on this massive market but also plans to revolutionize it using blockchain technology and crypto. The GambleFiprotocol has already seen over $1.3 million in wagers placed in December alone, with forecasts suggesting this figure could double in January. Rollblock blends the transparency of blockchain with the excitement of traditional gambling to deliver users an entirely new experience. At the time of writing, Rollblock offers more than 7,000 classic casino games from over 10 leading gaming providers. Additionally, the platform expanded into sports betting, which became a major hit in December. What truly sets Rollblock apart, however, is its focus on security. The platform operates under a full license from Gaming Anjouan and has passed a SolidProof audit, ensuring the safety of both investors and gamers. The entire ecosystem is powered by RBLK, the native utility token. Rollblock has implemented a revenue-sharing model to boost the momentum of RBLK every week. The platform will use up to 30% of its revenue to buy RBLK tokens from the open market. 60% of these will be burned to make tokens deflationary and the remaining tokens will be used for staking rewards. This could result in millions of dollars worth of tokens being burned weekly, driving the token's price higher. Currently, RBLK is in its ninth stage of the presale, with tokens selling for only $0.0445. Can Solana Hit New Highs In 2025? Solana has been a top performer in 2024. The rally was mainly driven by the increased adoption of its blockchain, with its stablecoin TVL reaching over $5 billion in the last few months. The past 24 hours have been great for SOL, as Bitcoin reclaimed the $97k resistance level. Solana’s price surged by over 8%, reaching a token price of $211. The volume has also been great, increasing by 20% to reach $3.7 billion. Analysts predict significant growth for Solana in 2025, with forecasts suggesting it could reach $700, bolstered by technological upgrades like the Firedancer. The bullish outlook is supported by a “cup-and-handle” pattern and Fibonacci retracement targets. Solana’s ecosystem is projected to grow to 7,625 developers, with a record $9.215 billion in TVL. While the best-case scenario could push SOL to $750, conservative estimates range between $220–$275, factoring in competition from Ethereum and macroeconomic conditions. Rollblock Eyes 100x Returns Rollblock has already seen huge returns during its presale. As momentum snowballs, analysts believe that early investors could receive up to 100x returns.

Experts Predict the Next Big Altcoin to Explode in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/shib-or-1fuel-experts-predict-the-next-big-altcoin-to-explode-in-2025/,"The post SHIB or 1Fuel? Experts Predict the Next Big Altcoin to Explode in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a world where crypto thrives on unlikely heroes, Shiba Inu’s rise from a cheeky meme coin to a market heavyweight is the stuff of legend. But now, 1FUEL is stealing the spotlight —not with memes, but with a revolutionary approach to managing digital assets. This cryptocurrency wallet is setting new standards on what crypto tools should deliver. The ongoing presale is already smashing records with over $950k raised and early backers seeing a 20% price bump. Is this one of the best cryptocurrencies to watch this year? Let’s find out! Can Shiba Inu Bounce Back? Shiba Inu recently burned 7.3 million tokens in a single day, marking a bold community-driven effort to tighten its supply and boost long-term value. With Shibarium and SHIB: The Metaverse playing key roles, the burn rate is now a critical part of SHIB’s strategy toward a deflationary future. Currently trading between $0.00002121 and $0.00002375 , SHIB has dropped 7% in two weeks and 20% over the past month. While still far from its 2021 high of $0.00008616, its $13 billion market cap and 16th spot among the best cryptocurrencies highlight its continued relevance. SHIB remains a notable contender, showing resilience in a challenging market. SHIB’s trajectory is anything but ordinary—it’s a mix of surges and pullbacks, defined by dramatic highs and sharp corrections. Yet, its resilience lies in the unwavering support of its community, ambitious ecosystem developments, and the potential analysts see for a rebound to $0.0002. This is no fading trend; SHIB has proven it can ride out market storms and still capture the attention of investors. With its reputation for defying expectations, it remains a token worth keeping on your radar. 1FUEL: The Cryptocurrency Wallet That Could 100x In 2025 Say goodbye to juggling wallets or deciphering clunky interfaces. 1FUEL takes what was once frustrating and turns it into something not just simple, but transformative. It’s a wallet, but also a powerhouse for security, privacy, and financial growth.

This isn’t just an upgrade; it’s a quantum leap for anyone tired of the crypto world’s fragmented landscape. And with a built-in privacy mixer, your transactions are not just secure—they’re cloaked in total anonymity, a feature more valuable than ever in an era of increasing regulatory scrutiny. A P2P exchange ensures you’re not reliant on centralized platforms, while every new user joining the ecosystem boosts its network value exponentially. The more users, the greater its utility—a chain reaction of growth. The buzz is real: Stage 1 of the presale sold out faster than anyone anticipated, raising over $950k and boosting the price by 20% to $0.012. With a 20% bonus on current purchases, analysts are calling 1FUEL one of the best cryptocurrencies to watch in 2025. It’s not just a wallet; it’s a passport to the future of finance. The B ottom Line While Shiba Inu has its fans, 1FUEL’s explosive potential is in a league of its own. With seamless cross-chain transactions, unmatched privacy, and real-world usability through debit cards, it’s a project built for the future.

Its structured presale, unique utility, and massive growth potential make it a standout in the crowded crypto market. This isn’t just another token; it’s a chance to be part of something bigger — something unstoppable. Fantom : A high-speed, scalable smart contract platform Fantom (FTM) is a smart contract platform designed to overcome the limitations of older blockchains like Ethereum. It uses its own consensus mechanism called Lachesis, allowing for thousands of transactions per second. Transactions are settled in 1-2 seconds at a very low cost. Fantom supports decentralized applications and digital assets, offering tools for developers and compatibility with Ethereum’s programming language. This makes it an efficient platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) services. With its focus on scalability, security, and decentralization, Fantom has the potential to attract developers and users seeking fast and affordable blockchain solutions. Considering its technological advantages, FTM may appear attractive in the current market cycle. Ethena: A crypto-native synthetic dollar and internet bond Ethena (ENA) is a synthetic dollar protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to offer a crypto-native monetary solution that operates independently of traditional banking infrastructure. Alongside this, it introduces the Internet Bond, a globally accessible, dollar-denominated savings instrument. By providing a decentralized alternative to traditional dollars and bonds, Ethena seeks to enhance accessibility and financial inclusion. In the current market cycle, with increasing interest in decentralized finance and alternatives to conventional banking, ENA presents a compelling option for those seeking stable assets within the crypto ecosystem. Uniswap’s UNI Token: Governance power in decentralized exchange Uniswap’s UNI token, launched in September 2020, allows holders to vote on platform decisions like fees and token distributions. Introduced in response to SushiSwap’s competition, Uniswap distributed 150 million UNI tokens to past users, giving each 400 tokens worth over $1,000 at launch. Since 2018, Uniswap operates as a leading decentralized exchange on Ethereum , using an automated liquidity protocol that enables trading without an order book and gives users full control over their funds. Its open-source design and free token listing distinguish it from centralized exchanges. With over $3 billion in assets, UNI’s significant role in Uniswap’s ecosystem and the DeFi space makes it an important token in the current market cycle. Solana: A high-speed blockchain for decentralized applications Solana is a blockchain platform built for scalability, offering fast transactions and flexible development in multiple programming languages. SOL, its native cryptocurrency, plays a key role in the ecosystem by facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network supporters. Unlike some other platforms, Solana avoids using sharding or second-layer solutions to achieve scalability. This approach makes it appealing to developers and users seeking a high-capacity network capable of hosting products and services with high activity. The SOL coin underpins the operation of the Solana ecosystem, supporting a wide range of decentralized applications. In the current market cycle, Solana’s focus on speed and scalability highlights its potential in the blockchain space. Conclusion While FTM, ENA, UNI, and SOL show promise, their short-term potential may be limited in the current bull run. Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero, offering 700% ROI in its presale. With governance, incentives, and staking, it invites all to join the fight for financial freedom and defeat crypto villains.

Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) might be challenged by a new PayFi gem — Remittix (RTX) . The new PayFi solution is capturing attention for its innovative approach to cross-border payments, positioning it as a serious contender to XRP. As Solana rallies, XRP must stay vigilant as Remittix rises in prominence. Remittix Makes Cross-border Transactions Cheaper & Faster Remittix (RTX) seamlessly bridges cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies. The platform streamlines fiat-to-crypto transactions, making them faster, more affordable, and more secure. Users can instantly swap over 30 crypto assets into fiat and transfer funds to any bank account worldwide, avoiding delays, intermediaries, and high fees common in traditional banking. The platform supports stablecoins, ensuring consistent currency value during transactions. This feature has attracted thousands of investors, contributing to the sale of over 50 million tokens during the presale. Remittix also offers multi-currency wallets, enabling users to store Ethereum and fiat currencies in one place. Merchants and businesses benefit from the Remittix PayFi API, which seamlessly converts crypto payments into fiat. Companies can send fiat payments via crypto without revealing the involvement of cryptocurrencies. The platform's immutable transactions reduce chargebacks, enhancing users' reliability. Remittix’s security has been audited by SolidProof and BlockSAFU, assuring a trustworthy system for its growing user base. Remittix is gaining momentum by effectively bridging crypto and fiat systems. The RTX token sells at $0.0172, making it an appealing choice to early investors. Analysts predict the token will surge by 50x in value in the coming months. This affordability and growth potential combination positions Remittix as a standout contender in the crypto market. Solana’s Sale of Pump.fun Boosts SOL’s Price Solana’s price surged by 10%, surpassing $210. The price increase began when Pump.funplatform’s fee account moved $55 million worth of SOL to the Kraken exchange. Pump.fun has added substantial sell pressure to Solana throughout 2024. Data from Lookonchainindicates that the platform has deposited over $303 million worth of SOL to Kraken and sold more than $41 million worth of SOL tokens. Analysts predict Solana could reach $400, supported by historical chart patterns and anticipation for the approval of the first United States spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). Investor optimism continues to grow, with many expecting the ETF to gain approval by the end of 2025. Analyst Predicts XRP ETF Could be Approve by Mid-2025 Ripple (XRP) is undergoing significant developments that could drive its value higher in 2025. In December, the altcoin introduced Ripple’s Lab Stablecoin (RLUSD), which is already gaining attention in the market. This launch has strengthened Ripple’s (XRP) position and generated positive sentiment among traders. As SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced plans to resign, the recent U.S. election brought further optimism with Trump’s victory. Gensler’s departure raises hopes for a more crypto-friendly SEC. This change could lead to the SEC dropping its appeal, eliminating long-standing legal uncertainties for Ripple (XRP). This resolution is expected to build investor confidence and attract institutional capital to the platform. Another pivotal factor is the potential approval of Ripple’s (XRP) exchange-traded fund (ETF). Legal expert Jeremy Hogan predicts this approval may come in mid-2025. If approved, industry experts think XRP will reach $10 by 2025. Remittix Gaining Traction as The Next Big Thing in Crypto Remittix is gaining significant attention with its presale, attracting interest from crypto investors. The protocol’s unique features make it an appealing option for cross-border payments. While XRP and Solana remain key players in the crypto market, Remittix stands out with its innovative approach to facilitating smooth crypto-to-fiat transactions. Analysts project that Remittix will surge by 5,000% in 2025 as the platform continues to gain traction.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 15:58:00

Amidst this renewed bullish strength, Bitcoin is preparing for a vital encounter with the $99,900 capable of significantly altering its price trajectory in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $100,000: Is the Bull Market Over or Just Taking a Breather? Bull Flag Or Bear Flag, Bitcoin Bulls To Call In an X post on January 3, crypto analyst with username Plan D shared an analytical commentary on Bitcoin’s price. Plan D stated the premier cryptocurrency is currently forming a “moon flag” that will face major resistance at $99,900. A “moon flag” here likely refers to a chart pattern that will result in a dramatic price gain upon confirmation. It is based on the bull flag which is a continuation pattern that occurs during an uptrend indicating potential breakout and further price gains. A bull flag is characterized by a period of consolidation after a sharp price gain followed by an uptrend. For Bitcoin’s “moon flag” to become valid, Plan D states the asset must break and stay above $99,900, which may result in a sustained price rise to around $108,000. However, if Bitcoin fails to move above $99,900, this development may indicate confirmation of a bear flag—a bearish chart pattern that mirrors the bull flag but indicates downward momentum instead. In this case, Bitcoin is projected to fall as low as 78,000 indicating a potential 20.3% from its current market price and 27.7% from its all-time high of $108,268. Plan D notes that while altcoins are currently a profit zone for most investors with Bitcoin Dominance on the decline, the crypto market is not safely on an upward trajectory until Bitcoin breaks above $99,900. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Moves From 56 To 60-Day Cycle After Crash Below $100,000, What To Expect Next BTC Price Overview At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $97,903 after price gains of 0.72% and 3.95% in the past one and seven days respectively. However, the premier cryptocurrency remains in the red zone on its monthly chart with a 0.77% loss Amidst Bitcoin’s ongoing price rebound, traders are taking profit as evidenced by a recent reduction in long position on Binance from 66.33% to 56.85%. However, long positions remaining dominant over short positions by 13.7%, indicate that the majority of Binance traders still anticipate Bitcoin to maintain its current uptrend. These bullish sentiments in the Bitcoin market are only likely to grow stronger in the coming days as Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration approaches. Many enthusiasts expect the US President-elect to lead a pro-crypto government based on his electoral campaign promises.

33767162,[object Object],1736006440,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Whales Control 94.5% Of Exchange Volume – Selling Patterns Suggest Shift Ahead,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whales-control-94-5-of-exchange-volume-selling-patterns-suggest-shift-ahead/,"Bitcoin has experienced a significant surge, climbing from local lows of $92,000 to a local top of $98,950 yesterday. This upward momentum has reignited optimism among investors and analysts as the leading cryptocurrency continues to show resilience after weeks of market indecision. However, the dynamics behind this rally shed light on the influence of major market players. Data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler highlights an intriguing trend: the top 10 large transactions on exchanges now dominate 94.5% of the total trading volume, overshadowing smaller transactions. This data suggests that whales and institutional investors are playing a dominant role in shaping Bitcoin’s price movements. Their dominance not only underscores the concentration of market power but also raises questions about the sustainability and trajectory of this recent surge. As BTC approaches the psychological $100,000 mark , the market eagerly awaits confirmation of a continued bullish trend. The interplay between large transactions and retail participation will determine the cryptocurrency’s direction in the coming weeks. Whether this rally is the start of a new leg up or a temporary spike remains to be seen, but the current dynamics highlight the growing influence of major players in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Dynamics May Change Bitcoin whales have always played a critical role in the cryptocurrency market, consistently dominating over 90% of transaction volumes since its early stages. Their influence is a hallmark of the market’s dynamics, often dictating price trends and shaping investor sentiment. However, this dominance is not static and fluctuates with market cycles, offering insight into broader trends. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared data on X , shedding light on the current state of whale activity. According to Adler, the top 10 large transactions on exchanges now account for an impressive 94.5% of the total market volume, eclipsing smaller transactions. This figure is particularly noteworthy as it exceeds the 10-year average of 93.5%, underscoring the increasing concentration of market power among large players. Adler highlights a historical trend in whale behavior: around the mid-cycle, whales typically sell their holdings, gradually reducing their market dominance as the cycle peaks. This pattern was prominently observed during Bitcoin’s movement between $35,000 and $70,000, where whale dominance began to wane. The current elevated dominance of large transactions suggests that whales remain highly active, which could signal the early to mid-stages of a bullish cycle. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for investors. While whale dominance highlights confidence among major players, it also emphasizes the importance of monitoring their behavior for signs of market shifts. As Bitcoin navigates its next move, tracking these metrics will be vital for assessing the potential trajectory of the market. BTC Trying To Push Above $100K Bitcoin is currently trading around $98,000, following its first attempt to breach the highly anticipated $100,000 mark. This level represents a significant psychological and technical barrier, and breaking above it could pave the way for a new wave of bullish momentum. However, for this to happen, bulls must not only push the price above $100K but also establish it as a strong support level to confirm the breakout. The $95,000 mark has proven to be a robust support level, offering a foundation for Bitcoin’s current position. Holding above this level is a positive sign, as it keeps the bullish structure intact and gradually weakens the resistance at the $100K supply zone. This sets the stage for another attempt to reclaim new highs. Market participants are closely watching the $100K level, as a successful breach could trigger an aggressive rally, driving BTC into uncharted territory. On the other hand, failing to break above this level in the near term could lead to prolonged consolidation or even a retracement to retest lower support levels. As sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next few days will be pivotal in determining Bitcoin’s short-term direction and the broader market’s momentum.

Center stage is its native token, 3BAY, designed with a tokenomics structure that promises to be a magnet for those eyeing the best crypto presale spots. With a deflationary model and a strategic allocation approach, 3BAY isn’t just riding the wave of buzzwords; it’s setting the pace, turning potential into profit. The Art of Presale Mastery Diving into Web3Bay’s tokenomics reveals a strategic 40% token allocation to the best crypto presale, translating into 2 billion tokens aimed squarely at fuelling early-stage growth and liquidity. Starting at a modest $0.003 per token, the journey through 28 presale stages—each hiking the price by 15%—culminates in a token priced at $0.1959. It’s a setup that tempts with the allure of significant returns, painting a picture of a presale primed for high stakes and even higher rewards. With over $254K raised and more than 77 million tokens already claimed, the presale’s second stage prices each 3BAY at $0.00345. This progressive pricing isn’t just pulling up the value; it’s an invitation to jump on board early. The clarity and focus of Web3Bay’s fundraising strategy are a beacon for those seeking to anchor in a crypto with tangible growth prospects. Here, early action is the key to unlocking substantial returns, setting the stage for a high-ROI crypto opportunity . Where Scarcity Meets Value In the world of crypto, scarcity is akin to gold dust. Web3Bay harnesses this principle by capping the total supply of 3BAY tokens at 5 billion. Beyond the inherent scarcity, the plot thickens with deflationary tactics designed to reduce the circulating supply, elevating the tokens’ value over time. The platform’s transaction incentives—offering a 5% discount for purchases made with 3BAY—do more than encourage use; they enhance the token’s scarcity by setting aside a portion for future burning. This strategic reduction ensures that as the platform’s popularity surges, the number of tokens dwindles, sewing a rich tapestry of supply and demand dynamics that favor early investors. Governance with a Golden Touch Web3Bay doesn’t just offer tokens; it invites its community into the governance fold. Holding 3BAY tokens means more than investment; it’s a vote in the platform’s evolution, a chance to steer the ship. This democratic approach deepens user engagement, building a foundation of trust and transparency rare in many crypto ventures. Token holders become stakeholders, their fortunes woven into the platform’s success. This synergy between user and platform cultivates a fertile ground for value growth, ensuring that the tokens held today grow more potent as Web3Bay expands its reach. Why 3BAY is the Crypto Crown Jewel Web3Bay’s tokenomics is a masterclass in crypto-economic design. The robust presale structure combined with the deflationary model positions 3BAY for an enviable trajectory of long-term value appreciation. As the platform’s ecosystem thrives on the back of next-gen Web3 shopping solutions, demand for 3BAY is set to skyrocket, outpacing supply and securing its status as the best crypto presale. Final Thoughts As the blockchain arena continues to evolve, Web3Bay is carving out its niche with a forward-thinking approach to tokenomics. The significant presale allocation and deflationary measures underline a commitment to nurturing value for token holders. With governance and community engagement at its core, 3BAY isn’t just a token—it’s a gateway to the future of e-commerce in the Web3 era. For those scouting the best crypto presale , the time is now; 3BAY’s blend of scarcity and structured growth makes it a prime pick in today’s crypto landscape.

The analyst also revealed the timeline for when the top meme coin could reach these price targets. Two Levels To Watch Before FLOKI Price Hits ATH In an X post, Master Kenobi revealed $0.00021 and $0.00028 as two levels to watch before the FLOKI price hits its current ATH of $0.00035 and enters price discovery. He added that he believes that the top meme coin will hit these price levels this month. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that FLOKI could rally to as high as $0.0011 as it rallies to a new ATH. A rally to this price level represents a gain of around 478% for the meme coin. Master Kenobi also recently provided a bullish outlook for the FLOKI price. The crypto analyst mentioned that the crypto was on the verge of a massive breakout that could send its price to around $0.00080. In a recent X post, he again reaffirmed that the meme coin was on the verge of a price breakout. Master Kenobi suggested that FLOKI could soon breakout from the two-weeks rectangle. More Bullish Outlook For The Top Meme Coin Other crypto analysts have provided a bullish outlook for the FLOKI price. One of them is World Of Charts. In an X post , the crypto analyst noted that the meme coin has recorded a 2x price increase from its last breakout. He added that FLOKI is now bouncing again from the horizontal support area and approaching the bullish flag trendline. In line with this, World Of Charts predicted that the meme coin could record another 2x price increase in the coming days. Crypto analyst Poseidon noted that the FLOKI price has recorded 300 days of consolidation. He remarked that this consolidation phase should end with an expansion to the upside. From a fundamentals perspective, FLOKI also has a bullish outlook. As CoinGape reported, the meme coin’s ETP could go live in the first quarter of this year. This fund will attract institutional inflows into the coin’s ecosystem and possibly contribute to future price rallies.

The cryptocurrency SPX6900 (SPX) operates on the Ethereum network.

There are about 930 million of its 1 billion tokens in circulation. The coin is available for trading on several exchanges, including decentralized ones like Aerodrome and Uniswap V2. Through these platforms, users can buy and sell SPX tokens, possibly making money off of market fluctuations and price volatility. However, it is quite volatile. Its price is impacted by worldwide cryptocurrency trends and market emotion. SPX can also be used to generate interest by spot trading or pledging, while perpetual and ETF/leveraged trading are not recommended for non-professionals because of their high risk.

China just let its currency, the yuan, sink past a level it had fiercely protected for weeks. The decision is a shot fired in what could become a full-blown economic war, and Washington isn’t sitting still. President Donald Trump, who has spent years accusing China and others of using cheap currencies to crush U.S. businesses, is back and ready to start drama. Trump has always had a bone to pick with exchange rates. Last June, he called out China and Japan, accusing them of rigging their currencies to pile “a tremendous burden” on American companies. His weapon of choice? Tariffs. He spent his first administration threatening and slapping tariffs to force foreign currencies to appreciate. With the yuan now weaker than ever, this is the opening act of what could define 2025. Currency wars are nothing new, but they’re always bad news Currency wars are a tale as old as time, and they don’t end well. The 1930s are a case in point. Back then, nations played dirty, devaluing their currencies and jacking up tariffs. It was called “beggar-thy-neighbor” economics, and it wrecked global trade. A study by economists Kris Mitchener and Kirsten Wandschneider showed that those tactics slashed trade by 18%. Countries started looking inward, focusing on their own problems and leaving the global system to rot. Franklin D. Roosevelt drove the point home in 1933 when he skipped a global economic conference in London and went sailing instead. That set off a domino effect—over 70 countries devalued their currencies, throwing international trade into disarray. The fallout didn’t stop there. The world learned its lesson the hard way, and after World War II, the U.S. changed its tune. It led the charge to build institutions like the International Monetary Fund, fostering cooperation and trade. Even in 2008, when the global financial system was on the brink, the U.S. worked with G20 nations to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. But Trump? He’s dragging the playbook back to the 1930s, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Trump’s tariff threats are a ticking economy time bomb During his campaign, he floated a 20% universal tariff and a 60% tariff on China. Those numbers didn’t stick, but the attitude did. Economists predict that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might strike a deal to keep tariffs and export controls at manageable levels. But here’s the thing—deals only work if both sides play nice. If either Washington or Beijing miscalculates, the fallout could escalate fast. And history has shown us what happens when economic tensions spiral out of control. The yuan’s decline is a political statement. China’s domestic demand is stagnant, and its interest rates are at rock bottom. Letting the yuan weaken makes sense for Beijing, but it’s a red flag for Trump. He doesn’t care about the “why.” He’s focused on the “what,” and what he sees is a currency undercutting U.S. competitiveness. The effects of this showdown are already being felt. Goldman Sachs predicts global growth will hold steady at 2.7% in 2025, mirroring 2024. The U.S. economy is expected to grow by 2.5%, way ahead of the eurozone’s 0.8%. Inflation is easing, dropping from 6.8% in 2023 to 4.5% by 2025. That’s giving central banks room to cut rates, with the Fed aiming for 3.25%-3.5%. Emerging markets aren’t so lucky. Growth is slowing to 4.2%, hit by trade tensions and structural issues. The eurozone is also struggling, weighed down by new tariffs and a shaky economic outlook. And all of this is happening against the backdrop of a potential U.S.-China standoff.

Table of Contents Rollblock’s unique rev-share mechanism makes dreams come true Solana is up 10% as community is bullish on ETFs Shiba Inu teases a breakout Join the RBLK presale After double-digit declines, both Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are finally in the green again. Meanwhile, crypto casino Rollblock continues to tear through milestones as investors have started taking notice. With over $8 million raised during the ongoing presale of the RBLK tokens, Rollblock is positioned to be one of the top performers of 2025. Let’s dive deeper. Rollblock’s unique rev-share mechanism makes dreams come true Rollblock sets itself apart from other crypto casinos as it is entirely blockchain-based. This means that many of the inefficiencies typical of the industry don’t apply to Rollblock . All transactions are easily traceable, and the manipulation of bets is virtually impossible as all data is immutably inscribed on-chain Over 35,000 early adopters have joined the Rollblock ranks and are already enjoying the 7,000-title library, which caters to every type of player. From casino classics such as blackjack and roulette to blockchain-exclusive games, newcomers will always find something that suits their style. On top of this, Rollbllock also boasts a brand-new sports betting platform, allowing enthusiasts to place their bets on their favorite sporting events and tournaments. Users will have the opportunity to engage with one of the most lucrative reward systems in the crypto space, powered by the native RBLK token. Every week, Rollblock will repurchase RBLK from the open market by spending up to 30% of the casino’s own revenue. 60% of these tokens will be burned forever, promoting scarcity-driven growth, while the rest will be distributed to users as recurring staking rewards.

However, the incoming Trump administration promises to be a pro-crypto one and introduce a new regulatory framework to promote and encourage crypto adoption, which analysts expect to have a significant impact on Solana’s price performance. Over 70% of the community expects Solana ETFs to gain approval by July 2025 according to Polymarket betting activity. At the time of writing, Solana trades at $214 following a 10% intraday increase and a 35% surge in 24-hour trading volume. As hope returns to the market, Solana is ready to fill the trend and enter price discovery once the $264 ATH is reclaimed, with the next major target being the untested $300 mark. Shiba Inu teases a breakout Shiba Inu is capturing attention once again as it recorded an 8% daily increase, which saw its price reclaim and hold the critical $0.000022 level. Trading activity has risen by over 77%, with more than $550 million worth of Shiba Inu changing hands across the various platforms. Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain has also recorded a surge in activity and is now averaging 4.7 million daily transactions, having reached the 700 million milestone just a week ago, on Christmas day. As meme coins seem primed for a resurgence, Shiba Inu has another ace up its sleeve that could see it reach incredible heights at the peak of the bull run — Shibburn. This is Shiba Inu’s dedicated burn mechanism, which constantly deflates the circulating supply of SHIB. In 2024 alone, more than 44 billion SHIB were torched, worth approximately $1 million at current prices. Join the RBLK presale Right now, RBLK tokens are selling for just $0.0445, and early buyers are already enjoying 345% gains, with an additional 800% surge expected by the end of the presale alone. This current price point is still the perfect opportunity for proactive investors. Analysts firmly believe that Rollblock could become the next 100x gem, especially when taking into account all that this project has to offer.

The truth is, that meme coins have nothing to back them up, and they have to rely on something else for their value. Do this right, and meme coins like Bonk and DogWifHat can be extraordinarily lucrative, but it requires nerves of steel. A much safer and less nerve-wracking investment opportunity is in Remittix , this new crypto allows cross-border crypto payments and is grabbing headlines for all the right reasons. Remittix (RTX): The Dreams Of International Crypto Payments Are Now A Reality Crypto payments are the ideal use case for blockchain tech, but unfortunately it’s not widely accepted yet. Apart from a few outlier jurisdictions, crypto payments are nowhere near a reality but Remittix has changed all that. Remittix has pioneered a way for its holders to do unilateral crypto-to-fiat payments! Remittix is available in over 30 fiat currencies and allows crypto payments directly into a recipient’s bank account. The recipient does not even know it’s a crypto payment! The advantages: it is nearly instant, at a fraction of the cost, and does not require the regulatory paperwork of foreign exchange transactions. Remittix’s capacity for decentralizing international crypto payments is an absolute game changer, and the investment potential is immense! Bonk (BONK): Solana Dog-based Meme Coin’s Bite Underwhelms Bonk had a brilliant year between November 2023 and November 2024, but December was not kind to the meme coin. Bonk was needed in the market. Solana needed a meme coin, and Bonk fit the bill like a glove. At first, Bonk did the predictable thing and did nothing, but when Bonk exploded, it exploded! Bonk did the usual meme coin thing and shot the moon, but it could not maintain momentum like most meme coins. Bonk lost nearly half the value it had built up during the Pump Trump, and now investors are looking for something else to make up for their losses. Dogwifhat (WIF): Iconic Meme Coin Collapses To March 24 Levels dogwifhat is in many ways the quintessential meme coin: it is frivolous, irreverent, it has no basis for existing, it has nothing to back it up, it is a worthless token, and it made a boatload of money for its investors. dogwifhat started 2024 at $0.30 and peaked at way over 10x that at $4.80. dogwifhat was a good dog, indeed. But WIF seems to have lost its bite and is trading at two bucks, down 60% from its ATH, again showcasing typical meme coin behavior. Great to hold when the market is bullish and if you sell at the top. However, it is disastrous in a downturn. WIF, like all meme coins, does its own thing irrespective of market sentiment. It can be up by miles one day and tumbling off a cliff the next, regardless of market trends. Conclusion When meme coins like WIF and Bonk cause too much uncertainty, investors look for tokens with utility and long-term sustainability. When one considers Remittix’s cross-border crypto payments use case and the billions of dollars that can move through such a system, it stands to reason that Remittix is a much better investment option than meme coins. Remittix is now available in presale at $0.0172 making now an excellent time to acquire the RTX token before it rises to $0.0177 in just a few days!

While this signals growing adoption and a flood of projects moving on-chain, it also brings increased complexity. Users are finding it harder to transfer assets between chains, while projects struggle to attract users beyond their native ecosystems. Liquidity is scattered, and managing assets across chains and applications has become a serious challenge. In this blog, we’ll dive into the key issues of fragmented liquidity, complicated asset transfers, and integration challenges for developers — and how LI.FI makes the DeFi experience better. Solving DeFi Fragmentation As DeFi continues to evolve, the ecosystem faces several key challenges, from fragmented liquidity to complex user experiences and developer integration headaches. Let’s understand each challenge and how LI.FI helps overcome it: 1. Fragmented Liquidity Across Chains The increase in the number of chains has spread liquidity across different apps and chains. This makes it harder for users and developers to find the best rates or access the most efficient liquidity. With liquidity scattered, there’s often higher slippage, suboptimal trading conditions, and more manual work to connect to each liquidity source. Via Defillama To solve this, LI.FI aggregates liquidity from over 30+ chains, 18+ bridges, and 38+ DEXs and DEX aggregators into a single platform. Instead of manually navigating fragmented liquidity, users and developers can access everything they need from one place. This means better prices, lower slippage, and smoother transactions without having to deal with the complexity of multiple integrations. 2. Complex User Experience in Multi-Chain Transactions Interacting across chains can be a frustrating experience for users. Swapping, bridging, or moving assets typically requires multiple steps and different tools, which makes the process slow and confusing. This complexity discourages users from engaging fully with DeFi. Zaps, a feature in our stack, streamlines the process by bundling multi-step transactions into one action, whether it’s swapping, bridging, or staking. By handling the complicated processes behind the scenes, multi-chain actions are simplified. Through a single API call, users can perform cross-chain swaps, transfers and directly interact with your app, without worrying about the underlying steps to get there. This drastically improves the overall experience by reducing the effort and knowledge required to interact with DeFi. 3. Developer Complexity in Integrating Multi-Chain Features For developers, adding multi-chain functionality is a challenge. They need to integrate multiple bridges, liquidity sources, and protocols, which increases both development time and maintenance costs. This slows down the ability to launch new features or support different chains. With access to a single integration point, developers no longer have to deal with the headache of piecing together different systems. LI.FI offers a range of tools that are available depending on how much control and customization you require: • APIs and SDKs offer deeper customization, allowing developers to build cross-chain swaps, bridges, and liquidity features in a way that best fits their specific application. These tools provide full control, enabling developers to integrate features with precision while managing gas fees, optimizing routes, and minimizing slippage.• For developers looking for a quick solution, Widgets provide a plug-and-play option. With just a few lines of code, developers can integrate multi-chain functionality instantly. This approach is perfect for those who need rapid deployment without the need for extensive customization. This flexible approach allows developers to choose the integration that best fits their needs, whether they are seeking full control with APIs and SDKs or a faster, simplified solution through widgets. 4. Lack of Gas Tokens on Destination Chains One of the common issues users face when transacting across chains is the lack of gas tokens on the destination chain, which can cause assets to be stuck on a chain without any gas. Having to manually acquire gas tokens for each chain adds another layer of complexity. To solve this, LI.FI provides gas refuel, which ensures that users have the necessary gas to complete their transactions seamlessly. This feature eliminates the need for users to manually acquire gas tokens, simplifying the process and reducing transaction failures across different chains. Conclusion In the rapidly expanding DeFi space, fragmentation and complexity can slow down both user adoption and development progress. LI.FI opens up the possibility for more intuitive financial applications, where users don’t need to worry about the multi-chain interactions of swapping, bridging, or gas refuels. By simplifying user interactions, we can create a more streamlined and accessible DeFi experience. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With a bold narrative of chaos and opportunity, Catzilla positions itself as the ultimate meme coin for investors ready to harness its roaring potential. A warrior’s journey: Conquer the 14 stages Catzilla isn’t just a token; it’s an odyssey. With 14 presale stages leading to public launch, every step is a chance to amplify crypto holdings, with gains skyrocketing up to 700%. Each stage tells a story of growth, determination, and financial empowerment, making CATZILLA not just an investment but an adventure. The power of cats: Why meow matters Feline-inspired tokens like MEW and Popcat have proven that cats don’t just land on their feet — they leap to massive gains. MEW clawed its way into the top meme coins with a 103.7% surge, while Popcat delivered an awe-inspiring 157.44% growth in record time.

In the Jasmy ecosystem, data can be treated as personal assets. The project’s approach to data democratization allows users to own their data securely, while service providers can offer services using that data. Considering the growing importance of data security and privacy, JasmyCoin’s technology addresses significant concerns in the digital age. Whether the coin is attractive in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market trends and individual investment goals. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but with notable differences. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, enhancing its compatibility within the Ethereum ecosystem. The project began with a supply of one quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin to foster credibility and trust. Buterin donated a substantial portion of these tokens to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, actions that significantly raised SHIB’s profile in the cryptocurrency community. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s integration with Ethereum allows for the development of decentralized applications. This includes ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that enables users to trade and stake tokens. Additionally, there are plans for a future non-fungible token (NFT) platform and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-based governance system. These developments suggest potential for broader utility in the cryptocurrency space. The attractiveness of SHIB in the current market cycle depends on various factors, including market conditions, technological advancements, and adoption by users and developers. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on the Ethereum blockchain. It was created as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme, which gained popularity in the early 2000s. The coin aims to ride the wave of success enjoyed by other meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. PEPE is designed with a no-tax policy and is upfront about its lack of utility, embracing its identity as a pure memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE saw a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching as high as $1.6 billion. This rapid growth turned early holders into millionaires and attracted a community of followers. The rise of PEPE has sparked what some refer to as a “memecoin season,” leading to the launch and volatile trading of other memecoins. The PEPE roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and aims for a broader “meme takeover.” Whether PEPE remains attractive in the current market cycle depends on market dynamics and investor sentiment. Its appeal is tied to its meme status and community support, factors that contribute to its prominence in the cryptocurrency space. Floki Inu (FLOKI) Floki, initially known as Floki Inu, is a cryptocurrency that emerged in June 2021. It was inspired by Elon Musk’s tweet about naming his Shiba Inu dog Floki. What began as a meme coin has evolved into a project with real-world applications. Floki aims to provide utility and engage in charitable activities. One of its notable initiatives is building schools in less developed countries like Laos and Nigeria. The coin has gained recognition for expanding its ecosystem and increasing its influence. Floki offers various projects that enhance its utility. These include Valhalla, an NFT metaverse game, and FlokiFi, a decentralized finance service. The partnership with NOWPayments and the introduction of the prepaid Floki Card allow users to use FLOKI tokens for transactions in the real world. This diversification into NFTs, DeFi, and real-world applications sets Floki apart from other meme coins. Its expanding ecosystem may be appealing to those interested in cryptocurrencies that offer more than speculative trading. In the current market cycle, Floki’s focus on utility and development could make it an attractive option for investors looking for coins with practical uses. Conclusion JASMY, SHIB, PEPE, and FLOKI are promising, but XYZVerse unites sports fans in a memecoin with ambitious growth goals and a community-driven approach.

Fifteen years later, this network unites thousands of individual and enterprise miners who hunger to release a new Bitcoin and earn rewards in return. However, it is believed that mining crypto coins such as free ethereum is too complicated for beginners and non-techies. Home mining: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-house-connected-to-a-network-with-blue-lights-zZrtuNA9TYU Have things changed in 2024? Is there an energy-effective way to mine BTC, ETH, and altcoins? How to mine Bitcoin at home? Learn all the answers and step-by-step instructions from this Bitcoin mining guide 2024. How to Set Up Home Mining? Among passive crypto income methods, BTC mining is a standalone one. Its setup and operation require specific hardware and software. You’ll have to choose a mining pool and make accurate calculations to ensure the power efficiency of your network. Let’s have a detailed look at these undertakings. Step 1: Evaluate Your Setup Requirements Home-based Bitcoin mining will only be profitable if you establish it on solid hardware. You should also consider that the thing consumes significant amounts of electricity and requires a physical medium with enough space. Hardware Considerations Today, BTC mining is a tough competition with thousands of well-equipped miners engaged. It doesn’t mean you cannot win your place in this competition, but you’ll need proper equipment to make an adequate start. An essential component for your DIY Bitcoin mining setup is an ASIC chip. This technology was invented in 2013 and revolutionized the entire BTC mining industry. Its benefits over outdated CPU-, GPU-, and FPGA-based equipment are as follows: ● Initially designed for crypto mining.● Provide better output.● More efficient from a hash rate power perspective.● More affordable for crypto mining from home. ASIC, or so-called Antminer hardware, is the most effective strategy in today’s competition. Like any other method, it requires initial investments, but it is crucial for ensuring power efficiency and the overall success of your network. Litecoin & Hardware Chip: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-close-up-of-a-computer-chip-with-the-letter-l-on-it-E6NWkgDuj5w Electricity & Space The next point to consider is the cost of electricity your mine will consume. Your expenses will depend on the electric power rates fixed in your location. Mining Bitcoin with ASIC is the most advanced approach. In 2024, a number of next-generation Antminer solutions came to the market. However, be ready to provide enough space for your equipment. It is also crucial to ensure proper cooling for your system. In ultra-modern hardware, temperatures may go up to 45 degrees Celsius, so you’ll need to install additional coolers, air ventilation systems, and other equipment to raise the efficiency of your home-based mine. All this is sure to occupy a specific space, which you should consider beforehand. Step 2: Choose Your Mining Software In 2024, you can pick an Antminer with built-in crypto mine software. However, you may wish to install specific software manually. Then, the chosen app should comply with your hardware type (ASIC, GPU, etc.) The top popular software solutions in today’s industry include GGMiner, ASICSeer, BFGMiner, and Easy Miner. Choosing the right software may be a daunting undertaking. You need to know what type of crypto mine you wish to establish and the expected size of Bitcoin mining profitability. Things to consider in the first place are listed below: 1. Smooth compliance with your hardware.2. Software algorithms that match your chosen crypto coin (BTC, ETH, or another.)3. Built-in features for managing power efficiency.4. Scalability for those who plan to upgrade.5. Strong protective measures for your network security. Decentralization, blockchain: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-computer-generated-image-of-a-network-of-spheres-LUExqP65ifM Other factors important for your choice include automatic updates and vulnerability checks. We recommend shopping around and comparing various solutions available on the market before opting for any. You can build the very mining software you need with your own hands, too! However, this requires you to be an experienced developer with proper knowledge of crypto algorithms. BTC Mining Software Setup As soon as you are ready with your choice, you need to complete the Bitcoin mining software setup. It is simple to do. What is also important is that most software can be downloaded and installed for free. You’ll need to take these steps: 1. Download the targeted software onto your computer.2. Explore the chosen app’s documentation.3. According to the instructions provided by the developer, configure the software so that it suits your needs.4. Check how the installed components co-operate with your hardware.5. If you experience compatibility issues, re-install the software or contact support for troubleshooting. That’s it. Now, your software and hardware are ready to solve math problems and coin new blocks to the blockchain. Step 3: Joining a Mining Pool or Opting for Mine Solo? In fact, you have everything you need to start crypto mining from home now. However, one more effective move you may take is joining a powerful mining pool. Mining pools represent miner communities or sorts of artels. They allow users to cooperate and raise the computer efficiency of their networks. Ethereum blockchain: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-black-and-white-photo-of-cubes-on-a-black-background-IlUq1ruyv0Q There are various pools, but their idea is the same. You join the mining group and contribute to coining new blocks. Then, you earn your rewards according to the size of your contribution. Such a scheme is especially reasonable for home miners, as it allows them to ensure quick and frequent rewards. The list of reliable pools with affordable fees includes Slush Pool, AntPool, and F2Pool. If you opt for solo mining, be ready for heavy investments at the initial stage. It may take time to earn your first income this way. However, the future rewards will be much higher in the long run, especially if you’re going to employ optimized Bitcoin mining hardware produced in 2024. Step 4: Configure and Start Mining Now, it's time to configure your hardware and software to ensure the seamless work of both components. Before you start mining, you need to take these steps: 1. Provide your software with your URL or the URL of the chosen mining pool.2. Indicate your miner name and password.3. Insert your crypto wallet address to store the rewards there. Set up one if you haven’t ityet.4. Install all the necessary apps to monitor the performance of your network. Tracking your network’s statistics and progress is crucial for the efficient work of the entire system. You can use the data provided by your software’s dashboard, or you can apply specialized software. For instance, you can set up NiceHash or MinerStat to get access to detailed reports on your BTC mine’s profitability. Bitcoin Gold Image: https://unsplash.com/photos/a-gold-bit-coin-sitting-on-top-of-a-black-table-k9IbEseIQ04 Step 5: Calculate Profitability Measuring costs and expected profits is fundamental for your project. The key factors to include in your calculations are as follows: ● The local electricity rate.● Hash rate & network difficulty.● Mining pool fees.● Price volatility of the chosen crypto coin. Calculating your profit is a simple thing. You can use the formula below: If you do not wish to beat your brains by making complex calculations, you can use ready calculators online. The available Bitcoin mining hardware 2024, together with profitable electricity rates, can lead you to a truly cost-efficient home crypto mine. Tips for Optimizing Home-Based Mining The key point for any crypto miner is to raise the efficiency of their network. Besides implementing energy-effective Bitcoin mining hardware, they can also optimize their home-based mine by taking these actions: 1. Opt for renewable energy supplies (solar panels, wind energy, etc.)2. Increase mining activities at off-peak periods.3. Protect your hardware against overheating by using quality coolers, cleaners, etc.4. Communicate with other miners to share experiences, adopt useful innovations, and troubleshoot. These rules will help maximize your return. We also recommend following the crypto miner communities and top influencers to stay updated on the news. Conclusion Thanks to advanced technology and highly efficient equipment, home-based Bitcoin mining can be a profitable undertaking in 2024. However, certain preparations and thorough profit calculations are needed to run a successful crypto mine. Unlike other passive crypto income methods, mining requires purchasing hardware, installing specific applications, and providing enough room for your mine. You should also consider your local electricity rate, which will be a decisive factor for your Bitcoin mining profitability. Only after you totalize all these factors can you switch to setting up your mining project. Today, this process is a breeze.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL.

That’s half the community,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-hated-crypto-before-he-loved-it/,"The Daily Telegraph thinks it’s funny. Donald Trump hated crypto, called Bitcoin a scam, and slammed it as competition for the dollar. Now he’s calling himself the “crypto president.” The paper paints his conversion as some kind of warning sign, a red flag waving over the world. But let’s get real — half of the crypto community used to not care for Bitcoin too. Trump isn’t the first skeptic turned believer, and he won’t be the last. That’s literally the whole point of the industry. Jeremy Warner, assistant editor at The Telegraph, recalled Trump’s 2021 Fox News interview, where he said, “Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam” to claim Trump’s love for crypto is “positively Damascene,” before going on to label his pro-crypto plans as reckless. Trump’s crypto team: A lineup designed to disrupt Trump’s administration is staffing up with some of the biggest names in the game. Paul Atkins, the crypto-friendly former SEC commissioner, is set to take charge of the agency. This guy was investing in Bitcoin back in 2011. Yeah, that’s a true believer. Then there’s David Sacks, a tech veteran and proud blockchain lover. He’s stepping into a newly created role as the White House’s “AI and crypto czar,” though as we reported , he had to delegate some of his responsibilities to the Crypto Council, led by Bo Hines. Stephen Miran, the nominee for Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, adds to this powerhouse roster. He’s been a vocal critic of heavy-handed crypto regulation and promises to push for a lighter touch on policies affecting blockchain innovation. But the biggest headline grabber might be Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary. Lutnick has a 5% stake in Tether, one of the world’s largest stablecoin issuers. Plus, he’s well-liked in the crypto community. The nerds go crazy for him on X (formerly Twitter). It doesn’t stop there. Trump and his sons, Eric and Don Jr., have launched World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture touting “no direct oversight by government agencies.” However, some people, like Warner, think he only launched it to make money. But is there a single person in the world who isn’t in anything to make money? What a ludicrous argument! If the paper had a 45% stake in Trump’s company, bet they wouldn’t think the same. Deregulation fears: A recipe for disaster or crypto’s big break? The Telegraph sees Trump’s crypto enthusiasm as dangerous. Warner argues that deregulating crypto will open the floodgates for fraud, money laundering, and financial crises. He pointed to the fallout from the Sam Bankman-Fried scandal. Bankman-Fried, who once ran the massive FTX exchange, is now serving 25 years for fraud and money laundering tied to crypto. To Warner, Trump’s promises of deregulation signal a replay of past financial disasters. Sadly, history does back up some of these concerns. Deregulation has often led to massive blowups, like the 2008 financial crisis. Warner’s argument is simple: loosen the leash on finance, and in five to ten years, expect disaster. He sees Trump as the lobbyist’s dream, a champion for vested interests eager to cash in on America’s crypto boom. But for crypto believers, deregulation is the key to breaking the industry free from its current limitations. The crypto market, now worth nearly $3.5 trillion, has bounced back from its 2022 meltdown. Bitcoin has crossed $100,000, and institutional investors are piling in. The optimism surrounding Trump’s crypto-friendly policies has injected new energy into the market. Still, Warner cautions that lifting restrictions on banking exposure to crypto could create systemic risks that affect the global financial system. But while The Telegraph can raise all the red flags it wants, Trump’s crypto strategy isn’t going anywhere. Whether it’s deregulation, pro-crypto appointments, or the launch of a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, Trump will do what he wants in the end, regardless.",OP-ED|BTC|SEC|Tether|USD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-04 17:00:58

At last check Saturday, its price hovered at around $5.13. Sui ( SUI ), a popular layer-2 network, has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, soaring by over 1,312% from its lowest level in 2023. This performance has brought its market cap to over $15 billion, making it the 13th biggest cryptocurrency in the industry. Source: CoinGecko Sui’s surge coincided with the continued ecosystem growth as the total value locked in its Decentralized Finance ecosystem soared to a record high of $1.96 billion. The biggest players in its DeFi ecosystem are Suilend Protocol, NAVI Protocol, Cetus, Scallop Lend, and Aftermath Finance. You might also like: Can the Pepe coin price rise 35% as smart money holders sell? Sui partnerships Sui also grew after securing major partnerships with top companies like VanEck, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. For example, Grayscale launched the Sui Trust, which has accumulated over $14 million in assets. If the Securities and Exchange Commission changes its view on crypto ETFs under Paul Atkins , that could signal that the firm will apply for a spot Sui ETF in 2025. Sui has also had more successes that have propelled it to a record high. It has incorporated four stablecoins like USD Coin, AUSD, FDUSD, and USDY, which have a combined market cap of over $406 million. It also launched Deepbook V3, its native onchain order book, whose trading volume jumped to over $1 billion. Its DEEP token has gained a market value of over $375 million. Meanwhile, Sui’s DEX ecosystem is booming, handling over $46 billion in volume since its inception. More data shows that Sui’s futures open interest soared to a record high of $963 million. This is a notable increase from this week’s low of $650 million and a sign that SUI’s token is gaining traction among investors. Sui open interest | Source: CoinGlass Sui price forecast SUI price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SUI token has been bullish this year, rising for four straight days and flipping the resistance at $5 into resistance. By doing that, the coin invalidated the risky double-top pattern whose neckline was at $4. A double-top is a popular reversal sign in the market. The price of Sui has been supported by the 50-day moving average, which it has failed to move below since September last year. It is also a cheap coin, as the Z-score of the Market Value to Realized Value has fallen to 2.7. A cryptocurrency is said to be highly expensive when it has a Z score of 3.8. Therefore, technicals suggest that the SUI price will rise to the extreme overshoot of the Murrey Math Lines at $5.50. A move above that level will raise the odds of it moving to the next crucial level at $10.

This shift highlights the U.S.’s dominance in the “digital gold” rush. Despite this, Chinese mining pools still significantly influence, even with ongoing restrictions. U.S. Mining Pools Lead the Charge The U.S. leads Bitcoin mining through Foundry USA and Marathon Holdings (MARA), which mined over 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks together. Foundry USA, the largest pool globally, grew from 157 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 280 EH/s by December. The company controls nearly 36.5% of the network’s hashrate. MARA Pool, on the other hand, contributes 4.35% with 32 EH/s. These two pools have firmly placed the U.S. in the driver’s seat of the Bitcoin mining industry. Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers and private firms seek to tap into its potential. Texas lawmakers are considering launching a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to secure the state’s future in digital finance. This initiative aims to strengthen the U.S.’s role in global Bitcoin mining. The U.S. achieved dominance despite the difficulty of Bitcoin mining reaching an all-time high (ATH) last year . China’s Persistent Grip on Global Mining Power Despite the U.S.’s rise, China remains a strong force in the Bitcoin mining sector. As of September 2024, Chinese mining pools still commanded a staggering 55% of the global hashrate, despite its 2021 crackdown on crypto mining. The ban, meant to curb the country’s grip on crypto , has not slowed down the Chinese mining operations. Instead, miners used VPNs and peer-to-peer apps to continue mining under the radar, bypassing the restriction. This makes it hard to track the true distribution of mining power, as Bitcoin mining is a global operation. Meanwhile, the concentration of mining power in a few large pools has raised concerns about Bitcoin’s decentralization. As big companies dominate due to the high costs, smaller miners are being pushed out. Many fear this could lead to national security risks if one country controls too much of the network. A Shift in Strategy: The U.S. and Bitcoin Mining Hardware Amid rising geopolitical tensions, mining hardware companies are shifting strategies. Bitmain, which controls 90% of the global market, plans to expand its production operations to the U.S. to reduce dependence on China. This expansion comes in response to increasing trade tensions between China and the U.S. Likewise, Jack Dorsey’s Block plans to increase investments in Bitcoin mining and its self-custody wallet, redirecting resources from other projects.

In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation.

The drop in ORDI value could be attributed to the general market sentiment.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November rising above the $35 mark and crossed in December trading at $48 The coin crossed into 2025 trading at $35.70.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-04 17:14:36

With Chainlink and Cronos Leading Blockchain’s Next Phase,https://nulltx.com/qubetics-the-best-crypto-to-buy-for-january-2025-as-it-shapes-the-future-with-chainlink-and-cronos-leading-blockchains-next-phase/,"As we have entered 2025, several cryptocurrencies are creating buzz in the market, with Toncoin and Fantom leading the way as top choices for investors. Toncoin, known for its scalability and fast transactions, has been growing steadily. Similarly, Fantom is drawing attention with its fast and secure blockchain that supports decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. However, there is another crypto rising quickly that promises even more transformative solutions for blockchain enthusiasts: Qubetics. Qubetics is rapidly becoming one of the best cryptos to join for December 2024, and for good reason. Currently in its presale phase, Qubetics has already raised over $8.6 million and has sold more than 397 million $TICS tokens. With over 13,200 token holders already on board, this blockchain project is gaining momentum thanks to its innovative features like the Qubetics non-custodial wallet. For January 2025, Qubetics is not just a must-join project, but a revolutionary solution for users seeking greater security, transparency, and autonomy in the world of cryptocurrency. The Promise of Qubetics: A Game-Changer for Cryptocurrency Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Wallet is one of the key features that sets it apart from other projects. The absence of a non-custodial wallet in many blockchain ecosystems has led to various challenges, especially regarding security and privacy. Many crypto users today rely on centralized exchanges and custodians to hold their assets. This dependency opens the door to significant security risks such as hacks, loss of funds, and unauthorized access. Moreover, these third-party services can often restrict users’ access to their funds, which is a growing concern in today’s regulatory environment. With the rise in regulatory risks targeting centralized crypto services, Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet empowers users by allowing them to retain full control over their private keys and funds. This gives individuals greater security, as they no longer have to trust third parties with their assets. Privacy concerns are also mitigated, as users have more control over their information. In an age where data breaches and surveillance are becoming increasingly common, Qubetics’ approach to decentralization offers a refreshing alternative that prioritizes user autonomy. Another significant issue addressed by Qubetics is scalability. Many blockchain networks struggle with transaction speed and capacity, which can limit their ability to scale effectively as the number of users grows. Qubetics’ focus on scalability ensures that its network can handle increased demand without compromising speed or efficiency. This aspect is particularly important for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain-based applications. As the industry continues to evolve, having a platform that can scale effectively while maintaining high performance will be crucial for long-term success. For more information on Qubetics, check out this video. The Rise of Toncoin While Qubetics is carving out a new space for itself, it is essential to recognize the impact of Toncoin has rapidly gained recognition for its ability to offer high transaction speeds and scalability, making it an appealing choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps). By leveraging the TON blockchain (The Open Network), Toncoin has overcome many of the limitations faced by traditional blockchain networks, making it a powerful tool for the future of digital transactions. Toncoin’s focus on scalability and speed places it in direct competition with other blockchain projects, but its efficient approach to handling large volumes of transactions gives it a competitive edge. What Has Been Going On with Fantom? Similarly, Fantom continues to lead the way in DeFi innovation with its fast and scalable consensus mechanism. By utilizing the Achi consensus protocol, Fantom ensures that its network can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it one of the most efficient blockchains in operation today. This scalability, combined with low transaction fees, has made Fantom a favorite among developers in the DeFi space. As decentralized finance continues to grow, Fantom is positioning itself as a critical player in enabling a more efficient and inclusive financial system. The Future of Cryptocurrency The future of cryptocurrency is bright, and Qubetics is set to play a crucial role in shaping it. With its focus on user-centric solutions, decentralization, and privacy protection, it is quickly becoming a standout in the blockchain space. Investors looking for the best cryptos to join for January 2025 would be wise to take a closer look at Qubetics. Its innovative features, solid roadmap, and growing community position it as one of the most promising projects in the market. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, Qubetics is one to watch for the future.

Analyst Commented,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoins-rally-has-lost-momentum-what-will-happen-next-analyst-commented/,"Bitcoin closed 2024 on a high, reaching a record $107,000 in mid-December before retreating to hover around $96,000 in early 2025. Despite this decline, BTC's remarkable rise over the past year has left many investors wondering what's next. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw its most significant outflows since its launch on Thursday, with $333 million in outflows. Some attributed the outflows to tax-related adjustments or profit-taking, while others saw them as part of a broader pause in market momentum. “Crypto tends to move in momentum cycles, with periods of rapid growth followed by quieter phases,” Andy Baehr, Managing Director of Indices at CoinDesk, told Morning Brief. Noting Bitcoin’s performance in 2024, Baehr pointed to two key periods: an ETF-driven rally in the first quarter and another surge between September and December, driven by the Federal Reserve meetings and the US presidential election. Stating that it is important for crypto investors to think long-term, Baehr said, “We should be patient in the quiet times and excited in the big moments.” Related News: Bankrupt Cryptocurrency Whale Still Won't Give Up: It Increased its Position Even More As Bitcoin celebrates the 16th anniversary of the Genesis Block, Baehr noted that the asset class is still in its infancy compared to traditional financial instruments. Baehr highlighted four key areas driving its adoption momentum: Government Reserves – Governments that include Bitcoin in strategic reserves. Enterprise Use Cases – Increasing interest from large corporations. Institutional Investments – Gradual involvement of pension funds and insurance companies. Advisory and Personal Engagement – Wider education and adoption of financial advisory services. This adoption momentum is expected to support Bitcoin’s medium- to long-term price stability and gradually reduce its notorious volatility, Baehr said. Regulation remains a crucial factor for the crypto market. While Bitcoin itself operates under a relatively solid framework with futures, ETFs, and options, stablecoins are expected to gain significant traction this year. “If stablecoin legislation passes, these tokens will require blockchains to transact, further expanding the utility of platforms like Ethereum and other layer 1 solutions,” Baehr said. While Bitcoin’s momentum has slowed since December, the next rally could be just around the corner. “When the momentum returns, we are confident that this will be a broad rally in the crypto market,” Baehr said. *This is not investment advice.

The analyst revealed that the foremost meme coin was approaching the moving average (MA) line, which could lead to a new all-time high (ATH). Dogecoin Eyes ATH As Weekly RSI Approaches The MA Line In an X post, Master Kenobi revealed that Dogecoin’s weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the MA. He remarked that this is a crucial level that needs to be broken to confirm a continued upward movement. The crypto analyst added that if these barriers are cleared, then the current ATH of $0.74 becomes the next major point of interest for Dogecoin. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction To $4.9: How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Drive The Next Wave As part of his Dogecoin analysis, Master Kenobi also noted that DOGE has had a solid week, although it is unlikely to close in the ATH zone. As part of the obstacles that DOGE needs to overcome, the crypto analyst highlighted a resistance that the foremost meme coin faces at the upper green trendline on his accompanying chart. This comes after DOGE successfully tested the lower green trendline two weeks ago. From a fundamentals perspective, the crypto analyst noted that Donald Trump’s reinstatement in the White House could serve as both an indicator and a significant catalyst for Dogecoin reaching its current ATH. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also shared an analysis of what needs to happen for Dogecoin to reach and surpass its current ATH. First, he stated that the meme coin needs to break the macro golden pocket at $0.49, then the Fib .703 level at $0.53, and then a break above $0.59. The crypto analyst asserted that a clean break above $0.59 would pave the way for a new ATH for Dogecoin. DOGE Ready For Next Leg Up The Dogecoin price looks well-primed for the next leg of its bull run. In an X post, crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade revealed that a Dogecoin MACD bullish crossover has occurred on the daily chart. He added that the previous bullish crossover triggered a massive pump for DOGE when it soared from $0.11 to $0.43. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Can Break To $0.48, But This Needs To Happen First The crypto analyst added that Dogecoin could record a similar rally again. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach the much-anticipated psychological $1 level on this next leg up. In another X post, Trader Tardigrade mentioned that the meme coin has just entered distribution in the “Power of Three” (PO3) pattern. He added that this pattern makes $1 a reasonable target. Master Kenobi also recently predicted that Dogecoin could rally to as high as $1.2 if the meme coin breaks its ATH by the end of January. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.38, up over 15% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD trading above $97,000 as the U.S. session began. Following a rapid start to the new year and a retest of $96,000 as support, Bitcoin aimed to reclaim the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). At $96,740 at the time of writing, the 50-day SMA previously acted as support for over two months before being lost in late December. “Nice follow-through on the falling wedge breakout,” trading account SuperBro noted on X. “Careful not to get aggressive with longs into potential resistance, now we need to reclaim the 20 and 50 SMA and flip these back to support.” Other analysts anticipated that the trendline could regain its role as support, potentially fueling a continued bull run after last month’s cooldown. On shorter timeframes, however, trader Roman advised caution. “I think some of you are getting excited a bit too early,” he commented, analyzing four-hour charts. “We’ve got a low-volume pump with maxed stoch RSI. Generally means we come down a bit.” The stochastic relative strength index (RSI) exceeded the overbought 70 threshold, signaling potential short-term exhaustion. Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades highlighted the 200-period SMA on the four-hour chart as a critical resistance level, with the 200-period EMA providing support. “Trading right around the high volume node. Meaning, most volume traded between these prices,” Daan explained on X. “Price moves easier when it breaks away from such a high volume area. The 4H 200MA is guarding the top side. I want to see this break above $98K+ to get the party started and start the run back to all-time highs. $95K is an important level to hold in the short term.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 17:35:38

Notably, a top attorney following the case predicts it could be resolved by April or May this year. Donald Trump’s win and the appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair are seen as favorable for Ripple and XRP. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse expressed his desire to collaborate with the new SEC, which has raised hopes for progress and clarity, as well as the possible dismissal of the XRP lawsuit appeal. Notably, attorney Jeremy Hogan responded to an X post over the odds of the Ripple vs SEC case getting dismissed, settled or dropped by February. “I’d say it’s possible but maybe unlikely,” he noted. “40 days is not a lot of time to get reports together, memos, have the requisite SEC meetings, etc.. I’m going with April/May as a likely timeframe,” he added further. I'd say it's possible but maybe unlikely. 40 days is not a lot of time to get reports together, memos, have the requisite SEC meetings, etc.. I'm going with April/May as a likely timeframe. — Jeremy Hogan (@attorneyjeremy1) January 3, 2025 He thinks the decision may take time due to the need for reports, memos, and SEC meetings, but still expects a dismissal or settlement by April or May. A Shift In Approach Recently, in an interview with Thinking Crypto, Amanda Tuminelli from the DeFi Education Fund noted that while dropping lawsuits completely might not quickly happen, a shift in approach is likely. Tuminelli believes the SEC may seek favorable settlements, called “consent decrees,” where both parties negotiate a resolution and the court ensures the terms are followed, allowing cases to be resolved without being fully dropped. With the January 15 deadline approaching, US SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and Chief Litigation Counsel Jorge Tenreiro are likely preparing to file an opening brief in the XRP lawsuit. The SEC may make a last-minute filing before pro-crypto Paul Atkins takes over, which could potentially create challenges for Ripple. XRP Community Hopeful Gensler’s brief submission may be the SEC’s final attempt to strengthen its case as Ripple’s defense gains strength. With the outcome still uncertain, this move shows the SEC’s determination to maintain control over digital asset regulation. Nevertheless, the XRP community is hopeful for positive developments, including an XRP ETF launch and price rally. Notably, if the XRP lawsuit is dismissed, it could lead to XRP ETF approval and a price surge above $10 as investors gain legal clarity.",News|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 17:38:05

Pepe the Boss (PEPEBOSS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEBOSS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe the Boss can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe the Boss could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe the Boss launched with over $8,500 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe the Boss on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe the Boss by entering its contract address – 5pgsjH712NZ6eaKunsEfZarG9UotHaxvheW5E39a8NFX – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEBOSS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 17:43:00

Hyeon-Jin Kwon says she initially lost $56,000 after an impostor claiming to work at Bank of America gave her a call and managed to drain her account, reports the ABC-affiliated news station WMAR. “[The scammer] reassured me to check the number on my phone, check the number on the back of the card. I even Googled Bank of America’s phone number and everything lined up, so I thought for sure she’s from Bank of America, and then she was able to actually read off my entire credit card number… They gave me a link to click through, which I entered in my information, and through that, she was able to access my bank account and take control. And she managed to wire out almost my entire checking account.” Kwon says the scammers sent her money to a JPMorgan Chase account and managed to withdraw $13,000 in cash before the bank froze the account. That was back in September. Flash forward to today – Kwon says Chase has not released the remaining $43,000, and neither bank has reimbursed the stolen funds. “It was devastating. I think this is probably one of the hardest things I’ve experienced in my life. And not knowing if rent can get paid, you know, my creditors, my bill collectors, and how do I even stay afloat? “The people that are committing the fraud, they’re very sophisticated. I think they are miles ahead of what the banks are doing. So, it just seems like we’re just open game for being hit with fraud.” Bank of America has released a statement on the matter. “Identity theft cases can be complex and sophisticated. We prioritize client protection and work to recapture stolen funds in incidents like this.” JPMorgan Chase says it’s working with BofA to resolve the issue.

Designed as a tribute to internet culture, PEPE embraces a simple, utility-free approach, setting itself apart by eliminating transaction taxes. It aims to replicate the success of meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. In mid-2023, PEPE reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts and building a vibrant community. Its roadmap emphasizes increasing visibility through social media trends and securing listings on major exchanges, driving wider adoption. Additionally, a burning mechanism enhances scarcity, while long-term holders are incentivized with rewards, aiming for greater stability in the volatile crypto market. As an ERC-20 token, PEPE leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake security and is accessible on popular platforms such as Uniswap, Binance, and KuCoin. With its unique features and growing popularity, PEPE continues to stand out in the current market cycle as a notable contender in the meme coin space. Conclusion Coins like PEPE show less short-term potential. DOGEN, a meme token for those seeking luxury and success, is expected to grow 700% by the end of presale, with potential for significant returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive campaigns and perks for early adopters.

Read on to learn more! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Dogecoin’s DOGE Falls Below $0.32 as a New PropFi Coin Gains Momentum Dogecoin’s DOGE swiftly dropped below $0.31 on December 19, 2024, causing a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market’s momentum and surprising many traders. The drop occurred in direct reaction to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s most recent statements on the economic outlook. Powell’s comments on inflation estimates having “fallen apart” caused panic in the cryptocurrency markets. The Fed’s decision to keep interest rates higher than projected has had an especially strong impact on usually speculative assets. The price change is a 35% drop from DOGE’s 2024 top of $0.47, emphasizing the magnitude of the recent downturn. As a consequence, many Dogecoin investors are flocking to a new PropFi coin in the hopes of making enormous profits. Aptos’ APT Maintains a Bearish Momentum Aptos’ APT has now been down 32.47% in price over the last seven days. This sharp decline in the Aptos token price started with rising concerns around the token unlock , which was expected to lead to increased selling pressure on APT. Unlocking tokens entails distributing previously restricted crypto tokens to the general public, usually after a vesting timetable or promotional event. However, after the token unlocking event on December 11, 2024, APT rose for a few days but was unable to maintain the upward pace. This is because the token unlock event flooded the market, increasing supply without a commensurate increase in demand. The implication is an increased selling pressure on the APT token.

According to data from blockchain tracker SoSoValue, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) saw a staggering $332.6 million worth of outflows on January 2nd, its largest day of outflows on record. The data also shows that other spot market BTC ETFs were mostly in the green as Fidelity’s FBTC, Arkham’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB all posted inflows of $36.2 million, $16.5 million, and $48.3 million respectively. Another notable ETF that posted outflows was Grayscale’s GBTC, coming in at $23 million. IBIT and GBTC’s combined outflows made the first trading day of the year red for ETFs associated with the top crypto asset by market cap, bringing down daily total net inflows to -$242.3 million. IBIT launched in January of 2024 after Bitcoin-based ETFs were approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a judge ordered the regulatory agency to rethink its viewpoint on the matter to remain consistent with its other stances. In November, it was reported that IBIT had surpassed BlackRock’s gold ETF (IAU) in terms of net assets, reaching over $33 billion. As stated by Nate Geraci, co-founder of the ETF Institute, at the time, “iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has now surpassed iShares Gold ETF in assets… Did this in 10 months. IAU launched in January 2005. Absolutely wild.” IBIT is trading for $56.04 at time of writing.

This bullish price action above $1 begs the question: Is this ADA’s breakout moment to new all-time highs, or is it just another speculative frenzy waiting to fizzle out? Can ADA Maintain Its Bullish Edge? The crypto market is riding high in the new year. Cardano’s native cryptocurrency ADA stands out, surging 14.8% and surpassing the psychologically important $1 mark after weeks of sluggish consolidation. You see, this is more than just a price point — it could be a trigger for full-blown FOMO to kick in, attracting new money and spurring interest from investors seeking diversification. At the time of writing, ADA had settled at around $1.09 after hitting an intraday high of $1.11 earlier today, according to CoinGecko. This technical breakout has sparked bullish sentiment, with spectators suggesting that Cardano is now set to continue its upward trajectory if it successfully flips $1 into robust support. If this happens, ADA may set the stage for a parabolic first quarter in 2025. Meanwhile, the programmable Cardano blockchain is scheduled for multiple fundamental upgrades in the coming months, including the Plomin hard fork in Q1 2025. Developers are also currently working on further boosting Cardano’s scalability and interoperability with other blockchain networks. These developments offer a promising outlook for ADA. What ADA Charts Indicate Popular analyst Ali Martinez has suggested a potential rally to $4 based on previous cycles. According to his analysis, Martinez is following a similar price pattern to its historical cycles. For context, ADA jumped from $0.088 to $0.190 during the 2020 rally. The rally later fizzled, with the asset slumping to $0.12 lows. But after the pullback, ADA surged from a low of $0.173 on Nov. 16, 2020, to as high as $3.085 on Aug. 29, 2021. Therefore, if history is anything to go by, Cardano could be on the verge of a “big move” to $4 in the coming weeks.",Cryptocurrency|Featured|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|FORKS,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-04 17:56:26

Namely, Dogecoin (DOGE) is the best memecoin option. Furthermore, Solana (SOL) is the best utility play! However, there’s a third option that can outdo them both. The project in question is none other than DTX Exchange (DTX)! All of these make up the top 3 altcoins for 2025. However, DTX Exchange is leading the way, emerging as the most promising investment of the year! Dogecoin Is Preparing for a Rally Based on Historic Patterns The DOGE price is finally rising. Namely, it rose by 7.86% in a week. This is great news for DOGE, as many feared it would die down. However, DOGE didn’t do that. Namely, DOGE managed to start its rise without the help of Elon Musk. This is very promising for Dogecoin. The reason behind Dogecoin’s price rise is a new development. Namely, DOGE might be used for payments on different platforms soon. If this happens, Dogecoin can see a massive surge in price. Also, an analyst says that a potential “yellow candle” is possible for DOGE. This means that he expects a breakout for Dogecoin. Namely, the candle could bring a 100% rise in Dogecoin’s price. So, DOGE is definitely one of the top 3 altcoins right now! And so is SOL! Solana’s Price Is Moving Up as Interest Rises Solana’s price is finally back above $200. More specifically, it’s at $208 right now. This rise brought a new wave of confidence for SOL holders. It also proves that Solana is still a dominant player in the market. Also, memecoin trading on Solana has picked up again. Experts say that this will drive further growth for SOL’s price. So, they see SOL’s price rising to $300 in 2025! This would be a 44% rise for SOL. Thus, SOL is one of the top 3 altcoins you can invest in right now! However, even with SOL’s imminent price rise, DTX Exchange remains a more promising investment. That’s why DTX takes the #1 spot on the “top 3 altcoins” list for 2025! DTX Exchange: The Future of Decentralized Trading Is Here! There are many reasons why DTX Exchange takes the #1 spot on the top altcoins list. One of them is the amazing speed that DTX Exchange brings. Let’s compare it to Solana so that you see just how fast it is! Namely, Solana currently offers a speed of 600 TPS. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange comes with an amazing 100,000 TPS! This is 166 times faster than Solana! This incredible speed has never been achieved before. So, how did DTX Exchange do it? Well, DTX Exchange uses the VulcanX blockchain to reach this speed, which has already been tested by experts. Furthermore, DTX Exchange makes trading much easier. That’s because it allows you to trade thousands of different assets from one place. Also, it allows you to manage all your investments via the Phoenix Wallet. This will save you a lot of time and allow you to focus more on improving! Another standout DTX Exchange feature is its fair launch system. This system gives everyone an equal chance to invest in DTX! That’s because it makes sure that DTX Exchange isn’t backed by large investors who can manipulate its price. Instead, it’s backed by smaller ones who can’t influence DTX’s future in any way! Also, DTX Exchange investors get governance rights and access to profit-sharing. This allows them to participate in DTX Exchange’s future development and make money on the side! DTX: Invest in the Most Promising Coin in the Top 3 Altcoins List for 2025 Today! So, we know now that DTX is the most promising coin in the “top 3 altcoins” list for 2025. And right now, you have a chance to invest in it before it launches! Namely, DTX is in Stage 7 of its public presale, selling for $0.14. The DTX presale has already seen incredible success, raising over $11.2 million in a matter of weeks. So, interest in DTX is extremely high! As the presale continues, DTX will rise in price and launch at $0.20. That’s also when its rally will start, according to experts. Namely, they see DTX’s price rising by 100x shortly after its launch, and even more throughout the year. So, don’t miss the chance to catch all the gains that DTX will bring in the months to come!

Over the past week, the token surged by 10%, driven by growing investor confidence amidst a broader crypto recovery. With Bitcoin now trading above $97,000, analysts believe two key charts suggest that the SHIB price could double in the coming weeks. 2 Key Charts Hint at a Massive Surge for Shiba Inu Price Shiba Inu price is showing signs of a bullish breakout as its price action forms a textbook cup-and-handle pattern. This classic bullish setup indicates the possibility of a significant upward move in the near term. The daily SHIB chart reveals a gradual decline followed by a steady recovery, completing the “cup” formation. The neckline resistance stands firmly at $0.00003287, a critical breakout level for bullish confirmation. The “handle” phase is currently unfolding as the price consolidates below the neckline. The SHIB price sits at $0.00002435, reflecting a 62.53% recovery from its October low of $0.00002054. If the price breaks above the $0.00003287 neckline, the projected target for the pattern points to $0.00005339, offering a potential upside of 62%. On the downside, the red demand zone between $0.00002000 and $0.00001800 provides robust support. If the price dips into this zone, a strong bounce could reinforce the bullish outlook. For SHIB to maintain bullish momentum, it must close above the neckline with strong volume. A failed breakout or rejection at this level could lead to further consolidation. Conversely, sustained buying pressure could propel SHIB toward its ultimate target of $0.00005339 by mid-2025. Source: TradingView Analyst Highlights Bullish SHIB Outlook, Targets Key Levels A crypto analyst has highlighted a promising technical setup for the top meme coin on the weekly chart. According to the analyst, the chart displays a “super clean” structure, indicating potential bullish momentum for the token. The chart analysis shows SHIB currently holding above a key support level at $0.021. This level has acted as a solid foundation after recent price retracements. The analyst is eyeing $0.054 as a significant resistance level in the coming weeks. Further upside potential includes a major resistance zone near $0.066, which aligns with historical price activity from 2021. A successful breakout above $0.066 could potentially open the door for continued gains in the Shiba Inu price Forecast . The weekly candlesticks indicate a recovery phase, supported by trending upwards moving averages. However, caution remains as the market consolidates just above its critical support. SHIB enthusiasts and investors, particularly those referencing meme coin ecosystems like PEPE, are hopeful for upward momentum. Whether SHIB can achieve these targets will depend on broader market sentiment and buying pressure in the coming months.

A breakout above critical levels could trigger substantial gains, rewarding patient investors in the coming months.

Analysts recommend keeping your eyes on $FXG, SUI, and HBAR if you’re hunting for altcoins to buy. With unique offerings like the Trader Funding Program, which provides up to $500,000 in trading capital, and same-day fiat and crypto transactions in over 100 local currencies, FXGuys is becoming a favourite among smart prop traders. In addition to funding and fast transactions, FXGuys rewards each trade through its Trade2Earn program, giving traders $FXG tokens for every move. This feature adds to the project’s appeal by cutting trading costs and incentivizing active trading. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE FXGuys: Why Smart Dogecoin Traders are Getting Interested in This Groundbreaking Project FXGuys is making waves as a top pick for traders looking for the best crypto to buy. The FX Guys platform focuses on helping skilled traders who need more capital to start. It focuses on a unique concept called Proprietary Finance (PropFi) that connects investors and traders in a way that benefits both.

As its DeFi coin price gains traction, it’s clear why many consider $FXG one of the altcoins to buy right now. SUI’s Price Drops: Can Trending Altcoins Rebound Like DOGE In 2021? Like Dogecoin, SUI stands out as one of the best altcoins to buy. It uses smart technology to handle transactions faster and more efficiently than others. With features that focus on developer safety, Sui is built to attract long-term attention in the crypto world. Sui recently teamed up with Google Cloud to access real-time blockchain data. It also partnered with Franklin Templeton, helping to grow its ecosystem. These moves make Sui a strong player in the market. SUI performed well in early December, but like other trending altcoins, it is struggling. SUI is trading at $4.077, a 6.43% decline from its price of last week. Some Dogecoin experts still expect SUI’s struggles to continue as its Relative Strength Index shows a bearish divergence. According to these DOGE experts, SUI could fall further to $3.500 soon. Conversely, with Sui gaining new partnerships and its utility increasing, DOGE investors are still optimistic about the project. These Dogecoin experts say SUI could rise to $5 in a few weeks. Amid these mixed forecasts, top investors say $FXG’s high-flying presale suggests it is the better bet for their investment targets. Hedera’s Unique Hashgraph Technology Makes HBAR One of the Altcoins to Buy Dogecoin investors are drawn to HBAR because it shows low volatility and has the support of top tech giants. With HBAR’s price growing steadily, Hedera is becoming a popular choice as one of the altcoins that can replicate DOGE’s 2021 surge. According to CoinMarketCap data, HBAR is valued at $0.276, an 8.66% increase from its price of last week. Meanwhile, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) moving out of the overbought area, some DOGE experts predict a bigger uptrend for HBAR soon. These DOGE experts predict that the token could surge to $0.350 soon. On the other hand, if HBAR is rejected at the $0.300 resistance level, it could fall as low as $0.200 in a few days. As such, these investors are picking FX Guys over SUI and HBAR due to its profit-sharing model that allows traders to keep 80% of their profits. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Dogecoin Experts Believe $FXG Could Be Your Ticket to Riches $FXG is making headlines as one of the best altcoins to buy right now. The token is part of the FXGuys ecosystem and is currently priced at just $0.04 in Stage 2 of its public presale. Early investors stand to gain big as prices rise in Stage 3, which is a quick 25% profit. If you grab $FXG at its current price, the potential gains are even higher. By the end of the public presale, investors could see returns of up to 150%. It’s a chance to get in early on what some are calling a game-changing opportunity. Many crypto enthusiasts believe $FXG has the potential to rival DOGE’s rally post-launch in 2025. With its strong presale performance and staking benefits, the buzz around this token is growing fast.

This funding method, which involves issuing shares without a set maturity date, aims to strengthen the company’s Bitcoin reserves while maintaining financial flexibility. This unique financing strategy provides investors with regular dividends and avoids the pressure of repayment deadlines. The company clarified that this initiative is independent of its earlier plans to raise capital through equity and fixed-income instruments. The perpetual preferred stock could be funded by converting Class A common stock, issuing cash dividends, or redeeming shares. Dylan LeClair, Metaplanet's Bitcoin strategy director, highlighted the innovative nature of this move, explaining that it allows investors to benefit from Bitcoin's volatility while offering MicroStrategy a cost-effective way to secure funds . LeClair estimated that even with an annual dividend rate of 6%, the company would only need to pay around $120 million annually—an amount manageable given its substantial equity capital raised in 2024. MicroStrategy expects to launch the offering in early 2025, provided market conditions remain favorable. However, the company has not yet fully committed to this plan, leaving room for adjustments if necessary. This approach aligns with MicroStrategy's long-standing strategy of using innovative financial tools to grow its Bitcoin holdings. Over time, the company's continuous Bitcoin acquisitions have significantly strengthened its market standing. MicroStrategy’s share value has surged, earning it a place on the Nasdaq 100 index and positioning it as a pioneer in Bitcoin-focused financial strategy . The firm has consistently used debt and equity offerings to finance its Bitcoin purchases, demonstrating a strong commitment to its vision. However, such an approach comes with risks. Issuing new shares for funding can dilute existing shareholders' ownership, potentially lowering earnings per share. Analysts, including those from The Kobeissi Letter, have warned that failing to secure adequate funding could disrupt MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin acquisition plans. Despite these concerns, the company remains optimistic about the potential benefits of its perpetual preferred stock offering. With careful execution and favorable market conditions, MicroStrategy aims to further solidify its reputation as a leader in corporate Bitcoin investment while navigating the challenges of shareholder dilution and market volatility.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-04 18:01:49

The asset has attained this feat for the second time in 30 days after it topped USDT temporarily in December 2024. XRP’s gains trickle in as spot ETF momentum soars in the United States, coupled with anticipated positive crypto laws. For Tether, the company remains at the center of regulatory headwinds in Europe following the launch of the landmark Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) Regulation. Like XRP, other altcoins have also made massive gains today as Bitcoin dominance falls. XRP’s Market Cap Taps $140 Billion On Jan 3, XRP’s price tapped $2.4, soaring 2.7% alongside a wider market rally. The recent price jump takes its market capitalization above $140 billion, outpacing USDT stablecoin. XRP trading volume is over $5 billion, raising community traction and following a sentiment swing. XRP has gained momentum on the back of a second Trump Presidency. After the November polls, XRP recorded huge inflows, leading to a similar position before a pullback. Major points include anticipated positive regulations in the U.S. market and possible spot XRP ETF approval . A shift in regulatory stance remains a bullish catalyst for the crypto markets. In the last four years, XRP has faced the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) hammer after it filed a lawsuit against the firm for allegedly offering unregistered securities. This tanked the asset’s price below $1, trading around the margin for several years. In 2024, XRP jumped over 280%, with gains from institutional investment and Ripple’s global partnerships. Spot ETFs To Determine The Asset’s Next Chapter The chances of a spot XRP ETF in the United States are more likely in a Trump administration. Last year, several firms filed applications with the market anticipating price jumps to new all-time highs like Bitcoin’s performance. After the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, the asset dominated financial markets due to huge institutional investments. XRP bulls have accumulated tokens ahead of potential upward price movements that are raising buying pressure. Crypto enthusiasts, xrpmessenger wrote on the improved chances of a spot ETF. “ Moreover, there’s a growing chance of a spot ETF launch for XRP next year. Four different investment firms have already filed spot XRP ETF applications with the SEC. In the past, with all the regulatory uncertainty swirling around Ripple, there would have been absolutely no way the SEC would have approved these ETF applications. But in a Trump administration, the SEC might be much more willing to consider these applications.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|Tether|USDT|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-04 18:15:04

In a report filed on January 1, Collins revealed he had purchased between $1,001 and $15,000 in Ski Mask Dog (SKI), a token that saw huge value appreciation just days after his transactions in December. The timing of Collins’ purchases coincided with a broader rally in the cryptocurrency market, raising questions about the motivations behind his investments. SKI, which traded under $0.01 for months, surged to an all-time high of over $0.35 in December, settling at approximately $0.25 by early January. Altcoin Portfolio Details Alongside SKI, Collins also disclosed positions in other digital currencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Velodrome (VELO), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and The Graph (GRT). The buys mark an emerging pattern from public figures actively using the space of digital assets; meanwhile, Collins is one of a small minority that reports his positionings publicly. Required STOCK Act disclosures detail that Collins has been active in the space, having made three separate SKI transactions in December. Each valued up to $15,000, the purchases came shortly after Collins won reelection in Georgia’s 10th congressional district with 63% of the vote. STOCK Act Compliance and Lawmaker Scrutiny Crypto disclosures by Collins now make him the first member of Congress to report such transactions in 2025. The STOCK Act requires lawmakers to report substantial financial activity, including trades of digital assets, within a 45-day window. Critics of the current disclosure system say it slips on a number of potential conflicts of interest for lawmakers who have an influence over laws and regulations on finance. A good number of members of Congress have called for stricter rules, including a prohibition against stock and crypto trading for sitting legislators. Crypto in Congress: Growing Trends While Collins has not made digital assets a centerpiece of his political platform, support for legislation such as the Financial Innovation and Technology (FIT21) Act suggests a desire to foster innovation in the crypto industry. As Congress considers possible changes to the STOCK Act, Collins’ investments-and those of other lawmakers-may be increasingly scrutinized, further fueling debates about the role of cryptocurrency in public office.",Blockchain|Altcoins|Regulation,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-04 18:16:48

As expected, several meme coins have soared above the wider market, clinching triple-digit gains at the start of the year. Digital asset analysts tip the overall trend to continue following macro factors, although corrections will be recorded in multiple assets. At press time, the total crypto market cap stands at $3.5 trillion, a 2.5% growth in the last 24 hours. The total meme coin figure is up 14% in the same period as it soared to over $127 billion. While bulls continue to push trading activities, bear traders warn of sharp volatility in January. Top Meme Coins Gainers According to data from CoinGecko, these assets are leading meme coin charts on the heels of massive community participation. Nexus Erebus (NXR) leads the pack with a 503% gain today to trade at 0.001682. The asset’s growth pattern can be seen across multiple timeframes, showing resilience despite periods of price corrections. Last week, NXR picked up a strong performance, posting 1292.5% and making a recovery from 307% gains in the last 30 days. The asset’s market cap is above $1.6 million, with low figures driving new users. Traditionally, crypto traders prefer early positions in meme coins to get an edge. MLG follows with a 269% inflow surge in inflows today. The meme coin exchanges hands at $0.009225, taking its market capitalization above $8.8 million. MLG recorded 196% gains this week alongside a similar monthly number. Reasons for the asset’s growth ranged from community participation to high volumes. Trumpius Maximus (TRUMPIUS) has picked up a 215% increase today to trade at $0.2685. Like other fast-rising meme coins, the asset posted huge wins in the short-term window. Is a Meme Coin Frenzy On The Cards? Several crypto users have projected a meme coin frenzy this year, citing a string of market-moving factors. Meme coins are known to jump in line with wider market trends, leading to a close monitoring of altcoin fundamentals. Last year, the market notched two meme coin rallies after Bitcoin soared to new all-time highs. The first came following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, while the second was recorded after the U.S. Presidential elections. Days after Donald Trump’s inauguration, crypto traders have repositioned holdings. Recently, meme coin bulls have also made large asset purchases, swinging sentiments upwards.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-04 18:25:08

On Friday, Jan. 3, it was running full steam ahead, briefly tapping $98,690. That’s a strong rally, with 24H trade volume declining to $35 billion on its $1.94 trillion market cap from $56 billion on Dec. 30. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.38%. Bitcoin is based on a novel design for computers on a decentralized peer-to-peer network called the blockchain. Bitcoin “miners” create a new block every ten minutes containing newly settled transactions and an updated record of all accounts (called addresses) on the chain. The electronic cash platform generated its first block on Jan. 3, 2009. Now that Bitcoin is old enough to drive a car if it was a human living in the United States, here’s a look back at how Google, Amazon, and Facebook were doing on their sweet sixteen. BTC and Nasdaq Leaders Compared Bitcoin traded on the BitcoinTalkForum via handshake agreements and PayPal for settlement for an average of $0.00099. A bagful of Bitcoin worth a dollar then is worth some $9.8 billion for the same amount of BTC at current prices today. That’s a 989,898,990,000,000% (989 trillion percent) increase in the value of BTC in 16 years. It’s a rate of growth so staggering traditional financial markets have only recently begun to comprehend that it’s even real. Here’s how three Nasdaq tech giants compare: Google shares debuted in a 2004 initial public offering (IPO) at $85 per share. On Jan. 3, some 11 years later, they’re trading at $193. But after a stock split in 2022, the company issued 20 shares for every investor owned at the time. So adjusted to $3,860, the ROI for Google stock in about 11 years from its IPO date is 4,541%. Amazon stock debuted at $18 a share in 1997. On Jan. 3, it traded for $224, some 28 years later. But after four stock splits, IPO buyers with any remaining shares have 240 for each one they bought in 1997. So adjusted to $53,760, the ROI for Amazon stock from its IPO is 298,666%. Bitcoin can give it 11 extra years of growth and still absolutely diminish these gains by comparison. That’s truly remarkable because Amazon IPO shares are some of the best-performing stock market investments in history. Facebook’s stock launched at $38 a share in 2012. On Jan. 3, it traded for $604. The company, now called Meta, has never split its stock. So, the ROI for Facebook after 12 years is 1,589%. 16th Birthday Milestones for Bitcoin At 16 years old, Google acquired London-based AI firm DeepMind Technologies in 2014. Today, AI is one of the most important narratives in the crypto space adjacent to Bitcoin. At the end of December, cryptocurrency tokens for AI agents posted 67% days for the 30-day window. Some posted over 200% ROIs. Amazon closed a $545 million acquisition of Diapers.com and Soap.com in 2010 in its sixteenth year. Bitcoin is not a corporation and can’t make acquisitions, but today, several corporations are beginning to acquire BTC. That includes Japan’s Metaplanet and Virginia’s MicroStrategy at the moment. Facebook rebranded to Meta to focus on virtual reality in 2020 when it turned sixteen. Today, several cryptocurrencies are developing in the VR sector, such as Shiba Inu’s Shibarium, Virtuals Protocol, Axie Infinity, and Decentraland.

In a milestone achievement, XRP’s market capitalization hit $138.97 billion, surpassing financial giant Charles Schwab’s $135.16 billion, according to Market data on January 4. This development underscores XRP’s growing relevance in a market increasingly driven by institutional and retail interest. XRP surged 3.14% to $2.47, showing a robust 23% rebound from a recent two-day low of $1.99. Its current market cap positions it as one of the standout performers in a rally where Bitcoin and Ethereum showed relatively modest gains. Linda Jones, a renowned financial analyst and wealth mentor, captured the market sentiment in her recent analysis, proclaiming , “The XRP train has left the station.” Jones argued that XRP’s current trajectory suggests that the window for purchasing at lower prices may have closed. She added, “XRP’s performance is signaling an unstoppable momentum, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it surpass its all-time high in this bull run.” While Jones refrained from offering specific short-term price targets, her optimism aligns with the bullish sentiment among XRP supporters . XRP’s Path to Higher Levels The crypto community is rife with predictions for XRP’s near-term potential. Alex Clay, a market analyst, foresees XRP climbing to $10, citing a significant breakout above its monthly supply zone. Clay’s technical analysis points to this breakout as a critical turning point, signaling sustained bullish momentum. Source: Alex Clay X Adding to the bullish outlook, Dark Defender highlighted key targets for XRP at $4.11 and $5.85 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. Referring to the current rally as merely a “warm-up,” Dark Defender expects XRP to make more significant moves this month. Meanwhile, Egrag Crypto, a seasoned analyst, has projected XRP to reach $5.89 in a worst-case scenario and $6.50 in an ideal situation. Though made last year, his predictions remain relevant amid XRP’s surging performance. The rally of XRP, in particular, happens when the crypto market is gradually shifting to positive sentiments in the United States. Experts attribute this momentum to factors such as higher institutional demand, better market environment, and assumption to the office by what Ripple CEO refers to as “ the most pro-crypto Congress in history. ” XRP has taken the position of a market leader in the current rally, much to the rate of peers such as Ethereum and Binance Coin, among others. Nevertheless, there is a major concern for XRP due to the organization’s legal war against the SEC. January 15 is fast approaching as the industry still holds its breath about whether the case will go to trial. The result may seriously blow Ripple’s prospects and ability to pump institutional investments into XRP. Flipping Charles Schwab Market Cap Exceeding Charles Schwab’s market cap is more than bragging rights for XRP—it is a psychological battle. It underscores the trend that digital assets are now recognized as valid forms of investment. While Schwab is conventional old finance, XRP is a new-generation cryptocurrency, and the latter’s trajectory causes one to think twice about the future of finance. The fact is that recently, XRP marked some impressive achievements, and a deluge of analysts’ predictions became bullish. The current market value of XRP, followed by the expectations from renowned analysts, indicates that the rally for XRP is only set to continue further.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-04 18:33:05

BTC registered an impressive rally in 2024, largely due to the BlackRock-spurred Wall Street Bitcoin revolution and Donald Trump’s shock victory on Nov. 6. Now, a popular investor is predicting that China will create Bitcoin’s next glorious rally as it unleashes its much-awaited bazooka fiscal stimulus. For context, the Financial Times revealed that the People’s Bank of China is set to slash its interest rates in order to prop up its stalling economy. This, according to Bill Miller IV, a portfolio manager at Miller Value Partners, might be the bullish catalyst that catapults Bitcoin to new highs. “Looks like China is going to drive the next leg higher in #Bitcoin,” Miller wrote in a Jan. 3 post on X. Hopes Grow For US Strategic Reserve Miller also cited the United States launching a strategic Bitcoin reserve as another potential trigger for a meteoric bull run in 2025. Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have been thrust into the limelight as investors bet that the incoming Trump administration will usher in a more friendly regulatory environment. “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else — not just China but others are embracing it — and we want to be the head,” President-elect Donald Trump said during a mid-December interview. As ZyCrypto previously covered, Trump vowed to establish a national Bitcoin reserve on the campaign trail. If such a plan materializes, it would mean the U.S. government would hold a stockpile of the premier crypto as it already does with other assets, like oil and gold. It’s worth mentioning that governments around the world held roughly 2.2% of Bitcoin’s total supply as of July, as per CoinGecko data, with the U.S. holding approximately 213,297 BTC. China, the UK, Bhutan , and El Salvador are other nations with considerable Bitcoin stashes, data tracked by BitcoinTreasuries shows. Moreover, politicians in Japan and Germany have signaled their interest in giving BTC reserve status in their nations.",Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|China,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-04 18:36:31

Still, despite her promise, Solana finds achieving the $2,000 price mark challenging. As of writing, SOL is priced at $188.99. It is still 33.77% below its all-time high (ATH) of $260, even though it has seen a 6.27% increase during the past 60 days. Solana's $2,000 target fell short primarily due to the decreased token-generating capacity of the network. As developers explore alternative platforms, SOL’s usage stagnates. The network has struggled to maintain the momentum it once had, keeping its price growth limited. While Solana’s potential remains strong, investors are shifting their attention to competitors that promise better returns at lower price points. Among these are Rexas Finance (RXS) and Dogecoin (DOGE), two SOL competitors under $1 poised to create substantial wealth by 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenization One innovative platform that crosses actual assets and blockchain technology is Rexas Finance. Priced at just $0.175 in its 11th presale round as of writing, RXS has already shown an impressive 485% ROI since its September 2024 launch at $0.030. Having sold around 385,215,429 RXS tokens and raised $34,038,099, Rexas Finance has become a strong rival in the crypto market. Rexas Finance lets consumers tokenize actual assets, including real estate, gold, art, and antiques. This allows investors to acquire entire or partial shares of assets worldwide, altering the $65 billion art market, $121.2 trillion commodities market, and $379.7 trillion real estate market. The Rexas Token Builder allows individuals to tokenize assets without any coding expertise. Combined with the Rexas Launchpad, users can quickly raise funds for their tokens. With a trillion-dollar accessible market, Rexas Finance has almost endless room for expansion. The platform is flexible for various use applications since it supports several token standards, such as ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155. Following a Certik audit, Rexas Finance guarantees investors the platform's openness and security. The initiative especially incorporates individual investors instead of venture capital money, strengthening a committed community. With real-time updates and thorough information for investors, the listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko improve Rexas Finance's visibility. Analysts estimate that by 2025, RXS will climb 24,400% to $42.70. Investing $5,000 now might yield a fantastic $1,220,000. In addition, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million USDT giveaway. Twenty lucky winners will each receive $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. Participants can boost their chances of winning by completing tasks on the Rexas Finance website and sharing the initiative. Dogecoin (RXS): The Original Meme Coin Turning Serious Another rival under $1, Dogecoin (DOGE), demonstrates that it is more than a meme. While priced at $0.3172 as of writing, DOGE has increased 118.18% over the past 60 days, showing its resilience and future expansion possibilities. Dogecoin is rather popular, supported by a strong community and celebrity sponsorships. On many different platforms, it is the most often used payment option. Analysts project DOGE to rise to $2.10 by 2025, offering early investors notable gains. The Dogecoin network keeps changing and is under constant development meant to improve its transaction speed and scalability. Why Solana Struggles While Competitors Shine Solana’s inability to reach $2,000 stems from reduced network usage for token creation and increased competition. While SOL has been a leader in the blockchain space, it now faces challenges as innovative projects like Rexas Finance and Dogecoin capture market attention. The accessibility and affordability of RXS and DOGE make them attractive to retail investors seeking exponential returns. Solana’s current challenges limit its growth, whereas Rexas Finance presents a compelling case for investors.

Investing early in Rexas Finance could yield life-changing returns as the platform innovates and gains traction.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 18:46:00

The rise comes given the significant improvements in on-chain user experience and infrastructure over the past few years. The increase in DEX futures trading can also be attributed to the growing adoption of platforms like Hyperliquid, Jupiter, ApeX, Satori Finance and Drift, which have consistently grown in recent months. Hyperliquid Leads The Pack Remarkably, these platforms grew at an average rate of 26.5% per month throughout 2024. By December, the total trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) reached $285 billion, driven by strong growth from a few leading platforms. Hyperliquid led the pack by contributing a huge 78.8% of the total DEX futures volume. In December, Hyperliquid alone recorded over $225 million in monthly volume, while other platforms like Jupiter, ApeX, Satori Finance, and Drift accounted for smaller portions. Following Hyperliquid, Jupiter captured 9.8% of the market, recording over $28 million in December. CEXs Dominate In Volume While DEX futures trading is growing, centralized exchanges (CEXs) still dominate in overall volume. In December, Bitcoin futures on CEXs totaled over $2.14 trillion, and Ethereum futures reached $1.28 trillion. However, Bitcoin futures volumes on CEXs dropped 17% compared to November, and Ethereum volumes remained steady. This shows that while DEXs are gaining market share, CEXs still have much higher trading volumes. In December, centralized exchanges (CEXs) led with Bitcoin futures at $2.14 trillion and Ethereum futures at $1.28 trillion.

In the past 24 hours, while the majority of assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP, have struggled to gain momentum, SUI has topped the market with a 20% upside move. SUI Tops the Crypto Market With this notable price surge, SUI is trading near $5.27 and has witnessed significant participation from traders and investors, resulting in record jumps in trading volume. Data from CoinMarketCap revealed that the altcoin’s trading volume has surged by 150%. This notable participation from traders and investors is also one of the major reasons behind the rally. Long-Term Holders Move Assets With this notable upside momentum, long-term holders, investors, and retailers have been found dumping SUI tokens, indicating potential profit booking, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of $15.60 million worth of SUI tokens. In the cryptocurrency industry, the inflow of assets from long-term holders’ wallets to exchanges indicates a potential sell-off, which could create selling pressure and lead to a price decline. Despite all this offloading, the SUI price remains strong above $5. What’s Driving the SUI Rally? However, another potential reason for the SUI upside rally is the controlled release or unlock of 82 million SUI tokens, which is equivalent to 0.82%, along with the collaboration with ANT Digital Technologies for global adoption, recent recognition from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson , and the breakout of a crucial resistance level. SUI Technical Analysis and Key Levels According to expert technical analysis, SUI has recently broken out from a crucial resistance level of $4.90, which it has tried to breach multiple times historically. In addition to the breakout, the altcoin has successfully closed a daily candle above the $5 mark, with strong interest from traders and long-term holders. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, a correction is possible, as the price seems to be overextended. However, SUI could soar by 10% to reach the $5.75 mark in the future. Will the SUI Rally Continue? The current market sentiment, with price recovery, rising investor interest, recent collaborations, recognition from the founder of a major blockchain, and the recent breakout, suggests that this rally could sustain, and the price may continue to soar in the future.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 18:55:54

Top Trader Believes This ETH Rival Under $1 is the Best Option for a Huge ROI,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/01/is-ethereum-still-worth-buying-top-trader-believes-this-eth-rival-under-1-is-the-best-option-for-a-huge-roi,"Ethereum has dropped 7.87% over the past month but has also risen brilliantly, rising 27.41% over the prior two months. These conflicting signals have left buyers wondering whether Ethereum is still worth purchasing. One ETH rival, Rexas Finance (RXS), has nevertheless drawn the interest of a top trader. Under $1, RXS is becoming increasingly popular as the best option for investors looking for massive ROI. Is Ethereum Still Worth Buying? Although Ethereum's medium-to-long-term path points to a growing trend channel, recent price action suggests possible difficulties. Concerns have been raised over the double-top development, which resulted in a collapse through the $3,670 support level. Although the target price of $3,366 has been reached, this structure suggests potential further down movement. Ethereum is now under vital support at $3,300. A breach would imply bearish momentum; a bounce from this level would indicate recovery. Furthermore, trade volume patterns—low at price peaks and high at price bottoms—suggest decreasing upward momentum, which might hint at a possible trend break. Rexas Finance (RXS): The ETH Rival For Huge ROI Under $1 Rexas Finance represents a major blockchain innovation rather than only a rival project. Positioned as a real-world asset (RWA) token, RXS is transforming asset tokenization by letting people tokenize real estate, art, intellectual property, and more. This capacity makes it a flexible platform ready for general use. With a market area unexplored by Ethereum, RXS is defining its niche and drawing institutional and retail investors. Rexas Finance's presale has been remarkable. In its 11th stage, each token cost $0.175 and has raised over $34.23 million. With less than 39 million RXS tokens left, this stage targets raising an extra $7.875 million, bringing the total to $41 million. These outstanding figures show investors' growing faith in the project's concept and implementation. Unlike many blockchain initiatives that depend on venture capital, Rexas Finance has selected a public-oriented funding approach. This approach enables regular investors to join the RWA revolution, promoting community ownership and confidence. Its choice to prioritize inclusivity over institutional financing shows the project's dedication to decentralization and broad adoption. The fact that Rexas Finance's examination by top blockchain security platform Certik went well adds even more trust. By reassuring investors of the security and dependability of the project, this audit helps to reduce possible vulnerabilities and worries. Furthermore, increasing the token's exposure and driving its price momentum are its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. As RXS continues to attract the market's interest, its price development path suggests that it could provide returns much above those of Ethereum and other well-known cryptocurrencies. The token is a unique choice for investors hoping for long-term gains because it can mix accessibility with usefulness. Why Rexas Finance (RXS) is the Best Option A top trader claims that Rexas Finance is the best Ethereum rival for investors looking for significant returns. At under $1, RXS presents a low starting point, making it reachable to a broad spectrum of buyers. Positioning itself as a pioneer in the RWA industry, its creative method of asset tokenization meets an increasing demand in the blockchain environment. The project's strategic development milestones highlight the possibility of expansion. As the presale advances and investor interest increases, RXS is predicted to experience price jumps that may surpass those of other cryptocurrencies. Given that the larger market is getting ready for the next bull run, RXS is one token that shows great potential for large profits. Though rising initiatives like Rexas Finance undermine Ethereum's attractiveness, it is still a powerful rival in the cryptocurrency space. Ethereum's established market posture might restrict its upward potential for those looking for exponential increases. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, has the benefit of being in its early years when a notable price increase is more possible. Forward-looking investors find RXS appealing since it might outperform Ethereum in percentage returns as it picks momentum. Conclusion Although Ethereum is still a good investment for people who appreciate stability and long-term expansion, the cryptocurrency market is changing quickly. Rivals like Rexas Finance are grabbing interest with creative ideas and outstanding presale performance. Supported by its innovative approach to asset tokenization and significant market momentum, RXS presents a unique chance for investors looking for substantial returns at a price less than $1.

Experts Say This Crypto Has More Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-a-5-dogecoin-price-likely-in-2025-experts-say-this-crypto-has-more-potential/,"Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, has consistently defied expectations with its resilience and growing adoption in the crypto space. While speculation around its future continues to grow, another exciting development in the crypto world is the Lightchain AI Presale , which has been gaining attention as a promising new opportunity. As experts analyze whether Dogecoin can hit the $5 price target by 2025, the broader crypto market is buzzing with innovation and potential. Backed by strong community support, increasing use cases, and high-profile endorsements, Dogecoin has shown it’s far more than just a joke currency. With ongoing advancements in scalability and integration into mainstream payments, many believe DOGE holds significant untapped potential. These factors are driving optimism that the $5 milestone could be achievable in the coming years. Lightchain AI offers a unique perspective on this topic and provides valuable insights for potential investors. Expert Predictions and Factors Influencing Dogecoin’s Potential Growth Specialists have different guesses about Dogecoin’s possible rise by 2025. Some watchers say that DOGE might get close to the $1 mark, with guesses from $0.71 to $1.01, pushed by more use and tech gains. But, getting to $5 by 2025 seems hard, given DOGE’s present cost of around $0.31. Things that affect Dogecoin’s rise are its big fan base, famous people backing it, and possible use in common money systems. Still, problems like its rising supply model and rival coins could hold back big price growth. So, while some growth might happen, hitting a͏ $5 value by 2025 looks strange without big changes in the market. Challenges and Opportunities for Dogecoin to Reach $5 by 2025 Reaching a $5 valuation for Dogecoin by 2025 comes with notable challenges. For one, achieving this price would require its market capitalization to surpass $700 billion, a significant leap from its current value. Additionally, Dogecoin’s unlimited supply model makes it harder for the price to appreciate over the long term compared to cryptocurrencies with capped supplies. Another hurdle lies in the lack of significant technological advancements, which could limit its competitiveness in the rapidly evolving crypto space. However, there are opportunities that could support Dogecoin’s growth. Its strong and active community plays a key role in maintaining interest and driving adoption, while increased mainstream acceptance as a payment method and integration into platforms could boost its utility and value. Furthermore, endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk can significantly enhance visibility and attract more investors. Despite these positives, reaching a $5 price by 2025 remains a bold target, heavily reliant on major market shifts and broader adoption within the cryptocurrency space. Why Expert Sees More Potential in Lightchain AI Presale Experts are increasingly optimistic about Lightchain AI’s presale, highlighting its innovative integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. The platform introduces the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for executing AI computations, enhancing network security and efficiency. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) provides a dedicated environment for deploying AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps), enabling seamless integration of AI capabilities into the blockchain ecosystem. Lightchain AI’s tokenomics are designed for sustainability and equitable distribution, with a total supply of 10 billion LCAI tokens allocated across presale, staking rewards, liquidity pools, marketing, treasury, and team incentives. The project’s roadmap outlines key milestones, including testnet rollout in January 2025 and mainnet activation in March 2025, aiming to enhance scalability, privacy, and governance within the blockchain space.

Although BNB Price Predictions show its stability in fluctuating markets, and Bitcoin Cash keeps traders alert with its critical support levels, it’s the Web3Bay presale that’s capturing attention with an immense 6,430% ROI potential. With prices increasing by 15% at every presale stage, starting early with Web3Bay could bring huge benefits. As crypto whales hunt for lucrative opportunities and retail investors search for the next big breakthrough, Web3Bay’s path is being compared to the early days of Ethereum and Binance. The critical question remains: will you take action now or let this opportunity slip away? Web3Bay: The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay is revolutionizing early crypto engagement by significantly favoring early presale participants. Prices begin at $0.003, rising by 15% with each phase, showcasing unprecedented potential for early action-takers. Currently, in presale stage 2 priced at $0.00345, the presale has already gathered over $280,000, selling 76 million 3BAY tokens. Missing out now could mean facing higher prices later—an outcome every buyer wants to avoid. Web3Bay stands out with its strategic approach. As a decentralized e-commerce platform, it eliminates intermediaries, fostering secure, direct deals. Leveraging decentralized storage through IPFS, contract-based automated payments, and cross-chain functionalities, it attracts crypto whales, recognizing its long-term value.

Crypto whales are already participating, leaving retail investors with one decision: Are you prepared to stake your claim in this groundbreaking venture before it’s too late? BNB Holds Strong Despite Market Volatility BNB remains a prominent cryptocurrency, buoyed by its extensive use. It is currently valued at about $699.58. Experts are keeping an eye on it, as BNB Price Prediction suggests it will perform well, especially due to its integration with Binance’s services like reduced fees and token sale access. It reached a peak of $794 in December 2024, highlighting its potential despite the usual market fluctuations. Updates to the BNB Chain are enhancing its capacity and compatibility. These upgrades are crucial as Binance expands its offerings across DeFi and NFTs. With significant investment in BNB, it’s a focal point for both day traders and long-term holders poised for its next big development. Is Bitcoin Cash Poised for a Major Breakout? Bitcoin Cash is noticed for its fluctuating support levels. At a price of around $456.72, it draws those awaiting the next Bitcoin Cash Breakout. Current market trends indicate stabilization and anticipation, reinforced by its second halving in 2024 and a recent addition to the EDX Markets. These developments enhance Bitcoin Cash’s appeal as a quicker, less expensive alternative to Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Cash network is evolving, with improvements in scalability and functionality to secure its place in the crypto market. With growing interest from major investors, BCH could be setting up for significant market shifts. Will this result in a sustainable breakout or just temporary peaks? Time will show. Final Verdict BNB and Bitcoin Cash continue to draw interest, with BNB Price Prediction showing potential for growth through enhanced utility and network upgrades. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Cash’s prospects for a breakout seem promising as it stabilizes after the halving and attracts trader attention. Yet, major investors are turning their attention to Web3Bay, enticed by a presale that offers a potential return of up to 6,430% . With its decentralized e-commerce platform that boasts distinct features and a thoughtful pricing strategy, Web3Bay is emerging as a compelling opportunity. While BNB and BCH maintain their positions, Web3Bay offers an early chance to be part of a project set for significant growth.

Amidst this recent price gain, developments from the short-term holders (STH) activity have revealed significant indications for Bitcoin in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Sinks To Lowest Since FTX Crash: Bottom In? Bitcoin STH MVRV At 1.1 With More Room To Run According to a recent X post, blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shared a data report on the Bitcoin short-term holders’ MVRV ratio in relation to market price. In crypto, the market value to realized value ratio (MVRV) is a critical analysis tool used to gauge whether an asset is overvalued or undervalued. It is also used to track the holders’ profitability with values above 1 indicating profit and below 1 meaning a loss. Based on Glassnode’s report, the Bitcoin STH MVRV ratio currently stands at 1.1 suggesting that short-term holders i.e. investors who acquired Bitcoin within the past 155 days, are on average, experiencing a 10% profit. Considering BTC’s price fall in recent weeks, there might be increased selling pressure as these holders move to realize their gains, leading to short-term price resistance. However, data from Glassnode indicates that the Bitcoin MVRV STH ratio previously reached peaks of 1.35 in November 2024, and 1.44 in March 2024. These MVRV values suggest that short-term holders may tolerate higher profitability levels before triggering a widespread sell-off. If Bitcoin bulls maintain the current price recovery with rising demand, the STH MVRV ratio could rise closer to these historical peak levels, which could signal a confirmation of Bitcoin resuming its market uptrend. Related Reading: On The Horizon: Bitcoin $140,000 Projection And SOL, XRP ETFs Approval In 2025 Crypto Forecast BTC Must Avoid Fall Below $87,000 – Here’s Why In relation to the Bitcoin STH MVRV ratio, it is understood that 1.0, which indicates no profit or loss, is a pivotal value acting as a support during bullish trends or resistance in a market downtrend. Glassnode report reveals that the current STH MVRV ratio shows that 1.0 corresponds with the $87,000 price zone. According to data from the Cumulative Bid-Ask Delta, there is an air pocket between $87,000 and $71,000 i.e. there is low trading activity or fewer significant buy orders in this price range. Therefore, if the price of BTC slips below $87,000, it will hit no significant support until $71,000 translating into a major price decline. At the time of writing, the premier cryptocurrency continues to trade at $98,081 reflecting a 1.02% gain in the past day. With a market cap of $1.94 trillion, Bitcoin continues to rank as the largest asset in the crypto market.

The wallet purchased 123 million FOCAI for a total of 5.39 SOL. It then sold its positions for 16,070 SOL, making a total profit of $3.47 million, corresponding to a 2,973x increase.

This new solution, introduced in a January 3 GitHub post by cryptography researcher and Zeus Network Chief Scientist Dean Little, is designed to safeguard user funds from future threats posed by quantum computing. The Make-up of The Solana Winternitz Vault Solana’s Winternitz Vault leverages a sophisticated hash-based signature system. This is to ensure security for Solana, which is already known for its fast transaction speeds, low fees, and scalability. Generally, Solana is recognized as a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and cryptocurrency transactions. The solution generates a unique cryptographic key for every transaction to reduce the risk of coordinated attacks from quantum computers. It utilizes Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS). This is totally unlike traditional wallets. Google Willow Raise Hack Concerns A few weeks ago, Google took the world by surprise when it launched Willow, its quantum computing chip. This chip uses 105 qubits to solve computational problems in less than 5 minutes, which would otherwise take 10 to 25 years. Many fear this could jeopardize the security of other systems that use passwords and privacy keys, including Bitcoin (BTC). Also, there are reports that Chinese researchers breached encryption algorithms using quantum computing . A research team at Shanghai University claimed that they used a quantum computer developed by Canada’s D-Wave Systems to penetrate encryption algorithms. According to a South China Morning Post report, they explored a method known as quantum annealing. Quantum Computing is Not Yet a Threat Though concerns are consistently rising about how quantum computing puts cryptocurrencies at risk, experts think that this technology is not yet an immediate threat. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin suggested that the quantum hacking scenario is still a few years away. In the case of Bitcoin, a seed phrase comprises 12 or 24 random words that act as a master key to a wallet.

Rexas Finance (RXS), an ADA competitor less than $1, is taking the stage with its innovative method of real-world asset tokenization. Investors are attentively tracking their paths for significant returns as XRP and RXS coins hit double-digit pricing in 2025. Cardano Price Rebound Potential At $0.87 right now, Cardano (ADA) has declined 12.87% over the previous month and 2.90% over the past 24 hours. The token's movement inside a horizontal trend channel suggests that its price might remain within this range for the foreseeable future. Cardano's resistance is $1.30, allowing big price swings; its support level is $0.76. A low Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests that Cardano may be oversold and points to a likelihood of recovery of recovery. Given advancements in ADA's ecosystem, market observers point out its chances for momentum recovery. Ripple (XRP) Targets Double-Digit Prices Rising to $2.17, Ripple (XRP) has been one of the best performers of 2024. Over the past two months alone, XRP has increased over 300%, surpassing 250% year-to-date. Continuous developments in Ripple's legal fight and rising acceptance of its payment methods further bolster XRP's position as a top altcoin in the market, which helps explain these outstanding increases. With support around $0.65 and resistance at $2.72 XRP, it also moves in a horizontal trend channel. Technical signals suggest upward momentum, including TradingView's ""buy"" rating. Given the rise in institutional adoption and regulatory clarity confirming Ripple's place in the global financial system, analysts estimate that its price might reach double digits by 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): The ADA Rival Under $1 Rexas Finance (RXS) has become a promising ADA challenger aiming for exponential expansion, focusing on Cardano and Ripple. Priced at $0.175 in its present presale stage, RXS has shown substantial success, having already increased 500% from its starting presale price. The amazing $34.24 million raised by the presale indicates great investor confidence in the project's ambition. Rexas Finance is transforming the production and management of digital tokens to represent actual assets. Its technology simplifies tokenizing real estate, art, and goods so users may quickly tokenize assets. This creative method has attracted so much interest that RXS is among the most often discussed real-world asset (RWA) tokens of 2024. Rexas Finance has chosen a public presale approach instead of many initiatives that depend on venture capitalists, guaranteeing extensive involvement in its expansion path. Listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko have further enhanced its prominence and legitimacy. The Certik audit, which stressed the project's dedication to openness and security, has also given investors confidence. According to market analysts, Rexas Finance's future is bright. They project token prices to reach double-digit levels in 2025. Driven by rising acceptance and the popularity of tokenized assets, projections show that RXS might earn $36. Rexas Finance is positioned to draw a larger audience and boost liquidity since intentions are for listing on three of the top 10 Tier 1 exchanges. The platform's creative approach to real-world asset tokenizing has already helped it to become a prominent participant in the crypto scene. Apart from being a rival to Cardano, RXS is a disruptor in the larger blockchain market since it enables users to tokenize practically any asset with simplicity. Investors who see the coin's potential today could profit greatly as RXS keeps acquiring popularity and targets exponential expansion. While Ripple's significant adoption and legal certainty could drive its price to new heights, Cardano's established ecosystem and dedication to invention prepare it for a possible comeback. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, presents a novel viewpoint on actual asset tokenization, which appeals to investors looking for strong growth possibilities. Conclusion As the market gears up for the 2025 bull run, these three tokens stand out as strong contenders for double-digit prices. While established players like Cardano and Ripple continue building on their foundations, rising stars like Rexas Finance prove that innovation and adaptability can unlock immense value. Investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth may find these tokens compelling. Take advantage of the ongoing presale and invest in Rexas Finance (RXS) to position yourself for transformative gains by 2025.

Among these are Sui (SUI) and Toncoin (TON), which have lately given outstanding performances. While Sui has shown notable positive momentum and new all-time highs, Toncoin has shown tenacity in the face of market consolidations. With a creative ecosystem centered on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi), Rexas Finance (RXS) has positioned itself as a leader in this competitive scene. In the race to $10, RXS presents special utility and great development potential that might drive it over Toncoin and Sui. Toncoin (TON): Tough But Slow Growth Priced at $5.81 and with a market capitalization of $14.8 billion, the coin has exhibited amazing consistency despite market declines. It has shown durability during consolidation phases and had a 9% price rise last week. Its price swings between $5.7 and $4.8, reflecting a mix of bullish and negative factors, and it displays quite slow progress. Driven by persistent investor confidence, technical signs point ahead to Toncoin, perhaps breaking above the $10 level. Still, the coin has seen little monthly movement—a meager 2% increase—so this growth path stays slow. Although Toncoin provides consistent performance, its lack of innovative ideas or dynamic utility reduces its attraction compared to other flexible cryptocurrencies. Sui (SUI): Pushing Ahead with Bullish Velocity Sui has had an amazing run, rising almost 47% in the past week and surpassing an all-time high above $3.5. Its 63% green-day rate over the previous month and 20.33% volatility rate indicate great investor confidence, consistent with sustained optimistic momentum. Analysts estimate Sui might reach between $10 and $15 by year-end, driven by strong technical indicators and an upbeat attitude. Though Sui's quick price swings and regular performance have attracted interest, its value proposition mostly depends on industry trends. It lacks the complete ecosystem and practical use cases that are growingly crucial for long-term success in the cryptocurrency market. Rexas Finance: A Novel Ecosystem with Applied Value Rexas Finance distinguishes itself from Toncoin and Sui by providing an ecosystem meant to bridge the gap between conventional finance and blockchain technology. Fundamentally, Rexas Finance is about tokenizing real-world assets—that is, fractional ownership of valuable things such as real estate, gold coins, and companies. Important Characteristics of the Rexas Ecosystem The Rexas Token Builder allows users to tokenize actual assets easily, eliminating the need for blockchain knowledge. This easy-to-use tool lets people and companies start tokenizing assets in minutes, democratizing asset tokenization access. The decentralized Rexas Launchpad offers a safe and open space for token financing among several blockchain systems. This tool gives companies and initiatives confidence in their funding and helps them to raise money efficiently. Investors can engage in fractional ownership of real-world properties with Rexas Estate, therefore generating stablecoin passive income. This function reduces entrance requirements for real estate investing, so enabling a worldwide audience to access it. Rexas GenAI uses artificial intelligence to create excellent digital artworks, allowing producers to enter the NFT market without the need for artistic knowledge. In the fast-expanding NFT industry, this instrument increases the chances of artists and businesses. While the Rexas Treasury maximizes yield via compound interest tactics, Rexas DeFi enables smooth cryptocurrency trading across several blockchain systems. These tools improve the platform's attractiveness to long-term investors and DeFi aficionados. RXS Presale: Unmatched Investing Opportunity Pricing is $0.175, and the RXS coin is currently in its eleventh presale stage. With over 386 million tokens sold and $34.2 million raised, the presale has been a clear success. Driven by its creative environment and practical uses, investors have seen the great promise of RXS. How Would One Take Part in the RXS Presale? Get your wallet ready. Use a wallet compatible with Wallet Connect, such as Trust Wallet or MetaMask. Store Your Wallet: Purchase ETH or USDT, making sure you have enough for gas expenses. Link to the Rexas Platform See rexas.com to link your wallet to the Ethereum network. Pay Method of Choice: Your chosen payment method should be ETH or USDT. Finish the exchange: Enter the intended purchase amount, check the information, and then complete the transaction. Your RXS tokens will be delivered straight to your wallet after verifying the transaction. Why might RXS beat Sui and Toncoin? Rexas Finance provides unmatched value through its real-world utilities and transforming environment, even though Toncoin and Sui have attracted attention with their resilience and optimistic tendencies. Its emphasis on democratizing investment, streamlining asset tokenizing, and allowing fractional ownership fits the needs of the worldwide market for accessibility and creativity. Furthermore, by guaranteeing long-term relevance and scalability, RXS offers a strong infrastructure for producers, dealers, and investors. Forecasts of a 6x return at launch and ongoing expansion indicate that RXS will surpass rivals in the sprint to $10. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is changing as people seek initiatives with actual value and practical uses. Although Toncoin and Sui have shown great performance, Rexas Finance is a game-changer with its whole ecosystem and emphasis on asset tokenization. For those wishing to profit from the next great cryptocurrency success story, RXS offers an unmatched investment opportunity as the presale progresses. With its unique qualities and fast development trajectory, Rexas Finance is positioned to compete and lead the race to $10.

These were released under a Freedom of Information Act request after months of legal wrangling. The letters, known as “pause letters,” provide rare insight into the thinking of the FDIC on cryptocurrency activities. They show that the agency instructed banks to stop crypto-related activities in what appeared to be a conscious effort to prevent U.S. banks from engaging with crypto companies in 2022. News of the same was announced by Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal on X, formerly known as Twitter: “FDIC magically found TWO more pause letters in this search after saying before that it had complied with an earlier Court order.” Judge Criticizes FDIC for Noncompliance On December 12, 2024, Judge Ana C. Reyes admonished the FDIC for over-redacting previously released documents and failing to fully comply with the orders of the court. She ordered the agency to make “more thoughtful redactions” and provide greater transparency by releasing the requested documents. In that regard, two new letters released due to the compliance by FDIC have shown that banks were asked to stand down on all crypto asset-related activities. The result has been delays in launching crypto services and further confusion about what will be required for regulatory compliance. Implications for Regulatory Transparency The publication of the documents has reignited debates over the transparency and accountability of U.S. regulatory agencies in the cryptocurrency sector. Critics have likened such moves to “Operation Chokepoint,” a controversial 2013 program that targeted banks and payment processors serving high-risk industries. Dubbed “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” this new version is part of a broader pattern of regulatory scrutiny the crypto industry has been facing. The “pause letters” have been viewed as confirmation the FDIC is involved in the broader push. Grewal has called on immediate congressional hearings to have lawmakers investigate the FDIC’s practices. “The new Congress should launch hearings on all this without delay,” Grewal said on X . With the regulatory landscape continuing to shift, industry players and policymakers alike are further pushing for a clearer set of guidelines that balances innovation with oversight under a new presidential administration.",Blockchain|FDIC|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-04 19:28:00

Binance says the Central Bank of Brazil has granted the crypto exchange approval to acquire financial services firm Sim;paul, a licensed broker-dealer in the world’s eighth-largest economy. “By receiving full approval for the takeover of Sim;paul – a licensed broker-dealer authorized to distribute securities and to issue electronic money (EMI) by the Central Bank of Brazil, Binance, which was already operating in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the country as a global exchange, can be more efficient in complying with the ongoing regulatory advancements. The approval also makes Binance the first crypto exchange to have a broker-dealer license in Brazil.” According to Binance, the broker-dealer license it has received follows various other regulatory advancements in Argentina, India, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Dubai, France, Japan and El Salvador. “Furthermore, we have expanded our global compliance team by 34% to 645 full-time employees, including strategic senior hires. We employ over 1,000 compliance staff and contractors, ensuring that we dedicate sufficient resources to drive Binance and the larger crypto ecosystem’s growth sufficiently and responsibly.” The granting of a broker-dealer license in Brazil is coming a few months after the crypto exchange’s founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao was released from a US prison after pleading guilty to anti-money laundering charges while at the helm of Binance. Zhao stepped down as the CEO of Binance in November of 2023 after the U.S. Justice Department levied charges against him and the crypto exchange. The license is also being granted months after the Nigerian government dropped anti-money laundering charges against Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan. Binance, however, is still facing anti-money laundering charges in the West African country.

Microsoft’s $80 billion investment in AI data centers Microsoft is investing $80 billion in the fiscal year 2025 towards building data centers that are specially designed for AI workloads. In short, it is an effort to strengthen AI and cloud infrastructure to meet the unprecedented global demand for artificial intelligence. More than half of the investments will be channeled into the capability to train AI models and for deploying applications that are AI-driven, within the United States itself. Vice Chair and President Brad Smith highlighted that the U.S. leads the global AI race, driven by private investments and innovations from both startups and established companies. He credited Microsoft’s success in AI to its partnerships with firms like OpenAI, as well as its AI-enabled products like Windows and Teams. This partnership has allowed Microsoft to include AI in its Windows, Teams, and Azure systems. These three platforms experienced an outstanding 33% growth in cloud services during the first quarter of 2025. Strengthening America’s position in AI He called AI the “electricity of our age,” highlighting its potential to transform industries and drive economic growth Smith also requested the U.S. to enhance its leadership in AI by improving education and promoting American AI technologies all over the world. And ensuring that workers are prepared for the jobs of the future. He alerted that China’s influence is increasing, as it offers cheap chips and AI data centers to developing countries. Smith added that instead of worrying about competition, the U.S. should move fast to make its AI technologies the best, so it can succeed in the AI field for a long. He cited innovation from the likes of Microsoft as an example. It is placing its bet on AI by riding the industry trend as the adoption of AI picks up after ChatGPT. As Microsoft builds AI infrastructure very carefully, NVIDIA has taken a lead position as the most dominant hardware provider for AI. The training and usage of AI models are largely dependent on the GPUs of NVIDIA, and with its strong stance in the market for AI hardware, it has dominated the tech market. It’s very clear that the company depends on the highly advanced GPUs from NVIDIA in the AI data centers, showing a great interplay between software and hardware in the AI revolution. In fact, the rapid growth of the AI field has made companies like Microsoft invest heavily in their infrastructure just to stay up with the changing landscape. Microsoft invested a lot in AI but did not accept Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor, a proponent of Bitcoin, proposed to Microsoft that they consider the benefits Bitcoin provides as a strong way to protect finances. However, the company chose to focus on AI and cloud computing as its main growth areas instead. This means that Microsoft plans to keep focusing on investments that can show quick returns, instead of trying to get involved in the digital world called Bitcoin. The large amount of $80 billion for an AI data center investment is very big for Microsoft as it shows its commitment to future technology improvements. Microsoft’s decision not to use Bitcoin sets it apart from some competitors, but its focus on AI and cloud services shows a clear strategy to drive innovation and maintain leadership.

This has allowed AI altcoins to be in the spotlight in 2025. PropiChain (PCHAIN), ai16z (AI16Z), and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) are the leading AI altcoins to watch in the new year. PropiChain is a tokenization and fractional ownership platform that uses AI features to transform the $300 trillion real estate industry. On the other hand, FET and AI16Z are tipped to fly high, with analysts calling them must-watch AI altcoins. A16Z Mulls a Launchpad for AI Altcoins AI16Z plans a token launchpad similar to Pump.fun to support AI altcoins using its Eliza framework. Pump.fun is a launchpad for meme coins on Solana. The launchpad will make ai16z’s token the primary currency for agent-to-agent interactions in AI altcoins. AI16Z will include features such as staking for access, liquidity pools, and launch fees to capture value. After gaining 106% in the past week, AI16Z is one of the best-performing AI altcoins in the same period. Analysts claim that it will see further gains in 2025 as the AI agents narrative grows. PCHAIN’s AI Features Attract Dogecoin and Solana Whales PropiChain is one of the best AI altcoins to watch in 2025. The project raised over $1 million in funding after attracting members from the Solana and Dogecoin communities. Early investors have already earned 200% gains when the presale reached the second round. These impressive developments are a result of PCHAIN’s innovative features, anchored on artificial intelligence. As a tokenization and fractional ownership platform, PCHAIN enables users to buy or sell portions of properties. This model gives retai traders access to a market traditionally reserved for the rich. Away from tokenization, PropiChain’s AI features are transforming real estate management and investing. The platform offers users valuable real estate insights through AI-driven predictive market analysis. By gaining access to future patterns and data-based analyis, PCHAIN’s users make informed investment decisions. This allows them to outperform the market and notch high returns. Additionally, smart contract automation is used to automatically handle real estate transactions such as auto-leasing and lease renewals. This feature makes real estate transactions faster, cheaper, and safer. Property managers, landlords, and tenants are impressed by this feature. To keep the platform safe for users and investors, the platform had its smart contract independently audited by BlockAudit. Furthermore, PropiChain also AI for automated valuation models for accurate appraisals. This feature makes sure that buyers and sellers buy or sell properties at fair market values. PCHAIN also incorporates the metaverse for virtual property viewing, staging, and meetings. This makes it easier for potential buyers to make purchasing decisions without physically beign there. With such features, PCHAIN is on of the best AI altcoins to invest in. It is expected to surge higher than Solana and Dogecoin. FET Loses Ground, Expected to Bounce Back FET lost 29% in a month, reducing its yearly gains to 77%. This decline comes as AI altcoins tumble. However, analysts predictFET could bounce back. There are several factors that will catalyse its recovery. The demand for AI altcoins is growing, with AI agents slowly taking over. FET is projected to rise to $3, up from its current price of $1.26. The AI altcoin is projected to outpace other leading assets such as Dogecoin and Solana. Investors are Turning to PropiChain for Maximum Gains Investors are flocking to PropiChain in droves. At only $0.011, PCHAIN offers investors an attractive point as it gears to surge 20,000% after launch on exchanges. The real estate altcoin further won the hearts of investors after listing on CoinMarketCap. This move added another layer of credibility of transparency. Apart from its AI features, PropiChain has investor-driven tokenomics and incentives. Its generous staking rewards of up to 225% APR is helping bring more investors to its ecosystem. Take advantage of this opportunity to outperform Solana and Dogecoin investors in 2025. Join PCHAIN’s presale to grow $1,000 into $200,000 in 2025.

BlockDAG’s SHA-3 ASIC Hardware Offers Superior Crypto Mining Profits!,https://thecoinrise.com/why-are-xrp-filecoin-facing-volatility-blockdags-sha-3-asic-hardware-offers-superior-crypto-mining-profits/,"The crypto market remains unpredictable, with December showcasing the usual fluctuations. The XRP price outlook indicates a possible decrease of 15-20% as technical indicators turn negative, while the Filecoin (FIL) price prediction reveals ongoing uncertainty. Amid these established cryptos facing hurdles, the emerging project BlockDAG is proving to be one of the best cryptos to mine, thanks to its unique approach to enhancing miner access and reward consistency. With the first shipment of miners planned for 2025 prior to its mainnet release, BlockDAG (BDAG) is committed to providing equitable access to its specialized SHA-3 hardware. As the industry observes XRP and Filecoin managing technical issues, BlockDAG is positioned to significantly impact both miners and the broader market. XRP Price Forecast: Potential Decline During the Holidays? XRP is under increasing bearish pressure this December, with indicators pointing to a possible 15-20% decline by month’s end. Having peaked at $2.90, the cryptocurrency has since fallen more than 25%, reaching as low as $2.13 on December 23 and is currently priced at $2.20. This downturn is mainly due to profit-taking after a surge to overbought levels and the Federal Reserve’s move towards more restrictive monetary policies. Compounding the negative XRP price outlook, significant holders are beginning to sell off, potentially driving the price down further. Filecoin (FIL) Price Forecast: Critical Levels to Monitor Filecoin (FIL) is experiencing a downward trend, characterized by a descending channel with decreasing highs and lows. This pattern identifies resistance levels at $5.506, $6.666, and $8.490, with support around $4.373. Currently at $4.794, FIL is at a pivotal point. Bearish sentiment is underscored by technical indicators such as RVOL, MA, and RSI, yet breaking above these resistances could initiate a positive shift in its price prediction path. Traders are advised to keep a close watch on these crucial levels to spot potential movements. BlockDAG’s SHA-3 ASIC Hardware: Revolutionizing Crypto Mining BlockDAG is transforming crypto mining by creating a system that unites small-scale hobbyists and large-scale enterprises. Its Keccak256 (SHA-3) ASIC miners are engineered for optimal efficiency and easy access. To date, over 15,100 mining rigs have been sold in the ongoing presale, accumulating $6.1 million from these sales and more than $175.5 million from BDAG coin sales. A recent AMA announced that this hardware is set to be delivered in 2025 on a first-come, first-served basis, with all participants equipped before next year’s mainnet launch. This initiative not only equalizes opportunities but also supports genuine decentralization and enhanced security through its commitment to Proof-of-Work (PoW). For those looking for the best crypto to mine, BlockDAG provides rigs that are both effective and environmentally friendly, thus profitable. What sets BlockDAG apart is its progressive reward system and sustainable practices. Instead of sudden reward cuts, BlockDAG introduces a steady monthly decrease in rewards, reducing market instability and offering miners more predictable returns. With energy-efficient operations and powerful hash rates, BlockDAG’s ASIC miners are perfectly suited for optimizing earnings with minimal environmental effects. BlockDAG also simplifies mining for both novices and experienced miners alike. Its efficient integration with mining pools makes network connection straightforward. With its dedication to rapid transactions and profitability, BlockDAG is becoming a leading project in the mining sector. It stands out as the premier choice for those seeking the best crypto to mine in 2025, thanks to its modern strategies and focus on inclusivity. Conclusion: The Premier Crypto Mining Choice As the cryptocurrency market progresses through December, the XRP price outlook suggests possible reductions, while the Filecoin (FIL) price prediction shows a descending channel pattern, offering both opportunities and challenges for traders. Contrastingly, BlockDAG introduces an advanced solution. Its SHA-3 ASIC miners are setting new standards in mining with their eco-friendly designs and consistent reward reduction system. BDAG is quickly becoming the best crypto to mine , recognized for its considerable growth prospects. With BlockDAG’s equipment, miners can attain substantial hash rates with reduced power use and can accumulate up to 2000 BDAG coins daily. For those in search of stability and growth opportunities, BlockDAG represents an attractive option within the crypto market.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 20:09:00
