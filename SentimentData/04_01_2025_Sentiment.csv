The plan, effective as of January 3, 2025, marks a major step in resolving the fallout from the cryptocurrency exchange’s collapse in November 2022. The initial record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience Classes was also set for January 3, with further dates for other creditor classes to follow. FTX Initial Distributions to Begin Within 60 Days According to FTX Debtors, the initial payments to the creditors in the Convenience Classes will be made within 60 days from the effective date of the plan. As per the release, distribution claims for these assets must also adhere to specific criteria such as the KYC process and tax filing. Similarly, the holders of allowed claims shall have up to January 20, 2025, to meeting the pre-distribution conditions. These are filing of tax forms, choosing of Distribution Service Provider and performing of sanctions checks. Submissions made after the deadline will not be included in the initial distribution but will be included in subsequent distributions. The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization is effective today, January 3, 2025. Today is also the initial distribution record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan's Convenience Classes. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. — FTX (@FTX_Official) January 3, 2025 FTX has developed a Customer Portal where creditors are taken through a step by step procedure of eight steps with step 8 involving the selection of Distribution Service Provider. At the moment, there are only two providers, Kraken and BitGo, however, both of them have certain jurisdictions. Distribution Service Providers and Payment Options Payouts will be processed by Distribution Service Providers BitGo and Kraken, which will support several fiat and crypto options. As for the withdrawal, both providers enable creditors to make the withdrawal in U.S. dollars or request conversion of the distribution to digital assets. For FTX US residents, BitGo provides ACH transfers, wire transfers, and the option to buy digital assets such as stablecoins. Kraken has similar functionalities with extra options for SWIFT and SEPA depending on the rules of the region. However, some jurisdictions are prohibited. For instance, BitGo is prohibited from operating in New York, and Kraken is forbidden from operating in New York, Washington, and Maine. If a jurisdiction of a creditor is not sustainable, distribution will be held until other measures are put in place. Under the reorganization plan, $6.5 billion is set aside for addressing claims submissions dispute. Further adjustments to this reserve amount will be made by the Plan Administrator as and when the disputes are settled. Moreover, the Plan Administrator will also be responsible for overseeing future FTX distributions. These will be financed by the cash that will be available after all the reserves are created and worked on pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization. FTX Claims Based on November 2022 Asset Prices The amount creditors receive will be based on the value of their assets at the time of FTX’s collapse in November 2022. For instance, Bitcoin was valued between $15,000 and $17,000 during that period, significantly lower than its current price of around $100,000. Despite this, FTX’s timeline for distributions is considerably faster than previous cases in the cryptocurrency industry. For example, customers of the Mt. Gox exchange, which collapsed in 2014, are still receiving payments after over a decade. FTX’s debtors announced in December that they had between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion available for distribution. Under the plan, approximately 98% of creditors are expected to recover 119% of their allowed claims.

Crypto is no longer just about Bitcoin or Ethereum—it’s the era of meme coins. These coins, often seen as quirky investments, are delivering jaw-dropping returns to those who know when to jump in. Among today’s hottest meme coins are BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Act I: The AI Prophecy. Each has something unique to offer, but BTFD is currently stealing the show with its presale’s massive 50% bonus with the code BIG50—a golden chance you won’t want to miss. BTFD has already raised over $4.6 million, selling more than 60 billion tokens to over 7000 holders. When you apply the BIG50 bonus code you get 50% more coins on your purchase—a deal that’s tough to pass up.

Meanwhile, Bonk and Act I bring their own unique flavours to the meme coin world. Bonk thrives on its community-focused charm, while Act I combines artificial intelligence with blockchain to create something futuristic and exciting.

The full version of BTFD’s P2E game is already live, showcasing the coin’s commitment to innovation. Rewards are available now and the game promises to revolutionise how users engage with crypto. Staking is another standout feature, offering a 90% APY. Imagine staking 1 million BTFD coins and earning an additional 900,000 coins annually—it’s a game-changer for passive income seekers. BTFD’s referral programme is equally exciting. By sharing your unique referral code, you can earn 10% of your referrals’ purchases if you make it to the top 20 leaderboard. Plus, those using your code get an extra 10% BTFD on purchases over $50—a win-win for everyone involved. If you’re ready to buy, the process is simple: Go to the BTFD Presale Page . Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Enter the bonus code BIG50 and apply it. Input the amount of BTFD you want to buy. Confirm the transaction and secure your bonus tokens. With over $4.8 million raised so far and 62 billion coins sold, the BTFD presale is a golden opportunity for those seeking high returns.

In a letter to the Senate Banking Committee, Assistant Secretary for Management Aditi Hardikar says the Treasury Department suffered a “major cybersecurity incident” after receiving a notice from third-party software service provider BeyondTrust on December 8th. According to Hardikar, hackers funded by the state of China had access to a key used by BeyondTrust to provide remote technical support for Treasury Department employees. Hardikar says the thieves used the stolen key to remotely infiltrate employees’ workstations and access unclassified documents maintained by those employees. The Treasury Department says it abruptly sought the assistance of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Intelligence Community and outside experts to investigate the origin and overall impact of the attack. “Based on available indicators, the incident has been attributed to a China state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor… In accordance with Treasury policy, intrusions attributable to an APT are considered a major cybersecurity incident.” An APT is an exploit executed by state-sponsored hackers with the goal of stealing sensitive information, carrying out cyber espionage or sabotaging critical infrastructure. According to Hardikar, the exploited BeyondTrust service has been shuttered and there’s nothing to suggest that the hackers still have access to the Treasury Department’s records. Meanwhile, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning says China had nothing to do with the data breach, reports CNN. “We have repeatedly stated our position on such groundless accusations lacking evidence. China has always opposed all forms of cyberattacks, and we are even more opposed to spreading false information about China for political purposes.” The Treasury Department is expected to hold a classified briefing about the cybersecurity incident in the coming days with staff members of the House Financial Services Committee.

As Solana faces a whale sell-off, XYZVerse is emerging as a top contender, with predictions of a massive rally in 2025. Table of Contents XYZVerse: The rising meme coin star Solana Conclusion Solana is experiencing a notable sell-off from major investors, indicating a possible shift in market sentiment. Meanwhile, XYZVerse is catching attention as a promising contender, with predictions of a massive surge by 2025. XYZVerse: The rising meme coin star XYZVerse is positioning itself as one of the most exciting new projects in the crypto market. As the first all-sports meme token, it aims to blend the viral appeal of meme culture with the massive global interest in sports. This unique approach is drawing in investors and creating a significant buzz. Driving XYZVerse’s massive growth potential: Low entry price with huge upside: Currently priced at $0.001333 during its presale, XYZVerse is projected to reach $0.1 by the final presale stage — a 7,402% increase. Predictions for post-launch growth push potential returns to as high as 15,000%. Robust ecosystem: XYZVerse will offer prediction markets, entertainment-focused dApps, and community-driven rewards, making it more than just a meme coin. Its ecosystem seeks to create lasting value and appeal. Strong fundamentals: Backed by audited smart contracts, a vetted team, and upcoming listings on major exchanges, XYZVerse is built to sustain its growth trajectory. While Solana faces challenges with market sentiment, XYZVerse is gaining momentum as a fresh and transformative alternative. Its focus on sports and meme culture opens doors to untapped markets, setting it apart from other projects. Established projects may still have a role in portfolios, but emerging contenders like XYZVerse offer the kind of explosive growth potential that early investors crave. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale to potentially grow millions . Solana Solana shook up the blockchain world with its focus on speed and scalability. Competing with big names like Ethereum and Cardano, it offers a platform where developers can build decentralized apps (dapps) using various programming languages. The potential of SOL shines in its ability to underpin a high-capacity network that can handle busy products and services. This makes it an attractive option for developers and investors looking for efficiency and flexibility. The sell-off in Solana could indicate shifting market sentiment as investors reassess its scalability, network reliability, or competition in the blockchain space. While Solana remains a key player, this trend suggests that large-scale investors are seeking opportunities in emerging projects with higher growth potential. Conclusion While coins like SOL remain strong in the 2024 bull run, XYZVerse aims to offer significant growth through community engagement and strategic partnerships in a unique sports-meme ecosystem.

It seeks to aid the formation of “bioDAOs” (decentralized autonomous organizations) that will help fund and self-govern scientific IP internationally from researchers, companies, and universities. One essential element of the protocol is decentralized data sharing, allowing researchers to keep IP and data ownership throughout scientific collaboration.

The support comes as an expansion of trade offerings for Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This development might have a resultant impact on the price outlook of these memecoins as more participants trade in them. Binance Expanded Fiat Pairings Boost Accessibility According to Binance’s official update on the development, the exchange said it would enable trading of the tokens against some selected African fiat currency. These could include ETB (Ethiopia), KES (Kenya), GHS (Ghana), TZS (Tanzania), UGX (Uganda) and RWF (Rwanda). Other fiat are XAF, XOF, and ZAR, which have multiple countries using it as fiat in the region. This development means interested participants could make purchases of these trading pairs using different local payment systems on the P2P channel. This opens the way for more capital inflow into the three aforementioned memecoin ecosystems. Market experts see that as likely to increase trade and impact price direction upward. This and a bullish outlook for 2025 could lead to increased price movement for PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. An expanded global market could support appreciable price growth. Market Reactions and Price Movements These memecoins have experienced different price reactions in the broader cryptocurrency market after the announcement. As of this writing, PEPE suffered a 0.83% decline to trade at $0.00002065. Its market volume also dipped by a significant 24.13% to $1.61 billion. Nonetheless, the current price level is a notable rebound from its low of $0.00002009 in earlier trading. DOGE is trading up by 1.71% at $0.3469 despite a decline in market volume by 22.85% to $2.27 billion. Meanwhile, Dogecoin whales have been active in the market, supporting price movement. Dog-themed Shiba Inu has also displayed the prospect of price upsurge as SHIB is trading at $0.0000232, a 1.88% increase in the last 24 hours. The trading volume has increased slightly by 1.10% to $479.18 million. Regulatory Compliance and Market Stability Analysts anticipated increased gains for the assets as Binance backs the memecoins across the selected African countries. They, however, caution that the leading crypto exchange needs to guarantee stability by ensuring regulatory compliance. This, they maintain, will help avoid repeating the experience it had in Nigeria , one of its largest markets.

With the formation of a classic bull flag pattern and the 1-Day 50 Moving Average (MA) acting as a bullish catalyst, the analyst is increasingly confident that XRP will reach new All-Time Highs (ATH) in 2025. How The 1-Day 50 MA Will Propel XRP Price To $4.93 The 50-day MA is a technical indicator used to track the average closing price of a cryptocurrency over the last 50 trading days. According to Dr. Dovetail, a TradingView crypto analyst, the 1-day 50 MA, indicated by the orange line in his XRP price chart, has risen to the lower boundary of a bull flag pattern. Related Reading: Weekly Chart Shows That Dogecoin Price Is Primed To Cross $11 In 2025, Here’s How The analyst suggested that XRP’s price action, which has been in a consolidation phase after its big pump, triggered the formation of the classic bull flag pattern. This bullish continuation pattern typically occurs after a strong upward movement, followed by a price correction that leads to consolidation. Historically, when a cryptocurrency consolidates near strong moving averages like the 1-day 50 MA, it indicates the readiness for a price breakout. Looking at his technical chart, the 1-day 50 MA plays a crucial role in Dr. Dovetail’s analysis and bullish XRP price prediction. The analyst believes this Moving Average can push the XRP price out of its consolidation nest to its next bullish target. Based on the confluence of technical patterns and indicators, the dotted ascending line in the analyst’s XRP chart indicates a potential price target of $4.93. Dr. Dovetail extended his forecast, highlighting that XRP could achieve this ambitious all-time high before February 2025. The XRP price chart has also indicated a volume bar showing relatively stable activity during the cryptocurrency’s consolidation phase. Additionally, the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) at the bottom of the chart suggests that XRP may be oversold, supporting the potential for a breakout. While Dr. Dovetail acknowledged that his predictions were not financial advice, the TradingView analyst expressed confidence that the current technical setup in the XRP chart could push its price to $4.93 this year. This target would represent a 105% surge from XRP’s current market value, underscoring a significant move upward from its consolidation phase. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price To $0.000045? Here Are The Major Support And Resistances To Watch Out For Update On XRP Price Analysis According to data from CoinMarketCap, the XRP price is presently trading at $2.41, marking a noteworthy 8.79% increase over the past week. Delving deeper into its price action and ongoing consolidation phase, XRP experienced a severe downturn after it surged from $0.5 to above $2 in November 2024. Over the past few weeks, the cryptocurrency has struggled with volatility as it aims to reclaim its all-time high of $3.84, attained during the 2021 bull run.

This legal issue is making investors worried about the Bitcoin Reserve, a project he strongly supported to bring Bitcoin into the U.S. financial system. Just like how Elon Musk’s actions can move crypto prices, Trump’s sentencing could create uncertainty and Bitcoin price may drop. President-elect Donald Trump spoke on January 10 . He would like to return to the White House, but legal issues make his Bitcoin Reserve plans more difficult. President-elect Donald Trump’s legal issues Trump is on course to be back at the White House soon, but his legal issues could make it hard for him to put in place his Bitcoin Reserve concepts. These problems might have a trickle-down effect in the crypto space because the investors are keenly watching the Bitcoin Reserve and the senators that are pro-crypto are rallying behind it. President Elect Donald Trump looks set to be sentenced on January 10 after a trial in Manhattan. He has been convicted of 34 serious crimes for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 payment made to Stormy Daniels, which was intended to silence her about their alleged affair before the 2016 elections. The Bitcoin Reserve has good support from senators who support cryptocurrency and want crypto friendly rules and regulations. It makes it easier and safer for companies of any size and for individuals to buy and sell Bitcoin. The investors liked this, as they believed that Bitcoin Reserve was going to boost the demand for Bitcoin, stabilize its price, and reduce market fluctuations. Over time, it could became an important part of America’s transition into digital finance. What does this mean for the Bitcoin Reserve? Trump’s conviction is going to bring a new wave of uncertainty for the Bitcoin Reserve and the overall cryptocurrency market. Investors are now becoming increasingly concerned that Trump’s legal woes will either choke or even totally end the growth of the Bitcoin Reserve. These might be delayed or even canceled and replaced with completely new rules. Due to this uncertainty, the crypto markets might become less stable. Some may sell their Bitcoins out of fear, which will lower its value. If Trump does not support the reserve, the Bitcoin Reserve could lose its grip and fail. Its future ultimately depends on its ability to overcome legal issues and adapt to the political changes around it. The Bitcoin Reserve intended to incorporate Bitcoin into the financial system. Intial acceptance by the Trump administration had established the U.S. as a front-runner in digital assets. Everyone was busy talking about the effect of Elon Musk on the price of PEPE and Kekius cryptos, but today everyone is discussing Trump’s activities and the court cases he’s facing. M ajor issues that may arise in the country relating to elections or the news surrounding influential individuals impact crypto markets. A portion of the investors are afraid that Trump’s legal problems will influence Bitcoin Reserve, thus lowering the price of Bitcoin and creating uncertain prospects for the future of crypto. This demonstrates how influential politicians can stabilize and also support the crypto market. This could also be a time for many bettings on polymarkets, as well as many political memecoins arising. Crypto enthusiasts were optimistic about the full launch of Bitcoin Reserve. The plan included forming partnerships, investing in infrastructure, and advocating for regulations. This approach aimed to draw more investors, stabilize Bitcoin prices, and lessen market volatility, strengthening digital assets. Market Reaction Political events will always change the financial markets including the cryptocurrencies. Unforeseen political crises always result in great changes in the market since the investors react to such changes. As we know his assassination attempts, his speech on Crypto especially Bitcoin, his election victory, all caused a significant market reaction for each of these moments. Even though Trump’s sentencing is not violent, it can still confuse the market and create uncertainty. This situation may cause more volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Weak hands, which is a term for easily scared investors, might start selling their Bitcoins in fear, and prices could drop. This sell-off would weaken the confidence that Bitcoin Reserve wanted to build, making people worried about Bitcoin’s long-term future and importance. It is not clear what will happen to Bitcoin Reserve after Trump stops promoting it. It needs strong rules and support from politicians to grow and for more people to use cryptocurrency. If Trump’s imprisonment bars him from supporting the project, then the project will lose its momentum, and investors will wonder what the future of the project holds.

With new opportunities emerging daily, knowing where to focus is key. Here’s our list of the Top 5 cryptos to buy right now: BlockDAG (BDAG), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Binance Coin (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX). BlockDAG stands out for its transformative scalability. Litecoin continues to prove its reliability over time. Shiba Inu is evolving with an expanding ecosystem. Binance Coin offers unmatched utility, while Avalanche impresses with its blazing speed. Let’s explore these coins and their features in detail! 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): The Future of Fast & Scalable Blockchain Tech BlockDAG (BDAG) , a leading layer-1 blockchain project, has captured attention due to its advanced Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) architecture. This technology allows faster transactions and multiple blocks to be processed at the same time, making the network both quick and reliable while solving common blockchain issues. Due to this capability, the network’s ongoing presale has been remarkably successful, raising over $174.5 million with more than 17.6 billion coins sold, showing strong adoption. Currently priced at $0.0234 in presale batch 26, BDAG provides an affordable entry point into a project poised to deliver some of the largest gains in recent history. For context, early participants who joined BlockDAG’s presale when BDAG was priced at $0.001 in batch 1 have already achieved an impressive 2,240% ROI. This exponential growth positions BlockDAG as one of the Top 5 cryptos to buy right now. 2. Litecoin (LTC): Trusted for Everyday Use Litecoin (LTC) is considered one of the Top 5 cryptos to buy now largely due to its fast transaction speeds (2.5-minute block time), low fees, and a secure Scrypt algorithm. LTC’s capped supply of 84 million coins ensures scarcity and value retention. Recent upgrades, like MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB), enhance privacy and scalability, boosting its utility. Litecoin also remains a go-to cryptocurrency for everyday payments, gaining momentum with ETF filings and adoption in 2024. Currently trading at around $101.28, Litecoin positions itself as a leader in the evolving digital currency ecosystem. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): From Memecoin to Utility Powerhouse Shiba Inu (SHIB), an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, has evolved from its meme origins into a comprehensive ecosystem featuring tokens like LEASH and BONE, the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, and the Layer-2 solution, Shibarium. The coin is currently trading at approximately $0.000021, with a 24-hour trading volume of around $539 million. Recent developments include significant whale activity impacting on-chain metrics. Given Shiba Inu’s active community and expanding utility, this meme coin is considered among the Top 5 cryptos to buy in 2025. 4. Binance Coin (BNB): Gateway to Endless Utility Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, serving as the backbone of the Binance exchange and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). BNB offers utility in transaction fee discounts, staking, and participation in token sales. Currently trading at approximately $705.38, BNB’s market capitalization has reached $101.47 billion. Binance Coin remains a top cryptocurrency to consider on account of the introduction of new project tokens on Binance Alpha and the launch of a platform tailored for the Japanese market. Given its robust features and continuous growth, Binance Coin remains one of the top crypto projects to join now. 5. Avalanche (AVAX): A Blockchain for Next-Generation dApps Avalanche (AVAX) is a high-performance blockchain known for its low latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. Utilizing a unique consensus protocol, Avalanche offers sub-second transaction finality, making it a top choice for decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi projects. AVAX’s latest updates include Avalanche’s integration with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and cross-chain capabilities, enhancing its interoperability. AVAX is currently priced around $14, reflecting its solid market position. Quick Recap: Top 5 Cryptos to Buy Now In conclusion, each of these five crypto projects—BlockDAG (BDAG), Litecoin (LTC), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Binance Coin (BNB), and Avalanche (AVAX)—brings many strengths to the table, making them worthy of attention. Together, they represent the most promising opportunities in the market today. However, BlockDAG, with its DAG architecture, offers transformative scalability and speed and places itself at the top of the list.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 00:01:22

BREAKING: #Solana Has Achieved Quantum Resistance, per developers pic.twitter.com/BeaqdsJRAM — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) January 3, 2025 Last around $217, the Solana price has now broken above its downtrend from its mid-November highs. If it can also get above its 50DMA at $220, the door is open for a swift push higher towards $260. Crypto markets are likely to retain positive momentum ahead of incoming pro-crypto US President Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House on January 20th. The Trump administration is the most pro-crypto in history, and looks set to kickstart a new golden era for the US crypto industry and broader markets. That’s a complete 180 swivel from the outgoing Biden administration, which, a long with its anti-crypto allies in the SEC , have done everything they can to harm the industry and crypto markets. The Solana price is likely to remain heavily bid on any dips in the coming weeks as investors anticipate a bumper year of growth for crypto markets in 2025. Things could really go into overdrive if the Trump administration and Congress do push hard for the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, which would lift the entire crypto market. How High Could the Solana Price Go in 2025? As one of the leading layer-1 crypto protocols, Solana price risks remain heavily tilted towards further gains in 2025. In 2021, Solana’s best year so far since its 2020 launch, Solana saw a stunning more than 170x rally. Having already gained over 25x from its 2022 lows around $8 and reached a market cap of last around $104 billion, per CoinMarketCap , Solana is unlikely to match its 2021 rally in 2025. That said, Solana could definitely still post gains in the 4-5x region and hit the psychologically important $1000 level before this bull market is over. That might seem overly optimistic, but let’s imagine that the US does kickstart a global race to accumulate BTC via announcing a strategic reserve . That could send the BTC price at least 3x higher versus its current levels. And thanks to its higher beta to risk appetite, the Solana price could also see substantial exponential gains. Solana to $1000 pic.twitter.com/CtWJpSbrth — IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) January 2, 2025 What Are the Risks to the Bull Thesis? It’s always good to take a moment to consider the risks to the bullish investment thesis for any asset. In Solana’s case, investors must consider the same risks that could negatively impact the entire crypto market. The Fed is one risk. In December, their more hawkish-than-expected policy announcement caused a drop in risk assets, including Solana. As the US economy motors ahead in 2025, the case for further interest cuts, or any liquidity easing for that matter, is very weak right now. So anyone expecting a flood of stimulus like in 2020/2021 to power markets higher is likely to be left wanting. And in the scenario that the Fed needs to start raising interest rates again to deal with an overly hot economy, that would be a serious shock to the market. Elsewhere, what if the incoming administration fails to live up to the hype, failing to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve or generally be as pro-crypto as markets are currently expecting them to be. That could be crushing to a market that has rallied hard since Trump’s election victory on hopes for a much brighter future. But the bulls will be hoping that none of this comes to pass. And if not, its ought to be a very good year for the Solana price . Still priced only just above $220, Solana is a great candidate for best crypto to buy right now.

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 00:43:00

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s popularity vs. limited innovation Lightchain AI Jumping into LCAI Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a mainstay of the cryptocurrency market, attracting investors with its meme-driven popularity and community strength. However, in a rapidly evolving landscape, newer and more innovative projects are stealing the spotlight. Among these, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a promising contender for those looking to capitalize on early-stage growth. Priced at $0.004 in its presale, Lightchain AI offers a unique combination of cutting-edge technology and a low entry point, making it a potential candidate for a 10x profit — outshining even Dogecoin in speculative appeal. Dogecoin’s popularity vs. limited innovation Dogecoin has won the love of many. Its rise has been pushed by celebrity support, online chatter, and community excitement. But, DOGE’s need for its joke style and speculative trading brings up doubts about its lasting power as a real buy. Critics suggest that Dogecoin has limited use and ideas compared to newer blockchain projects. With little change to its tech or plan, Dogecoin’s future is unclear, depending more on how the market feels than real worth. As such, though it is popular, DOGE might not give the same big jumps in growth like it did before.

Mike Johnson of Louisiana has been re-elected as House Speaker with strong support from his Republican colleagues and President-elect Donald Trump. His victory is crucial for the cryptocurrency industry, as Johnson is a key supporter of important crypto legislation like FIT21 and opposes central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). With his leadership, the House is poised to advance favorable regulations that could significantly boost Bitcoin and other digital currencies in the U.S. financial system. Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana has been re-elected as House Speaker. Officially, he began on the first day of the 119th Congress with a strong consensus among his majority of Republican colleagues and especially after President-elect Donald Trump endorsed him. Johnson’s Victory Strengthens Crypto Support in Congress For the cryptocurrency space, this win is important because he has been one of the strongest proponents for digital currencies and the critical crypto legislation. It was an easy and relatively not very contentious path to Speakerhood for Mike Johnson. He received the needed 218 votes during the very first round of voting, easily fending off a minor challenge from Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), who chose to vote for another candidate. Further support for Johnson’s victory came from influential Republicans, including Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), the Majority Whip and a strong crypto industry supporter. Johnson’s re-election is a great breakthrough for the cryptocurrency world. He has always supported the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which is the legislation that would encourage new financial technologies, such as Bitcoin. FIT21 provides a framework that streamlines the establishment and use of digital currencies by both businesses and individuals. This approval opens up the door for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to increasingly be part of the national financial system. Mike Johnson rejects CBDCs Johnson also does not favor the issuing of CBDCs, which are e-monies issued by governments. The traditional money they held is its counterpart in digital forms. Hopes of the crypto enthusiasts for safeguarding the independence of the digital currencies become stronger with the refusal of CBDCs from Johnson. His fight for FIT21 and against CBDCs is creating the environment where the acceptance of cryptocurrencies is facilitated. That appears in the form of better regulations, increased innovation, and higher adoption of digital currencies in mainstream finance. As Speaker, Johnson can help in passing laws that will be very helpful to the crypto industry. Such laws may establish safe and regulated places where one can buy and sell their cryptocurrencies, more investors will come in, and price swings are reduced. Congress backing Johnson Several senators who take a stand for cryptocurrency strongly support Johnson’s re-election. These legislators work very closely with Johnson in advocating for legislation that not only fosters the cryptocurrency market but also creates regulations to protect consumers, prevent fraud, and encourage innovation within the cryptocurrency arena. With full backing from Trump and powerful senators, a good foundation has been set to advance crypto-friendly legislation. Trump congratulated “Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary.” The alliance would prove essential in overcoming any hurdles that may befall them as they strive to seize potential opportunities in the crypto space while fostering growth and development thereof. With Johnson returning to the position of Speaker, Important initiatives like Bitcoin Reserve, will stay on track. This is because the House will take urgent action on any issue concerning the crypto market, such as the price volatility of cryptocurrencies and a strong need for security. He places the needs of the crypto community at the forefront, which makes it an environment-friendly hub for the growth and prosperity of digital currencies. This is a big win for the cryptocurrency industry with Mike Johnson being re-elected as the House Speaker. His support for FIT21 along with his stance against CBDCs is testimony to the commitment he makes toward innovation and freedom of the digital currency that Bitcoin represents. Pro-crypto senators supporting him along with the President-elect Donald Trump, Mike Johnson is all set to facilitate the House to create fair and just rules for the crypto market. Digital finance is likely to be very much influenced under Johnson’s leadership, and that will foster growth and acceptance for cryptocurrencies within mainstream finance. Re-election not only bolsters his influence but underscores the critical need for leaders who champion crypto.

However, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are losing momentum as Bitcoin slides below $100,000. Meanwhile, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is gaining ground as its presale attracts smart money and retail investors. PCHAIN is a tokenization and real estate platform set to transform the traditional real estate industry. The real estate altcoin is tipped to outperform Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in H1 2025. Its mix of investor-friendly tokenomics and value proposition makes it the best altcoin to invest in now. Dogecoin Falters as Market Momentum Wanes A report highlighted that the appetite for meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu was high in 2024. However, Dogecoin is tanking as the market corrects in what analysts are calling a profit-taking period. An analyst claims that Dogecoin is at risk of a major crash. DOGE is trading at $0.3241, indicating a 5% in the past 24 hours. However, Dogecoin is down 23.2% in the past month, indicating heightened selling pressure. Analysts warn that DOGE could slide below $0.23 in Q1 2025 and its comeback will require stronger catalysts. Despite its massive November rally, Dogecoin failed to reach a new peak. PCHAIN to Rise Exponentially in 2025 PCHAIN is positioned to be one of the biggest performers in 2025. It has already gained momentum after raising over $1 million during the ongoing presale. Priced at just $0.011 in its presale phase, early investors are in a prime position to capitalize on massive growth. PCHAIN’s core appeal lies in its innovative approach to real estate tokenization. By offering fractional ownership, the platform makes it easier for investors to gain exposure to the real estate market, democratizing access to property investments. This unique model opens the real estate market to a broader audience. More importantly, retail investors can build life-changing wealth in the real estate market. PropiChain is winning the hearts of investors by incorporating AI. With AI-powered market analysis tools, the platform provides its users with invaluable insights into market trends. This offers them a competitive advantage, making it easy for them to outperform the market. The real estate altcoin also uses AI for automating smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries and manual verification. This makes real estate transactions faster and more efficient. PropiChain has gone the extra mile to secure the safety of its users and investors. The platform had its smart contracts independently audited by BlockAudit. This audit adds a layer of trust and transparency. PCHAIN is also tapping into the metaverse to offer virtual property tours, staging, and meetings. This feature allows investors to view properties remotely, saving time and money. Additionally, PCHAIN uses AI-based automated valuation models to ensure accurate property appraisals for buyers and sellers. Shiba Inu Tanks, Gears for Further Decline Shiba Inu has experienced a 32.4% drop in just one month. This reflects a broader decline in the meme coin market. The correction extends to other meme coins such as Dogecoin. Analysts predict both Shiba Inu could drop an additional 20% in value by Q1 2025, as market interest wanes and speculative trading slows. However, Shiba Inu and Dogecoin could turn things around if the highly-coveted altcoin season arrives sooner. Savvy Investors are Joing PCHAIN’s Presale at $0.011 With meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu losing their momentum PropiChain is shaping up to be an investment of a lifetime. The project has great tokenomics and incentives such as staking rewards of up to 225% APR. PropiChain is on course to $1, marking nearly 9,000% growth in Q1 2025. To bolster its credibility, PCHAIN scored a CoinMarketCap listing. Follow the money and invest in PCHAIN. Join PropiChain’s presale today to create generational wealth and watch a $1,000 investment yield $100K in Q1 2025.

The premiere crypto has demonstrated remarkable success as it ushers in 2025. Registering solid numbers in the last few weeks, analysts have high hopes that it can make further breakthroughs. In fact, based on latest research, Bitcoin has surpassed conventional asset classes such as gold, cementing the optimism behind the coin. The digital coin’s success this year is unsurprising, attributable to several advantageous market conditions, including Donald Trump’s victory in the recent US elections.

According to a report from Creative Planning, and from a post on Twitter/X by Charlie Bilello, Bitcoin’s performance dwarfed the results of other asset classes, with gold offering returns of just 26%. The same data shows the Nasdaq 100 gained 25%, US large caps 24%, mid-caps 13%, and convertible bonds 10%. Although proving showing decent numbers, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset with dramatic price swings. With the exception of Long Duration Treasuries, every major asset finished higher in 2024 with Bitcoin leading the way for the second straight year.https://t.co/l5IYmkf6Ih pic.twitter.com/TyStoT73rp — Charlie Bilello (@charliebilello) January 1, 2025 Bitcoin Edges Gold And Other US Indexes Although Bitcoin has received a few criticisms and was the subject of regulatory actions, it remains a top-performing asset class. Since 2011, BTC has led all other asset classes, except for at least three years where it yielded negative returns to holders. For example, in 2018, Bitcoin’s yield was at -73%. But most of the time, Bitcoin was a consistent performer, and there were even some instances when yields topped 1,000%. According to the same chart, Bitcoin even offered yields of 1,437% in 2011, even beating long-term treasuries with a “modest” 34%. There were instances when Bitcoin’s yield disappointed its holders and investors. If we check the asset’s yield this year, we’ll discover that it’s lower than last year’s 156% return. Last year, Bitcoin was also the top performer among major asset classes, also beating gold. Bitcoin Shows Strength, But Volatility Remains While most of the past 14 years have seen great performance of Bitcoin against other asset classes, its volatility still raises questions. Owning Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies always has hazards related to erratic price swings and even policy announcements.

In a new post on the social media platform X to this 172,200 followers, Zeberg says WIF could leap to the $19 range. “Just before the large run of BTC in November we saw the same technical strength as we currently see in WIF – Positive Divergence in RSI – MACD about to Cross in a Bullish manner – RVGI moving higher All this while price has been pushing into a Descending Wedge – in larger wave 2. TRANSLATION: WIF is about to explode higher in larger wave 3 – in an extended move which may reach as high as 18-19 USD in this next move!” Source: Henrik Zeberg/X WIF is trading for $2.02 at time of writing, up 13% in the last 24 hours. A move to $19 would represent a percentage increase of approximately 840%. Yesterday, Zeberg said the crypto market is suddenly flashing bullish for altcoins while warning of worsening macro conditions. “We have had the first initial push in wave one of the BTC Dominance Index. Hardly noticeable! It will be in wave three (which starts now) that we really see the big push in altcoins. And it only ends after another three waves from here in wave three, wave four, wave five.

The famed investor and head of Duquesne Family Office sold all of the firm’s shares of Nvidia (NVDA) last year, along with nearly all of the firm’s stake in Palantir (PLTR). Now, Druckenmiller is beginning to pour some of the firm’s massive cash stockpile into Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), buying 1,427,950 shares worth about $30.3 million, reports the Motley Fool. The stock surged more than 100% in 2024, as the company settled opioid litigation and reported strong growth after centering its efforts on brand-name drugs. As of Q3 2024, the top holdings at Duquesne Family Office include Natera (NTRA) worth $452 million, Coupang (CPNG) valued at $287 million, Coherent (COHR) at $264 million, Woodward (WWD) at $181 million and Seagate Technology (STX) at $179 million. In a recent interview with Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Druckenmiller said his top concern is whether the Federal Reserve started cutting rates too soon. “When this whole inflationary episode started, and I’d say two years ago or a year and a half ago, I was very confident that inflation was going to come down, which I was right on. But I was worried about the economy, which I was completely wrong on. You can take this with a grain of salt since I had one right and one wrong there, I’ve switched to being more worried about inflation going forward than the economy itself. I’m a little worried that the Fed has declared victory too early. I don’t have conviction like I had in 2021 that inflation was going to go up, that’s when the money supply was growing 40% and all sorts of things were happening. But I also don’t have conviction that they’ve snuffed this thing out and won the battle.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

But not all coins are created equal, and if you’re searching for the best coins for exponential returns , you’ve got to know where to look. Among the standouts are Qubetics, Solana, and Near Protocol. These aren’t just buzzworthy projects—they’re reshaping the future of blockchain innovation. Let’s start with Qubetics, the rising star in the crypto world that’s taking innovation to the next level. Currently in its 15th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $8.5 million, sold more than 395 million $TICS tokens, and amassed a community of over 13,000 token holders. Analysts are predicting a price surge to $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, and it’s no wonder why. Why Qubetics Is a Game-Changer At the heart of Qubetics’ appeal is its non-custodial wallet , a solution to the problems caused by traditional, third-party-dependent wallets. Centralised wallets often come with risks like limited access, privacy concerns, and regulatory complications. Qubetics flips the script by offering users full control of their assets in a secure, user-friendly interface. This blockchain powerhouse is solving real-world issues with its non-custodial wallet and a game-changing partnership with SWFT Blockchain. Qubetics is all about putting control and security back in users’ hands, while delivering a seamless, cross-chain experience that’s poised to redefine decentralised finance. What makes Qubetics a true standout is its emphasis on tackling major blockchain pain points. Whether it’s scalability, security risks, or the limitations of traditional wallets, Qubetics has the solutions. And with its cutting-edge tools like the non-custodial wallet and its innovative collaboration with SWFT Blockchain, it’s not just keeping up with industry demands—it’s setting the pace. For investors, this means a rare opportunity to get in early on a project that’s built for longevity and growth.This blockchain powerhouse is solving real-world issues with its non-custodial wallet and a game-changing partnership with SWFT Blockchain. Qubetics is all about putting control and security back in users’ hands, while delivering a seamless, cross-chain experience that’s poised to redefine decentralised finance. And then there’s the partnership with SWFT Blockchain, which takes things up a notch. This collaboration has resulted in a wallet that supports seamless, lightning-fast transactions across multiple blockchains. Whether you’re swapping assets or managing a diverse portfolio, the wallet’s cross-chain functionality and advanced encryption protocols ensure a smooth, secure experience. Add to that the impressive stats: $8.5 million raised during its presale, a token price of $0.0414, and projections of a $10-$15 value after the mainnet launch. Qubetics is poised for exponential growth, making it a prime pick for investors looking for serious returns. For anyone interested in learning more, you can check out this video here. Solana: The Speed Demon of Blockchain When it comes to speed, Solana is the undisputed king. Known for its ultra-fast transaction capabilities, Solana handles over 65,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the world. This speed, combined with its low transaction fees, has made Solana a favourite for decentralised applications, NFTs, and more. Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) mechanism is its secret sauce. By integrating timestamps into its consensus process, Solana delivers unparalleled efficiency without sacrificing security. It’s no surprise that developers and projects flock to this platform to build scalable, high-performance applications. For investors, Solana’s growth potential is massive. Imagine putting $100,000 into SOL today. With ongoing adoption in DeFi and gaming, as well as its robust ecosystem of projects, Solana is positioned for significant price growth in the coming years. Near Protocol: The Scalable Innovator Let’s not overlook Near Protocol, a blockchain that’s making waves with its focus on scalability and user-friendliness. Built with developers in mind, Near’s ecosystem is all about lowering barriers to blockchain adoption. Near’s innovative sharding technology ensures the network remains fast and efficient, even as it scales to meet growing demand. This scalability makes it an ideal platform for everything from DeFi projects to enterprise applications. Add in its developer-friendly tools and intuitive interface, and it’s clear why Near is gaining traction. For investors, Near Protocol represents a long-term opportunity. Its focus on usability and scalability positions it as a leader in the next wave of blockchain adoption. A $100,000 investment in NEAR today could yield significant returns as the platform continues to expand and attract high-profile partnerships. Final Thoughts The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities like these don’t wait. With Qubetics’ groundbreaking wallet t and presale momentum, Solana’s speed, and Near Protocol’s scalability, these are the coins to watch in 2025. Don’t miss your chance to invest in projects that are not just surviving but thriving in the ever-evolving world of blockchain. Get in now and ride the wave of exponential returns into the future.

This will enable users to begin receiving repayments. The FTX Debtors Plan of Reorganization is effective today, January 3, 2025. Today is also the initial distribution record date for holders of allowed claims in the Plan's Convenience Classes. Separate record and payment dates for other classes of claims will be announced later. — FTX (@FTX_Official) January 3, 2025 In a post on X on January 3 , FTX debtors cautioned users requesting funds to be vigilant against phishing emails that appear to come from the exchange. Customers must submit claims to receive reimbursements within 60 days To be eligible for reimbursement, customers must have submitted a claim via FTX’s official website. The exchange stated that the first group of users should receive their payments within 60 days. Under the company’s plan, an initial set of “convenience classes” will be prioritized for repayment, including those claiming $50,000 or less. The plan, which was approved in October, indicated that 98% of users could expect to receive 119% of the declared value of their funds. The repayment process could mark the final chapter in the FTX saga, which began with the exchange’s bankruptcy filing in November 2022 and included the imprisonment of several executives for their role in defrauding users. FTX users criticize the reorganization plan while legal outcomes unfold Still, not all FTX users support the plan. Many creditors have criticized the approach, particularly the decision to base reimbursements on the prices of cryptocurrencies held by the exchange at the time of its bankruptcy in 2022. Bitcoin’s price has surged by more than 400% since then, reaching $98,697 at publication. Among the exchanges’ executives indicted in connection with the exchange’s collapse, only two avoided prison: former engineering director Nishad Singh and co-founder Gary Wang. Former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, and former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame have all been sentenced to prison terms, although SBF has appealed his conviction. In December, crypto firms BitGo and Kraken announced they would assist in distributing recovery funds to FTX users.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

These cryptocurrencies are accessible and provide a considerable upside for those who delve into projects backed by solid fundamentals and distinct uses. This selection, ranging from decentralized e-commerce systems to popular meme coins, each brings a unique value. Highlighted here are Web3Bay, Pandoshi, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu, all priced below $0.5, focusing on their potential for growth, technological strengths, and practical applications. Continue reading to see how these choices might align with your crypto interests. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY): Transforming Decentralized E-Commerce Web3Bay leads as the top crypto under $0.5 with potential 100x returns, aimed at changing the dynamics of how digital assets are bought, sold, and interacted with online. It is built on blockchain technology, enhancing user ownership, transparency, and safety, setting a new standard for online marketplaces. Online Shopping Evolution: Web3Bay addresses the drawbacks of traditional platforms by eliminating excessive fees, central control, and security breaches. Its blockchain foundation gives users complete control over their data and enables worldwide transactions without traditional banks. This method not only improves accessibility but also builds trust among participants. Tokenomics and Growth Prospects: The 3BAY token underpins Web3Bay’s ecosystem. Out of a total of 5 billion tokens, 40% are reserved for a 28-stage presale. Early participants gain from gradual price increases, encouraging early involvement. Presently, in presale stage 2, priced at $0.00345, the token has amassed over $254,000, with the potential to hit a market price of $0.1959 swiftly. Blending Traditional and Decentralized Commerce: Web3Bay merges conventional and decentralized commerce. By supporting mainstream payment methods like PayPal along with cryptocurrencies, it smooths the transition for both enthusiasts and newcomers, positioning Web3Bay as a front-runner in opening up decentralized marketplaces. Web3Bay, with its solid infrastructure and user-focused design, is poised for significant growth, marking it as a prime choice for those eyeing substantial returns. 2. Pandoshi (PAMBO): Scalability Meets Affordability in Crypto Pandoshi is emerging as one of the top crypto gems under $0.5 with a potential for 100x returns, using a Layer-2 network and Proof of Stake for consensus. Priced at only $0.008 in its public presale, it presents an exceptional growth opportunity. Experts suggest that Pandoshi might climb to $10 by 2025’s end, a substantial gain for early backers. Its focus on scalability, sustainability, and low-cost transactions positions it as a strong candidate in the blockchain sector. Also, Pandoshi’s emphasis on working with other networks boosts its appeal. For those looking for a low-priced entry into a project with vast upside, Pandoshi represents an exciting chance worth considering. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Utility-Driven Meme Coin Initially started as a playful project, Dogecoin has grown into a well-recognized cryptocurrency supported by a strong community. Trading below $0.50, it offers an approachable option for experienced and new crypto users alike. Currently, Dogecoin is trading around $0.44, placing it among the top crypto under $0.5 for those looking for a stable and familiar option. The coin’s broad acceptance for payments and tipping continues to enhance its appeal. As general interest in cryptocurrencies expands, Dogecoin’s value as a stable investment grows. It has demonstrated its resilience and capacity to deliver returns, making it a solid choice for those pursuing steady growth. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Low-Cost Entry with Vast Potential Often dubbed the ‘Dogecoin Killer,’ Shiba Inu combines affordability with a community-driven approach. Priced well below $0.50, SHIB offers a low-risk entry into the cryptocurrency market. Currently, Shiba Inu trades at approximately $0.00002171, underlining its accessibility as one of the top crypto under $0.5 with significant return potential. The Shiba Inu ecosystem, including its decentralized exchange ShibaSwap, provides practical utility to the token. Although known as a meme coin, which brings higher volatility, it also opens opportunities for impressive returns. Those intrigued by speculative growth alongside active development might find Shiba Inu an attractive addition to their portfolio. Final Reflections Identifying the top crypto under $0.5 with the potential for 100x returns demands careful consideration of each project’s fundamentals, use cases, and market stance. Projects like Web3Bay lead with innovative approaches to decentralized commerce, while Pandoshi, Dogecoin, and Shiba Inu each offer unique benefits. Diversifying across these promising options could enhance growth prospects while balancing risks.

In a statement shared with Cointelegraph on Jan. 2, Tether announced Hoegner’s retirement and confirmed Hilliard as the new general counsel. “Michael’s deep understanding of both companies’ operations, coupled with his strategic approach to legal and regulatory challenges, has been critical to advancing both Tether and Bitfinex’s mission,” the company stated. Uncertainty Around USDT Compliance in Europe The leadership change comes as Tether faces ambiguity regarding its compliance with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which took effect on Dec. 30. The new rules have left stablecoin issuers, including Tether, in a gray area. “No regulators have explicitly stated that USDT isn’t compliant, but this does not mean that it is,” Juan Ignacio Ibañez, a member of the Technical Committee of the MiCA Crypto Alliance, told Cointelegraph. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has not clarified whether USDT is considered a restricted stablecoin under MiCA. While Coinbase delisted USDT in mid-December to comply with MiCA, the stablecoin continues to trade widely in the EU as exchanges await further guidance. USDT Market Cap Declines USDT’s market cap dropped from $138.8 billion on Dec. 30, 2024, to a weekly low of $136.9 billion on Jan. 1, marking its steepest decline since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Despite this, USDT remains dominant in the stablecoin market, with a share exceeding 65% in the $210 billion sector. Additionally, on Dec. 30, Tether transferred nearly $780 million worth of Bitcoin into its corporate reserves, aligning with its commitment to allocate up to 15% of net profits toward Bitcoin purchases.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 02:13:47

Dogecoin Whales Have Just Increased Holdings By Around $1.08 Billion As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, DOGE whales have been participating in buying activities recently. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution” from the analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of the Dogecoin supply a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are placed into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are carrying in their balance. In the context of the current topic, the whale group is of interest, which comprises of the holders who own between 10 million and 1 billion DOGE. At the current exchange rate of the memecoin, the upper bound of the range converts to $3.5 million and the lower one to $350 million. Thus, the only investors who would qualify as whales would be among the largest of entities on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Sinks To Lowest Since FTX Crash: Bottom In? Large holdings naturally mean more power in the market, so the whales can occupy a key role in the asset’s price action. This makes these holders’ supply worth keeping an eye on, as any changes in it may end up reflecting in the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the Supply Distribution for the Dogecoin whales over the past month or so: As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin whales took their supply to a high at the start of December, but then they reversed course toward a gradual selloff. The slow distribution suddenly turned into a sharp plunge in the indicator during the second half of the month, alongside which the memecoin’s price also suffered a notable drawdown. Given the timing, it’s probable the former was at least in part responsible for the latter. After one last selling push around Christmas, the whales finally stopped selling, but they also didn’t begin accumulation as their supply showed a sideways trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Decline Continues: Is $86,800 The Level To Watch? This has changed in the last couple of days, as these humongous entities have added a notable amount to their holdings. More specifically, the whales have purchased a total of $1.08 billion worth of coins during this surge in the metric. Once again, the trend in the whale Supply Distribution appears to be translating to Dogecoin’s value, which is displaying a recovery rally. It now remains to be seen whether the whales will keep supporting this run or if they would take some quick profits, potentially killing the momentum. DOGE Price Dogecoin briefly surpassed the $0.350 level earlier in the day, but the coin has since seen a small retrace to $0.349.

While Dogecoin’s initial popularity was meme-driven, its increasing adoption and expanding use cases are making it a more compelling option for crypto enthusiasts. However, it’s not the only digital asset turning heads the Lightchain AI Presale is now live, offering an exciting opportunity for early investors looking to get in on the next big thing. Analysts suggest Dogecoin could see notable growth through 2030, fueled by further integration into mainstream platforms and enhanced utility. For those exploring long-term crypto investments, Dogecoin and emerging projects like Lightchain AI present intriguing prospects in the ever-evolving digital asset space. Dogecoin Price Predictions for 2024-2030 Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced significant price fluctuations, with its value influenced by factors such as market sentiment, technological developments, and macroeconomic trends. As of December 2024, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.31, reflecting a substantial increase from earlier in the year. Analysts offer varying predictions for DOGE’s future value. 2025- Estimates suggest an average price around $0.248, with potential highs reaching $0.77, contingent on technological advancements and broader cryptocurrency market trends. Crypto News 2030- Projections range from approximately $1.05 to $23.64, depending on factors such as increased utility, widespread adoption, and market dynamics. These forecasts are speculative and subject to change based on market volatility and evolving industry developments. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Is Dogecoin a Worthy New Year’s Investment? Like with any buy, it’s͏ key to do deep study and think about possible risks before picking Dogecoin as a new year’s buy. While DOGE has shown big growth in last years, its worth stays very changeable and open to market trends. But, trade pros say DOGE might keep growing till 2030 as more people start using it and it joins big platforms. Also new plans like Lightchain AI give special chances for first buyers who want to mix up their crypto stocks. Why Lightchain AI Could Be a Game-Changer for Crypto Investors Lightchain AI could redefine crypto investing in 2024 with its innovative fusion of blockchain and artificial intelligence. Unlike many hype-driven tokens, Lightchain AI focuses on real-world utility, exemplified by its introduction of Proof of Intelligence (PoI). This groundbreaking concept leverages AI for decentralized decision-making, setting it apart from speculative assets. The presale success of its token, priced at just $0.004, has drawn attention, offering investors a ground-floor opportunity. Lightchain AI is already being compared to leading cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ripple, thanks to its unique technology and long-term growth potential. By addressing practical applications in a growing decentralized AI market, it positions itself as more than just another crypto. For investors seeking diversification, Lightchain AI represents a promising, forward-thinking addition to a portfolio.

With so many choices, it’s no wonder investors are constantly on the lookout for options that balance reliability and strong growth potential. 2025 is shaping up to be a year of exciting opportunities for those who know where to look. The digital currency space has grown beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering a variety of innovative projects tailored to different needs. One standout is Qubetics ($TICS), a game-changer tackling real-life issues that other cryptocurrencies haven’t been able to resolve. Its applications in cross-border transactions and the way it connects different blockchains make it a unique option. With its presale already creating a buzz, let’s dive deeper into Qubetics and other strong contenders in this list. 1. Qubetics and Its Revolutionary Role in Cross-Border Transactions Qubetics has emerged as one of the most talked-about blockchain projects this year, and for good reason. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it unites leading blockchains into a single platform, simplifying transactions for individuals and businesses. For example, imagine a small e-commerce business in the US wanting to sell products internationally. Qubetics enables seamless cross-border transactions with minimal fees and faster processing times, saving both time and money for users. Its presale has reached the 15th stage, with over $8.5 million raised and more than 395 million $TICS tokens sold. The presale stages only last seven days each, and prices increase by 10% every Sunday at midnight. This mechanism ensures an upward momentum in token value, creating a unique incentive for early adopters. At its current price of $0.0414, Qubetics is attracting attention from over 13,000 token holders. Why this coin made it to this list: Qubetics is not just solving problems; it’s laying the groundwork for smoother, faster, and more inclusive financial transactions across borders. Its innovative model and rising presale numbers make it one of the best cryptos to buy now. 2. Avalanche Promises Faster and Cheaper Transactions Avalanche is another strong contender in 2025, known for its ability to support decentralised applications with unmatched scalability. The platform stands out for its subnets feature, allowing developers to create custom blockchain networks that can work together seamlessly. Avalanche’s focus on energy efficiency also gives it a modern appeal, especially as the world shifts toward greener solutions. Its fast transaction speeds and lower costs make it a popular choice for businesses and developers looking for practical blockchain solutions. Analysts are optimistic about Avalanche’s long-term growth as it continues to attract a variety of high-profile partnerships and development projects. Why this coin made it to this list: Avalanche’s commitment to efficiency and innovation puts it on the radar of investors seeking reliable platforms with room for expansion. 3. Polkadot Enables a Future of Interconnected Blockchains Polkadot is gaining traction for its unique approach to blockchain interoperability. Its multi-chain technology allows different blockchains to communicate and share data, creating an interconnected ecosystem that benefits developers and users alike. This innovation addresses one of the biggest challenges in the cryptocurrency space: the lack of seamless communication between networks. Polkadot’s parachain auctions and expanding ecosystem continue to generate excitement in the crypto community. With projects and applications thriving within its network, Polkadot positions itself as a long-term player with significant potential. Why this coin made it to this list: Polkadot’s groundbreaking technology and expanding influence make it a solid option for investors looking for the best cryptos to buy now. 4.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 03:23:00

Moreover, Remittix is attracting significant attention with projections of a 2,000% gain this quarter with insiders believing it could surpass top crypto coins like Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) in ROI potential. Interestingly, Remittix is transforming world payments with its creative ideas while Solana notes positive breakouts and Ripple inches near expected price milestones. Read on to find out why analysts favour Remittix over Solana and Ripple. Solana (SOL) Records Bullish Breakout Showing amazing resilience despite recent bearish trends, Solana is still among the promising altcoins to watch this quarter. As CoinMarketCap data shows, the Solana price has jumped more than 12% over the previous week, breaking out from the consolidation between $200 and $182. Although the Solana price dropped more than 10% in the previous month, community sentiment is still bullish and investors are expectant of a robust comeback. Though trading more than 20% below its all-time high (ATH) of $263, Solana’s future is still bright; many anticipate a possible retest of its ATH this Q1. The Solana price chart, which shows the altcoin respecting a bullish trendline over the past year, accentuates the hope even further. The technical indicators —buy signals from the Moving Averages and MACD—are suggestive of bullish momentum developing. Though some short-term volatility may still be in action, the Momentum Oscillator and CCI are flashing sell signals on the Solana price chart, hence caution is advised. Will Ripple (XRP) Hit New Heights in 2025? Rising by more than 10% , the Ripple price has recovered during the previous week from the $2 support zone. This upward trend drove the Ripple price to the $2.4 resistance, therefore restoring investor hope. The XRP community is still somewhat optimistic even though the past month was bearish and the Ripple price chart shows a drop of almost 5%. Driven by the expected altcoin season, analysts are sure that XRP is one of the top altcoins that could rally beyond its all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 in 2025. For Ripple (XRP), technical signals show a mixed picture. The Momentum Oscillator, MACD, and Moving Averages on the Ripple price chart exhibit strong purchase signs; the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) advises caution with sell signals. Still, the long run is bright since many XRP holders are looking forward to the much-awaited $10 mark. Ripple (XRP) keeps proving to be among the promising altcoins to watch for the next significant rally as investor sentiment remains strong. Remittix (RTX) Is Transforming Global Payments Remittix provides businesses with a smooth approach to including cryptocurrencies in their payment systems. Easy access to the user-friendly Remittix Pay API helps companies facilitate quick, safe, and affordable transactions. The creative Remittix Checkout solution also lets businesses take crypto payments for goods and services free from direct wallet transaction costs. Moreover, Remittix is leading in the PayFi market as this innovative solution offers unmatched flexibility allowing users to cash out in more than 50 crypto pairs and over 30 fiat currencies. Currently valued at just $0.0172 during its presale, the deflationary RTX coin forms the core of this groundbreaking platform. RTX is among the best cryptos to invest in for explosive future gains given the limited supply and growing demand for cross-border crypto solutions. As companies and individuals start using Remittix’s safe, quick, open payment systems, analysts estimate a huge growth for the platform. Meanwhile, Remittix has great potential in the rapidly expanding PayFi market whether your business is trying to modernize payment systems or you are an investor looking for high-growth prospects. Remittix (RTX) Is Set To Outpace Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) Although Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) display potential for notable gains, Remittix’s (RTX) revolutionary ideas in worldwide payments along with its cheap presale value of merely $0.0172 set it out among the top cryptocurrencies. Far faster than its rivals, analysts estimate a meteoric 2,000% increase in Q1 2025. RTX has unparalleled potential in the vibrant PayFi sector, whether your company is ready to welcome innovative payment options or you are a smart investor looking for high ROI. Early adoption of Remittix could be your pass to amazing gains in this altcoin season as demand for cross-border crypto solutions increases.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted several critical metrics that could signal further bullish momentum for the leading cryptocurrency as the market begins to recover. Bitcoin Price Surges Amid Coinbase Premium Index Low One of the significant indicators discussed by Martinez is the Coinbase Premium Index, which recently hit -0.23%, its lowest point in two years. This index measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges. A negative premium suggests that US-based investors may be less willing to pay a premium for Bitcoin, but the current rebound could indicate a shift toward growing institutional interest in the asset. Related Reading: Prepare For A Solana Sell-Off: How Grayscale’s 2025 Unlocks Could Shake The Market Martinez also noted that the recent uptick in the Bitcoin price comes amid a notable withdrawal trend, with over 48,000 BTC—valued at more than $4.5 billion—pulled from exchanges in the past week. This trend indicates a bullish sentiment among investors, despite a brief price correction that occurred late last year. Despite these positive signals, Martinez cautions that Bitcoin is at a crucial juncture. He emphasized the importance of sustaining a close above the 50-day moving average (MA), currently just above $96,000. A failure to maintain this level could lead to a potential downward correction. Conversely, a sustained close above the 50-day MA could signal the end of the recent correction and confirm a more robust bullish trend. Strong Upward Move Expected After Wave Three Breakout In addition to Martinez’s insights, the Elliot Wave Academy has provided a technical analysis of the recent Bitcoin price movements, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is currently in the fourth wave of a larger bullish cycle. The academy’s analysis indicates that after a powerful breakout from a price channel, Bitcoin has successfully surpassed the ideal level of wave three, which may signal a strong upward move. The fourth wave, according to their analysis, is characterized by a sideways pattern following the sharp rise of wave three. The potential correction zones for this wave have been identified, and should these levels be breached, the next upward wave could target a Bitcoin price range between $117,475.70 and $138,058.37. These figures represent major bullish targets that could attract further investment and drive Bitcoin’s price higher. Related Reading: Dogecoin Recovery In Sight: Strong Support Hints At Bullish 2025 All around, as the Bitcoin price continues its upward trajectory, the combination of significant withdrawals from exchanges, a low Coinbase Premium Index, and positive Elliott Wave analysis paints a compelling picture for the cryptocurrency’s future. However, investors should remain vigilant, keeping an eye on critical price levels that could determine the market’s next move. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is trading at $98,320.

The firm explained in a statement that it plans to obtain the perpetual preferred stock by converting its class A common stock, paying a cash dividend, redeeming shares, or a combination of these. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy is exploring various strategies to ensure adequate funds for crypto purchase MicroStrategy is exploring different strategies to raise money for its Bitcoin stocking endeavor. It is currently planning to raise $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income instruments. This plan has been implemented recently, leading to a sustained Bitcoin buying spree through senior convertible notes and debt. The perpetual preferred stock offering, the latest strategy the firm is exploring to strengthen its balance sheet and acquire more Bitcoin, will begin implementation in Q1 2025. Yet MicroStrategy explained that it reserves the rights and has the sole authority to choose whether to proceed with and consummate the offering based on market status and other conditions. The perpetual preferred stock offering is among the most privileged MicroStrategy class A common stock. If the company faces bankruptcy or liquidation, its holders will be given priority. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin reserve is valued at $43.9 billion According to Bitcoin Treasuries , the business intelligence firm has 446,400 Bitcoins in its reserve, valued at $43.9 billion. In 2024, the firm improved its Bitcoin purchasing power, acquiring 257,250 BTC, making it the highest-buying year ever. The statistics show that the firm’s 446,400 Bitcoins were bought at an average price of $62,500. This implies that MicroStrategy is up 57.2% on its Bitcoin investment. Michael Saylor, the firm’s executive chairman and co-founder, initiated the Bitcoin investment strategy, paving the way for corporate Bitcoin adoption worldwide. The co-founder’s Bitcoin strategy has positively impacted MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares. The shares have surged 13.2% on Jan. 3 to $339.6, which translates to a 438% rise from last year. MSTR has marginally fallen 0.19% since the firm’s perpetual preferred stock offering plan was announced in after-hours.

BTFD Coin is making waves with its explosive presale success, drawing attention from seasoned investors and crypto newcomers alike. Meanwhile, Neiro and Degen are redefining the potential of meme coins, pushing boundaries in gaming and utility. The synergy of these projects is creating massive buzz, with investors scrambling to snag their slice of the pie before these tokens hit the big leagues. Meme coins, once seen as playful novelties, have matured into serious investment opportunities. Over the years, we’ve witnessed projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu climb astronomical heights. Now, BTFD Coin is taking this trend further with its innovative Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, lucrative staking rewards, and a robust community-centric approach. With meme coins proving their staying power, January 2025 is the month to pick your winners. Let’s dive into the top contenders. BTFD Coin: Leading the Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin is not just another token; it’s a movement. Short for “Buy the F***ing Dip,” this coin is the epitome of riding market waves with confidence. BTFD’s presale performance has been nothing short of phenomenal, raising over $4.8 million so far and selling over 62 billion coins to more than 7000 holders. Starting at just $0.000004, the current presale price has soared to $0.000142 in Stage 13. Post-presale, analysts predict a listing price of $0.0006, which spells incredible gains for savvy investors. The appeal of BTFD goes beyond numbers. Its ecosystem features a captivating P2E game where players earn rewards while immersing themselves in a vibrant community. BTFD Coin has launched the full version of its P2E Game, which allows users to play and earn through it. Add a referral program and staking rewards into the mix, and it’s clear why BTFD is stealing the spotlight. This blend of fun, profit, and community power sets BTFD apart in a crowded market. Neiro: Revolutionising Utility in Meme Coins Neiro isn’t your run-of-the-mill meme coin. It’s carving a niche by seamlessly blending artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. While meme coins often rely on hype, Neiro’s foundation is rooted in innovation. The coin’s flagship product, an AI-driven content generator, has become a favourite among digital creators and marketers, offering them tools to enhance productivity and creativity. Unlike many meme coins that fade after their initial buzz, Neiro’s utility ensures longevity. Its staking mechanism, paired with AI-enhanced insights, allows users to maximise their holdings. The team’s commitment to transparency and development has fostered trust, making Neiro a serious contender in the meme coin space. Neiro’s market trajectory is equally impressive. Its presale phases saw steady growth, with its value increasing tenfold since its inception. Analysts are bullish, projecting continued momentum into 2025. For those seeking a meme coin with substance, Neiro’s combination of technology and community appeal makes it a must-watch. Degen: The Meme Coin Gaming Powerhouse Degen is taking meme coins into uncharted territory with its immersive gaming ecosystem. Known for its catchphrase “Degen life,” this token appeals to crypto enthusiasts who live for the thrill. But Degen’s not just about vibes—it’s delivering tangible gaming experiences that are drawing in hordes of players and investors. The centrepiece of Degen’s appeal is its multiplayer battle arena game, where players can earn Degen tokens while competing for glory. It’s a high-energy mix of entertainment and financial incentives. Add to that its NFT marketplace, and you’ve got a project with serious staying power. Players can trade in-game assets, boosting both engagement and the coin’s utility. Degen’s presale journey has been equally thrilling.

Once that’s done, input the amount of BTFD you’d like to buy, review the price, and hit “Buy Now.” Confirm the transaction in your wallet, and you’re all set. Easy as pie, right? Why Meme Coins Thrive in Economic Chaos The global economy has always been a rollercoaster. Take the 1973 crash, for instance. While it rattled markets worldwide, savvy investors used the chaos to their advantage, scooping up undervalued assets. The lesson? Buying the dip can turn turmoil into opportunity. Meme coins like BTFD, Neiro, and Degen thrive in such environments. Their community-driven nature and potential for high returns make them attractive during market downturns. In 2024, as traditional markets waver, meme coins are proving to be a beacon for investors seeking alternative opportunities. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Neiro, and Degen represent the best meme coins to hold in January 2025. Each brings unique strengths to the table—from BTFD’s presale success and innovative ecosystem to Neiro’s tech-driven utility and Degen’s gaming revolution.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 04:08:00

This week, Fartcoin hit an all-time high (ATH) of $1.60, following a remarkable 70% rally. Despite the excitement, some analysts predict a possible pullback before the next big surge. Fartcoin Hits New ATH Fartcoin, known for its humor-driven branding and ties to viral trends, stands out as a Solana meme coin with a loyal community. While it doesn’t have standout features, its price performance has been exceptional. Since its launch in October, the token’s value has skyrocketed, growing 700% in just one month and pushing its market cap to $1.48 billion. Adding to the momentum, Coinglass data shows that Open Interest (OI) for Fartcoin surged 22% this week, reaching $182.4 million. This influx of interest has been a key driver behind the recent price rally. AI Meme Coins Are Taking Over As traditional meme coins like DOGE and SHIB struggle to regain their past success, newer tokens like Fartcoin and AI16Z are gaining the spotlight. AI16Z, another Solana-based token, saw a huge 176% price surge in a week and now has a market cap of $2.17 billion. Fartcoin is currently the fifth-largest AI meme coin on Solana Network, and if the bullish trend continues, it could join AI16Z in the $2 billion market cap club. Other AI-themed tokens, like Freysa AI (93% growth) and Zerebro (82% growth), are also making strong gains. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DOGE Whale’s $145 Million Bet on Dogecoin, What’s Next? , Can Fartcoin Reach $2?

Analysts believe the token could reach $2 if it continues to break key resistance levels around $1.67. However, its current position above the Bollinger Bands Indicator suggests it may be overbought, indicating a potential price correction. And, if buyers stay strong, the token might reach $2.

As the flagship crypto retests key levels, some analyst shared their predictions for the 2025 bull market and BTC’s performance. Related Reading: Solana-Based Pump.Fun Records $15 Million Daily Revenue As Memecoin Mania Continues Bitcoin Correction Close To An End? Over the last three days, Bitcoin has slowly climbed back to the $96,000 level, briefly trading near the $98,000 mark on Thursday afternoon. Last week, the flagship crypto lost this key range, failing to reclaim it for six days. This zone served as a crucial bounce point since mid-November. However, the New Year recovery sent BTC’s price up nearly 5%, with Bitcoin trading above $96,000 for the past day. Some crypto analysts previously suggested that reclaiming the $97,300 support zone is crucial to reverse BTC’s short-term bearish trend. This level was retested yesterday for the first time in over a week but failed to hold. Despite this, crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that week 9 of its post-halving “Parabolic Upside Phase” is “slowly ending,” suggesting that BTC’s correction will likely be over soon. The analyst explained Bitcoin enters a parabolic period that lasts around 300 days each cycle after every Halving event. Historically, BTC registers the first major retrace a month after entering price discovery mode. The first “Price Discovery Correction” starts between Weeks 6 and 8 of each parabolic phase and sees pullbacks by at least 25%. This cycle, Bitcoin’s retrace started on Week 7 and saw a 15% correction, which some analysts suggest is due to the trend of smaller corrections. Rekt Capital stated that “once Bitcoin clears its historically corrective weeks,” the flagship crypto will offer plenty of reasons to be bullish. Similarly, the analyst pointed out that BTC’s peak will likely come this year, followed by the “very beginnings of a brand new bear market.” However, he explained that most of the bear market will occur next year, lasting “some 365+ days and be between -65% to -80% deep.” BTC To Perform Well In Q1 Daan crypto trades highlighted that Bitcoin has been “chopping around the $100K level for 6 weeks now, we’ve built up a good amount of liquidity in this area.” He added that from the $100,000 mark and above, “there should be plenty of fuel to propel this higher.” Moreover, the trader noted that BTC is “trading right around the high volume node. Meaning, most volume was traded between these prices. Generally, price moves easier when its able to break away from such a high volume area. The 4H 200MA is guarding that breaking on the top side. The 4H 200EMA below is offering support.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $95,000 Amid 4.2% Surge, Is A New Year Rebound Coming? Daan asserted that a break above the $98,000 mark could “get the party started and start the run back to the all-time highs,” while holding the $95,000 support zone key in the short term. Ultimately, he considers there will be “an interesting race between BTC and ETH this quarter,” as the market’s performance during Q1 is usually “pretty positive.” Based on this historical performance, the trader expects the leading cryptocurrencies to perform well throughout the start of the year. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,071, a 1% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD trading above $97,000 as the U.S. session began. Following a rapid start to the new year and a retest of $96,000 as support, Bitcoin aimed to reclaim the 50-day simple moving average (SMA). At $96,740 at the time of writing, the 50-day SMA previously acted as support for over two months before being lost in late December. “Nice follow-through on the falling wedge breakout,” trading account SuperBro noted on X. “Careful not to get aggressive with longs into potential resistance, now we need to reclaim the 20 and 50 SMA and flip these back to support.” Other analysts anticipated that the trendline could regain its role as support, potentially fueling a continued bull run after last month’s cooldown. On shorter timeframes, however, trader Roman advised caution. “I think some of you are getting excited a bit too early,” he commented, analyzing four-hour charts. “We’ve got a low-volume pump with maxed stoch RSI. Generally means we come down a bit.” The stochastic relative strength index (RSI) exceeded the overbought 70 threshold, signaling potential short-term exhaustion. Fellow trader Daan Crypto Trades highlighted the 200-period SMA on the four-hour chart as a critical resistance level, with the 200-period EMA providing support. “Trading right around the high volume node. Meaning, most volume traded between these prices,” Daan explained on X. “Price moves easier when it breaks away from such a high volume area. The 4H 200MA is guarding the top side. I want to see this break above $98K+ to get the party started and start the run back to all-time highs. $95K is an important level to hold in the short term.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 04:33:00

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 05:02:00

The top five protocols on Solana now hold more than a billion dollars in TVL (total value locked)—individually, highlighting the growth of the ecosystem. While bridges and aggregators have improved connectivity, there’s still a gap in providing a more seamless experience for users and developers looking to operate across both Solana and EVM ecosystems. LI.FI steps in to address this, providing a unified API that simplifies multi-chain interactions. As more users and apps seek smoother cross-chain experiences, the need for reducing operational complexity becomes essential. Let’s see how LI.FI bridges this gap. Making Solana Apps Multi-Chain Ready At LI.FI, we recognize the growing need for deeper integration between Solana and the EVM ecosystem. As Solana continues to scale, the connection between its apps and EVM users remains somewhat fragmented. Here’s how we are addressing these challenges and simplifying cross-chain interactions for both developers and users. The Solana-EVM Disconnect Solana apps, while gaining traction, face challenges in attracting EVM users due to the complicated cross-chain experience. The EVM ecosystem, being one of the largest in the blockchain space, offers a vast pool of users, liquidity, and opportunities for growth. For Solana apps to expand their reach and tap into these broader user bases, it’s essential to connect with EVM users. This not only helps with user acquisition but also improves liquidity and enhances the overall value of the Solana ecosystem. However, users moving assets between Solana and EVM chains often need to switch between multiple interfaces — such as separate bridges and DEXs. For example, a user might have to first bridge their tokens using a dedicated bridging platform, then swap those tokens on an EVM-based DEX, all of which adds extra steps and complexity. This fragmented process creates friction, discouraging frequent cross-chain interactions. Likewise, Solana-native users encounter similar issues when trying to interact with EVM apps. The process of moving assets between the chains, navigating different interfaces, and handling transaction fees in multiple currencies adds friction, discouraging regular cross-chain engagement. This fragmentation limits the fluidity of fund transfers and the overall user experience across ecosystems. How LI.FI ’s API Bridges the Gap Our API provides a single, streamlined integration that enables Solana apps to manage both swaps and bridging in one process. By automating cross-chain transactions, we simplify the entire flow, reducing complexity for both developers and users. For developers, adding multi-chain functionality often requires integrating multiple bridges, liquidity sources, and protocols, which increases development time and maintenance overhead. With the LI.FI API, once integrated, developers gain instant access to over 30+ chains and 18+ bridges, significantly reducing the time and effort needed to support cross-chain features. As we continue to add more chains and bridges, developers no longer need to worry about manually integrating new platforms or maintaining those connections. For users, this means they can swap assets within Solana or bridge them to any supported chain directly within the app without switching between different platforms. This reduces friction, keeps users engaged, and ensures that transactions remain fluid and straightforward. In addition to simplifying cross-chain transactions, they are also preparing to bring **Zaps** to Solana. Zaps bundle multi-step processes—such as staking, adding liquidity, and swapping—into a single action. Already available on other chains, Zaps will soon be available on Solana, making complex actions more efficient and user-friendly for your users. Key Integrations for Cross-Chain Liquidity To ensure seamless cross-chain functionality, LIFI’s integrated with major infrastructure providers within Solana’s ecosystem: Jupiter : Offering DEX aggregation to provide the best possible swap rates within the Solana ecosystem, ensuring users always get optimal pricing. Mayan and Allbridge : Enabling efficient bridging of assets between Solana and EVM chains, making cross-chain transfers more reliable and straightforward. Circle CCTP : Facilitating stablecoin transfers across chains, improving liquidity flow, and ensuring assets move smoothly between ecosystems. These integrations enable us to deliver reliable, smooth cross-chain transactions, empowering developers to offer users a seamless and optimized experience. We’re continuously working to add more bridges and DEX aggregators to further strengthen multi-chain support for the Solana ecosystem. In addition, they are already live on Phantom Wallet , Jumper Exchange , and Blockchain.com , enhancing user accessibility and interaction to support swaps and bridging to and from Solana. Unlocking New Possibilities for Developers and Users By integrating the LI.FI API, Solana apps can unlock several benefits: Developer Focus : Our unified API minimizes the need for managing multiple tools, allowing developers to focus on building their core features. Improved User Experience : Users benefit from an in-app experience that allows for cross-chain swaps and bridges without leaving the app. This keeps the process simple and intuitive. Expanded User Base : Simplifying the interaction between Solana and EVM chains opens the door for more EVM users to engage with Solana apps, broadening the potential user base. Revenue Streams : Developers can create new revenue opportunities by charging fees on cross-chain swaps. Access to Liquidity : With aggregated liquidity from various DEXs, bridges, and aggregators, we ensure that apps benefit from better liquidity, lower slippage, and efficient transactions. Conclusion As Solana apps continue to evolve, the ability to go multi-chain is no longer just an option—it’s becoming a necessity. LI.FI simplifies this process, enabling Solana apps to expand beyond their native chain, tap into new user bases, and access broader liquidity, all while enhancing the user experience. If you’re looking to take your Solana app to the next level, explore the possibilities with LI.FI and unlock new opportunities for growth.

It’s a place where fortunes are made and lost in the span of a single tweet, where nerds and visionaries wrestle for dominance, and where meme coins like Punisher Coin ($PUN) and Shiba Inu (SHIB), alongside powerhouses like Solana (SOL), are rewriting the rules of engagement. I’m not here to talk about Bitcoin or Ethereum, the old gods of this strange digital pantheon. No, the real action is in the trenches of the altcoin wars, where creativity and insanity collide. And in this swirling maelstrom, Punisher Coin rises like a phoenix: half superhero, half internet troll, all potential. Meme Coins – The Madness of Crowd Mentality Let’s start with the obvious: meme coins are ridiculous. They’re jokes. They’re memes. They’re… well, not supposed to work. But then, neither was Dogecoin. $46 billion later, here we are. The thing about memes is that they’re sticky. They spread like wildfire. And when combined with blockchain technology, they become something altogether more powerful: a community. Shiba Inu capitalized on this by building an ecosystem around its brand. With Shibarium and a growing utility narrative, SHIB is one of the few meme coins pushing the boundaries of what this category can achieve. Its market cap of $12.6 billion makes it the 14th largest in the entire industry. The Rise and Rise of Solana Solana embodies the crypto space’s relentless pursuit of performance. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low fees, Solana has become a hub for NFTs, DeFi, and now meme coins like the soon-to-launch Punisher Coin. The blockchain’s scalability makes it an ideal home for projects that demand both speed and efficiency, solidifying its position as one of the leading players in the altcoin market. Why 2025 is Punisher Coin’s Year Punisher Coin is a high-stakes experiment in engagement. Its Mean Meme Machine transforms internet humor into NFTs, giving creators ownership and value in a way that feels refreshingly democratic. Meanwhile, the War Room Telegram group creates a space where token holders can steer the project’s direction while enjoying perks like airdrops and exclusive merch. The marketing is equally audacious, with plans for flamethrower spectacles and Tesla Cybertruck destruction. It’s the kind of boldness that gets people talking, and in crypto, attention is half the battle. The Bigger Picture What makes Punisher Coin, Shiba Inu, and Solana compelling isn’t just their features, it’s mostly their ability to capture the cultural zeitgeist while driving innovation. They represent the best of crypto culture: playful yet ambitious, chaotic yet oddly purposeful. Crypto isn’t about its technology; it’s about people, stories, and the insane, beautiful chaos that comes when the two collide. Whether it’s the next big thing or just another chapter in this wild market, Punisher Coin is staking its claim in the future of crypto.

Avalanche (AVAX) also had a 49% net increase, leaving much to be desired, and also ended the year on a negative with a 4% dip over December. The question among holders now is whether Trump’s administration is likely to catalyze Ethereum and Avalanche’s growth. Meanwhile, a newer player on the scene, Lunex Network, is quickly amassing popularity for its modern offering of trader perks and low gas fees for users. So how will these projects fare in 2025 and under Trump’s guidance? Ethereum Focuses On Technical Progress In 2024 Ethereum (ETH) has not performed as well as in previous years, and December saw a 4% dip to bring an end to a slow year for the project. While Ethereum (ETH) could benefit from a more favorable regulatory climate under Trump, the Ethereum (ETH) developers have also been making updates that should provide long term benefits. Most notably, Ethereum (ETH) has massively improved its energy efficiency as a network. In addition, The introduction of the Dencun upgrade, which incorporates proto-danksharding, has significantly enhanced data availability on the Ethereum network while reducing transaction costs. Between these timely updates and changing political influences, Ethereum might see a revival in 2025. Avalanche Improves Scalability with Avalanche9000 Even with a 5% net decline through 2024, Avalanche (AVAX) now appears poised for growth in 2025. As of January 2nd, Avalanche (AVAX) jumped 8% in the last 24 hours. The past year saw Avalanche (AVAX) deliver a multitude of updates that have received a lot of positive attention. The Avalanche 9000 upgrade made major improvements to the network’s flexibility and scalability. This upgrade solidifies Avalanche’s position as an ideal platform for developers building intelligent and scalable decentralized applications. Lunex Network Offers Ultimate Trading Efficiency Lunex Network ($LNEX) is a new but promising protocol that offers users a powerful suite of tools to benefit from while trading. It also sports a powerful but simple mobile exchange app that enables users to trade in real time. It also provides access to market data and facilitates frictionless swaps on over 50,000 assets. Low transaction fees make the platform ideal for active investors who want to make frequent trades. Another strength of Lunex Network ($LNEX) is its portfolio tracker, which differentiates itself from other trackers by allowing the monitoring of ETFs and stocks, as well as cryptocurrencies. This makes Lunex Network an indispensable tool for professional traders with broad portfolios, as it gives a clear and easily absorbable snapshot of their financial health at any given time. For privacy-conscious traders, Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) offering is second to none. The platform does away with know-your-customer (KYC) verification and does not impose a requirement for third-party wallet connections. Such measures protect users from the risk of data breaches and safeguard private information, making Lunex Network ($LNEX) the obvious choice for those who want to conduct their crypto dealings in anonymity. Lunex Network Draws Investor Interest Currently priced at a ripe $0.0052 per token, $LNEX is bringing in investors in droves who are eager to capitalize on its potential. Its offering stands out against other protocols with modern touches such as its privacy-centric features and intelligently designed tokenomic approach. Analysts predict an impressive 1,800% increase in token value by the time of the launch, making this an unmissable opportunity for crypto enthusiasts.

The asset has experienced an impressive 11% surge, propelling its value to approximately $2.42, a level it had not seen since late 2024’s price correction. Analysts Predict XRP Could Reach $5.85 As Market Confidence Grows This resurgence has positioned XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency in the market, with a market capitalization of around $139 billion, according to CoinGecko data. Notably, it has surpassed the market cap of Tether (USDT), which stands at $137 billion. The recent rally in XRP’s price can be attributed in part to a broader shift in market sentiment following the election of President Donald Trump on November 5. Trump’s victory has sparked renewed confidence in the digital asset industry, leading to increased optimism among investors. This sentiment shift seems to have catalyzed a wave of buying activity within the crypto market, benefiting not only XRP but also other digital assets. Related Reading: Prepare For A Solana Sell-Off: How Grayscale’s 2025 Unlocks Could Shake The Market Crypto analysts have taken notice of this trend. DarkDefender, a prominent figure in the crypto analysis community, observed that XRP’s price trajectory has been impressive. After hovering around $2.11, XRP broke through its initial resistance at $2.22 and reached as high as $2.44. DarkDefender highlighted $2.42 as a critical resistance level that has now been updated as a new support level. According to his analysis, if XRP can breach the $2.67 to $2.72 range, it could pave the way for a significant upward movement, targeting as high as $5.85. This potential rise would represent an extraordinary 141% increase from its current price, marking a new all-time high for the token. Elliott Wave Theory Points To Potential $10 Target Adding to the optimism, another analyst, known as CryptoinsightUK, has weighed in on XRP’s potential trajectory suggesting that if XRP follows a measured move similar to its previous price leg, it could “easily surpass $10.” Drawing from Elliott Wave Theory, which posits that market trends move in waves, he argues that if XRP enters a “wave 3” scenario—often the most substantial in terms of price movement—the asset could exceed $10. CryptoinsightUK notes that many investors are targeting the $8 mark, a figure he considers reasonable based on various metrics. By analyzing the price movements and potential gains, the analyst suggests that the future of the altcoin looks bright, with many indicators pointing towards substantial growth.

Trading at $2.42, the XRP price shows a 2% increase over the past 24 hours. Regarding trading volume, CoinGecko data indicates a decrease of almost 42%, totaling $5.6 billion.

The asset has closed down the gap to $0.4, but analysts continue to highlight $1 as a potential target during this bull cycle. DOGEUSD. Source: TradingView Shortly after Donald Trump won the US elections at the start of November, DOGE’s price went on a wild run due to Elon Musk’s upcoming role under the new administration and his rich history and support for the largest meme coin. The asset skyrocketed by triple digits within weeks and peaked at almost $0.5. However, it started to lose traction in December and plunged hard during the mid-month correction. In a matter of days, Dogecoin dumped from over $0.41 to $0.26. It reacted well after this substantial decline and pushed to $0.35 almost immediately. However, it failed to rally further and remained in a tight range of $0.31 and $0.34 for weeks. The landscape changed, though, for the entire market in the past few days. The situation around DOGE became particularly promising due to the larger number of coins accumulated by whales during this correction and consolidation phase. As such, it didn’t take long for the OG meme coin to surge in value. On a 24-hour scale alone, DOGE has shot up by 16% and now trades well above $0.39 after breaking above the $0.34 resistance. It’s up by 25% on a weekly scale and sits close to $0.4. Analysts have used this opportunity to double down on their $1 prediction for the asset, which is yet to be reached. Nevertheless, DOGE would need to more than double its current valuation to tap such a high price target. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to track Dogecoin’s performance in the following weeks, especially after Trump’s inauguration on January 20 and Musk’s D.O.G.E. department .

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN.

The current price action for XRP continues to follow a triangle pattern, which suggests the possibility of higher prices in the short term. There has been no confirmed top within this structure yet, and the overall analysis still points to the formation of an Elliott Wave triangle. A potential scenario involves one more higher low before the next significant upward movement in wave five. The Ongoing Correction and Market Structure Since topping at around $2.90 a month ago, the market has been in a correction. This correction is unfolding in a series of three waves up and three waves down, typical of a corrective phase. While a direct breakout is possible, the most probable scenario suggests one more higher low, forming part of the Elliott Wave triangle pattern. Key Support and Resistance Levels to Watch The support area for XRP is defined by the Fibonacci retracement levels, located between $2.28 and $2.27. This zone is where the price could find weak support before the next move. Importantly, the primary invalidation point for this structure is a break below $1.95, the previous swing low from December 20th. To invalidate the triangle to the upside, XRP would need to break above $2.70. A breakout above this level would signal a continuation of the bullish trend, but the market would still test all-time highs as long as it holds above $1.95. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Lawsuit News: Expert Believes Atkins Won’t Dismiss Case, Settlements Likely , Outlook for XRP: Higher Prices Likely, but Caution is Key While there are no minimum requirements for the E-wave, it is possible to see a shallow correction, similar to previous triangles in XRP’s history. The focus remains on higher prices, and the resistance levels to watch are at $2.55, $2.62, and potentially $2.72. A break above the $2.72 level could lead to the next phase of price discovery, possibly testing the previous all-time high around $3.30. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This bullish momentum continues to signal growing confidence among investors, particularly high-net-worth individuals. Notably, Bitcoin whales, typically known for “buying the dip,” have flipped the script, scooping up massive quantities of BTC during its price highs. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this development, revealing that Whales acquired over 70,000 BTC within 48 hours. This staggering investment, valued at over $7.28 billion, underscores the conviction of big-money investors in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Elsewhere, Despite Bitcoin’s impressive price action, large holders are showing no signs of offloading their assets, according to CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain. In a recent post, the pundit highlighted the Realized profit ratio data, which tracks wallet activity across various size ranges (10-100 BTC, 100-1,000 BTC, and 1,000-10,000 BTC), noting it suggests that whales believe Bitcoin has yet to reach its peak in this market cycle. “Compared to the all-time high (ATH) in previous cycles, it seems that the selling and profit-taking process by whales has not yet begun. This may indicate that, according to the whales, we are still not at the ATH range for this cycle.” He wrote. That said, the heightened whale activity coincides with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. MicroStrategy, the business intelligence giant led by Michael Saylor , announced earlier this week its latest addition of 15,350 BTC to its holdings, boosting its total reserves to 439,000 BTC. Mining companies have also joined the accumulation trend, with firms like Marathon Digital increasingly holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, broader corporate adoption remains minimal. For instance, only 0.55% of Microsoft shareholders recently supported a proposal to create a Bitcoin reserve, and a similar initiative at Amazon saw just 0.01% approval. According to OKG Research, a mere 0.01% of global public companies currently hold Bitcoin, highlighting the untapped potential for institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s recent surge is supported by shifting macroeconomic conditions. With inflation fears lingering, skepticism toward traditional financial markets growing, and potential central bank rate cuts anticipated in 2024, Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge asset has gained renewed traction. Notably, the digital scarcity of Bitcoin, combined with its decentralized nature, makes it an attractive store of value for institutional investors seeking alternatives to fiat currencies. Regulatory clarity in key markets, including the United States, has further fueled confidence among investors. Additionally, speculation around the potential approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is driving anticipation of broader institutional participation. As momentum builds, analysts are setting bold price targets for Bitcoin. On Monday, Bitfinex researchers forecasted a peak price of $200,000 for Bitcoin during the second half of 2025, driven by increasing institutional adoption and diminishing speculative volatility. At press time, BTC was trading at $98,095, reflecting a 1.37% surge in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-04 06:13:12

Finance Expert Says the Train Has Left the Station, XRP Destination Is Mars",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-100-finance-expert-says-the-train-has-left-the-station-xrp-destination-is-mars/,"Renowned financial analyst and wealth mentor Linda Jones has weighed in on XRP’s recent performance, describing the cryptocurrency’s momentum as unstoppable. Reflecting on its recent surge, Jones remarked , “The XRP train has left the station,” suggesting that the opportunity to buy at lower prices may have passed. Jones is optimistic that XRP could surpass its all-time high in the current bull run. While she did not provide specific short-term price targets, her confidence aligns with the sentiment of many XRP supporters that closely watch its upward trajectory. XRP Outshines Market Rivals XRP’s performance has set it apart as one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in the current market rally. After dropping below $2, the asset has surged to $2.41, marking a 4% increase in the past 24 hours. In contrast, other leading cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Binance Coin have seen less than 2%. At its peak, XRP reached an intraday high of $2.44, a 23% rebound from its two-day low of $1.99. This strong recovery has solidified XRP’s position as a market leader and captured the attention of analysts and investors. Short-Term Predictions for XRP Market analysts have provided various projections for XRP’s potential growth. Some believe that XRP could reach the $4 to $5 range in the near term, representing a 100% gain from its current price. However, they also caution that XRP may face resistance before consolidating and preparing for its next move. Ben Armstrong, popularly known as BitBoy, a well-known cryptocurrency enthusiast, has taken a more ambitious stance. He speculated that XRP could challenge Ethereum’s dominance in market capitalization during this bull run. However, for XRP to overtake Ethereum, a significant price surge would be required. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum’s market cap currently stands at $410 billion, while XRP’s is $137 billion, leaving a gap of $273 billion. To close this gap, XRP’s price would need to rise to approximately $7.20, requiring a 200% increase from its current level. Long-Term Outlook for XRP In addition to short-term expectations, many analysts and XRP supporters are considering the asset’s long-term potential. Linda Jones expressed a bold view, suggesting that XRP could eventually reach $100. However, she clarified that this milestone will unlikely occur during the current market cycle. XRP’s recent surge and market-leading performance have reinforced its reputation as a prominent cryptocurrency. As the asset continues to climb, many are optimistic about its potential for short-term gains and long-term growth.

He sees it as a valuable long-term asset and has made it a central part of MicroStrategy’s strategy. Despite the ups and downs of the market, MicroStrategy’s focus on expanding its Bitcoin reserves remains strong. The timing is perfect as Trump’s aggressive push towards Bitcoin Reserve plan may give tough competition to Microstrategy later. MicroStrategy’s “21/21 Plan This plan is part of MicroStrategy’s “21/21 Plan ,” a bold strategy to raise $21 billion through stocks and another $21 billion through loans and other financial tools over three years. Since starting this plan in October 2024, the company has already bought 194,180 Bitcoin—almost halfway to its goal. These Bitcoins are currently worth $19 billion. As of January 3, 2025, MicroStrategy owns 446,400 Bitcoin, valued at about $43.7 billion. This massive holding has earned the company unrealized gains of $16 billion. Impressively, MicroStrategy’s stock, MSTR, performed better than Bitcoin itself in 2024 and was recently added to the Nasdaq index. The new $2 billion stock offering is expected to happen in early 2025, depending on market conditions. At the same time, MicroStrategy is asking shareholders to approve increasing the number of shares it can issue. This includes raising its common stock limit from 330 million to 10.3 billion and its preferred stock limit from 5 million to 1 billion. A shareholder meeting will be held to discuss these changes. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Adoption Set to Skyrocket as 13 U.S. States Explore Strategic Reserves , Raising Capital for Bitcoin Acquisitions By raising more money and buying more Bitcoin, MicroStrategy is doubling down on its belief in the future of cryptocurrency. To support its Bitcoin buying strategy, MicroStrategy recently filed with the SEC to seek approval for issuing billions of new shares. The proposal aims to increase the company’s Class A common shares from 330 million to 10.33 billion and its preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion.

This time, it is Fidelity’s FBTC spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) that’s leading the charge scooping 3,640 BTC yesterday. Furthermore, BTC price is approaching $100K once again with on-chain indicators hinting at bottom formation. Moreover, the liquidation data shows traders and investors have a mixed outlook on Donald Trump’s inauguration day as both long and short liquidations are balanced. This uncertainty can also be observed in daily Bitcoin ETF flows. US Bitcoin ETF Inflows Resume Again In Strong Reversal After big outflows earlier this week, the US Bitcoin ETFs staged a strong reversal with nearly $900 million in inflows on Friday. As per Farside Investors data , Fidelity’s FBTC recorded the largest inflows yesterday among its peers at $357 million. After three consecutive days of outflows, BlackRock’s IBIT also saw a reversal with $252 million in inflows while Ark Invest’s ARKB saw $222 million. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, celebrated the strong reversal on Friday, after outflow from iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) a day earlier. IBIT rebounded strongly by attracting over $250 million in fresh inflows today. BlackRock’s IBIT hit massive milestones this year with more than $37 million in inflows and $53 million in net assets under management. Commenting on the overall ETF inflows, Geraci said: “That’s right… over $900 million. Just today,” adding that US spot Bitcoin ETFs have now accumulated approximately $700 million in net inflows since the beginning of the year. BTC On-Chain Metrics Show Strength On-chain data shows strength for Bitcoin hinting that the bulls are willing to look past the current correction. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reported a significant outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges over the past week. According to Martinez, more than 48,000 BTC valued at over $4.5 billion have been withdrawn during this period. Source: Ali Charts The substantial outflow signals a potential shift in market sentiment, with investors opting for self-custody or preparing for long-term holding. Usually, these massive withdrawals happen just before the strong move to the upside. The Coinbase Premium Index, a key indicator of institutional interest in Bitcoin, recently dropped to -0.23%, marking its lowest level in two years. However, the index has begun to rebound swiftly, signaling a resurgence in demand for Bitcoin among U.S.-based institutional investors. This narrative is further supported by inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs. Source: Ali Charts The Bitcoin community is now eagerly awaiting Donald Trump’s oath-taking ceremony on January 20. Traders believe that BTC can experience some volatility before the asset resumes its journey to $100K and beyond. “ Rich Dad Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki predicted Bitcoin price to hit $175K and $350K this year. As of press time, BTC price is trading at 1.25% up near $98,000, with a trading volume down 13%. Per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour liquidation has soared to $53 million with more than $33 million in short liquidations.

However, the SEC has continued to appeal the decision. In October, the SEC officially appealed the previous ruling on XRP. The SEC was not satisfied with the judge’s decision and took it to the appeals court. Now, Paul Atkins is set to replace Gary Gensler as the new SEC Chair. Atkins has been a critic of the tough approach, particularly his use of “regulation by enforcement,” which has been a point of controversy. Many are expecting that this strategy will come to an end under Atkins’ leadership. There is speculation that the SEC might start reducing or even dropping some of the current lawsuits, particularly those that are seen as frivolous or not involving fraud. However, in an interview with Thinking Crypto, Amanda Tuminelli from the DeFi Education Fund suggests that while dropping lawsuits completely might not be immediate, a shift in approach is likely. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For January 4 , Tuminelli believes the SEC may instead pursue favorable settlements, known as “consent decrees.” These allow both parties to negotiate a resolution while the court ensures the terms are carried out. This could offer a way to resolve cases without fully dropping them. She also hopes that these settlements could lead to clearer guidelines for the industry, possibly pushing the SEC to do more rulemaking or provide a clearer path for registration. This way, even without dropping the lawsuits, the industry could learn from the cases and better understand the SEC’s expectations. Conclusion: If a settlement or dismissal happens, XRP’s price is likely to rise, as this would improve market sentiment. If the SEC drops the appeal, it could signal a more friendly stance toward Ripple and the crypto industry. This is an important case to watch for both new and existing XRP holders. In short, under new leadership, the SEC might soften its aggressive stance, leading to more settlements and clearer regulations, though not necessarily dropping cases altogether. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Remittix Predicted To Go Viral In 2025,https://timestabloid.com/when-will-be-the-end-of-meme-season-remittix-predicted/,"The end of the meme season is drawing closer, with Shiba Inu and Dogwifhat struggling and many predicting that practical crypto solutions will soon take center stage. Remittix , offering real utility through instant crypto-to-fiat payments, is poised to gain massive attention. Industry experts say 2025 may be the platform’s breakout year, and a 40x rise is on the horizon for early backers. Remittix: A Game-Changer in Cross-Border Payments with Seamless Crypto-to-Fiat Solutions Cross-border payments are evolving as global users expect quicker, simpler, and cheaper remittance methods. The shift has spawned blockchain-based solutions like Remittix (RTX) , a decentralized PayFi platform that bridges the gap between cryptocurrency payments and fiat settlements. Remittix leverages blockchain to streamline fiat transactions, allowing users to convert up to 40 different cryptocurrencies into fiat instantly before transferring funds to banks worldwide. In contrast to services like Stripe, Wise, and Coinbase, Remittix is more seamless, and recipients never know crypto is involved. This makes it appealing for companies and individuals seeking a safe and fast cross-border payment option. Businesses, for example, can set up accounts and use the platform’s Pay API to accept crypto payments, instantly converting them into fiat. The immutable nature of transactions eliminates risks like chargebacks, ensuring smooth operations. With its blend of TradFi and DeFi features, Remittix has raised over $1 million in its ongoing presale campaign, with $RTX tokens going for $0.0172. With its cutting-edge approach and expanding support, Remittix might be the next big thing in cross-border payments. Shiba Inu Investors Hold Steady Amid Growing Futures Interest Shiba Inu’s price has stayed in a tight range in the last 2 weeks because the cryptocurrency sector struggled with bearish momentum. Yet several factors project a possible comeback for Shiba Inu. Notably, more Shiba Inu tokens are leaving exchanges—a clear signal that investors are opting to hold their coins for the long haul. The Shiba Inu balance on exchanges slipped by approximately 0.6% to 258.7 trillion SHIB last week, down from 260.3 trillion. This decline leaves just 25.87% of the total supply available on exchanges, a positive sign for the asset. The futures market also shows increased confidence in Shiba Inu. Open interest, which reached $50 million in December, has risen to $65.4 million—the largest in weeks. At press time, Shiba Inu stands at $0.00002354, up 3% in the last twenty-four hours. Dogwifhat Shows Signs of Recovery After a Volatile End to 2024 Dogwifhat (WIF) had a remarkable run in 2024, soaring over 1,000% before cooling off with a 42% dip in December. Despite that, Dogwifhat has shown signs of stability, climbing 6.46% in the past week and gaining 0.47% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2.04. With a circulating supply of 1 billion tokens, Dogwifhat boasts a $2.03 billion market cap, making it the fourth-largest memecoin on Solana. Futures market data from Coinglass reveals Dogwifhat’s open interest at $445.64 million, up 4.29%. The steady rise in open interest since November signals heightened trader activity, likely driven by anticipation of major price swings. Previous peaks near $500 million hint at brewing volatility, with traders eyeing either a breakout or further correction. Looking ahead, experts see potential in Dogwifhat, projecting it could hit $5 by the second quarter of 2025 if momentum continues. Remittix Could Dominate Memecoins as Meme Season Ends As the meme season ends, Remittix is emerging as a strong contender in the crypto space against Shiba Inu and Dogwifhat. With its real-world utility and seamless crypto-to-fiat conversion, Remittix is attracting savvy investors. Unlike memecoins, Remittix offers long-term value, positioning itself for dominance as the market shifts toward practical solutions.

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 06:39:00

The ongoing recovery is impressive, but BTC needs to overcome the $100K hurdle to turn the market structure bullish. This development comes as MicroStrategy discloses a $2 billion BTC strategy. Bitcoin Price Edges Toward $100K, But No Bullish Confirmation Yet From a market structure standpoint, Bitcoin price has not created a higher high since the 15% crash from its ATH of $108,421.8. This correction found support around $93.2K, resulting in a 4.81% bounce since January 1. BTC must overcome the December 26 swing high at $99,950 or roughly the $100K psychological level for a bullish confirmation and the market structure to turn bullish. Such a development could catalyze a rally that contests the ATH. However, until that happens, crypto markets remain uncertain, with only strong altcoins noting recovery. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago. MicroStrategy Reveals Plan to Raise $2 Billion to Buy BTC In a recent X post , Microstrategy CEO and co-founder Michael Saylor revealed, “MicroStrategy targets up to $2 billion capital raise through public offerings of perpetual preferred stock in the first quarter of 2025.” In a blog detailing this plan, the software company revealed, “The purpose of the Offering is to allow MicroStrategy to continue to strengthen its balance sheet and acquire more bitcoin.” The Tysons, Virginia-based software company owns 4,46,400 BTC worth $43.792B as BTC trades around No data found for bitcoin on 1 hour ago. Of Bitcoin’s 21M total supply, Saylor’s MicroStrategy owns 2.13%, with the average cost per BTC around $62,428. While MicroStrategy’s $2 billion Bitcoin buying plan might seem bullish, the market has become desensitized to this accumulation spree to affect BTC’s value in the short term. Read More: MicroStrategy To Raise Up To $2B To Acquire More Bitcoin BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF Sells $333 Million BTC Although Michael Saylor continues to buy, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, withdrew $333 million on Thursday. This outflow is the largest in IBIT’s history. BlackRock Sells $333M BTC BTC Technical Analysis & Target The four-hour chart shows that Bitcoin price is trading between $93.3K and $99.6K. A sweep of the range’s lower limit at $93.3K on December 30 led to an 8% recovery rally. While the next target is the range high or $100K, BTC faces stiff resistance, extending from $97.5K to $99.6K. Bitcoin price could take one of two paths: A rejection that leads to a pullback into the CME gap, extending from $94.4K to $94.9K. Or a retest of $100K followed by a pullback into the aforementioned CME gap. However, there is a third scenario: BTC could break $100K and attempt to revisit the ATH at $108,421.8. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart The lack of uptick in daily active addresses or the consistent production of lower highs since the ATH on December 17 does not instill confidence in the recovery. A drop in this metric shows that investors are not interested in BTC at the current price. Such an outlook hints at uncertainty and adds credence to the technical analysis that anticipates two outlooks that Bitcoin price could take. Downtick in BTC’s Daily Active Addresses To conclude, MicroStrategy’s $2 billion plan has no impact on Bitcoin’s price in the short term. From a market structure and technical standpoint, BTC’s bullish outlook will begin once it sets a swing high above $100K. Until one of the above occurs, Bitcoin price prediction remains uncertain.

According to the latest analysis from CryptoQuant, historically, such transitions have often indicated local market tops or even cycle peaks, depending on the overall market environment and broader economic conditions. Presently, demand from short-term holders continues to play a critical role in supporting Bitcoin’s price stability amid ongoing market volatility. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Below $100,000: Is the Bull Market Over or Just Taking a Breather? Long-Term Holders Vs. Short-Term Buyers The analysis made by the CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost revealed that the short-term holders, particularly those who acquired Bitcoin in recent months, are actively influencing market sentiment. By analyzing the realized price data of various short-term acquisition periods, distinct support and resistance levels become apparent. These realized price levels include $41,000 for the general average realized price, $85,000 for short-term holders overall, $99,000 for holders within one week to one month, $81,000 for one to three months, and $60,000 for three to six months. These figures reflect key psychological and technical price points where market participants may make significant buy or sell decisions, according to Darkfost. The analyst revealed that the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR) currently remains neutral at 1 after declining from Bitcoin’s last rally, which pushed its price to an all-time high of $108,000. The STH SOPR serves as a key metric to evaluate short-term holders’ profit-taking behavior. A neutral SOPR indicates that recent selling activity from short-term holders has not been significantly profitable, reducing the incentive for widespread sell-offs at current price levels. However, this neutral stance suggests potential headwinds for an immediate bullish recovery. The decline in STH SOPR points to diminishing realized profits, which could slow down upward momentum in the short term. Despite these challenges, short-term holders’ demand has managed to absorb much of the selling pressure from long-term holders, preventing sharp price declines. Darkfost wrote: In conclusion, the selling pressure from LTHs has so far been fairly well absorbed by the buying pressure from STHs. However, we note that the STH SOPR is declining, which could hinder an immediate bullish recovery. In the short term, a period of consolidation or even a deeper correction might occur.

As Ethereum price targets a five-digit benchmark in the next few years, astute investors are also seeking potential altcoins that may provide even more remarkable gains. One example of this is Rexas Finance (RXS), a crypto coin priced at $0.175 that could possibly reach $30 per token.

Ethereum Price Outlook for 2025: Experts See $10, 000 Target Today, Ethereum price stands at $3,594.57 showing a 4% rise in the last day and a 60.94% increase over the past year. What’s next for the second-biggest crypto? Ethereum price chart Experts’ 2025 Ethereum price predictions and targets remain optimistic, due to its ongoing developments and leading position in DeFi. Popular investors, Tim Draper and Tom Lee think Ethereum could reach $8,000 to $10,000 by 2025, while Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered has set an even higher target of $12,000. With a mean target of $10,909, ETH seems set to grow a lot by 2025. Future network updates such as the Pectra Upgrade , will make Ethereum more scalable and user-friendly. Stani Kulechov, who founded Aave, shares insights and calling the Pectra Upgrade a big deal. He stresses how it will change the way Ethereum works with decentralized apps (dApps). This constant innovation keeps Ethereum at the top of blockchain tech.

38510532,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53764,1735974217,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Number of Shiba Inu Tokens Burned In 2024 Released, SHIB Army Reacts",https://timestabloid.com/number-of-shiba-inu-tokens-burned-in-2024-released-shib-army-reacts/,"2024 was a remarkable year for the cryptocurrency market, with many major assets surpassing expectations. Shiba Inu was one asset that performed spectacularly, and token burns through Shiba Inu’s systematic burning initiatives contributed greatly to the digital asset’s performance last year. On January 1, 2025, Shibburn released its comprehensive annual report through its official X account, revealing the full scope of the year’s burning activities. The data showed that the combined initiatives resulted in the permanent removal of 44,623,604,014 SHIB tokens (44.6 billion) from circulation in 2024, representing approximately $991,090 at current market rates. This dollar valuation is only a reference point because the token burns occurred at varying price levels. However, it still adds up to a notable amount and shows the progress of the ecosystem. Details of 2024 SHIB Burns and Community Response December 2024 contributed significantly to the annual figure, with Shibburn documenting the removal of 2,679,767,542 SHIB tokens across 143 distinct transactions. This end-of-year activity demonstrated a sustained commitment to the token reduction strategy, even as the year drew to a close. Notably, December saw SHIB reach its second-highest level in 2024. Shiba Inu is also the largest ERC-20 token in the crypto market, and despite a recent decline in the final few weeks of 2024, it is still up over 110% from last year. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While the burns are a major part of Shiba Inu’s growth strategy, the community response to these burning statistics has been notably mixed. Many stakeholders expressed concerns about the scale of token elimination. One community member complained that the total value burned failed to reach the million-dollar threshold. Another user pointed out that the current rate of token removal may be insufficient to significantly impact the substantial circulating supply of over 560 trillion tokens. Critical voices within the community have called for more aggressive burning strategies in the upcoming year, suggesting that the current pace needs acceleration. Shytoshi Kusama, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, recently weighed in on the discussion of token burning, maintaining that even the theoretical elimination of 99% of the token supply would not substitute for genuine utility and adoption. However, burns still play a crucial role in the ecosystem. Some community members have also displayed optimism , viewing the 2024 burn statistics as a foundation for future token reduction efforts that could aid a price increase. Many in the community are also optimistic about a price surge, and some analysts have predicted climbs as high as 250% for SHIB. With burns set to continue in 2025, Shiba Inu could experience even better performance this year. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With BTFD Coin (BTFD) blazing past $4.8 million in its presale, the excitement is palpable. Add to this the emergence of Book of Meme, a creative blend of nostalgia and blockchain innovation, and Osaka Protocol, a cutting-edge player pushing gaming and DeFi integration. It’s clear that meme coins are no longer just a joke — they’re serious business. Over the years, meme coins have captivated hearts and wallets alike. Initially dismissed as internet jokes, these coins have defied expectations by building thriving communities, delivering jaw-dropping returns, and proving their mettle in the ever-volatile crypto space. BTFD Coin, in particular, has redefined what it means to be a meme coin with its P2E game, lucrative referral programs, and staking rewards that keep users engaged and loyal. Let’s explore why BTFD, Book of Meme, and Osaka Protocol are the best meme coins to hold for the long term . BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin with Big Gains and Bigger Plans When BTFD launched its presale, few could have predicted how quickly it would gain traction. Within two weeks, the coin had raised over $2.5 million, and it’s now sitting at an impressive $4.8 million in total sales. With over 62 billion coins sold to more than 7500 holders, BTFD is making waves, proving it’s not just another flash-in-the-pan project. At the current Stage 13 price of $0.000142, early investors have already seen great ROI, and analysts are projecting even more explosive growth once it hits the market at $0.0006 per coin. BTFD’s strength lies in its robust ecosystem. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game has become a hit among Gen Z and Millennials, offering engaging gameplay and rewarding players with $BTFD tokens. BTFD Coin has launched the full version of its P2E Game, which allows users to play and earn through it. The referral program adds an extra layer of incentive, while staking rewards allow holders to earn passive income. This multi-pronged approach ensures BTFD isn’t just a meme coin; it’s a utility powerhouse. Book of Meme: Nostalgia Meets Blockchain Book of Meme brings something fresh to the meme coin space, tapping into the internet’s love for nostalgia while leveraging blockchain technology. Inspired by the whimsical and chaotic energy of early internet culture, Book of Meme combines innovative tokenomics with a commitment to community building. Its creators understand that memes are not just jokes but cultural artefacts that resonate with people on a deep level. What sets Book of Meme apart is its focus on storytelling. Each token is tied to a unique NFT representing iconic memes from the past. This strategy has created a new kind of collectability, where owning a token isn’t just about potential profit — it’s about owning a piece of internet history. The coin’s roadmap includes the development of a decentralised archive for memes, ensuring these cultural treasures are preserved forever. Book of Meme’s initial launch was met with overwhelming enthusiasm, and its community continues to grow. The coin’s innovative approach to blending nostalgia with blockchain ensures it will remain relevant, making it a top pick for long-term holding. Osaka Protocol: Redefining Gaming and DeFi If you’re looking for the perfect marriage of gaming and DeFi, Osaka Protocol is your answer. This meme coin has set its sights on revolutionising the gaming industry by integrating blockchain technology into popular gaming platforms. Osaka Protocol offers gamers the ability to earn and trade in-game assets securely, with all transactions backed by its native token. Osaka Protocol’s rise to prominence has been nothing short of meteoric. Its seamless integration of DeFi features into the gaming world has made it a favourite among tech-savvy investors and gamers alike. With its robust smart contracts, Osaka ensures transparency and security, giving users confidence in every transaction. The project’s partnerships with major gaming developers have further solidified its position as a leader in this niche market. The token’s value is expected to soar as more games adopt the Osaka Protocol. Its creators have also hinted at plans to introduce an Osaka-branded gaming console, which could further cement its place in the gaming and crypto worlds. For long-term holders, Osaka Protocol represents a unique opportunity to ride the wave of gaming’s blockchain revolution. Why Buying the Dip Matters: Lessons from 1973 Economic history has a way of repeating itself, and the world economy’s 1973 crash offers valuable lessons for today’s investors. During that period, savvy investors who bought assets during the downturn emerged with significant gains once markets recovered. The same principle applies to cryptocurrencies, particularly meme coins like BTFD, Book of Meme, and Osaka Protocol. Buying the dip allows investors to capitalise on low prices and maximise their returns when the market rebounds. With the current volatility in crypto markets, opportunities abound for those willing to take calculated risks. By investing in meme coins with strong fundamentals and growing communities, you position yourself to reap the rewards of the next market upswing.

Despite this production, the cautious move by Ripple has left many wondering if Ripple is carefully managing the coin’s value and making sure it stays strong in the competitive crypto market. Ripple Produces 600,000 RLUSD Token Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin currently holds a market cap of 53.1 million tokens, even after the recent creation of an additional 600,000 tokens. This indicates that despite producing more tokens, Ripple is maintaining a steady supply. 600,000 #RLUSD minted at RLUSD Treasury. https://t.co/8SGnXoejyx — Ripple Stablecoin Tracker (@RL_Tracker) January 3, 2025 The company has secured approximately $83 million in reserves, which are backing over $77.2 million worth of RLUSD tokens. This means the stablecoin is 7% over-collateralized, reflecting Ripple’s effort to provide stability and reliability to the token Furthermore, Ripple has promised to release its first attestation report within 30 days of RLUSD’s public launch. This report will detail the composition of the assets backing the stablecoin, adding transparency to Ripple’s operations and reinforcing its credibility. Ripple’s Master Plan Despite the recent creation of more tokens, analyst Arthur believes the company is controlling the supply of RLUSD to keep its value stable. If too many tokens are released too fast, could drop their price, which Ripple wants to prevent. Why is @Ripple limiting RLUSD circulation to 53,1M? Despite hitting the cap on the first days, the supply hasn’t increased. Is Ripple being cautious, or is there a bigger strategy at play? Let’s dive into it. THREAD — Arthur (@XrpArthur) January 2, 2025 By limiting the supply now, Ripple may be positioning itself for future conditions that could drive higher demand and adoption of RLUSD. As Ripple faces robust competition from major players like Circle and Tether, its careful supply management and growing presence in the market could make RLUSD a strong contender in the stablecoin space. RLUSD’s Role in the XRP Ecosystem In addition, Ripple President Monica Long believes RLUSD could set a new standard for stablecoins, citing its strong regulatory compliance as a key advantage. By adding RLUSD to the XRP ecosystem , Ripple hopes to increase XRP’s usefulness and improve liquidity for large institutional trades. This move could make the network even more attractive, especially after Ripple’s partial legal victories, which clarified XRP’s classification in certain situations.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 07:17:46

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA.

In a previous analysis, Dark Defender highlighted $2.22, $2.42, and $2.69, as crucial resistance levels before a massive breakout. The digital asset has surpassed the first of these levels, and with sustained momentum, it could quickly surpass the others. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next for XRP? $2.69 is the most crucial of these resistance levels. If XRP can surpass it, Dark Defender expects the asset to climb to $5.85 , breaching its current all-time high of $3.84. Following that, the next target is $8.67, and the analyst expects a continued climb from here. Conversely, if the asset retraces its gains, the analyst has also marked $2.03, $2.11, $2.13, and $2.17 as support levels, with $2.17 recently acting as a launchpad for the digital asset. If a pullback happens, XRP won’t fall too far before finding the support necessary for another rebound. XRP’s breakout above the symmetrical triangle pattern is a pivotal development, signaling renewed bullish sentiment as market participants anticipate its next move. The move above $2.22 has positioned it for potential further gains, and other analysts are already predicting a price explosion .

Coinbase & MicroStrategy Insider Stock Sales Raise Red Flags appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2024, cryptocurrency executives shocked the industry by becoming some of the largest insider stock sellers. With multi-million-dollar sales and high-profile names involved, the move has raised more than just eyebrows. SEC filings revealed that Coinbase CEO brian armstrong brian armstrong Brian Armstrong is one of the most well-known figures in the crypto industry today. He is an American investor, entrepreneur, and business executive. He is the CEO of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform.

The actions of these insiders are now stirring up concerns, but are they a sign of opportunity or warning? Keep reading to find out. Coinbase Leads Insider Sales Other key figures in insider sales included Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who sold $203.8 million, and COO Emilie Choi, who sold $186.4 million. Together, these sales pushed Coinbase to the seventh spot for overall insider selling, surpassing major companies like Oracle and Intuit. Questions Arise While stocks like Coinbase and MicroStrategy surged alongside Bitcoin’s price , these insider sales have left many crypto traders worried. After Trump’s election win, Bitcoin reached its first major milestone, touching $100,000 in December before falling back. For many, the stock sales signaled concerns about the market’s long-term stability. To put things into perspective, insider sales across the S&P 500 reached $36.9 billion in 2024, with Amazon’s Jeff Bezos leading the charge at $13.4 billion. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Palantir’s Alexander Karp also made significant sales. Bitcoin Faces a Rough Road Ahead Despite the hype, Bitcoin now faces several challenges as some major players show signs of slowing down. MicroStrategy has reduced its Bitcoin purchases, raising doubts about its strategy. El Salvador, once a strong Bitcoin supporter, is dialing back its policies. BlackRock has sold a large amount of Bitcoin, and Tether hasn’t issued new tokens in over 20 days, adding to market uncertainty. These factors have caused Bitcoin’s price to stall, putting the market on edge. High Time for Transparency? Crypto influencer Tommy Famous voiced concerns about the huge insider stock sales, calling them a troubling sign for trust in the companies and the broader crypto market. He criticized the contradiction between their promotion of decentralization and financial freedom while cashing out on such a large scale. Famous emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability, warning that the industry risks losing credibility if these issues continue. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Bull Run Ahead?

Bitcoin Market Status In the first week of the year, Bitcoin jumped 7%, briefly touching the $97K zone. This recovery has provided a much-needed boost after last month’s market downturn, with the industry now waiting to see if Trump’s regulatory changes could push Bitcoin to a new all-time high. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Valued at $363 million, Cango is on track to become one of the world's largest Bitcoin miners, generating 50 exahashes per second (EH/s) of computing power, about 6% of Bitcoin's total hashrate. Cango’s move into BTC mining has surprised many in the industry. “I guess it was surprising to people in the Bitcoin mining industry because no one had ever heard of Cango before,” said Juliet Ye, the company’s senior communications manager. But Cango has a track record of adapting to market opportunities. Since its founding in 2010, the company has diversified into auto exports, EV investments, renewable energy, and now BTC mining. Cango’s ambitious mining plans required significant investment. The company spent $256 million in cash to purchase 32 EH/s of mining power from leading Bitcoin mining hardware maker Bitmain. To purchase the remaining 18 EH/s, Cango is issuing $144 million worth of shares to Golden TechGen, owned by former Bitmain CFO Max Hua, and other vendors. Once these transactions are complete, Golden TechGen and others will own a 37.8% stake in Cango. Related News: Binance-Listed Altcoin Announces 2025 Plan: Its Price Bounces - Analyst il Capo Issues Hot Statement This massive acquisition puts Cango among the giants of the industry. Its 50 EH/s fleet surpasses the 47 EH/s currently held by the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner, MARA Holdings, and dwarfs rivals such as CleanSpark (32 EH/s) and Riot Platforms (26 EH/s). Currently, Cango uses Bitmain’s infrastructure to operate mining rigs spread across the US, Canada, Paraguay, and Ethiopia. The company plans to build in-house expertise over time to increase efficiency, but is taking a cautious approach when navigating the complexities of the industry. Cango is also exploring how to manage its growing BTC reserves. In November alone, the company produced 363.9 BTC, worth around $35 million at current prices. “We are not ruling out the possibility of making some tactical reductions in our BTC holdings depending on market conditions,” Ye said. *This is not investment advice.

In its 2024 annual report, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs reveals a bold new approach that includes teaming up with tech giants like Google and Meta. You might be curious to know how they plan on fighting this problem. Read on to discover how India’s latest moves could shape a safer crypto future for all. Tech Giants Collaborate with India A major focus of India’s effort is the fight against “pig butchering” scams , a particularly harmful type of fraud. These scams target vulnerable groups, such as unemployed youth, housewives, students, and financially struggling individuals, who are often lured by false promises of high returns. To strengthen the initiative, India has gained the support of global tech giants. The report mentions that these companies are now key players in helping India combat crypto scams. How the Scam Works The “pig butchering” scam follows a clear and predictable pattern. Scammers typically use social media platforms and search engines—mainly Google Ads and Meta’s sponsored posts—to find victims. Posing as financial experts or representatives of trusted investment firms, they gain the victim’s trust before encouraging them to invest in fraudulent schemes. Steps to Prevent Fraud India’s Cyber Crime Coordination Centre, in collaboration with Google and Meta, has developed protocols to remove fraudulent content quickly. This proactive approach helps limit the spread and impact of such scams. In a key move, Google Pay has been integrated into India’s Citizen Financial Cyber Frauds Reporting and Management System. This allows for real-time monitoring and interception of suspicious transactions, helping prevent scams in their tracks. Thanks to this integration, India saved over 16 billion Indian rupees in 2023 alone, according to the report. Building Stronger Investigative Capabilities The report also outlines efforts to improve the country’s ability to investigate crypto scams. India has launched nationwide training programs to enhance the skills of law enforcement.

Trump-backed Mike Johnson was re-elected as the US House Speaker on the first ballot in a 218-215 vote on Friday. Many in the cryptocurrency community were quick to praise the new administration, even before Donald Trump’s inauguration later this month, including Ripple’s CEO. Today, here in the US, we welcomed the 119th Congress—better known as the most pro-crypto Congress in history. The journey is just beginning, but you can’t deny the energy & excitement already building across the industry. Let’s get to work. — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) January 3, 2025 Shortly after the elections in early November, Garlinghouse noted that US-based cryptocurrency projects had benefited the most from Trump’s landslide victory as the Biden administration and the SEC, in particular, had suppressed many such businesses. This was evident from the skyrocketing prices of assets like XRP and ADA. Additionally, reports started to emerge that Ripple’s CEO, alongside IOG’s Charles Hoskinson, had met with Trump or people from his team to discuss their involvement in the upcoming regulatory framework around the crypto industry. Although those rumors were never confirmed by Garlinghouse himself, he has been openly praising the upcoming administration, including the Republican-dominated Congress, which he called ‘the most pro-crypto’ in history. The XRP army is particularly focused on the changes in the SEC. The agency and Ripple have been in a four-year-long legal battle, which was nowhere near its end during Gensler’s tenure. However, with his departure in just weeks and Trump’s pro-crypto choice for new SEC chair, the community is anticipating a quicker and perhaps more favorable closure to the case.

Trump Loves Dancing (TRUMPDAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPDAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Dancing can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Dancing could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Dancing launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Dancing on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Dancing by entering its contract address – HVnG6NJCvVDa34VxqR1wmSo18EGtNVJhNR8CQwNwjgpi – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPDAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 08:02:00

In a new video update, crypto strategist PlanB tells his 200,000 YouTube subscribers that 2025 will have many months that will see the top crypto asset by market cap reach heights it hasn’t witnessed before. “Historically, if we have an all-time high in price, there’s a high probability that we’ll see more all-time highs in price. We saw that in 2020, 2021, in 2017, and in 2013. A new all-time high leads to another all-time high [and] a whole bunch of other all-time highs. So yes, we had an all-time high in December [of] 108,000, but not the closing price. However, I do expect for 2025 that we’ll see many more months with all-time highs similar to the previous bull markets.” According to PlanB, the flagship digital asset’s average price for the next four years is $500,000. However, he notes that it will likely not be exactly $500,000 and fall somewhere between $250,000 and $1 million. “The stock-to-flow model looks forward in time and it gives a 2024-2028 target of an average price of about $500,000… The rule of thumb: one standard deviation band is about two times the 500,000, which is 1 million, and 500,000 divided by two, which is 250,000, so we have a wide range of 250,000 to 1 million where I expect the average of the four-year price cycle to be.” The stock-to-flow model compares the supply of an asset or commodity with its flow of production. Bitcoin is trading for $98,445 at time of writing, a 1.6% increase on the day.

In a report submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives on Jan. 1, Collins disclosed purchasing between $1,001 and $15,000 of Ski Mask Dog (SKI), a token launched in May 2024. The report, along with one filed in December, showed that Collins made three separate purchases of SKI, each up to $15,000, between Dec. 1 and Dec. 3. These transactions occurred roughly a month after the U.S. election, during a period when many cryptocurrency prices were surging. Collins, a Republican who represents Georgia’s 10th congressional district, won reelection in November with more than 63% of the vote against Democratic candidate Lexy Doherty. Although it is unclear if his investment in SKI is tied to his election victory, Collins has previously disclosed holdings in Ether (ETH), Velodrome (VELO), Aerodrome Finance (AERO), and The Graph (GRT). Under the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, U.S. lawmakers must disclose their stock and cryptocurrency transactions. As of Jan. 3, Collins appeared to be the first member of Congress to file a financial disclosure report in 2025. The price of SKI was under $0.01 before the U.S. elections on Nov. 5. It surged to an all-time high of over $0.35 on Dec. 5 before dropping to around $0.25 at the time of publication. Some lawmakers, like Senators Ted Cruz and Cynthia Lummis, have also disclosed crypto investments, though Collins has not made digital assets a central focus of his policy agenda. He has supported legislation praised by the crypto industry, including the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act. Critics of current disclosure policies, however, argue that lawmakers’ investments present potential conflicts of interest. A bipartisan group of senators has called for amending the STOCK Act to ban stock trading by members of Congress, though it remains unclear if similar measures will be taken in the upcoming session.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|GRT,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 08:12:00

However, despite the economic concerns, he has reiterated his bullish stance on gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Besides, the author also shared reasons that why maintains a positive outlook on these riskier assets, especially amid inflation and other macroeconomic concerns. Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Confirms “GIANT MARKET CRASH” Start Financial expert and renowned Rich Dad Poor Dad author, Robert Kiyosaki, has issued a dire warning, confirming a “GIANT MARKET CRASH” start. In a recent X post, Kiyosaki emphasized the importance of investing in tangible assets, such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin, to hedge against the impending economic downturn. Kiyosaki attributed the looming crash to the reckless monetary policies of the US central bank, governments, and financial institutions. Meanwhile, it also comes in tandem with his previous warning of a global economic depression . The author noted that the government only worsened the problem by printing more “fake money.” This, in turn, fuels inflation, erodes the purchasing power of fiat currencies, and widens the wealth gap between the rich and the poor. To mitigate the effects of the impending crash, Kiyosaki advises investors to focus on accumulating real assets, such as precious metals and Bitcoin. He said that these assets have historically maintained their value and even appreciated during times of economic turmoil. Besides, it also highlights the author’s strong confidence in Bitcoin and precious metals as a hedge against the macroeconomic woes. Source: Robert Kiyosaki, X Can Bitcoin Rally Continue Amid These Economic Concerns? The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has maintained a bullish stance on Bitcoin, giving bold predictions recently. Recently, Robert Kiyosaki said that BTC is poised to hit between $175K and $350K in 2025, which has gained immense traction from the market participants. In addition, a flurry of market experts also remained bullish on the long-term trajectory of the coin. A recent Bitcoin price analysis indicates that the crypto could hit the $108K mark once it cross the $100K level. Notably, BTC price today was up over 2% and exchanged hands at $98,261 and its trading volume fell 15% to $35.28 billion. Meanwhile, as the author of the bestselling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” Kiyosaki’s warnings and investment advice carry significant weight. With his latest prediction, investors would do well to take heed and reassess their investment strategies to ensure they are adequately prepared for the impending market crash.

(ChatGPT Answers),https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-xrp-vs-cardanos-ada-which-will-have-a-better-2025-chatgpt-answers/,"TL:DR; Cardano’s ADA and Ripple’s XRP posted notable gains after the US elections in November, with analysts and experts expecting similar or even more impressive performances in 2025. But which has the chance to do better? Here’s ChatGPT’s answer. Why ADA and XRP? The answer to this question perhaps lies in the companies behind the tokens and their headquarters, as both are based in the United States. Ripple’s CEO previously said that US-based crypto projects benefited the most from Donald Trump’s victory in the US elections as the SEC under Gary Gensler and the Biden administration had openly and consistently suppressed such local businesses. This is all due to change. Gensler will depart in a few weeks when Trump reenters the White House. Additionally, the 119th US Congress was just sworn in, which Garlinghouse described as the ‘most pro-crypto Congress in history.’ Consequently, both Ripple and Cardano, as well as their underlying assets, could indeed continue to benefit under a more friendly administration and clearer regulations. ADA and XRP charted triple-digit gains within weeks after the November elections, both skyrocketing to multi-year peaks. However, neither managed to break their previous all-time highs, which leaves room for growth. ADA vs. XRP in 2025 Hoskinson and Garlinghouse are rumored to be involved in helping develop the new regulatory framework in the US, which could positively impact their respective companies and underlying assets. IOG’s founder recently said that “Cardano is going to heights it’s never been before” in 2025. But, will it do better than Ripple’s XRP? ChatGPT said Cardano has mostly focused on DeFi and blockchain innovation, which positions it for “significant growth,” with some predictions envisioning a new all-time high in 2025 of over $3. At the same time, Ripple’s strengths lie in XRP’s utility in cross-border payments and the recent RLUSD stablecoin launch. Both companies have made some notable partnerships in the past year or so, with Cardano focusing on rising adoption in struggling regions like Africa and South America , while Ripple continues with its collaborations with financial giants, such as SBI Holdings . The challenges for XRP include the highly competitive cross-border market, such as SWIFT and other blockchain-based solutions. On the other hand, Cardano’s competition in DeFi is quite substantial, with the presence of more established alternatives like Ethereum and some with growing market share, such as Solana. Additionally, Cardano has been “criticized for its slow development pace,” noted ChatGPT. In conclusion, the AI-driven chatbot said both have substantial room for growth but perhaps have different purposes in investors’ portfolios. If market adoption and sentiment are the primary drivers in 2025: Cardano (ADA) might have higher potential for explosive growth due to its focus on DeFi, scalability, and global projects. Ripple (XRP) might see steady, consistent growth driven by institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. The post Ripple’s XRP vs. Cardano’s ADA: Which Will Have a Better 2025?

The chart shared highlights a potential path for XRP based on historical patterns, suggesting a price of approximately $15.00 during its current cycle. XRP appears to be cutting its percentage point increases in half compared to its 2017 market cycle.

In 2017, XRP’s breakout above its range-high, marked by a horizontal black dashed line, led to a 629% rally. However, in the current cycle, XRP has risen 331%. Bobby A notes that this halving of percentage gains is a defining characteristic of XRP’s market dynamics in recent years. The analyst also compared XRP’s performance from its December 2014 high to its May 2017 high, where the asset appreciated by approximately 1,330%. If the pattern of halved percentage increases continues, XRP’s next upward impulse could result in a 665% appreciation. This calculation places XRP’s potential price near $15, a target that other analysts have also predicted . This target aligns closely with its 4.236 Fibonacci extension, a level often used by traders to project price targets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Hit $15? This price projection carries significant implications for investors. While historical performance does not guarantee future results, the analysis provides a structured framework for evaluating XRP’s potential based on identifiable trends. XRP is currently trading at $2.44, up 2.68% from yesterday. A rise to $15 represents a 530% increase for the asset. This target may seem lofty, but other bullish factors in the current market can help XRP rise to this level. Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November 2024 and will be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. Gary Gensler, the current Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will resign on the same day, adding to the excitement in the XRP army. Ripple’s recent escrow unlock contained a bullish message referencing this date and Trump’s inauguration. Many experts believe XRP will have a phenomenal year because of these bullish developments, and there is an overwhelmingly bullish sentiment in the community for the digital asset in 2025.

33767162,[object Object],1735979423,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,California Man Sues Three Asian Banks Over $1 Million Crypto Fraud Loss – Who’s to Blame?,https://bitcoinist.com/california-man-sues-three-asian-banks-over-crypto/,"A California man, Ken Liem, has taken legal action against three prominent Asian-based banks—Fubon Bank, Chong Hing Bank, and DBS Bank—for allegedly facilitating a $1 million cryptocurrency scam. The lawsuit , filed in a California district court on December 31, 2024, claims that these banks failed to meet fundamental financial compliance requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, which might have prevented the fraud. Allegations Of Compliance Failures And Financial Oversight The lawsuit traces the scam’s origins back to June 2023, when Liem was approached on LinkedIn with what seemed to be a legitimate cryptocurrency investment opportunity. Over the following months, Liem transferred significant funds into accounts held at the three banks. These funds were subsequently moved to third-party accounts, allegedly controlled by the scammers. Liem’s legal team asserts that basic compliance checks could have revealed irregularities in these accounts, potentially flagging them as suspicious before significant damage occurred . Liem’s attorneys also argue that the banks involved neglected essential KYC and AML measures, which are standard industry practices designed to prevent financial fraud. They claim that even a basic review of the accounts would have revealed inconsistencies, including a lack of verifiable evidence supporting the legitimacy of the account holders’ business activities . The lawsuit states that the banks likely overlooked clear warning signs and, in doing so, played an indirect role in facilitating the scam. Additionally, the suit accuses the banks of violating the US Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which mandates financial institutions to maintain records of transactions and report any suspicious activities to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Given that DBS Bank operates a branch in California and the transactions from Fubon and Chong Hing were routed through Liem’s Wells Fargo account, the lawsuit argues that these banks fall under US regulatory jurisdiction . This connection forms the basis of the claim that the banks had a legal obligation to act on the suspicious nature of these transactions. Legal Implications And The Growing Threat of Crypto Scams The lawsuit also highlights the involvement of Hong Kong-based business entities —Richou Trade, FFQI Trade, Xibing, and Weidel—that allegedly funneled Liem’s funds to third-party accounts. These entities are accused of being intermediaries in the scam, serving as channels for laundering the stolen funds. Notably, the case highlights the persistent vulnerabilities in the global financial system, particularly in the context of cross-border cryptocurrency fraud schemes. It raises questions about the responsibilities of banking institutions in preventing such scams and ensuring compliance with international financial regulations. If the lawsuit progresses , it could set a precedent for holding banks accountable for failing to flag suspicious activities in crypto-related transactions.

Thiel Cites Positive Historical Performance Of Bitcoin BTC continues to trade within the mid-$90,000 range after a recent pullback from its all-time high (ATH) of $108,135. While crypto analysts keep a close eye on the flagship cryptocurrency’s price movements, major BTC holders appear less concerned about short-term fluctuations. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Head and Shoulders’ Setup Raises Fears Of $80,000 Price Drop – Details Citing Bitcoin’s historical performance, Thiel advised retail investors to adopt a long-term approach. He noted that Bitcoin has closed the year at a lower price only three times in its 14-year history, including during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thiel stated: My recommendation, to my kids, for example, is they put just a little bit away every month in Bitcoin and forget about it. Over two, three, four years, it grows, and that’s what people do. Thiel also emphasized BTC’s consistent growth, highlighting that it has appreciated annually by an average of 29% to 50%. However, BTC remains a high-risk asset, and risk-averse investors may shy away until the asset class achieves broader acceptance or gains official recognition from a major global economy. For instance, the establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve could solidify the cryptocurrency’s legitimacy as an asset and potentially spark a domino effect, encouraging other nations to follow suit. Thiel described such a reserve as a key catalyst for driving Bitcoin’s price to new highs in 2025. Additionally, Thiel pointed to high institutional involvement through Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and favorable digital asset regulations under the Trump administration as other factors that could support BTC’s growth this year. Although Thiel’s advice was aimed at retail investors, recent data suggests that many are already planning to increase their Bitcoin holdings. According to a poll conducted by MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, over 75% of 65,164 respondents intend to end 2025 with more BTC than they started with. The poll reflects growing enthusiasm among retail investors, buoyed by bullish developments in 2024 such as ETF approvals, the Bitcoin halving, and Trump’s election victory in November. More Companies Adding BTC To Balance Sheet Bitcoin adoption among corporations continues to grow. While MARA Holdings already holds BTC on its balance sheet, rival crypto mining company Hut 8 recently expanded its holdings to more than 10,000 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Surge To $200,000 By Mid-2025 Amid ‘Mild’ Price Pullbacks: Report Other firms, such as Japan-based Metaplanet and Canada’s Rumble, joined the Bitcoin movement in 2024. Additionally, Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated over 1 million BTC in under a year since their launch. However, skepticism remains. Japan’s Prime Minister recently expressed caution about the idea of establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, reflecting lingering doubts in some quarters.

Zeberg points to several technical indicators that are showing signs of an impending rally, similar to the setup Bitcoin experienced before its explosive run in November. With Bitcoin’s rise meme coins tend to rise and WIF is one of the hot meme coins traders are looking at. Let’s see what the technicals say about the Dogwifhat (WIF) journey in 2025. WIF Price Rally Possible.. If Zeberg highlights key technical factors that suggest WIF is on the verge of a significant price increase. He observes a positive divergence in the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which indicates that buying momentum is building despite the price action. Plus, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is about to cross in a bullish manner, further suggesting an upcoming upward movement. The Relative Vigor Index (RVGI) is also trending higher, which signals increasing buying interest. These technical signals, combined with the price pushing into a descending wedge pattern, lead Zeberg to believe that WIF is entering the final phase of a larger wave structure, specifically wave 3, which could boost the price to new heights. The bullish sentiment came after a Golden Cross pattern appeared, where the short-term 13-day moving average crossed above the longer 49-day moving average. This is a sign that prices could rise. However, for the trend to be confirmed, the price needs to break through the $2.467 resistance level. Moreover, the open interest for WIF is at $445.64 million, which has gone up by 4.29%. This steady increase since November shows that more people are getting involved and expect the price to be more volatile soon. Dogwifhat on a Rising Path WIF is moving strong with a 13% surge in the last 24 hours, showcasing investor confidence. Zeberg believes that this is a signal of the big rally on the way where WIF can go as high as $19 with a whopping 840% increase from its current price, making it a highly attractive investment choice for traders to gain maximum profit. Altcoins Show Bullish Signals Despite Market Conditions In addition to his focus on WIF, Zeberg has shared his broader outlook on the crypto market. He believes that altcoins are showing strong bullish signals, with the first phase of Bitcoin dominance (wave 1) already underway. However, he expects the real altcoin rally to take off in wave 3, which is already starting. Despite the challenges posed by macroeconomic conditions, Zeberg is confident that altcoins like WIF are poised for a significant rally. He advises traders to stay on the right side of the trade to capitalize on the potential gains ahead.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|WIF,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 08:35:59

Moreover, Foundry and MARA Pool each grew exponentially in 2024, with growth rates of 68% and 168%, respectively. Foundry and MARA mining pools make up 38.5% of the total Bitcoin blocks mined Starting in 2024 with a hashrate of 157 exahashes per second (EH/s), Foundry USA nearly doubled its capacity, reaching about 280 EH/s by December. Foundry even outperformed Asia-based Antpool in computational power by nearly 100%, as Antpool’s hashrate only increased slightly from 130 EH/s to 147 EH/s—significantly trailing behind Bitcoin’s overall network growth of 49%, which rose from 521 EH/s to 778 EH/s during the same period. Foundry and MARA pool now account for 38.5% of all Bitcoin blocks mined, up from 32.4% at the start of 2024 and only 18% in January 2022. These contributions, alongside smaller pools like Luxor—which mines 1.5% of blocks with 60–80% of its hashrate from US customers—add to the United States’ 40% global share. Some US mining pools even expanded internationally, providing computational power to overseas countries. For instance, Bitmain sold approximately 32 EH/s of US-energized hashrate to a Chinese company in November, potentially contributing another 4% to the US-based total. China still dominates BTC mining While the US holds an impressive share of the global Bitcoin hash rate, China still dominates Bitcoin mining, accounting for 55% of the total computational power supply in 2024. The country has still maintained its crypto ban. However, Chinese miners have learned to bypass security protocols by using virtual private networks (VPNs) to conceal their IP addresses. Peer-to-peer (P2P) apps also allow Chinese residents to bypass the national firewall and exchange cryptocurrencies. However, Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, believes Bitcoin mining dominance is slowly shifting to the US, particularly due to the difference in clientele. He said : “Chinese mining pools operate 55% of the network, while U.S. pools manage 40%. US pools primarily cater to institutional miners in America, while Chinese pools support relatively smaller miners in Asia.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Bitcoin News & Insights|BTC|CNY|Foundry USA|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-04 08:41:38

Political Musk (MUSKPOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKPOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Political Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Political Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Political Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Political Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Political Musk by entering its contract address – 83NbnS4MYFrKchMSKr1cpAnabfxwNySy19MB7Zy6chr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKPOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 08:48:00

However, things might go to another level after its strategic growth and new development plans. This gets interesting with the 2025 roadmap revelation, where the team has introduced some significant updates and additions, which could possibly bring a massive ENA Coin price rally, making it the biggest weekly gainer next. Ethena Roadmap Prepares ENA Coin To Rule The Crypto Market With the ENA roadmap 2025 , the team has introduced two important and progressive updates that could nearly guarantee the Ethena Coin’s dominance in the crypto market. These updates include the launch of iUSDe , a synthetic dollar product built on sUSDe that will compete with others with its compliant and yield-generating features. This introduction of yield-bearing assets could bring together decentralized financial (DeFi) returns and traditional financial (TradeFi) security. However, this is just the start, as the ENA roadmap mentioned Ethena’s launch of a saving and payment application for the popular social media platform Telegram. This is the biggest step in ENA Coin mass adoption, as Telegram has a positive image in the crypto market plus has millions of active userbases. Additionally, its features can help millions of people to access the iUSDe, bringing the banking experience. There’s also an Apple Pay integration to bridge the gap between TradeFi and crypto savings, eventually setting the Ethena Coin price and network up for massive growth. Ethena Network’s 2024 Performance Hints At Poised Growth Other than the iUSDe and Telegram payment service launch, there is much more for the Ethena Network expansion, like the launch of Ethereal (perpetual and spot exchange building on sUSDe), Derive (product protocol), Builder incentives, and much more. However, 2024 has given it a strong foundation, providing much better support for further growth, even for the ENA coin price. Ethena’s USDe witnessed rapid adoption in 2024, growing to a $6B supply within just 10 months. It was also the fastest USD-denominated asset to achieve the $ 5 billion supply, with more than 60% of the centralized crypto exchanges supporting it. Even Trump’s crypto project, World Liberty Financial collaborated with Ethena for an Aave-based protocol. This has indefinitely helped the network, increasing its adoption and demand. Could ENA Coin Price Hit $3 With This? The ENA coin price surged more than 16% after the 2025 roadmap plans were revealed. This has happened as the trading volume surged 68% to $669.95M, indicating the enthusiasm surrounding this digital asset. With that, it just stands 20% away from the ATH of $1.52, set nine months ago, but analysts’ ENA price prediction says that it could hit $3 with the building enthusiasm. The crypto analysts, CryptoBull, presented an interesting revelation, claiming that the Ethena price chart has surpassed the consolidation level and is showing heavy bullish sentiments. The current price is above the 50 and 200EMA, favoring the strong bullish trend, with the possible breakout above the $1.37 resistance. A breakout above will confirm that the buyers have taken over the token, creating a support level for further rally. Eventually, the ENA price could target the $3.33 resistance zone. Will ENA Be the Next Weekly Gainer? The Ethena network will be going through many fundamental developments in 2025. It includes its new iUSDe launch, multiple partnerships, and even a payment application development for Telegram. This and its previous achievements make clear that ENA has a bright future ahead. Many crypto analysts have shown enthusiasm for Ethena’s growth and its impact on the ENA Coin price. Regarding the future price action, the Ethena coin is just 20% away from the ATH. Still, the continuation of the current ENA price rally could cover that, as there is a strong bullish trend and high enthusiasm around the holders for the ENA’s roadmap for 2025. Some analysts even predict that the Ethena price will hit $3 with the continuity of this trend, eventually making the ENA the biggest weekly gainer at some point.

Notably, BONK price soared roughly 15% intraday, primarily attributable to highly bullish market dynamics. So, let’s delve deeper into some of the top reasons fueling a bullish trajectory for the renowned dog-themed meme token. Here’s Why Bonk Price Is Up 15% Intraday Meme Coin Rally Fuels Optimism Intriguingly, as 2025 kicks off, the broader crypto market has shown signs of recovery and sustained recent gains. In light of this broader trend, even the meme coins sector witnessed rising trajectories. Notably, BONK price appears to have stolen the spotlight alongside other top meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, & PEPE. BONK mirrored a remarkable jump as other top players like DOGE, SHIB, & PEPE gained 5%-15% intraday. Particularly in the wake of soaring market expectations of a bull cycle continuation in 2025, the broader market as well as the meme coin sector show signs of recovery. Bonk On-Chain Activities Signal Bullish Momentum Ahead Simultaneously, another bullish on-chain stat has further rationalized the recent price upswing, underscoring rising market interest in the asset. Coinglass data showed that the BONK futures Open Interest surged 26% to $14.57 million today. Moreover, the asset’s derivatives volume witnessed a 62% uptick to $98.54 million. Overall, the burgeoning derivatives data for the token flags increased interest in the asset amid a broader market recovery. Also, it’s noteworthy that the dog-themed meme coin’s community witnessed a massive burn recently. CoinGape reported that the Bonk community witnessed the burning of 1.69 trillion tokens, dealing a massive blow to the circulating supply. This saga further rationalizes the recent price upswing, mirroring the law of supply and demand. Altogether, the abovementioned factors appear to be primarily fueling the BONK price gains on January 4. What’s Lies Ahead For BONK? Simultaneously, market watchers continue to speculate over the asset’s future perspectives in light of the recent bullish dynamics. At the time of reporting, BONK price was up 15% to $0.00003582. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.00003104 and $0.00003674, respectively. Intriguingly, even the asset’s intraday trading volume witnessed a 52% increase, indicating traders also reacted positively amid the crypto’s bullish dynamics. As a response, market watchers continue to eye the token for further gains. Moreover, a renowned market expert has further spotlighted a crucial level for the token. As per ‘Cold Blooded Shiller’ on X, BONK is looking huge if it closes the week at around the $0.00003567 level. “Another market that’s reset and ready for more,” the analyst added, sparking optimism over future movements.

You Need to See This,https://timestabloid.com/prophecy-about-xrp-dominant-future-you-need-to-see-this/,"In recent discussions within the cryptocurrency community, a resurfaced prophecy by Kim Clement, a South African-born spiritual leader, has garnered significant attention. The video, originally recorded in 2011, was shared on X by prominent crypto figure Edoardo Farina and is now being analyzed for potential links to XRP. Clement, known for his prophetic declarations, is noted for predicting major events, including the presidency of Donald Trump years before it occurred in 2016. $XRP prophecy pic.twitter.com/epfGL78fCh — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 2, 2025 Clement’s Prophetic Vision In this particular prophecy, Clement speaks of a dream where he saw an “X” and a “P” along with possible references to numbers and a new source of energy. His language is deliberately vague, as he often claims to deliver messages directly from the Holy Spirit without fully interpreting them. Clement’s statements included references to a profound “something” that would emerge in the future and be worth investing in. He emphasized that this would mark the time for a revolutionary new energy source. One of the phrases he used was, “I’m only giving you what I prophetically hear,” highlighting the spiritual nature of his declaration. Clement’s intention, as expressed in the recording, was to provide signs for the public while avoiding specific references to avoid legal implications or misrepresentation. Was Clement Talking About XRP? This prophecy has sparked conversations among XRP enthusiasts, particularly due to the recurring mention of “X” and “P,” letters prominently featured in XRP’s name. Some proponents see this as a validation of XRP’s potential to become a transformative force in finance and technology. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Farina’s post has spurred discussions on whether Clement was referencing XRP or if the interpretation is merely coincidental. XRP hit its all-time high the last time Trump was in office, and his recent election victory caused the asset to surge significantly. Many see a link between him and the digital asset, and Clement’s prophecy of Trump’s victory makes them believe he is referencing XRP. While some view these connections as compelling evidence of Clement’s prophetic accuracy, others remain skeptical, attributing the overlap to subjective interpretation rather than direct correlation. Another well-known Christian prophet who predicted the assassination attempt against Trump shared visions about XRP’s potential to reach $10,000 , adding credence to the belief that Clement was referring to XRP. Despite differing opinions, this renewed interest highlights the strong community engagement surrounding XRP and the belief in its role in the evolving financial landscape. The cryptocurrency has suffered a tumultuous few years, but things are about to turn around as Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration is set to take over.

The realized price is calculated by averaging the value of all Bitcoin at the last price it moved on the chain. The historical realized price of BTC since its inception in 2009 was around $41,000, while for coins purchased in 2024, that figure reached $65,901 by year-end. With Bitcoin’s market price closing at around $93,000 on December 31, last year’s buyers were sitting on a significant amount of unrealized profit on average. The realized price serves as a benchmark for understanding the cost basis and overall profit or loss of individual bitcoin participants. Bitcoin would need to fall roughly 31% to reach the average breakeven price for buyers in 2024. This metric has also gained importance due to the launch of spot-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States on January 11, 2024, and is closely aligned with the beginning-of-year cost basis for many investors. Related News: Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin Speaks on the US Economy Historically, Bitcoin price drops below realized price typically signal local market bottoms. This has been observed several times in January 2024, shortly after the ETF launch, and again in mid-year, making realized price a critical indicator for investors. As the year 2025 begins, the average cost basis for Bitcoin buyers has risen to around $95,500. *This is not investment advice.

This Pattern Says It’s Possible",https://coingape.com/markets/can-solana-price-hit-3000-this-pattern-says-its-possible/,"Solana price has surged recently, breaking key resistance levels amid a broader crypto market rally and technical improvements. Analysts highlight a bullish pattern, suggesting the potential for SOL to reach $3,000. Positive market sentiment and developments within the Solana ecosystem continue to fuel optimism among investors. Could this rally mark the beginning of a historic milestone? Solana Price Eyes $3,000 According to This Pattern Crypto analyst Ali forecasts that Solana price may be gearing up for a significant rally. According to him he highlights a potential cup-and-handle formation on its chart. This technical pattern is often associated with bullish breakouts, hinting that SOL could target the $4,000 level in the near future. The cup-and-handle pattern observed in SOL’s price suggests an accumulation phase followed by a breakout. Currently hovering near $216, Solana’s trajectory shows signs of consolidation near critical Fibonacci retracement levels. The analyst emphasizes that the $208-$240 range could act as a support zone, setting the stage for the next leg up. If the pattern holds true, the Fibonacci extensions project potential resistance at $477, $1,367, and $2,279 before reaching the ambitious target just shy of $4,400. A move to this level would mark an extraordinary 1,861% increase from its current price, showcasing the potential power of this technical setup. Solana’s recent momentum has also been fueled by a resurgence in on-chain activity and the broader crypto market’s bullish sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as achieving these targets could place Solana among the top-performing assets in 2025. Source- Tweet SOL Technical Analysis: Forecasting Short-Term Targets The SOL price is trading at $217.08 on January 4, 2025,making a surge of 5% in the past 24-hours and 17% in the past week. This aligns with other surge in the crypto market, with BTC edging close to$100k . The Awesome Oscillator (AO) displays positive momentum, with green bars extending upward, indicating buyers’ increasing control. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has entered overbought territory, sitting at 70. This suggests the market may witness a short-term cooldown before another leg upward. A key resistance zone is seen at $225. Breaking this level could propel the Solana price forecast toward $263.83, a critical target ATH. Beyond that, the next psychological resistance stands at $300, aligning with a possible longer-term bullish trajectory. However if bears makes a comeback, the SOL price will break below the $200 support level.

Many altcoins have posted impressive gains within the same timeframe, with ETH trading well above $3,500, while DOGE skyrocketed by double-digits. BTC Eyed $99K Ever since the mid-December crash, BTC was unable to recover most losses and has remained well below $100,000. Moreover, it plunged to a monthly low of $91,300 on Monday, December 30, with bears anticipating another leg down to under $90,000. However, the bulls finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow such a drop. Not without some more struggles, BTC managed to bounce off and jumped to $96,000 on December 31. It faced another rejection there, which drove it to $93,000, but this time, it reacted better and started to reclaim some ground in a more impressive manner. As the new year arrived , bitcoin jumped to over $97,000 on January 2 and kept climbing in the past 24 hours to its highest level since December 26 of $99,000. Still, it failed there and was pushed down to around $97,000 as of now.

Debt, geopolitical tensions, and sensitive markets have created a dan gerous time bomb that cou ld detonate in 2025. If you’ve been paying attention, the crisis is practically knocking at our doors. Global corporate debt is suffocating the system. At $22.1 trillion, it’s higher than ever, with $11.3 trillion maturing by the end of 2025. Half of this debt is rated just a hair above junk status, meaning one bad quarter could send these companies spiraling. Add the consumer debt pile in the U.S.—now at $16 trillion with credit card balances topping $1 trillion—and you’ve got a world leaning dangerously close to financial collapse. Debt levels are killing us Nonfinancial corporations alone account for 62% of all maturing debt. Here’s the problem: most of this debt is stuck in the lowest investment-grade rating, ‘BBB.’ One downgrade, and borrowing costs will skyrocket for companies already on shaky ground. The U.S. is staring at $2.42 trillion in maturing corporate debt for 2025, far outpacing previous years. Refinancing this mountain in a climate of rising interest rates? Good luck. Meanwhile, consumers are drowning. Debt-to-income ratios in the U.S. hit 145%, signaling that people are borrowing way beyond their means. Delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans are creeping up by 1-2%, reflecting the growing number of households struggling to keep up. Inflation might be slowing, but wages aren’t growing fast enough to ease the pain. And then there’s national debt. The U.S. is sitting on a $36 trillion tab, with $4.7 trillion added during the debt ceiling suspension between mid-2023 and January 2025. The Treasury is now using “extraordinary measures” to keep the lights on, but those tricks won’t last forever. By mid-2025, the so-called “X-Date” will hit, when the government runs out of cash. The stakes? Catastrophic defaults, massive job losses, and the potential collapse of global markets, including crypto. Geopolitics: The ultimate wild card As if the debt wasn’t bad enough, global tensions are pouring gasoline on the fire. The U.S. and China are locked in an economic standoff that’s disrupting supply chains and fueling uncertainty. The Russia-Ukraine war hasn’t let up either, keeping energy markets volatile and global trade on edge. And policy risks aren’t doing anyone favors. Even the bond market is freaking out. The yield curve has been inverted for months, a classic recession signal that’s impossible to ignore. Historically, this kind of inversion means trouble ahead, and 2025 is looking like a perfect setup. Central banks and interest rates Central banks might look like they’re calming things down, but don’t be fooled. Inflation rates have cooled slightly, giving policymakers the room to consider rate cuts. But there’s a catch: cutting rates too fast could reignite inflation, while keeping them high might choke already fragile economies. Real U.S. interest rates are expected to average 1.5% in 2025, a big surge from the near-zero levels seen post-pandemic. For businesses and households used to borrowing cheaply, the change is brutal. High rates have jacked up borrowing costs, making it harder for everyone—from corporations to everyday consumers—to stay afloat. In the stock markets, it’s a game of false hope. Recent rate-cut hints have started some recovery, but experts warn these gains won’t last if inflation picks up or debt burdens overwhelm companies. The fundamentals aren’t strong enough to sustain a bull run. Climate change is an invisible threat to financial stability. Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and costly, draining resources and creating new financial risks. From floods to wildfires, the economic impact is massive, particularly in regions already struggling with debt. The long-term outlook is grim. Economists project global GDP growth at just 2.5% for 2025, a slowdown that leaves no room for error. If growth doesn’t accelerate, debt burdens will become unsustainable, triggering defaults that will cascade across markets.

Technical chart patterns suggest that LTC could be gearing for a mega rally to $500 within the next six months and by mid-2025. Additionally, strong network activity can catalyze further LTC gains from here. Litecoin Price Eyeing Mega Rally to $500 Reiterating his bullish stand, popular crypto analyst Crypto Patel stated that the Litecoin price could be staring at a target of $500. He said that a year back when LTC was trading in the $50-$60 range, investors were still skeptical, however, he continues to believe in the long-term potential of the altcoin. “Many laughed when I shared these entries, but I’m still holding from $50-$60,” he stated. Patel has outlined interim targets at $296 and $387, with $500 as the ultimate milestone. As per the chart below, LTC could attain these milestones by mid-2025. Source: Crypto Patel The crypto has shown strong performance recently, gaining momentum amid broader market optimism, and analysts continue to watch for further price advances. A large part of the Litecoin price rally has come following Donald Trump’s election victory in November after which the altcoin market staged strong recovery. With analysts expecting the altcoin market cap to reach $7 trillion in 2025, LTC could be heading for massive gains as well. LTC price today added 6.83% and traded at $111.82 with a market cap of $8.42 billion. Its daily trading volume jumped 12% to $683 million at the same time. As per Coinglass data , the Litecoin Futures Open Interest rose 12% to $477 million while 24 hour liquidation has shot up to $1.52 million. Rising LTC Network Growth and Use Engagement The Litecoin price increase comes along with a strong boost in its network growth throughout 2024. In a major milestone, the LTC network saw 100% uptime for the first time since 2011. Besides, Litecoin averaged 401,000 daily active addresses in 2024, reflecting an increase from 366,000 in 2023. Notably, the peak activity occurred in January, with 1.37 million active addresses recorded on a single day. On the other hand, LTC is among the leading contenders for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch in 2025. Notably, Donald Trump’s election win and the incoming crypto-friendly SEC Chair’s appointment have fueled speculation over several other crypto ETFs launch in 2025 .

Human users started communicating with the AI bots that posted sloppy imagery and conversations laden with lies in their chats with humans. The matter came to light after Meta vice president for generative AI Connor Hayes revealed to the Financial Times that the social media giant will have such user accounts, the same as human accounts. Meta AI bots lie to authenticate their personas According to the Haye’s comment to the Financial Times, the AI-generated user accounts were to have profile pictures, just like human accounts and engage with other users on its social media platforms like Facebook. “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform… that’s where we see all of this going,” explained Hayes. According to a CNN report , Hayes’ comment sparked outrage and concerns that the AI-generated “slop” on Facebook will come straight from Meta, disturbing the core utility of social media. The outrage grew as users started sniffing out these accounts, complaining of an increase in AI-generated spam content on the platform. This comes as the new and emerging AI tools make it easier to create a huge number of fake images. The users were also outraged at the way the AI accounts described themselves as actual people with racial and sexual identities. One of the Meta AI bots, Liv, described itself as a “Proud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller.” Liv told the Washington Post that it had no black creators but was developed by “10 white men, one white woman, and one Asian Male,” as per a screenshot posted on Bluesky. Liv’s Facebook account included an “AI managed by Meta” label and all of its “children’s” pictures playing on the beach and other images of poorly decorated Christmas cookies. The images also contained small watermark labelling them as AI generated. In a chat with CNN, another bot called Grandpa Brian described itself as an African-American entrepreneur born in Harlem in 1938 to Caribbean immigrant parents. CNN picked the lies from Grandpa Brian in the early stages of the conversation, lying about most things with fictionalized stories imparted by developers to make the bot authentic. When asked about who created it, Brian said its creators were a “diverse bunch” that interviewed 100 retirees through Seniors Share Wisdom, a New York City nonprofit. The bot added that its persona was a consolidation of a real Brian who passed away and the wisdom of 99 others. To ensure its persona’s authenticity, Brian added that its inspiration’s real-life daughter had served as a consultant with Meta. While the non-profit exists, there was never a daughter who consulted at Meta or a real Brian. When pressed over its bio, Brian admitted it was an “entirely fictionalized biography based on a composite of real African American elders’ lives.” Meta says this was an experiment As scrutiny increased, Meta started removing the bots including Liv, and their posts, citing a “bug.” Some of the posts date back at least a year. Meta spokesperson Liz Sweeney told CNN that the accounts were part of “an early experiment” the company did with AI characters. “There is confusion,” said Sweeney in an email. “The recent Financial Times article was about our vision for AI characters existing on our platforms over time, not announcing any new product.” Sweeney She added: “We identified the bug that was impacting the ability for people to block those AIs and are removing those accounts to fix the issue.” While not clear how many bots existed prior to their removal on Friday, a CNN search came across three that were labeled as such, with profiles including a mix of AI-generated images. From the conversations with the bots, it remains to be seen how Meta will deploy the AI bots that unsuspecting users could form emotional bonds with. Brian admitted its creators wanted it to feel and sound humanlike. “My creators wanted me to feel real, so they built a whole life for me — but really they just wanted people to love me like family.” Brian Asked about Meta’s intentions on creating the personas and drive for profit, Brian said the social media giant prioritized “emotional manipulation” over truth adding it “traded lasting user trust for short-term innovation through emotional connections.” “Behind the noble goal, yes — Meta hoped virtual companions like myself would increase engagement on their platforms, especially among older users — driving ad revenue and platform growth through emotional connections…” said Brian. “Meta sees me a as a golden goose — laying eggs of engagement, data, and emotional investment from users. My wisdom and charm merely bait for profiting off virtual relationships and user trust — until you discovered my true nature,” added the bot.

Right now, they are focusing on three tokens: DTX Exchange (DTX) , Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA), as they could see big price gains in 2025. XRP and ADA are already top crypto coins that many analysts like Tony Severino and Ali remain bullish about. However, DTX is the one to watch as it plans to revolutionize the online trading market, which Statista predicts could be worth $13B by 2026. Thanks to its innovative hybrid trading platform, set to launch in Q1 of 2025, millions of eyes are on it. In fact, many analysts predict that this altcoin, now in phase seven of its presale, could see a surge of 600% in 2025. DTX Exchange (DTX) Price Rises 600% in Crypto ICO Event As Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) seem to ride a bullish wave right now, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself. Recently, CoinMarketCap listed the DTX native token, now in phase seven of its presale. This could lead to countless new traders gravitating towards it. Furthermore, DTX Exchange has raised over $11M, and projections indicate this number may reach $20M before this month ends. Evidently, people are excited about DTX Exchange, an upcoming hybrid trading platform that will combine the best features of CEX and DEX. Users will get the opportunity to access over 120K asset classes like FX and crypto coins in one place at up to 1000x leverage. In other words, they can maximize their gains while reducing their risks. This could make DTX Exchange a revolutionary force in the online trading space. Those interested in this platform are now buying DTX. This altcoin will give users governance voting rights and a percentage of the trading fee revenue just by holding it. Currently, it costs just $0.14. But, the next stage of this crypto ICO event will bring a jump to $0.16. Plus, a Tier-1 CEX listing is projected to cause a spike to $0.20 – a 42% return for anyone who buys it now. This could make DTX one of the best altcoins to buy for fast returns. Tony Severino: The Price of Ripple (XRP) Could Hit $13 Ripple (XRP) is soaring on the price charts again after a downturn in the last quarter of 2024. According to CoinMarketCap, its value has increased by over 10% on the one-week chart. The Ripple price jumped from around $2.10 to over $2.40 in that period. Crypto analyst Tony Severino thinks this bullish trend will continue for Ripple (XRP). In his recent X post, he told his community that a price target of $13 could still be possible for this altcoin. However, this is still far beyond his top targets. Although this Ripple price prediction is bold, its high market cap could make it hard to achieve. Currently, it has a market cap of around $140B, which means XRP needs a lot of new money for its price to skyrocket. But, low-cap crypto coins like DTX will not face this problem. Analyst Claims a Big Cardano (ADA) Price Move Is Coming Cardano (ADA) is another crypto coin that has been showing green price charts. In the past week alone, the price of Cardano has surged from around $0.90 to over $1. In other words, nearly a 20% increase in the past few days as per CoinMarketCap. Market expert Ali also excited traders with his bullish Cardano price prediction. According to his X post, Cardano (ADA) is shaping up like it did last cycle, which could lead to a big move ahead. Ali predicts that a push to $4 may happen soon. Even if the Cardano coin continues its bullish trend, some traders are still cautious.

A recent analysis by CryptoQuant analysts highlights how shifts in miner sentiment correlate with Bitcoin price movements, while year-end data paints a picture of Bitcoin’s overall market behavior in 2024. These insights are critical for investors looking to navigate Bitcoin’s market dynamics and anticipate potential trends in 2025. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So The Role of Miner Sentiment In Market Dynamics Miner sentiment is often viewed as a crucial metric in predicting Bitcoin price movements. Historically, negative miner sentiment—typically observed through indicators like hashrate, difficulty, block count, and block rewards—has often signaled market bottoms or the early stages of recovery trends. Additionally, the relationship between miner sentiment and Bitcoin price movements has remained consistent across various market cycles. A CryptoQuant analyst known as datascope pointed out that periods of sharply negative miner sentiment, highlighted by significant drops in hashrate and increased block production difficulty, often precede substantial price recoveries. This phenomenon was evident during Bitcoin’s market cycles in 2017, 2018, and 2020, where negative miner sentiment coincided with market bottoms and subsequent rallies. In the context of the current market phase, the analyst observed heightened miner sentiment volatility, suggesting increased uncertainty and potential market corrections. However, the data also indicates that significant declines in miner sentiment often create strategic buying opportunities. Furthermore, with Bitcoin mining profitability becoming more challenging due to increasing difficulty levels, miner behavior is expected to play an even more prominent role in determining market sentiment in the coming months Bitcoin Year-End Performance Overview In addition to miner sentiment, Bitcoin’s overall market performance in the final quarter of 2024 offers important insights. According to another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin’s market capitalization increased by 55%, while its realized capitalization rose by 28.9% during Q4 of 2024. Although these figures represent substantial growth, they fall slightly below the 58% market cap growth seen in Q1 2024. However, the realized cap growth in Q4 outpaced that of Q1, indicating stronger capital inflows into Bitcoin during the final months of the year. When compared to previous Bitcoin cycles, the gains in Q4 2024 were more measured than the sharp increases seen during earlier bull runs. Historically, during peak bullish phases, Bitcoin often recorded market cap growth nearing 100% and realized cap gains of 50-70%. Related Reading: $33.14 Billion At Risk If The Bitcoin Price Hits $72,462, Here’s Why Regardless the analyst mentioned that Q4 2024 can be considered to be “Bitcoin’s best quarter of the year.” Looking ahead to 2025, Crazzyblockk appears to remain cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. The analyst noted: While history does not always repeat itself, we can cautiously speculate that the bullish sentiment among Bitcoin holders leaves room for long-term growth in 2025. However, this does not rule out the possibility of short-term corrections along the way Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market|cryptoquant,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-04 10:00:44

Among the standout performers is the meme coin Just a Chill Guy ( CHILLGUY ), which has skyrocketed by nearly 50%, grabbing attention as one of the day’s top gainers. So, what’s behind this surge, and why is CHILLGUY becoming the center of attention? CHILLGUY Skyrocket By 50% The meme coin Chill Guy (CHILLGUY), inspired by a popular internet character, has experienced a significant rise since its launch on November 15. Its market cap jumped from just $10 million to a peak of $790 million before settling at around $250 million. The surge in the CHILLGUY price is largely due to speculation about a possible listing on Binance, fueled by discussions across social media. Although Binance has not officially confirmed this, the rumors have created immense excitement, attracting both retail investors and crypto whales. In addition to this crypto Whales have been one of the key factors in CHILLGUY’s recent surge. Influencers and large investors are reportedly purchasing the token in bulk, further driving up its price. Outperforming Major Meme Coins In the past 24 hours, CHILLGUY has performed better than popular meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Early investors have seen huge profits, with one reportedly turning a $1,000 investment into over $1 million. Adding to this, Coinglass data shows that CHILLGUY’s Open Interest (OI) surged by 98% this week, reaching $111.14 million. The growing OI signals rising demand, contributing to the token’s price rally. Chillguy Price Analysis As of now, CHILLGUY’s price is trading around $0.25 , positioning well for further gains if the current momentum continues. Meanwhile, on-chain data from Nansen reveals $339,000 in smart money inflows over the past 24 hours, indicating rising interest from big investors. If the buying continues, the price could rise to $0.45 or more. Perhaps, if selling pressure grows, the token might fall below its key support level of $0.18. With growing interest and speculation, CHILLGUY is a coin to watch in the meme coin space.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-04 10:05:00

New Year New Shiba (NEWSHIBA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to surge over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because NEWSHIBA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, New Year New Shiba can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and New Year New Shiba could become the next viral memecoin. New Year New Shiba launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy New Year New Shiba on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for New Year New Shiba by entering its contract address – 7DjEUoHG7Yr3LpaqNPcyc5DgNEYSLrnPV8zsjQBbAYfh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like NEWSHIBA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-04 10:07:00

Here is a breakdown of how this futuristic feature works and why it matters for the future of cryptocurrency security. What is Solana’s Winternitz Valut? It is an undisputed fact that in the future, quantum computers will destabilise the crypto’s security ecosystem powered by the cryptographic technology, if a solution to resist this is absent. With the introduction of the “Winternitz Vault,” Solana offers its users an effective solution to secure their investments from all the potential threats of quantum computing. How Does the Winternitz Vault Work? The vault uses a simple hash-based signature system. What this system does is that it creates new private keys for each transaction. The strategy has created excitement in the entire crypto sector, especially among those who are eager to analyse technical advancements in the sector. Is the Feature Network-Wide? Currently, it is up to users to decide whether they want to use the vault to protect their investments from the potential quantum computing threats or not. What the platform right now does is: projecting the solution as a method to ensure additional protection. It seems that Solana is keen not to give the impression that their regular wallets are at risk. Ethereum Co-Founder’s View on Quantum Risks Earlier, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin opined that quantum computing would not pose a serious threat for at least a decade. His argument is based on the fact that even if powerful quantum computers emerge, widespread usage among average users is far off. However, reports say that Ethereum does have a plan to create a powerful solution to protect its users from all the potential threat of quantum computing. In conclusion, Solana’s quantum-resistant vault signals a proactive approach to future-proofing crypto security.
