While some, like AAVE, are showing signs of strength, others, like MANA, remain in consolidation mode, waiting their turn in the spotlight, according to the analyst. Martinez noted that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market due to a combination of strong rhetoric and fundamentals. The key factors include: The growing importance of the US Bitcoin Reserve. Anticipation surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock's 2% portfolio allocation recommendation to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is included in the Nasdaq 100. Martinez noted that Ethereum (ETH) has historically outperformed Bitcoin every December, pointing to the importance of timing and positioning. “If you’re investing in altcoins, the important thing is to get into projects with strong fundamentals early on,” he said. Martinez warned investors not to chase memecoins and be tempted by the lure of quick riches, instead focusing on altcoins with real utility and strong fundamentals that have a better chance of generating sustainable gains. Related News: An Extraordinary Proposal for Bitcoin: ""Make 1 Satoshi Now 1 BTC"" According to Martinez, several altcoins stand out as potential winners in the next market cycle: Worldcoin (WLD): A new project that aims to revolutionize identity and global finance. Uniswap (UNI): Leading decentralized exchange with a proven track record. AAVE: A DeFi leader that is already showing its strength. Chainlink (LINK): The home of widely adopted decentralized oracles. Maker (MKR): A stablecoin and one of the cornerstones of DeFi. ONDO: Positioned to capitalize on the narrative of tokenized real-world assets. Solana (SOL): Known for its speed, scalability, and thriving ecosystem. BNB: Exchange token with wide usage and market relevance. “These are not just ‘hype coins,’” Martinez said. “These are projects with solid use cases that can weather market volatility.” “For sustainable gains, position yourself where the smart money is flowing,” he said, suggesting that the next altcoin season may be closer than expected. *This is not investment advice.

Qubetics Brings a Fresh Start for High-Growth Investments,https://thecoinrise.com/did-you-overlook-crypto-trends-qubetics-brings-a-fresh-start-for-high-growth-investments/,"Have you ever wondered what might have been if you’d acted on early crypto trends? AAVE is a prime example of a project that started small but exploded into a major force in decentralised finance. It began quietly, with many sceptical of its potential, but today, AAVE is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. If you missed the boat then, you’re not alone. Luckily, new opportunities are always around the corner. This time, Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in with its groundbreaking innovations and a presale that’s catching the eye of investors.

It started as ETHLend in 2017, launching with an ICO that priced its tokens at just $0.0162. At the time, decentralised finance was still a niche concept, and many overlooked its potential. Fast forward to today, AAVE has grown into a powerhouse, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their assets without traditional intermediaries.

Partnerships and integrations have only added to its credibility, making it a long-term success story. For those who missed out on AAVE’s early days, the regret is real. Its value has multiplied many times over, showing what’s possible when you invest early in a project with strong fundamentals.

BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now – Don’t Regret It Twice!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bonks-moonshot-btfd-coin-is-the-best-meme-coin-presale-to-join-now-dont-regret-it-twice/,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on meme coins, you’ve probably heard of BONK. It exploded onto the scene as Solana’s first dog-themed meme coin, driving a frenzy in the crypto world. Back when it launched, early adopters were laughing all the way to the bank, turning tiny investments into jaw-dropping gains. BONK wasn’t just another token; it was a movement, a viral sensation. But here’s the thing – if you weren’t there to grab BONK during its early days, you might’ve missed the chance to cash in big time. Fast forward to today, BONK still holds a solid spot in the meme coin landscape, but the astronomical gains are harder to catch now. As it stabilises, those dreams of turning a hundred bucks into a small fortune feel like a distant memory. If you’re wondering whether history will repeat itself, well, it kind of is—but not with BONK. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a meme coin rewriting the playbook and turning heads during its explosive presale phase. Why BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now Launched with the mantra “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD Coin has become the hottest topic in crypto circles. With over $3.9 million raised in its presale and a price of $0.00013 per coin, BTFD is delivering on its promise to make sure you never miss a juicy dip again. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a full-blown movement, complete with its own P2E game, staking rewards, and an engaging community called the Bulls Squad. Here’s the kicker: when the presale ends, the listing price will jump to $0.0006. That means if you put in just $1,500 now, you’d snag a whopping 15 million BTFD coins. Once the coin hits the market at its projected price, your investment could skyrocket to $9,000 . Multiply that by the staking APY of up to 90%, and you’re looking at gains that most meme coins can only dream of. The presale has already sold over 55 billion coins to 5,400 holders, and with every passing stage, the price edges higher. Whether you’ve got 1 Ethereum (buying you 38,863,600 coins) or 1 Solana (grabbing 2,287,200 coins), the entry points are as diverse as they are lucrative. And if you’re into gaming, the BTFD P2E platform offers even more ways to earn. But what makes BTFD truly revolutionary is its community-driven ethos. With its Bulls Squad leading the charge, this token is built to withstand the wild swings of crypto markets and turn every dip into a launchpad for growth. Missed BONK? Don’t miss the lucrative BTFD presale . BONK vs. BTFD: A Tale of Two Meme Coins Comparing BONK to BTFD is like comparing yesterday’s news to tomorrow’s headline. BONK had its moment of glory, rallying meme coin enthusiasts around its quirky branding and strong community vibes. When it launched, its price surged astronomically, creating millionaires out of early believers. Even today, BONK remains a staple of Solana’s ecosystem, celebrated for its contribution to meme coin culture. But let’s not sugarcoat it: BONK’s peak growth is behind us. Its current price movements are more about consolidation than explosive growth. Analysts predict steady, albeit modest, increases in BONK’s value as it integrates deeper into Solana’s ecosystem. While that’s great news for existing holders, it leaves little room for the kind of exponential gains new investors crave. On the other hand, BTFD Coin is fresh out of the gates, riding a wave of excitement that shows no signs of slowing down. Its Ethereum-based foundation ensures scalability and security, while its built-in staking and gaming mechanisms make it far more than just a token – it’s an ecosystem. This combination of innovation and community engagement positions BTFD as the best meme coin presale to join now , eclipsing BONK’s fading spotlight. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Your Second Best Chance Crypto opportunities don’t come with guarantees, but they do come with patterns. BONK’s meteoric rise was a wake-up call for anyone sleeping on meme coins. If you missed that boat, don’t let BTFD Coin sail without you. With its presale already turning heads, this coin is set to redefine what it means to “buy the dip.” BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement, a rallying cry, and your ticket to being part of the next big thing. As the presale heats up and stages fly by, waiting could cost you dearly. So, what are you waiting for? Join the BTFD presale today and stake your claim in crypto history. Don’t let hindsight be 20/20 again. If BONK taught us anything, it’s that timing is everything. BTFD Coin is here to prove that lightning does strike twice – if you’re bold enough to catch it.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 22:07:57

Justin Bons, Cyber Capital founder and CIO, argues in a recent tweet that AI-enabled wallets will be the death of ETH’s ambitions of streamlining its ecosystem. Bons wrote: AI agents embedded in user wallets will revolutionize the crypto User Experience! Hilariously it will also be the last nail in the coffin for ETH alignment. ~Justin Bons He added that the situation would arise from AI objectively choosing the blockchains with the best offerings in fees, security, and transaction speeds. Thus, it would do away with what he termed as “all the tribalistic BS!” Netizens pushback on Bons’ claims Those claims kicked a Twitter storm with several netizens pushing back on his suggestions. One X user tdubb led the assault terming Bons’ prediction the worst take on the subject that he had ever seen. He insisted that the intention of the AI is what will matter as these tools will work according to their creator’s instructions. “AI will objectively choose chains with the best fee/security/speed properties” is up there with one of the worst takes on AI i’ve ever seen icl — tdubb — ux/acc (@tdubbdoteth) December 15, 2024 He suggested that there were other factors other than speed, cost, and security that would determine the working of AI-embedded wallets. These include the chain’s liquidity, product, and interoperability. But ultimately the AI agent’s design would hold sway. Another user @calebini also took Bons to task on his assertion that the AI agents wouldn’t choose Base as it was slow, costly, and totally centralized. He made fun of Bons’ apparently forgetting that virtuals, a prominent AI-agent platform was running on the network. @calebini also slammed Bons for relegating his platform to attacking ETH or BTC at every chance he got. He wondered why he (Bons) wouldn’t use it to highlight the positive developments within the entire crypto ecosystem. To him, Bons’ hostility towards the two was tiresome and undermined his credibility. Vitalik Buterin pushes for Ethereum alignment to unite the ecosystem The Ethereum alignment concept grew from the complexities that emerged from the blockchain’s evolution. As the network grew it accommodated many projects with diverse views, goals, and operating principles. This divergence threatens the realization of ETH’s core principles. To bring back all the players to Ethereum’s founding philosophies, the network’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the Ethereum alignment concept. Its key components are ecosystem unity and coordinated governance. Through it, the Ethereum Foundation hopes to build a stronger network with an enhanced ecosystem value. It also looks to improve the user experience by easing user navigation of the blockchain’s services and promoting the interoperability of applications.

In a Dec. 13 complaint, BiT Global accused Coinbase of delisting wBTC to promote its own product, cbBTC. The move allegedly caused significant financial losses and damaged consumer confidence in wBTC. The lawsuit claims attempted monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act, predatory practices to undermine wBTC, and false statements suggesting wBTC failed to meet listing standards. Coinbase announced the token delisting on Nov. 19, citing undisclosed failures to meet its listing standards. A Coinbase spokesperson defended the decision, stating: “Coinbase is committed to maintaining the high integrity of our listing standards, and we regularly evaluate assets listed on our platform. Should an asset fail to meet those standards, it is delisted.” BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has been a joint custodian of wBTC reserves with BitGo since August. The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, alleges Coinbase favored memecoins while challenging wBTC’s compliance with listing standards. Attorney Kevin Kneupper stated, “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space. If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” The lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $1 billion and demands injunctive relief to prevent further harm. BiT Global claims Coinbase aimed to eliminate competition, stating: “It’s clear that Coinbase’s decision is an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, pushing forward their own wrapped Bitcoin product, cbBTC, and removing the largest and most influential competitor in wBTC.” Coinbase previously announced: “Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC on Dec. 19, 2024, on or around 12 pm ET.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 22:55:00

He learned that the government planned to restrict AI development to a few large companies. This led him to endorse Donald Trump, who he believes supports less government control over tech. Marc Andreessen is the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, an influential figure especially when it comes to the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, he exposed his deep concerns over the Biden administration’s plan to regulate and control AI technology, after attending a series of meetings with government officials in May 2023. Andreessen criticizes Biden’s AI regulations Andreessen described the experience as “horrifying,” and it had a significant impact on his decision to endorse Donald Trump in the upcoming election. In the meeting, Andreessen learned that government officials were planning to take strong control over the AI sector, limiting its development and access to a few large companies that cooperate closely with the government. According to Andreessen, the officials clearly stated that AI startups would not be allowed to exist. He recalled the statement, “Don’t fund AI startups. That’s not something that we’re going to allow to happen.” The government’s plan was to establish a situation where only two or three major companies, tightly controlled and “wrapped in a government cocoon,” would be allowed to develop AI technology. These companies would receive government protection from competition and be fully directed by the administration on how to move forward with AI development. Government plans to limit AI Innovation What alarmed him was that the government would go even further by restricting access to the fundamental technology that powers AI. He explained that government officials suggested they could follow a similar path to the Cold War, where certain scientific areas, including physics, were classified and kept secret from the public and the research community. Andreessen was shocked when the officials suggested that AI could also be “classified” in a way that would limit or even prevent open research and development. This discussion raised serious concerns for Andreessen, especially since he had investments in AI startups. His firm has funded several cutting-edge AI companies, including Elon Musk’s xAI, Mistral AI, and Character.AI. The idea of controlling AI development would threaten his business interests and the tech innovation ecosystem. For Andreessen, this wasn’t just about his personal investments it was about the future of AI innovation in the United States. The Biden administration has taken an approach to AI, like issuing an executive order in October 2023 asking companies to voluntarily follow safety and transparency guidelines. The executive order called for companies to share safety test results with the government and for Congress to review data privacy practices. However, Andreessen claims that the government’s actual plan is much more controlling and stricter. He believes their anti-capitalist stance threatens innovation and the spirit of American business. His view is that the government’s approach to AI reflects a shift towards a more controlled economy. After the meetings, Andreessen decided to support Trump, who he saw as a leader promoting innovation. Trump’s approach of reducing government control over business and encouraging private companies in tech was the opposite of the Biden administration’s policies.

These sentiments from the crypto analyst mirror the dynamic nature of the market and the constant shift in investors interest. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Next Big Player In Crypto While PEPE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are household names in cryptocurrency, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves with its decentralized crypto wallet that gives investors absolute control over their digital assets without the interference of third parties. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is known for its adoption of AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that promote financial literacy, security and decentralization among its users. Touted as the SHIB of this cycle, the leading crypto analyst believes WallitIQ (WLTQ) is significantly positioned to benefit from the billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market as the demand for efficient crypto wallets continues to rise. In addition to the leading crypto analyst predictions of WallitIQ to replicate SHIB’s previous success, WallitIQ’s projected $10 million monthly revenue has attracted both retail and institutional investors who missed out on SHIB in 2021, with its low token price and an opportunity to create generational wealth. Following the crypto analyst predictions, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale has seen massive interest from investors, selling millions of tokens in just a few weeks. Early investors have positioned themselves to enjoy several benefits, including governance participation, early gains from token price appreciation, premium features, etc. The crypto analyst has also mentioned that the best time to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens is now to enjoy the benefits that come with its rapid price growth. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained popularity through its meme status and community-driven support, WallitIQ (WLTQ) distinguishes itself by providing tangible benefits such as annual percentage yields (APY) of 180% as rewards for users who stake their tokens. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides its users with access to over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, giving them an efficient and secure platform to diversify their portfolios. As a platform that prioritizes security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has won the heart of the crypto analyst with its combination of the advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) that protects user private keys and transactions from fraudulent individuals. In addition, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a smart contract audit conducted by a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known as SolidProof . This firm specializes in protecting financial institutions and preventing hackers from penetrating blockchain projects. PEPE As Dogecoin (DOGE) Replacement Just recently, PEPE crossed the $11 billion market cap milestone for the first time. With the latest price rally stretching its year-to-date (YTD) to 2,570%, PEPE is positioned to outperform rival meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the current bull cycle. As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to experience fluctuations, many are turning to PEPE as a fresh opportunity. The crypto analysts believe that PEPE could capitalize on the momentum previously enjoyed by Dogecoin, especially with PEPE’s increasing demand increasing social media buzz. According to data from CoinGecko , PEPE’s market cap is at $10.3 billion with a daily trading volume of $5.5 billion. As of the time of this writing, PEPE is trading at a price of $0.00002459. On the other hand, Dogecoin’s market cap is $60.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.7 billion. As of writing time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at a price of $0.4121. Be Part Of The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale With PEPE positioning itself as a viable replacement for Dogecoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) aims to capture the spirit of SHIB, attracting all classes of investors with its discounted token price. With the presale moving faster than expected, smart investors are seizing this opportunity to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens for a low price of $0.0243 each. Millions of tokens have been sold, reflecting the growing demand for innovative solutions that offer both utility and security.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 23:12:00

A new report from Electric Capital has revealed that Asia now commands 32% of the world’s crypto development. This is a sharp rise from just 12% in 2015. As North America’s influence declines, emerging markets, especially India, are becoming the main source of new talent in crypto. Asia’s Rapid Growth and the Emergence of India Asia’s growing dominance in crypto development is undeniable. The region’s 32% share of global developer activity marks a substantial shift in industry trends. What was once a Western-centric field is now expanding rapidly eastward, with India leading the charge. Since 2023, India has accounted for a larger share of new crypto developers than any other country. This underscores the country’s growing importance in the crypto ecosystem. India’s large talent pool and booming tech industry are driving its rise in blockchain development. The country is becoming a key player in the global crypto ecosystem. Its contributions are shaping the future of the industry. In a recent report, the country emerged as the global hub for Web3 innovations . A Decline in North America, But Veteran Developers Are Flourishing While Asia rises, North America’s dominance in the crypto field is dwindling. The region’s share of global developer activity has dropped from 43% in 2015 to just 24%. Still, the outlook remains positive. The crypto space has seen a 7% drop in active developers this year, but the picture is far from discouraging. Developers with over two years of experience have grown significantly, increasing by 27%. These seasoned experts now contribute over 70% of code commits in leading blockchain ecosystems, underscoring their importance to the industry. Their expertise drives innovation, sustains key projects, and stabilizes the fast-changing field. Despite fewer newcomers, the growing presence of experienced developers highlights the maturing nature of the crypto ecosystem. New Talent Flocks to Solana and Other Blockchain Ecosystems Ethereum remains the top platform for crypto developers, but its dominance is being challenged. Solana is rising quickly, attracting new developers , and becoming the preferred choice by mid-2024 in key markets like the U.S., U.K., China, and Canada. Alongside Ethereum and Solana, other blockchain ecosystems are also gaining traction. Platforms like Internet Computer, Aptos, Coinbase’s Base , Bitcoin, Sui, NEAR, Polkadot, and Polygon are seeing a significant influx of new developers, each adding at least 1,000 new contributors in the past year alone. This shift shows growing interest in diverse blockchain solutions and expanding innovation in previously overlooked markets. The surge of talent entering the crypto space, with over 39,000 new developers this year alone, signals the start of a new era for blockchain development.

This comes as optimism remains sky-high on the back of a crypto-friendly US presidential administration. As we reported just last night, President-elect Donald Trump confirmed his plans to back the national Bitcoin strategic reserve proposed by crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis. Since his election victory in November, Bitcoin has been on a tear, climbing by 50% in just over a month. Investors are betting big on the changes coming under his administration. Trump has made it clear he’s no fan of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose regulatory crackdowns have been a thorn in the side of the crypto community. The decision to replace Gensler with Paul Atkins, a known crypto ally, has made the market even more bullish. Bitcoin-based ETFs have been a game changer this year, and 2024 has been all about capital flowing in at an insane pace. Just last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $676 million in inflows. The derivatives market is also on fire. Open interest in Bitcoin futures and options has hit record levels. Everyone is betting on where it’s headed next, and the sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish. Altcoins have been left in the dust, with Bitcoin’s market share growing as investors double down on the one crypto they trust the most. While enthusiasm is high, there are signs of caution. Liquidity clusters around $100,000 suggest some volatility ahead. If prices dip, it’s likely a temporary pullback as the market resets before making another run.

The report reveals that countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and the Philippines are driving significant growth in awareness, ownership, and participation in crypto-related activities. Emerging Markets at The Forefront The survey shows that 93% of people globally are aware of cryptocurrencies, with 51% claiming to understand them. Ownership levels stand at 42%, with the highest rates reported in Nigeria (73%), South Africa (68%), and the Philippines (54%). These countries also displayed a notable increase in Web3 activities, such as holding NFTs, using decentralized finance (DeFi), and staking. In Nigeria, 77% of respondents correctly defined blockchain, while 80% knew about decentralization. Similarly, South Africa reported 74% familiarity with the latter concept, while 61% of participants in the Philippines shared the same understanding. Per the report, crypto adoption in these areas is driven by various factors, with a large number of proponents perceiving it as a solution to local economic challenges. Additionally, many in these markets view digital assets as a lifeline, with 65% of Nigerians seeing them as a way to store value amid currency instability and another 58% considering them as the “future of money.” Individuals in these countries are also more likely to invest in crypto in the coming year. The Philippines has been capitalizing on the opportunities provided by such assets, with a 7% increase in ownership over the last 12 months. Entry Barriers and Blockchain Solutions Despite the growing enthusiasm for crypto in these regions, the survey also highlights persistent barriers to entry. Concerns about market volatility, scams, and the lack of understanding of its purpose remain widespread globally. However, these obstacles are less prevalent in emerging markets, where respondents demonstrated a willingness to embrace virtual currencies despite the challenges. The report also reveals that blockchain could be key in addressing concerns about artificial intelligence (AI), with 75% of those interviewed worried about its potential to generate fake news and perpetuate fraud. About 54% of participants globally believe blockchain could provide the transparency and accountability needed to combat AI-driven misinformation. Speaking on the increasing importance of data privacy as highlighted by the survey, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin said: “The critical role of blockchain and decentralization in enhancing privacy, trust, and transparency for how our data is managed cannot be overstated.” He added that the last few years have shown growing momentum for crypto, blockchain, and Web3 adoption, with 2024 marking a significant period. He explained that this is due to various factors, including the recent U.S. presidential election , which could lead to greater regulatory clarity for the industry.

RCO Finance: Which Can Turn $1k into $100k by January 1?,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu-vs-rco-finance-which-can-turn-1k/,"Among the numerous digital assets, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and RCO Finance (RCOF) stand out as three distinct choices with significant potential in 2025. However, while each of these coins has its own narrative and market dynamics, the key question remains: which one holds the potential to turn a modest $1,000 investment into $100,000 by January 1? Dogecoin Could Hit $1.48 in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE), originally conceived as a meme coin, has grown to become one of the market’s most recognizable and widely traded cryptocurrencies. Known for its fun, community-driven nature, Dogecoin saw a significant price surge earlier this year, doubling in value within a month following Trump’s re-election, reflecting the strong bullish sentiments surrounding the coin. Despite its reputation as a meme coin, Dogecoin’s performance has shown potential for substantial gains, with an impressive 350% rise in a year to trade at $0.4055 at press time. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, with some bullish predictions putting its price at around $0.8392 by early 2025 and others hinting that it could soar to $1.48 after Trump assumes office on January 20, 2025. Nevertheless, while the projection of $1.48 is quite ambitious, it still can not convert a $1,000 investment in DOGE into $100,000. Buying DOGE at its current price could get you approximately 2,466 DOGE tokens, which at $1.48 would be worth a modest $3,649. Shiba Inu Price Could Hit $0.0000879 in 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB), often called the “Dogecoin killer,” has carved out a unique space in the cryptocurrency market with its playful branding and vibrant community. Also launched as a meme coin, Shiba Inu quickly gained attention due to its low entry price and speculative appeal. It has seen notable activity, including several token burns to reduce supply and increase scarcity. Although these burns represent only a small fraction of Shiba Inu’s total supply, they contribute to the deflationary narrative that can be attractive to investors looking for assets with limited supply and potential for price appreciation. Over the past year, Shiba Inu has experienced a notable price increase, soaring by 196% despite witnessing wild price swings. And while it is still way down from the $0.00008616 all-time high achieved in October 2021, predictions are placing the meme coin at $0.0000879 in 2025. However, while $0.0000879 would represent quite a huge gain for SHIB, it still would not be enough to convert a $1,000 investment into $100,000. $1,000, at the current SHIB price of $0.000028 , can get you 35,714,285 SHIB tokens, which at $0.0000879 would only be worth $3,139.285. RCO Finance Emerges as a Compelling Alternative Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are both meme coins and RCO Finance is emerging with a more structured and professional approach to cryptocurrency investing. As an AI-powered financial platform, it aims to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is the AI-powered Robo Advisor , which analyzes market data and tailors investment strategies to individual user preferences, optimizing portfolio performance without requiring manual oversight. This level of automation is particularly beneficial for novice and experienced investors, allowing them to focus on their long-term financial goals without getting bogged down by day-to-day market fluctuations. Additionally, RCO Finance will provide access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, from traditional stocks and bonds to digital assets and real-world assets like real estate. This wide range of tradable assets allows investors to diversify their portfolios and balance risk across different markets. Another unique aspect of RCO Finance is its KYC-free ecosystem, which ensures user privacy and simplifies the onboarding process, making it more accessible to privacy-conscious investors. Furthermore, the platform also features an audited smart contract , enhancing security and trust among users. These features position RCO Finance as a viable option for investors seeking more than just short-term gains. Investors can invest in the project through the ongoing RCOF token presale. Taking Advantage of the Ongoing RCOF Token Presale The RCO Finance presale represents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to maximize their returns. In its fourth stage, the RCOF token has already experienced a 509% price surge, reaching $0.07770, and is expected to see further gains as it progresses through the presale stages. The next stage, the final presale stage, is set to see the price of RCOF reach $0.21420 before public listing at between $0.4 and $0.6. This price trajectory indicates substantial potential for profit as the RCOF token approaches its public listing, where it could see even more significant gains as investors take advantage of early access to the platform’s features and the ecosystem’s expected growth. For those looking to transform a $1,000 investment into $100,000, the ongoing presale of RCO Finance presents a promising opportunity to capitalize on the projected price increases. A $1,000 investment in RCOF at the current presale price could earn you 12,870 RCOF tokens and if the token soars to $10 as projected by most analysts due to the current hype around AI and DeFi, the investment could turn to a cool $128,700.

Don’t Let This Best Meme Coin Presale for Massive Return Potential Be Your Second Mistake!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-brett-dont-let-this-best-meme-coin-presale-for-massive-return-potential-be-your-second-mistake/,"Meme coins have been shaking up the crypto world for years, delivering wild profits and unforgettable stories. Remember Dogecoin’s meteoric rise or Brett creating overnight millionaires? One thing’s clear: early movers always win big. Now, there’s a fresh chance to jump in early, and it’s making waves— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . In just 14 days , this presale sensation has raised over $2.6 million, selling over 44 billion coins to more than 3,900 holders. BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a movement redefining what meme coins can achieve with innovative staking rewards, a thrilling play-to-earn game, and a vibrant community called the Bulls Squad. This isn’t just another crypto; it’s your ticket to ride the next bull wave. BTFD Coin: The New Frontier for Meme Coin Enthusiasts Unlike the usual meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin brings substance to the table. Built on Ethereum’s rock-solid foundation, it flaunts unmatched security, scalability, and liquidity. The concept of “ Buy the Dip ” is more than a tagline—it’s a rallying cry for those ready to seize opportunities. With presale prices starting at just $0.000004, BTFD Coin offers prime entry points. The current stage 10 price of $0.0001 is still a steal. By the presale’s end, it’s set to launch at $0.0006 per coin. For context, a $2,500 investment at $0.0001 could fetch you 25 million BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, that $2,500 could skyrocket to $15,000 . Presale Success and Features BTFD Coin’s presale journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Hitting $1 million in under ten days, it’s sold over 44 billion coins. The Bulls Squad—a charismatic community of dip-buying enthusiasts—embodies resilience and camaraderie. For investors, BTFD’s staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, making it a top choice for long-term holders. The play-to-earn game adds another layer of engagement, allowing users to earn while having fun. Connect your wallet, level up, and turn in-game rewards into real-world profits. Tokenomics for Growth BTFD’s tokenomics ensure stability and growth. With 48% allocated to presales, 18% for staking rewards, and 17% for game incentives, every aspect fuels its ecosystem. Unsold tokens will be burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Brett Coin: The Opportunity You Missed Launched earlier this year, Brett Coin (BRETT) emerged as a memecoin powerhouse. Its 142% rally over the past 30 days captured the market’s attention, and it currently trades around $0.2053 with a market cap of $2.035 billion. This meme coin ranked #68 on CoinMarketCap and became a favourite among investors seeking high returns. However, not all has been smooth sailing. Brett faced a 47% drop in April 2024 due to insider holding concerns. Yet, it rebounded fiercely, proving its resilience. Investors who got in early reaped massive rewards, turning small bets into life-changing gains. What Makes Brett Unique Brett isn’t just another meme coin. Its community-driven ethos and market-savvy strategies have earned it a loyal following. Its success underscores one critical lesson: getting in early is everything. Those who sat on the sidelines when Brett was first gaining traction are now regretting it. Why BTFD Coin is Your Next Big Chance While Brett’s success is undeniable, BTFD Coin is positioned to be the next big thing. With its presale pricing, staking rewards, and innovative ecosystem, it offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors. Unlike Brett, which is now in its mature phase, BTFD Coin is just getting started, and its presale is the perfect time to dive in. Consider this: with 1 Ethereum, you can buy 38,863,600 BTFD coins. That’s a staggering amount compared to what you’d get with established meme coins like Brett. The same holds for 1 Bitcoin, which can fetch you 984,470,000 BTFD coins. The math is simple—early entry equals massive potential. Moreover, the BTFD play-to-earn game and community-driven initiatives ensure continuous engagement and value creation. The presale structure incentivises early investors, with prices escalating in each stage. As we approach the end of the presale, FOMO is building, and the buzz is palpable. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Dip—Ride the Wave Meme coins like Brett have shown us the power of early investments. But if you missed Brett’s meteoric rise, don’t let BTFD Coin slip through your fingers. With its presale gaining momentum, staking rewards offering high returns, and a play-to-earn game set to captivate, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin presale for massive return potential. So, what are you waiting for? The presale won’t last forever, and neither will these prices. Join the BTFD movement today and secure your place in the next big crypto success story.

37693393,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627921,1734308574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37693393.jpeg,Japan ‘far behind’ US in cyber attack preparedness — But that’s actually a good thing for crypto,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-far-behind-us-in-cyber-attack-preparedness-but-thats-actually-a-good-thing-for-crypto/,"Japan’s government is currently pushing for an “active cyber defense” (ACD) policy, and major media in the country are falling all over themselves to aid in the effort with stories to alarm the public. However, copying the examples of the US and UK, as major outlet Nikkei implies ought to be done, is in the very worst interest of peaceful crypto and privacy advocates in Japan. Not long ago, Cryptopolitan reported on Masaaki Taira, Japan’s digital transformation (DX) minister, being commanded by self-described “defense geek” prime minister Ishiba to accelerate work on an “active cyber defense” (ACD) bill. The bill is controversial because it involves state-level spying via private telecom companies on the people of Japan, even in peacetime, and supplying the info to the United States. Some Japanese are also suspicious of scandal-embroiled Taira potentially having connections with anti-Japan interests in the Chinese Communist Party. Major news outlet Nikkei has now joined the push for the “active cyber defense” agenda, publishing a report (or propaganda piece, depending on who you ask) promoting greater cyber-attack preparedness. The December 16 report goes so far as to imply that centralized misinformation control and even state-level “debunking” need to be increased, and done in tandem with major nations like the US and UK. But mimicking Five Eyes intelligence giants in surveillance is a horrible idea for cryptocurrency adoption and privacy in Japan, especially with a digital yen now on the table. The combined effect of all this is to threaten the culturally self-reliant populace with even more influence from a global banking cabal, and pressure to align with cartoonish foreign figures like Musk and Trump , whose actions Taira wants to “closely follow.” Of course Nikkei knows this. And of course the new prime minister Shigeru Ishiba doesn’t actually care about the security or economic freedom of the people he supposedly governs. But nor does any politician, really. This should go without saying. Nikkei shills for surveillance, Japan falls further from crypto grace While the years of independent bitcoin ATMs in Tokyo (ca. 2015-2017) operating free and unfettered are far behind us, and popular trading sites like Local Bitcoins have long since been destroyed by the same restrictive red tape that took out the ATMs, things yet continue to spiral downward when it comes to the Japanese government’s approach to finance, cryptocurrency, and information control. And the media is right there behind them, fueling the fire. “Cyber ​​attacks are posing increasing threats to national security,” the new Nikkei report (translated by Google) reads. “Attacks on governments and military-related targets in various countries have increased by more than 70% compared to the same period last year.” The piece continues: “Japan is currently aiming to strengthen its cyber security system, including the introduction of ‘active cyber defense (ACD)’ that detects signs of cyber attacks and prevents damage before they occur.” As mentioned above, the ACD bill aims to spy on public communications via private companies ostensibly to stave off cyber attacks and the spread of misinformation before they happen. According to other reports from local media, the new legislation could even include shutting down people’s computers. The terms “thoughtcrime” and “pre-crime” might pop into the heads of readers and film buffs familiar with the horrific dystopias of 1984 and The Minority Report. Japan’s NISC, responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings, issued far less alerts than its foreign counterparts in England (middle) and the United States (top), according to Nikkei’s research. Source: Nikkei Combine all this with the looming CBDC , (read: centrally programmed, censorable digital JPY) also shilled/predictively programmed by Nikkei interests, and a pretty clear picture of what is happening emerges: Japanese state officials are painting themselves as the victims, while clamping down even harder on the true victims — everyday folks just trying to get by. Crypto is taxed at insanely high rates in Japan (up to 55% on gains), and increasing regulation of the cryptocurrency and banking industries in the nation is making it near impossible for individuals and small businesses to leverage the true benefits of peer-to-peer digital currency — that is, without facing potential jail time. It’s now common in Japan for even normal bank accounts to unilaterally freeze customer funds if the smallest abnormality or “suspicious behavior” is detected with a deposit or transfer. Further, Japan’s financial regulator, the FSA, is in closed door talks about how to more effectively capture the asset class. Debunking the need for government debunking The Nikkei report notes that Japan’s NISC (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity), responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings to the public, lags far behind its foreign counterparts in Britain and the US. But in Japan, perhaps worrying about the inflation problem , the rampant overtourism, and suicides from overwork might be good to put on the agenda, as opposed to Shigeru Ishiba’s plans for military spending on steroids and drafting of cyber-security bills that spy on everyone. Perhaps instead of lending military support and money to the United States/Israel genocide in the Middle East, politicians on the archipelago might start worrying about the aging population of retirees unable to survive on the national pension. But alas, that is wishful thinking. Which is why permissionless cryptocurrencies became so important in the first place. The report compares the number of “debunkings” Japanese embassies have issued on X, compared to other embassies. Source: Nikkei As if to insultingly answer these ponderings with a non-sequitur, however, the Nikkei report reads: “The Nikkei Shimbun compiled the number of debunkings from April 2011 to July this year for the X (formerly Twitter) accounts of the Japanese, US and UK embassies … the Japanese embassies in the US and UK only sent out one debunking each from their respective countries … that denied the danger of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.” Nikkei’s report then lauds the intelligence giants overseas: “On the other hand, the US embassy in Japan sent out 13 debunkings, and the UK embassy sent out 10.” Is this really a litmus for social progress? Which government sends out the most “debunkings”? I don’t personally think so. A litmus for social progress is how much economic freedom an individual has, and the respect of others for that freedom. On that front, the Japanese government, and those of the whole world, are miserably and intentionally failing. So, if dystopian spying and “pre-crime” cybersecurity bills are what Japan is lagging behind in, perhaps that particular lack of ambition is for the best.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 00:23:00

The Dogecoin price is projected to achieve a $150 billion market cap, propelled by its loyal community and speculative momentum. The XRP price is expected to reach a $400 billion market cap, driven by increasing adoption in cross-border payments. Meanwhile, ETFSwap (ETFS) is on track for a $100 billion market cap, emerging as a transformative force in crypto. Among the Dogecoin price, XRP price, and ETFSwap (ETFS), ETFSwap (ETFS) stands out as a balanced investment option combining innovation and practicality. Its recent listing on Uniswap and accessible price point make it a strong contender for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the growth predictions. Why ETFSwap (ETFS) Leads Among 2025 Predictions ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape with its innovative features and investor-focused tools. Among its standout offerings is a real-time ETF price tracker , which provides precise and immediate updates on ETF performance. This tool allows investors to monitor trends and make informed decisions in a fast-moving market. The real-time tracker is an essential resource for those aiming to capitalize on the projected $100 billion market cap. Unlike the speculative nature of the Dogecoin price or the institution-driven XRP price, ETFSwap (ETFS) prioritizes functionality and actionable insights, setting it apart as a forward-thinking investment option. ETFSwap (ETFS) also allows investors to diversify their portfolios by offering access to crypto ETFs and traditional commodities such as oil, silver, and gold. This feature bridges the gap between decentralized trading and conventional markets, creating a balanced approach to risk and growth potential. Unlike the Dogecoin price and XRP price, which are tied to specific market narratives, ETFSwap (ETFS) provides a broader range of opportunities to align with varied financial goals. Introducing an AI-powered ETF screener further heightens the appeal of ETFSwap (ETFS), simplifying the decision-making process. For those targeting the predicted ETFSwap (ETFS) $100 billion market cap, the AI-powered screener efficiently maximises returns. The 2025 market cap predictions highlight distinct strengths for the Dogecoin price, XRP price, and ETFSwap (ETFS) price. With its listing on Uniswap, ETFSwap (ETFS) remains affordable, offering investors who missed the presale a chance to secure their positions before further growth. Dogecoin Price, XRP Price And Projected Market Cap Due to its community-driven growth and market popularity, the Dogecoin pric e has consistently drawn attention. Predictions of a $150 billion market cap reflect its ability to thrive during bullish cycles. Its speculative nature, amplified by high-profile endorsements, has made it a favorite for quick gains. Despite its appeal, the Dogecoin price relies heavily on market sentiment, which can lead to unpredictable fluctuations. This dependency may deter investors seeking long-term stability, making ETFSwap (ETFS) a compelling alternative with features designed to support sustained growth. Ripple (XRP) has established itself as a leader in cross-border payments, with the XRP price reflecting its growing use case among financial institutions. The $400 billion market cap prediction underscores its role in modernizing global transactions. Its ability to deliver efficient, low-cost solutions has earned it a strong position in the crypto market. However, regulatory challenges and competition in the payment sector may impact the XRP price trajectory. For investors seeking diversification, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers a platform that combines decentralized trading with traditional asset classes, delivering a unique approach to portfolio management. Conclusion The 2025 crypto market cap predictions showcase exciting possibilities across the market. The Dogecoin price’s $150 billion target reflects its speculative appeal, and the XRP price’s $400 billion prediction underscores its institutional credibility. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) shines as a well-rounded investment option, set to reach a $100 billion market cap through its unique features and market positioning. Savvy investors are taking action now. Acting now gives access to a platform that addresses the needs of today’s investors while offering the potential for substantial returns. Don’t miss out.

This Layer One Blockchain Proves It’s Not Too Late,https://thecoinrise.com/didnt-believe-in-early-crypto-success-stories-this-layer-one-blockchain-proves-its-not-too-late/,"Have you ever looked at projects like Solana and thought, “Why didn’t I invest earlier?” For many, watching Solana’s rise was a lesson in missed opportunities. But the truth is, crypto always has another game-changer waiting in the wings. This time, Qubetics ($TICS) could be that golden ticket, offering a fresh opportunity for those searching for the best crypto to buy for explosive returns. While Solana revolutionised blockchain speed and scalability, Qubetics is bringing its own innovations to the table. From simplifying blockchain development to offering a lucrative presale, Qubetics is poised to turn heads and change fortunes. Why Missing Qubetics Presale Could Be a Big Mistake Qubetics is not just a blockchain project; it’s a complete ecosystem designed to make blockchain technology accessible to everyone, whether they’re developers, small businesses, or large enterprises. At the core of its innovation is the QubeQode IDE , a visual development environment that eliminates the complexity of blockchain coding. Here’s how the QubeQode IDE is changing the game. Developers can use drag-and-drop components to add features like user authentication, token management, and data storage. A small business looking to create a custom token can do so in minutes without hiring a team of developers. Plus, the form-based configuration lets users set up smart contracts through intuitive forms—no coding required. The code snippet library adds another layer of simplicity by offering pre-written templates for common blockchain tasks. Now let’s talk about the Qubetics presale . Currently in its 12th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.031. Over 334 million tokens have already been sold to more than 9,700 holders, raising $6.4 million. With each presale stage lasting just 7 days and a 10% price increase at the start of each new stage, the time to invest is now. By the 13th stage, the price will rise to $0.0341. Solana’s Rise Shows Why Acting Early Matters Solana is one of the most talked-about blockchain projects, thanks to its unparalleled speed and low transaction costs. Launched with an ICO in 2020, Solana’s initial token price was just $0.22. Fast forward, and Solana is now a major player in the blockchain world, powering decentralised applications and attracting developers worldwide. What makes Solana special is its proof-of-history mechanism, which allows it to process thousands of transactions per second. This innovation has made it a favourite for projects requiring high throughput, from NFT platforms to DeFi applications. Its success underscores the importance of solving real-world blockchain challenges, which is exactly what Qubetics aims to do. For those who missed Solana’s ICO, it’s a reminder of how early action can lead to exponential gains. While Solana continues to grow, Qubetics offers a chance to get in early on a project with equally groundbreaking potential. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy for Explosive Returns Qubetics combines cutting-edge technology with practical solutions, making it a standout project in the blockchain space. Its QubeQode IDE makes blockchain development accessible to anyone, while its presale offers an affordable entry point for investors looking to maximise returns. For those who regret missing projects like Solana in their early days, Qubetics offers a fresh opportunity to be part of something big. With a clear roadmap, innovative tools, and analysts predicting significant growth, $TICS is the best crypto to buy for explosive returns. Don’t wait until the presale ends and the prices climb higher. Take a closer look at Qubetics and see how it could transform your portfolio.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 01:50:00

As the 9th largest crypto by market cap, Cardano’s market maturity is severely impeding its capacity for explosive growth. While Cardano has a solid technological foundation and a loyal community, its price has remained the same compared to the explosive growth seen in other altcoins. This situation is further exacerbated by the emergence of AI altcoins, which are revolutionizing the market with their ingenious solutions and reshaping investor expectations. For instance, altcoins like RCOF have innovative features, such as the robo-advisor, which offers personalized investment strategies based on extensive market analysis. This capability enhances the user experience and democratizes access to sophisticated trading tools, making these AI altcoins more attractive to traditional crypto assets like Cardano. These projects also garner attention for their impressive presale performances and projected returns. This potential for explosive growth and advanced technological capabilities appeal to Cardano investors looking for high-ROI opportunities. RCO Finance: The AI Altcoin Poised for Market Domination RCO Finance is an AI altcoin catching the eye of Cardano investors because of its innovative features. It has built a comprehensive ecosystem, transforming how investors interact with crypto and traditional financial products. Leading this AI revolution is its AI-powered robo-advisor , which provides tailored investment strategies based on your preferences. These strategies are developed after analyzing vast amounts of historical data, current market trends, financial goals, and risk appetite. By customizing your investment plans, the robo-advisor ensures every move you make is geared toward fulfilling your goals and that its recommendations are within your limits. This is useful for beginners since it can recommend low-risk investments to test the waters before moving on to higher-risk, higher rewards assets. For seasoned professionals, the robo-advisor provides advanced insights and customizable tools you can use to enhance your investments further. RCOF allows users to invest in over 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized stocks, ETFs, bonds, etc. This tokenization democratizes access to high-value assets previously hard to reach. It also enables users to buy fractions of these assets, meaning you don’t need the high capital previously required to purchase them. This accessibility presents unparalleled investment and diversification opportunities. In addition to breaking down price barriers by tokenizing real-world assets, RCOF is breaking down geographical barriers with its non-KYC policy, which allows users from anywhere in the world to sign up and participate. This means users from areas typically locked out because they can’t meet these stringent KYC requirements can invest and trade on RCOF. This non-KYC feature also appeals to users who prefer to maintain anonymity while transacting online. This platform relies on AI for updates and optimizations. This approach eliminates human error, increases security, and ensures it adapts to the changing needs of its users and the market.

Under the new rules, companies will measure crypto assets at fair value and update them at each reporting period in their financial statements. This will help companies realize both profits and losses based on Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market prices, helping them keep pace with the often fluctuating traded status of the currency. FASB ASC Subtopic 350-60 outlines a new accounting standard that is suitable for fungible crypto assets that meet certain requirements. However, NFTs, wrapped tokens, and internally generated digital assets are exempt from the scope. NFTs are unique and non-interchangeable, which means no two are the same, unlike Bitcoin, and factors like inconsistent pricing, low liquidity, and subjective valuations make it challenging to gauge the fair value of an NFT. Also, unlike BTC, NFTs typically entail specific rights and utilities. All of these reasons make NFTs inappropriate for the standardized, fair value measurement as mandated by ASU 2023-08 . “Nonfungible tokens (ASU 2023-08 applies only to “fungible” intangible digital assets because it is difficult to obtain market prices that meet FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, fair value criteria for nonfungible digital assets; thus, it is unclear how to account for and disclose other types of digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens. Reporting entities accounting for NFTs need to fully understand the rights associated with these tokens and what the tokens transfer.” reads FASB Accounting Standards Update You might also like: Best altcoins to watch as phase 2 of the bull market prepares for liftoff HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE 🙌 pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 What FASB’s new rules mean for investors Companies holding BTC as treasury reserve assets can now benefit from simplified reporting processes due to FASB’s decision to embrace fair value accounting. The update is anticipated to accelerate corporate adoption by providing greater transparency and a more precise valuation of crypto holdings for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. As businesses increasingly turn to BTC as a long-term strategic reserve , this rule change will cement BTC’s dominance further into the fabric of modern finance.

Any gains were left out of the records, and only losses were recorded if the value decreased. Offering this option will also give retail investors an unrounded view of a company’s financial position. The new rules, which mandate reporting of BTC at current market value, will provide more transparency and accuracy of the financial statements, allowing investors to assess risks, cash flows, and performance more effectively for companies such as MicroStrategy , Tesla and so on. Differences between traditional markets and the crypto economy fade as BTC’s grip as a financial asset becomes firm and clearer, and fair-value accounting standards are now in place.

Don’t Miss Out Again—Grab The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today!,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-goatseus-maximus-moonshot-dont-miss-out-again-grab-the-best-meme-coin-to-buy-today/,"Picture this: it’s early 2024, and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) launches quietly into the crypto world. You hear the buzz, but you brush it off—“just another meme coin,” you tell yourself. Fast forward a few months, and the whispers have turned into roars. Early investors are flaunting life-changing profits while you’re left with a lingering question: Why didn’t I act sooner? Now, history is handing you a second chance. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and it’s not just riding the meme coin wave—it’s making a tsunami. Already in its 12th presale stage, BTFD has raised a staggering $3.9 million, selling over 55 billion coins. With a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards boasting a 90% APY, and a passionate community, BTFD is more than a meme—it’s a movement. If you’ve ever wished for a do-over in crypto, this is it. The best meme coin to buy today is right here, right now. Don’t miss it. BTFD Coin: The Dip You Won’t Want to Miss The crypto world is buzzing about BTFD Coin , and for good reason. This Ethereum-based gem has taken the “buy the dip” mantra and turned it into a movement. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a meme coin newbie, BTFD offers a unique opportunity to ride the next big bull wave. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype train. It’s a fully-fledged ecosystem that blends entertainment, community, and financial growth. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game lets you rack up rewards while smashing through levels with the Bulls Squad. Imagine earning real crypto while gaming—sounds like a win-win, right? Staking is another major draw. Offering an average APY of 90%, BTFD’s staking rewards are designed for long-term holders. For example, staking just $1,000 BTFD coins could nearly double your holdings in a year. By the end of three years, compounded rewards could multiply your stash several times over. Presale Frenzy: Numbers Don’t Lie BTFD’s presale has entered its 12th stage, and the excitement around it is off the charts. Priced at just $0.00013 per coin, it offers an unmatched opportunity for early investors to get in before the big launch. So far, over 55 billion coins have been sold, raising an impressive $3.9 million . With its target listing price set at $0.0006, investors stand to gain significantly once it hits the open market. This presale buzz highlights the growing demand for BTFD and its potential to dominate the meme coin landscape. Let’s break that down. An investment of $750 today would get you 7.5 million BTFD coins. Once the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your stash could be worth $4,500 . Now imagine if the price soared beyond that—your potential gains could be life-changing. Accessibility and Community Power You can snag BTFD using multiple currencies. For example: 1 Ethereum buys 38,863,600 BTFD coins. $1 USDT gets you 9,981 BTFD coins. 1 Bitcoin? A whopping 984,470,000 coins. The project’s community is growing fast, with over 5,400 holders already. With its Play-to-Earn game live and staking rewards in full swing, BTFD is poised to become the best meme coin to buy today.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 03:17:00

The price has experienced a shallow pullback since the local top, and this could be forming a sideways triangle pattern, suggesting market indecision. The pattern is narrowing, and a breakout decision is expected soon. Key Support and Resistance Levels: Support Levels: The key support lies around $2.28 (the internal low of the triangle). A break below this would likely lead to a test of the lower support range between $2 and $2.23. Resistance Levels: The primary resistance lies at $2.53. A break above this could signal the start of a move toward $2.64 to $2.76. Bullish Outlook: If the price breaks above $2.53, this would suggest that the C-wave has started, potentially leading to further gains. The target resistance areas are around $2.64 and $2.76. However, a drop below $2.28 could signal a deeper correction. Bearish Scenario: A break below the red line at $2.28 would invalidate the bullish triangle breakout scenario. In that case, XRP could revisit the lower support levels between $2 and $2.23. Analyst Weighs In According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP had a bullish breakout from a flag pattern, and it’s now retesting the previous resistance, which has flipped to support. If XRP holds above $2.37, the bullish flag pattern targets a price around $3.79, offering a potential 50-60% upside. This target would only be invalidated if the price drops below $2.37, especially if it breaks below $2.28.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 03:27:30

Bullish on Bitcoin with a price target of $125k by March, driven by strong ETF inflows, low exchange reserves, and potential regulatory support. Mt. Gox repayments and MicroStrategy's aggressive buying strategy are unlikely to disrupt the current bullish trend significantly. Key risks include potential market downturns in early 2025 and increased supply from miners if Bitcoin prices drop. The ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) holds futures instead of spot Bitcoin. For now, I prefer various competitors that hold Bitcoin. Probably the best thing, if you can manage, is to hold your Bitcoins through a hardware wallet. ProShares charges 0.95% on an annualized basis. The fund also distributes some gains, which can make it a bit tedious to keep your exposure up. On the other hand, you're automatically selling some over time. Futures also tend to suffer from roll-yield. This is one reason why it doesn't track the Bitcoin price perfectly: BITO lags bitcoin price (Seeking Alpha) The fees on U.S. traded Bitcoin ETF's tend to be lower: BITO GBTC IBIT ARKB BITB BTC Fund Name ProShares Bitcoin ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF Fund Type Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Issuer ProShares Grayscale iShares 21Shares US LLC Bitwise Investments Grayscale Inception 10/18/2021 09/25/2013 01/05/2024 01/10/2024 01/10/2024 07/31/2024 Expense Ratio 0.95% 1.50% 0.12% 0.21% 0.20% 0.15% AUM $2.60B $21.15B $53.00B $4.85B $4.07B $3.90B Only the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) is a more expensive way to get exposure. However, there can be advantages to going through futures. Some cryptocurrencies have a yield. That's currently not the case with Bitcoin. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is a well-known example. In Europe, there are a lot of cryptocurrency products that pass along (part of) that yield. In the U.S. that's not the case. For most U.S. investors, it is hard to get access to those products. However, professional global traders can buy these (collect yield) and offset the crypto exposure by selling futures. These kinds of arbitrage trades can then have an effect on the futures curve and implicitly pass on some of the yield. However, I'd still rather pick and choose which futures to buy but wanted to mention it. In any case, I think the details of BITO vs any of these other products are overshadowed by the consideration of whether you want Bitcoin exposure or not. The volatility level is so high that these, often important, issues take a bit of a back seat. Mt. Gox On Bitcoin, I remain bullish. In my most recent article about Bitcoin, I set a price target of $88k for the end of the year. That's been exceeded now, and I'll move the goalpost in the conclusion. There are several reasons I'm not too worried $100k Bitcoin marks the top yet. I've commented on the Mt. Gox repayment saga quite a few times in the past. Some money has been repaid. Creditors got to choose whether they wanted to be repaid asap or were okay with a bit of an outdrawn procedure. The reason for that being there always remain small issues to be resolved, and it isn't great if that's holding up the entire process. Of course, the creditors picking the early option gave up some of the ultimate theoretical economics. The holdouts should ultimately be slightly better off but get to endure. The rehabilitation trustee posted the following English doc laying out the reasons. In practice, at the time of posting, there was still 44,905 BTC that needed to be sent out, and the deadline was moved to October 31, 2025, due to a variety of reasons like having to find the right people, legal dispute, etc. Here's a quote: With the exception of certain types of repayments, the Rehabilitation Trustee has largely completed the Base Repayment, Early Lump-Sum Repayment, and Intermediate Repayment (collectively, the ""Repayments"") for rehabilitation creditors who have completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments and have not encountered any issues during the Repayments process. However, many rehabilitation creditors still have not received their Repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving Repayments. Additionally, a considerable number of rehabilitation creditors have not received their Repayments due to various reasons, such as issues arising during the Repayments process. This just makes for a more gradual release of this BTC. Given we're in a bull market for Bitcoin, I'm not too worried about this additional supply because holders will be more inclined to continue hodling, the market is able to absorb any selling better, and the repayments likely continue throughout the year as issues get solved. Inflows Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are strong. Inflows are at levels similar to when ETFs were launched. The difference being this time there are virtual no offsetting outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). At the time, investors were migrating from this higher fee product to the newly available and cheaper alternatives. In other words; there is a lot of interest currently. spot bitcoin flows (THE BLOCK) Exchange reserves Because exchange reserves have hit a multi-year low and are trending down hard since April I wanted to highlight this: Exchange reserve assets (Crypto Quant) Elevated (and especially rising) exchange reserves can indicate future selling. If you want your Bitcoin to be secure, you don't have it on an exchange. The reason it is moved there is for trading purposes (which means selling). With Bitcoin, this can be tracked because blockchain movement can be followed. The inverse (dollars getting moved there) can't be tracked in the same way. Trump's election In this article , I wrote: Personally, I expected Bitcoin to benefit from either election outcome. If only because the uncertainty of the election would end. I'm bullish on Bitcoin for other reasons as well, more deeply explored in this article . Q4 tends to be a very good quarter for Bitcoin (since 2016) and November specifically (an average of +50% and +30% results according to Tastylive ). For good measure, Trump wasn't as pro-Bitcoin during his previous run. In my view, the pre-market run will likely continue. I severely underestimated how excited the crypto community responded to a Trump victory. I still mentioned and expected Bitcoin and crypto companies to do well in the article mentioned but not to the extent it has. It is impossible to prove, as there are no counterfactuals, but I expected Bitcoin and the market to rise with a Kamala win as well. Anything was simply an improvement from the status-quo under Biden. Most interestingly, Trump has indicated he likes the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. It's an idea that's been worked on by Senator Cynthia Lummis, who advocates for the government to buy 1 million Bitcoins over 5 years. At most there will be 21 million of these things out there, so that's a considerable amount. If this idea gets implemented, I'd expect the outcome to be staggering, but it's not my base case. Just a more positive regulatory environment should have a positive effect, if nothing else, on the capital raising for crypto-associated companies. MicroStrategy I've been writing on Seeking Alpha about Bitcoin since 2016. Almost always favorably, as I think there's real merit to this interesting novel asset with all its widely discussed properties. I'm not a huge fan of certain derivatives of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (MSTR). I'd only touch something like that if you knew exactly what you were doing. But as I discussed here in more detail, MicroStrategy can have a large effect on Bitcoin's price. Since my last Bitcoin article, MicroStrategy has announced an astounding $42 billion plan to raise capital . Saylor is generally very upfront about what he will do with raised capital; buy Bitcoin. Historically, MicroStrategy follows this up with another capital raise if the price continues to rise. It will play defense if/when prices fall. Only part of the capital raising has happened, and it is likely designed to get some headlines, but it's an aggressive buyer who's waking up after being absent for a while. Risks The current key risks to me are that we've moved past November, which is a very good month for Bitcoin, and are moving towards early 2025. Especially, January can be a tough month. Perhaps with some of the buzz generated during the holidays slowing down. I've written often about the halving of 2024 and what it could potentially mean because miners bring less supply to market. However, when Bitcoin is rallying, crypto firms like MicroStrategy, but also the miners get to raise money at much more favorable terms. They tend to pounce on these opportunities: capital raising by miners (TheMinerMag) When this money gets converted into crypto-mining hardware, that results in more and more supply coming to market. When demand flags, the additional supply can start having an effect. Bitcoin prices go down, decreasing revenue miners are generating, causing them to sell more of their Bitcoin production and/or reserves. Conclusion I'm still quite bullish in the short term and the very long term. I'll likely get a bit more careful around Q1 2025. I'd strongly reconsider exposure if we move to $70k. This would be a clear change from the current bullish trend. Depending on the events driving such a drop, I'd either sit or potentially buy back in later. As for the upside, based on seasonal Bitcoin performance data, I think we could see Bitcoin $125k before the end of March. In my previous article I arrived at a price target of $88k primarily based on historical seasonal Bitcoin returns. Updating that number with seasonality return data up to March, starting from today's price, I get to $125k. Keep in mind that's just a possible target, and I'm more confident near-term prospects remain fine as with any exact target being achieved. For example, with the right tweets from a fresh President, higher prices are possible. Given all of the above, BITO and other Bitcoin funds remain a buy.",ARKB|BITB|BTC|ETH-USD|GBTC|IBIT|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-16 03:53:14

Analyst Says DOGE Is Basically Ready For the Next Move,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-to-24-analyst-says-doge-is-basically-ready-for-the-next-move/,"Cantonese Cat, a recognized cryptocurrency market analyst, has projected an extraordinary price target for Dogecoin, suggesting that the meme coin could rise to $24. This ambitious forecast represents a potential gain of over 5,823% from current levels, fueled by technical indicators and recent whale activity. Dogecoin has experienced mixed performance in recent weeks. After a sharp rally in early November that saw its price climb 132% in three weeks to $0.4800—marking a three-year high—the cryptocurrency has since retraced by 16%, currently trading around $0.4052. Despite this pullback, optimism remains strong among analysts and investors. According to Cantonese Cat, the asset’s recent price movements suggest the cryptocurrency is positioned for a significant breakout. The analyst highlighted that the token has successfully defended key support levels, particularly around the 0.786 Fibonacci extension. Based on historical trends, Dogecoin followed a similar pattern during its 2021 bull cycle, when it rallied from this level to surpass the 2.272 Fibonacci extension, peaking at $0.73995. Cantonese Cat predicts that Dogecoin could replicate this historical pattern and reach the same Fibonacci level at $24. If this target is met, the token’s market capitalization will exceed $3.5 trillion, solidifying its position as a major player in the crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Whale Accumulation Signals Growing Optimism In addition to technical analysis, recent whale activity further supports the bullish outlook for the asset. Market analyst Ali Martinez has observed significant accumulation among large holders, signaling increased confidence in the asset’s future potential. Martinez shared data that whales holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE purchased 160 million tokens, valued at approximately $64 million, within the last 24 hours. This accumulation has brought the total to 22 billion DOGE, worth around $9 billion. Such large-scale acquisitions indicate strong market sentiment and often precede substantial price rallies. The willingness of high-value investors to buy during a dip suggests they anticipate a significant upward movement in the token’s price. While the broader cryptocurrency market has shown bullish momentum, Dogecoin’s trajectory remains uncertain as it contends with critical resistance levels. Nevertheless, analysts like Cantonese Cat and Ali Martinez believe the token is well-positioned for future growth, supported by historical trends and whale activity.

Qubetics’ dVPN, Ripple’s Speed, and Monero’s Anonymity Stand Out as Smart Choices",https://timestabloid.com/searching-for-the-best-cryptos-to-invest-in-today-qubetics-dvpn/,"What makes a cryptocurrency worth your attention? With so many choices in the market, selecting the best cryptos to invest in today can be tricky. The exciting part is that some projects bring revolutionary solutions to the table. This article dives into three top contenders: Qubetics ($TICS) , Ripple, and Monero. Each of these offers something unique, from privacy enhancements to real-world use cases. Qubetics has quickly turned heads with its cutting-edge decentralised solutions, especially its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics doesn’t just push innovation—it actively addresses real-world challenges that other blockchains have struggled to solve. Let’s take a closer look at what sets these cryptos apart and why they’re the talk of the town. Qubetics Tackles Privacy with Game-Changing Solutions Qubetics ($TICS) has been causing a stir with its focus on decentralisation and user-centric applications. Its most talked-about innovation, the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , is a huge leap forward for internet privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs that depend on centralised servers, Qubetics creates a peer-to-peer network that ensures no single authority controls user data. This guarantees unparalleled transparency and privacy. To understand its impact, let’s consider a real-world example. Picture an entrepreneur who frequently handles sensitive business communications. Traditional VPNs may leave gaps for data breaches. With Qubetics’ dVPN , they can send and receive information securely, without worrying about third-party interference. Similarly, in regions with strict censorship, individuals can access the web freely, bypassing restrictions while staying anonymous. But there’s more to Qubetics than privacy. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it connects leading blockchains under one platform. This means smoother cross-chain transactions and a unified ecosystem. The ongoing Qubetics presale has grabbed attention too. Currently in its 12th stage, it has raised over $6.4 million, sold 334 million $TICS, and attracted more than 9,700 token holders. Each presale stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. These structured stages have created buzz around the $TICS presale , with analysts predicting significant growth in its value. If you’re curious to learn more about Qubetics, this video dives deeper into its features: Learn everything you need about this project . It’s clear that Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s solving real problems in a practical, user-friendly way. Ripple Focuses on Revolutionising Cross-Border Payments Ripple has made a name for itself as the go-to solution for cross-border payments. Using its native digital asset XRP, Ripple enables near-instant money transfers across borders at a fraction of the cost charged by traditional banking systems. Banks and financial institutions have adopted Ripple’s technology to modernise their payment infrastructure, making it a favourite among investors looking for practical utility. One of Ripple’s standout features is its consensus algorithm, which replaces the energy-intensive mining process used by many blockchains. This not only makes Ripple faster but also more eco-friendly. Transactions settle within seconds, a significant improvement over traditional systems like SWIFT, which can take days. For businesses and individuals who regularly send or receive international payments, Ripple offers a seamless experience that’s hard to ignore. However, Ripple’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. Its ongoing legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP is a security has created uncertainty in the market. Despite this, Ripple continues to thrive, forging new partnerships with major institutions worldwide. As the case inches closer to a resolution, many investors see this as an opportunity to get involved at a potentially pivotal time. Ripple’s focus on solving real-world problems makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in today. Its practical applications in the financial sector and growing adoption by banks make it a strong contender for long-term growth. Monero Brings Privacy to the Forefront If privacy is your top priority, Monero might be the cryptocurrency for you. Unlike most blockchains that operate with transparent ledgers, Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques to keep transactions private. This means senders, receivers, and transaction amounts are all hidden, offering unmatched anonymity for users. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to provide true financial freedom. Whether you’re a freelancer who wants to keep payments private or a business looking to maintain confidentiality, Monero’s features cater to diverse needs. Its RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) technology ensures that no one can trace the source, destination, or amount of a transaction. However, this level of privacy has also attracted criticism. Some governments and regulatory bodies have raised concerns about Monero’s potential misuse for illegal activities. Despite this, Monero remains a popular choice for users who prioritise privacy and security in their financial dealings. Another strength of Monero is its active developer community, which continuously works on updates and improvements. This ensures that the network remains robust and secure, even as other blockchains face scaling and security challenges. For investors seeking a cryptocurrency with a clear focus and loyal user base, Monero offers a unique proposition. Wrapping Up on Today’s Best Cryptos The best cryptos to invest in today depend on what you’re looking for. Ripple stands out for its role in revolutionising global payments, Monero caters to those prioritising privacy, and Qubetics shines as a blockchain innovator addressing real-world challenges. Each of these projects has its unique strengths, making them worthy of attention. As Qubetics presale continues to break records, it’s clear that $TICS is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a platform poised for growth. With over $6.4 million raised and a growing community of token holders, Qubetics is creating waves in the crypto world. If you’re ready to explore a crypto project with real utility, now might be the perfect time to take a closer look at these options.

Known for its focus on scalability and user-friendly decentralised applications, Near Protocol has been making waves in the blockchain space. Its rise in value has left early adopters grinning ear-to-ear, while those who missed the boat are left wondering, “What now?” If you’re feeling that FOMO, don’t worry—you’re not out of options yet. While Near Protocol continues to thrive, there’s another project that’s catching the crypto world’s attention for all the right reasons. Meet Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Web3 aggregator that’s taking blockchain innovation to a whole new level. With its focus on real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics is emerging as the best crypto to buy in December 2024, offering investors a rare opportunity for sky-high returns. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for Groundbreaking Growth Let’s talk about Qubetics . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s a trailblazer in the blockchain space, tackling problems that most projects don’t even attempt to solve. Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, making real-world asset tokenization not only possible but practical for businesses, creatives, and individuals alike. Imagine you’re a small business owner in Chicago with a warehouse full of inventory you can’t liquidate. Traditionally, you’d have to jump through hoops to get a loan, but with Qubetics, you can tokenize that inventory, turning it into blockchain-backed digital assets. Suddenly, you’ve got liquidity without the hassle of dealing with banks. Now think about a landlord in Austin who wants to unlock equity from a property without selling it outright. Qubetics allows them to tokenize a portion of their property, opening up new revenue streams while retaining ownership. It’s not just for businesses. Imagine an artist in Los Angeles who wants to sell their work directly to buyers around the world. By tokenizing their creations on Qubetics, they cut out the middlemen, keep more of their earnings, and reach a global audience with ease. Here’s the kicker: Qubetics is still in presale, and it’s already creating a buzz. Currently in Phase 12, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0311. The project has raised over $6.4 million, with more than 334 million tokens sold to over 9,400 holders. The presale price increases by 10% every week, and the final phase will see a 20% jump. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 after the presale ends, offering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI for those who get in early. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just an option—it’s the frontrunner for anyone seeking massive returns and meaningful innovation. Near Protocol (NEAR): A Blockchain Powerhouse for Scalable Solutions Near Protocol has made a name for itself as one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain world. With its focus on scalability, speed, and ease of use, Near Protocol has become a go-to platform for developers building decentralised applications (dApps). Its unique architecture and innovative solutions have earned it a loyal following and a spot among the top blockchain projects. In 2024, Near Protocol has continued to build on its success. Its integration with other blockchains through its Rainbow Bridge technology has expanded its ecosystem, making it a key player in the world of interoperability. Near’s user-friendly tools and developer-focused approach have drawn in projects from across the crypto space, helping it maintain its momentum. Price-wise, NEAR has seen steady growth throughout the year, reflecting its strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Analysts predict that its upward trajectory is likely to continue as the platform attracts more developers and users. However, while Near Protocol is a solid project with a bright future, its early explosive growth has already passed. For investors looking for a ground-floor opportunity with the potential for sky-high returns, Qubetics offers a unique and compelling alternative. Why Qubetics and Near Protocol Are Both Worth Considering Here’s the thing: you don’t have to choose between these two projects. Qubetics and Near Protocol serve different purposes and cater to different types of investors, making them both valuable additions to a diversified portfolio. Near Protocol is perfect for those who believe in the future of dApps and blockchain interoperability. Its focus on scalability and user-friendliness ensures that it will remain a key player in the crypto space for years to come. It’s a great option for investors seeking steady, long-term growth in a proven project. Qubetics, on the other hand, is all about real-world impact and explosive potential. Its focus on real-world asset tokenization is innovative and practical, opening up new opportunities for businesses, creatives, and individuals. With its presale offering a rare opportunity for massive ROI, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone looking to maximise their returns. Both projects are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain, and together, they offer a balanced mix of stability and high-growth potential. Regret skipping Near Protocol’s rise?

The on-chain analytics platform Nansen has shared with CryptoPotato key insights into important institutional trends that will gain momentum in the crypto market in 2025. However, these narratives are expected to do well under a clearer regulatory framework, which is anticipated under the Trump administration. Institutional Interest to Rise in 2025 The crypto industry is likely to experience a surge in institutional interest in both listed crypto products. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) could become part of the default-balanced asset allocation among asset managers and pension funds. Nansen analysts noted that buy-side investors may begin integrating crypto into standard allocations – moving from a traditional 60/40 equity-bond split to a 55/40/5 equity/bond/crypto split. “This comes from a feeling of “missing out” on the past 40% BTC rally three weeks after the election. Can investors afford not to be allocated at all to crypto going forward?” the report questioned. Bitcoin could also emerge as a frequently used collateral in traditional lending and decentralized finance (DeFi). Word is spreading that stablecoin issuer Tether is already in talks with the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald about a $2 billion BTC lending project. The Tokenization Trend Furthermore, the launch of new derivative products like Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) options indicates increasing institutional adoption. Nansen mentioned that such products and their trading platforms will also attract fees for financial intermediaries, so the sector is likely to surge. Moreover, institutions are exploring the tokenization of financial assets at an increasing pace. U.S. firms are taking major strides toward integrating blockchain in financial markets, and this could be the basis for significant growth if authorities provide clear rules for such operations. One more trend that could drive growth in the crypto sector is stablecoin regulation. If the U.S. makes progress on stablecoin regulatory frameworks, then there could be higher institutional adoption of tokenized fiat currencies. In the meantime, Nansen says the market is seeing a healthy rotation among outperforming cryptocurrencies amid a relatively shallow consolidation after the election. While December’s historical seasonality suggests a positive environment, there could be heightened volatility by January as the new U.S. administration takes office.

Bitcoin investments are best made countercyclically, during periods of low interest and panic, not during peak hype. The Company's bullish case is convoluted and lacks clear, sustainable cash flow generation, unlike straightforward business models like McDonald's or Google. For Bitcoin exposure, consider Bitcoin ETFs or even futures instead of MSTR, which carries additional risks and complexities and is inefficient. Before I start my discussion on MicroStrategy: I would like to set the tone that I'm not a crypto-denier: I was on the record strongly bullish on Coinbase ( COIN ) on October 10, 2022, during the crypto winter, and it has since gone up 367%. Coinbase coverage (Seeking Alpha) Ironically, as shown below, Bitcoin was trading at $20-30k apiece at that time and interest in Bitcoin was much more muted. Bitcoin price (StockCharts) After briefly introducing my crypto ""credentials"" of honking the bullhorn during the winter stage, I'm going to expand on why I think MicroStrategy should be avoided by investors. Now there is already a lot of bearish coverage on Seeking Alpha, so I'm not going to repeat their points, rather this article will focus on adding a few points: 1. Bitcoin investments are best done countercylically In fact, in the past 5 years, the good buy points were when there was panic and uncertainty, prices were low and sentiment was muted, e.g. as shown in the green boxes below (1) during the COVID panic in early/mid-2020, (2) the subsiding of the bubble during late 2022 and (3) during many uncertainties in mid-2024. Remember when there was worrying over Germany selling crypto in June/July 2024 ? Turns out that was near the low point of the whole year (a cynic might suggest the news of Germany selling a mere $1-$2 billion worth of bitcoin was exaggerated to drive down prices for accumulation, but that would just be pure guessing). Bitcoin price (StockCharts) Another way to gauge sentiment is by using Google Trends and searching for Bitcoin (a lower reading on the indicator indicates less search interest comparatively and vice versa). Note how periods with low search interest were usually bullish for Bitcoin (green boxes), while periods of high search interest and high anticipation (red boxes, i.e. right now, with hype of Strategic National Bitcoin Reserve ) were usually not so good for Bitcoin price performance. So even if an investor were bullish on Bitcoin for the long run, this is probably not the ideal time. Bitcoin Google Trends 2. Convoluted logic and unclarity of MSTR's business model Peter Lynch had a rule that analysts could deliver their pitch for why a stock was a good investment in 90 seconds. That's because the best investments have business models that are easy to clearly articulate. Many of the best investments of all time are easily understandable by any layman if articulated professionally. For example, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, Google etc. You can see the customers going to and from McDonald's, you can see people smoking and not really quitting, and you can see people using Google every day (whether or not these products and services have any negative externalities that need to be otherwise regulated or managed is a different topic). Their business models are visible and verifiable and there's no question about their existence and utility and popularity with customers. However, when it comes to MicroStrategy bulls, in my opinion, their bullish case is so circuitous and convoluted, it's hard to understand, and you need to continuously try to convince yourself that it makes sense and that in itself is a huge red flag to me. Maybe in the end it'll work out, but I highly doubt it. If we browse through some of the recent analysis on Seeking Alpha, bullish arguments about MSTR include raising debt at 0% to buy ""an appreciating asset (i.e. Bitcoin""). But Bitcoin, unlike real estate, does not yield cash flow, so where does the cash flows come from in the long run? Even Michael Saylor admits that ""MicroStrategy found a way to outperform Bitcoin. The way that we outperform Bitcoin, in essence, is we just lever up Bitcoin."" That does not sound to me like much of a business model. When an investor buys McDonald's or Google, he's buying into the perpetual future cash flows that these businesses can generate in the future. If MSTR is essentially just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, why should an investor buy MSTR (which is trading at a massive premium to the Bitcoin MSTR owns. MSTR has a market cap of $88 bn while it owns roughly $40bn of Bitcoin at current prices of $100k/coin, and that's before considering the bonds MSTR has issued that will need to be repaid somehow, further diluting the current shareholder and increasing MSTR's effective ""premium to net asset value"") and not just buy Bitcoin futures? What exactly are investors paying MSTR for that they cannot get in terms of adding or reducing leverage ratio in Bitcoin futures? This reminds me of what Greenspan wrote in his memoir ""The Age of Turbulence"" about Enron. Now, I'm not saying or alleging that MSTR is doing anything improper or anything like Enron; however, the similarity is that Greenspan viewed Enron's explanation of its business case as complicated and no one knew how it was making money. Eventually, it turns out it was not making money at all and was a house of cards. My view is that at times when darling stock prices have surged, investors in the market are at max gullibility and any story stock with a stock price still appreciating lures in believers. With NVDA going up 1000+% in a year and a half, anything seems possible. Investors should have learned from the Everything Bubble of 2021 receding that when the tide goes out, these speculative issues go kaput, but it seems like they are just doubling down. In fact, when the Everything Bubble of 2021 went out, MSTR fell by 90% from peak to trough as shown below. An investor would have made substantial gains by buying Bitcoin in mid-2020 in the $10ks and in late 2022 Bitcoin even at its trough was mostly in the 20ks. But joining the rollercoaster in MSTR, especially at times of peak interest, was calamitous the last time around and my assessment is that it is not a good risk-adjusted bet this time around either. MSTR stock price (StockCharts) Risks to bearish thesis Again, I would not recommending shorting this stock. Market enthusiasm can continue for way longer than anyone can predict (or sustain) and maybe MSTR doubles or triples and keeps their money machine going on for much longer. Conclusion Individual investors are strongly cautioned against buying MSTR or putting substantial amounts of their life/retirement savings into it. Its business model is unclear and if MSTR is just a levered bet on Bitcoin, then investors can just buy Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin futures to gain the same exposure. Note that I am not suggesting a leveraged exposure to Bitcoins, but if that's what investors are looking for, it would probably be more efficient than buying MSTR.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-16 04:36:00

Now, he’s back with a new creation: the XRP $ARMY logo. Lobanovskiy described it as “the helmet of courage, an unstoppable ‘X’ of strength,” symbolizing the power of the XRP Army. As he puts it, “The XRP Army is more than just a community—it’s a movement. We shall prevail.” XRP enthusiasts appreciated his efforts and thanked him for the logo. A user said, “Wow. I didn’t even know that you are behind the xrp logo. I was always fan of your work Eddie, but now you are officially one of my super top favorite artists.” Another wrote, “I’m really proud of being part of the #XRPArmy movement. But now with the new logo… This is just the next level, thanks so much for this.” https://twitter.com/lobanovskiy/status/1866877220209250806 The XRP Army has been a strong supporter of Ripple, especially during the tough SEC lawsuit.In October this year, they started a petition on Change.org asking the SEC to stop its appeal in the case. The petition has almost 10,000 signatures. Ripple supporters believe that the SEC’s ongoing legal actions are causing unnecessary instability. The petition brings to light the four-year fight with the SEC, where Ripple supporters have worked to protect the company’s legitimacy. The XRP Army believes the SEC’s actions go against its goal of protecting investors and ensuring fair markets. Ripple Vs SEC: An Ongoing Saga The Ripple lawsuit started in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple Labs of selling XRP as an unregistered security, which Ripple denies. In the latest developments, the SEC must file its appeal-related opening brief by January 15, just days before Chair Gary Gensler leaves the agency. His successor, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, is known for advocating more lenient regulation, especially in the crypto space. With Gensler leaving soon, there’s speculation he may try to settle big cases like Ripple’s before he goes, but it’s unclear if that will happen.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 04:40:36

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 04:41:00

The U.S. central bank is expected to reduce the benchmark borrowing cost by 25 basis points to the 4.25% to 4.5% range, marking a total easing of 100 basis points since September. However, there are concerns that the accompanying Fed commentary will seek to temper expectations for further easing, potentially diminishing the bullish impact of the rate cut. The Fed will announce its rate decision, the dot plot, comprising interest rate projections, and economic forecasts on Dec. 18 at 14:00 ET. A press conference by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell will occur a half hour later. The previous dot plot released on Sept. 18 showed 2.5 points of rate cuts by the end of 2026, pushing the borrowing cost below 3%. Some observers believe the Fed will trim these forecasts on Wednesday. ""We suggest the risk of a 'hawkish' cut with less rate hikes next year than anticipated in September in the Summary of Economic Projections (dot plot), recognition that economy is stronger than it had expected previously, and inflation is on a bumpy path that allows the Fed to be patient,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said in Sunday's edition of the newsletter. If the projections reflect slower or fewer rate cuts, Treasury yields and the dollar will likely extend their recent run higher, potentially making it harder for risk assets, including BTC, to stay as strongly bid as they have been of late. That said, seasonality is quite bullish for BTC, and with President-elect Trump sending positive regulatory vibes to crypto, a potential hawkish Fed may not have a long-lasting impact on the cryptocurrency. Besides, the Fed rate cuts will still remain on the table alongside an expected easing from China, keeping BTC's bull case intact. ""Yet, whilst lots of ink will be spilled on the pace of cuts going forward, little detracts from the supportive macro dynamic of a global central bank rate cutting cycle and rising global liquidity, set to be propelled by China,"" founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said. Later this week, markets will get the latest core PCE reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which will reveal whether the recent upticks in consumer price inflation are a fluke or hints of a genuine inflation rebound.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-16 04:53:33

Despite this impressive performance, some analysts believe the cryptocurrency has the potential to achieve even higher milestones. EGRAG CRYPTO, a well-known market analyst, recently shared insights suggesting that XLM could climb to $2, representing a 371% increase from its current price levels. #XLM – The Squeak Update!

He referenced a significant event in 2020 when the asset broke above its exponential moving average (EMA) on the two-week chart. Following that breakout, the asset experienced a dramatic rally, gaining over 3,100% to reach $0.80. The analyst noted that Stellar (XLM) once again broke above this same EMA in 2023, showing the possibility of a similar upward growth. Based on historical performance and current charts, he set a potential target of $2.27 for the digital asset. As of now, the token is trading at approximately $0.4134 and reaching the $2 target would require a 360% increase from its current price. Price Action and Resistance Levels While EGRAG is confident in XLM’s potential, he emphasized that the journey to $2 will not be immediate or without obstacles. In a follow-up post, he provided a detailed roadmap for how the asset could achieve this milestone. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst suggested that XLM’s first major test will be breaking its all-time high of $0.90. Once this resistance is cleared, he expects the price to retrace slightly before climbing to $1.20 and beyond. This prediction is based on XLM’s weekly price action, which positions the asset in the middle of an ascending channel. EGRAG highlighted that the $0.90 level represents a strong resistance zone and will likely serve as a key inflection point. If the asset successfully breaks through this barrier, it could set the stage for further gains. Stellar’s Strong Momentum The asset’s recent performance has been part of a broader bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past 30 days, the asset has delivered substantial returns to investors, fueling optimism about its long-term potential. Analysts like EGRAG believe the ongoing rally and favorable technical indicators provide a solid foundation for continued growth. While the path to $2 may be gradual, the projection underscores the strong momentum behind the token and its potential to deliver significant returns. Investors will likely monitor resistance levels and market conditions closely as the asset attempts to reach new heights.

Just 6 hours before the price surge, two multisign wallets with a common creator address withdrew their first ETH and staked them. Has some new institution started accumulating Ethereum, maybe. Their unrealized profit grew to $517,754 before coming back to $157,570 as ETH price fell to $3,930. The Break down Two multisign wallets 0x23a…dad and 0xc9c…d04 withdrew a total of 4,502 ETH worth $17.54 from Binance. This was the first withdrawal for both the wallets. Interestingly, both these multisign wallets have a common creation wallet 0x7cf…617. The withdrawals were executed between ETH price $3,880 and $3,900. These tokens were then staked to KelpDAO. Source : Spotonchain With the amount and timing of these transactions, it looks like these actions belong to some institution. It timed the movement of Ethereum perfectly as just 6 hours later, the token reached $4,022. The value of staked tokens rose by 3% creating an unrealized profit of $517k. One thing to keep in mind is that multisign wallets are commonly used by institutions. The Mysterious Institution It would not be possible to clearly state if this is some institution or a new fund. The wallets have no history and hence there is no way of tracking it. There are many possibilities. Source : X.com These addresses might belong to some new fund, or a DAO or even some major investor testing the waters. One of the multisign wallet is 4 days old and the other one is made just 15 hours ago. Even their creator wallet originated 51 days ago. Correlation with ETH Price Movement The most interesting part of these transactions is their timing. Were the transactions made based on some analyses as the time aligns perfectly with Ethereum recovery to $4k. Or it was vice versa? Did these transactions fill confidence in the market to push the price up. Whether this is a coincidence or a direct influence, it gives a clear message that the market is sensitive towards significant transactions. The Market Movement At the time of writing Ethereum is trading at $3,930, a0.28% drop in the last 24 hours. Before falling the token rose by 2.06% reaching $4,022. The price is facing rejection from upper levels and Moving Average is the first line of defence at the support level around $3,940. RSI is following the price action and has fallen to 53.19, still holding solid. Currently there is no reason for the market to fall down . The rise in trading volume by 11.26% shows traders are showing interest. Source : Tradingview What to Expect? With time, we might discover who was behind this major ethereum transaction but it is sure, after bitcoin, institutions are also getting interested in ETH. The price stands solid near $4k.

With a recent price of $105,688, the cryptocurrency has increased by more than 50% since the election on November 5. Plus, ether increased by about 3% to $4,014. On Chain data revealed that nearly 27,000 Bitcoins, worth $2.8 billion, were withdrawn from major exchanges over the weekend, potentially driving prices higher due to reduced supply. This is an electrifying effect of Trump’s ultimate vision is to ensure America’s dominance in crypto before anyone else takes over, particularly against competitors like China, has fueled confidence among investors. Moreover, his selection of crypto-friendly figures, including David Sacks as the White House AI and crypto czar and Paul Atkins to head the SEC, signals a policy shift towards mainstream adoption. This move is a green flag for global powers, including Russia, to explore Bitcoin’s potential to counter geopolitical challenges, signaling a possible “Bitcoin cold war.” President Vladimir Putin explores alternatives to the U.S. dollar. Putin recently emphasized Bitcoin’s resilience against restrictions, highlighting its appeal as a hedge against traditional currencies. The Bitcoin reserve plan gained traction as companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla adopted Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks. MicroStrategy now holds 423,650 BTC, worth $43.6 billion, showcasing Bitcoin’s potential as a modern reserve asset. Trump’s proposal for a Bitcoin reserve echoes his earlier promise at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, where he predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could rival gold’s $16 trillion. Supporting this vision, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act, advocating for the U.S. to acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years to address the $35 trillion national debt. Critics Have Mixed Views on Trump’s Bitcoin Plan Trump needs Congress to approve funding, clear SEC and Treasury guidelines, and Fed cooperation to succeed. In the meanwhile, Strike CEO Jack Mallers believes Donald Trump could issue an executive order on day one to make Bitcoin a U.S. reserve asset. While it wouldn’t involve buying 1 million BTC, Mallers calls it a “significant position” that could reshape Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy. Others argue that making Bitcoin part of national reserves could go against its decentralized nature. While price fluctuation are also expected with the plan. Bitcoin Current Scenario Market experts predict Trump’s plans could dramatically impact Bitcoin’s value. Perianne Boring, founder of the Digital Chamber, estimates Bitcoin could reach $800,000 by next year, creating a $15 trillion market cap. She highlighted Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a key driver: “The sky is the limit if Trump’s proposals take shape.” Notably, there are speculations 0.25% interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve on December 18 could further boost Bitcoin’s momentum, according to analysts.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 05:09:55

Aave (AAVE) and Mantra (OM) are outperforming in the DeFi sector while Rollblock (RBLK) is the undisputed top altcoin in crypto gambling. This crypto casino’s presale price increases are accelerating as the demand for its tokens explodes. With only a few weeks left in Rollblock’s crypto presale, investors are racing to get in on the potential for 100x growth while they still can. Aave’s Crypto Lending Tops Sector as DeFi Adoption Rates Soar Aave has been a dominant figure in the DeFi sector for years now. However, the Aave price has only recently started to take off after rising DeFi adoption rates saw users pour into its crypto lending business. Aave now has more than $13 billion in loans and over $33 billion in deposits on its books. The revenue generated by this incredible growth has sent the Aave price 125% higher this month. This strong monthly performance has brought Aave to the top of the DeFi sector for 2024 with over 206% yearly growth. Real World Assets Craze Sends Mantra Soaring 15,000% Mantra has made an even bigger impact on the DeFi sector in 2024 as the demand for Real World Assets (RWA) functionality explodes. Mantra is the top altcoin in RWA, and it has experienced explosive growth as the result of soaring interest in this newest frontier of the crypto industry. The Mantra price outperformed the rest of the DeFi sector this month with a 126% rally. This latest push brings Mantra’s total 2024 growth to more than 15,000%. Analysts expect this rate to slow somewhat in 2024, but the rapid growth in RWA is expected to continue to push the Mantra price higher. Rollblock Bets Big on Crypto Gambling Revolution Rollblock’s crypto gambling wager is set to outperform even DeFi superstars Aave and Mantra. Crypto gambling is an even bigger craze than DeFi, and the gambling industry’s $500 billion in annual revenue dwarfs the potential of the DeFi sector. The excitement over this top altcoin’s take on crypto gambling is because it uses blockchain technology to solve all the problems that have weighed on online gambling for decades. Blockchain gambling with Rollblock means free, fast and seamless access to more than 7,000 of the best provably fair games in the industry and a premier sports betting platform. Rollblock also has a unique gambling token that allows its community to share in the profits of the casino. These tokens are purchased off the market every week with a portion of the casino’s revenue. These tokens are either burned to reduce the market supply or awarded for staking to increase the market demand. Rollblock’s crypto gambling revolution is driving a potential for 100x or higher growth from its current price of only $0.0415. Rollblock recently entered the ninth stage of its crypto presale, which leaves only three more stages before its tokens hit the open market.

MicroStrategy, spearheaded by Michael Saylor, is set to join the Nasdaq-100, marking a major milestone as the first Bitcoin treasury company to enter the prestigious index. Meanwhile, MARA Holdings, a prominent crypto miner, is positioning itself to follow suit, bolstered by substantial Bitcoin investments and a growing market presence. Michael Saylor Hints at MicroStrategy’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase as BTC Hits Six Figures MicroStrategy , under the leadership of Michael Saylor, continues its relentless pursuit of Bitcoin dominance. Over the weekend, Saylor dropped a cryptic hint suggesting that the firm may have made another significant Bitcoin purchase — its first acquisition with an average purchase price exceeding $100,000 per Bitcoin. In a Dec. 15 post on X, Saylor teased followers by asking if the SaylorTracker portfolio tracker was “missing a green dot.” The reference is widely understood by the Bitcoin community as an indication of a new addition to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings. The timing aligns with the firm’s recent pattern of Sunday hints, which have consistently been followed by Bitcoin purchase confirmations on Monday. If confirmed, this acquisition would mark a historic milestone for MicroStrategy: its first Bitcoin purchase in the six-figure price range. Bitcoin has remained above $100,000 since 5:00 PM UTC on Dec. 13, according to CoinGecko . Previous purchases by the business intelligence firm were made at average prices of $97,862, $95,976, and $98,783, with acquisitions amounting to $1.5 billion and $5.7 billion during the last three purchase rounds. As of Dec. 16, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings total 423,650 BTC, valued at over $43.6 billion. Should the latest purchase fall near the upper range of previous acquisitions, the firm’s Bitcoin portfolio would inch closer to a staggering $50 billion valuation. The latest hint comes just ahead of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $106,554. This monumental price level reinforces Saylor’s confidence in Bitcoin’s future. He has previously stated that MicroStrategy has no intention of slowing down its Bitcoin purchases, even as the cryptocurrency climbs to unprecedented price levels. In a bold statement, Saylor asserted he’s ”sure” the company will continue buying Bitcoin even if its price reaches $1 million per coin. This unwavering strategy has made MicroStrategy synonymous with Bitcoin investment in the corporate world. The company’s stock, MSTR, has reaped the rewards of this approach, skyrocketing 496.4% year-to-date, according to Google Finance data . Such stellar performance has propelled MicroStrategy into the elite Nasdaq-100, a stock index comprising 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. A Game-Changer for Bitcoin Advocacy Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin has extended far beyond the corporate realm. As an influential advocate, he has played a crucial role in driving institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. His public comments often serve as a barometer for Bitcoin’s broader acceptance in financial markets. If MicroSrategy’s latest acquisition is confirmed, it could bring the firm tantalizingly close to a $50 billion Bitcoin portfolio. Such a milestone would solidify its status as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, a title it has held for years. As Bitcoin continues to climb to new heights, all eyes are on MicroStrategy to see how far its ambitious Bitcoin strategy can go. Whether Bitcoin reaches $1 million or more, Saylor appears determined to lead the charge. Michael Saylor Predicts MARA Holdings Will Be Next Bitcoin Firm to Join the Nasdaq-100 In related news, Saylor has tipped MARA Holdings, a leading cryptocurrency mining firm, as the next Bitcoin-focused company to join the Nasdaq-100 Index. The prediction came in a Dec. 14 post on X, where Saylor responded to MARA Holdings chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, who congratulated MicroStrategy on its recent inclusion in the prestigious index. “Thanks, Fred. I expect $MARA will be the next,” Saylor remarked, signaling confidence in MARA Holdings’ trajectory toward becoming one of the largest publicly traded companies on the Nasdaq exchange. MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100, set to take effect before the trading day on Dec. 23, cements its position as a trailblazer in Bitcoin adoption among publicly traded firms. The company, recognized as the first Bitcoin treasury company to achieve this milestone, has seen its market capitalization soar to $94.77 billion as of Dec. 13, according to Financecharts. Fred Thiel, MARA Holdings’ CEO, acknowledged MicroStrategy’s achievement, stating, “Congratulations to $MSTR and @saylor for being the first Bitcoin treasury company to join the Nasdaq 100.” He further emphasized that MARA is “working hard to get there,” pointing to the firm’s ambition to follow MicroStrategy’s footsteps. MARA Holdings, a leading Bitcoin mining company, has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings. In the last two months alone, the firm has invested over $600 million in Bitcoin, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite its smaller market capitalization of $7.32 billion compared to MicroStrategy, MARA is positioning itself as a key player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its stock price has also demonstrated growth, closing at $22.73 on Dec. 13 — up 16.74% over the past six months, according to Google Finance data. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 is reserved for the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange by market capitalization. Being part of this elite index signals strong financial performance, innovation, and investor confidence. MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq-100 coincides with the removal of three companies: Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna. The change reflects the dynamic nature of the index, where only the most competitive companies maintain their positions. MARA’s Call for US Leadership in Bitcoin MARA Holdings has not only focused on expanding its Bitcoin holdings but has also emerged as a vocal advocate for US dominance in Bitcoin mining and adoption. In a Nov. 26 post on X, the firm urged the US government to take more aggressive steps to secure its leadership in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, framing the issue as a matter of national security. “The United States faces an urgent need to secure its economic and national security interests,” MARA stated, drawing parallels between Bitcoin and gold as strategic reserves. The firm’s call to action comes amidst a global trend of de-dollarization, as countries increasingly diversify away from reliance on the US dollar. MARA’s push for US leadership in Bitcoin aligns with the growing narrative of Bitcoin as a strategic asset in the global economy. As geopolitical dynamics shift and the role of the US dollar in international trade faces challenges, Bitcoin’s decentralized and borderless nature is seen by many as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Michael Saylor’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin as a superior treasury asset has been instrumental in driving institutional adoption. His prediction that MARA will join the Nasdaq-100 suggests an increasing convergence of cryptocurrency firms with traditional financial markets. As MicroStrategy prepares to officially join the Nasdaq-100, it sets a precedent for other Bitcoin-focused firms like MARA Holdings to follow. The crypto miner’s recent investments and advocacy efforts underscore its commitment to becoming a major player in the Bitcoin space. With Bitcoin adoption continuing to rise and institutional players making significant moves, the inclusion of more crypto-centric companies in major indices like the Nasdaq-100 appears inevitable. Saylor’s prediction for MARA Holdings could be a glimpse into a broader trend where Bitcoin firms solidify their positions in traditional financial markets. Whether MARA will indeed be next remains to be seen, but its trajectory suggests it is well on its way to joining the upper echelons of the financial world. For now, the spotlight remains on MicroStrategy’s achievement, serving as a reminder of Bitcoin’s growing influence in global markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-16 05:30:44

However, market analysts emphasize that the digital asset is likely waiting for impactful news to trigger this movement. Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and prominent figure in the crypto community, has highlighted an ascending triangle pattern on XRP’s daily chart, which traditionally indicates a bullish trend. He believes that the lack of major news has kept the token trading within a narrow range, a condition often observed when markets are in a holding pattern. While the token has exhibited price fluctuations between 10% and 20%, Van Code predicts a decisive rally will occur once the price breaks through $2.90. Key Developments Driving Anticipation The community closely monitors several anticipated events that could catalyze a price surge. Among the most notable is the imminent launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Ripple recently secured regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to list RLUSD, marking a significant milestone for the company. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, confirmed that RLUSD will soon be available on partner exchanges, with an announcement expected in the coming days. Other potential drivers include XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the resolution of Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute. However, these developments are not expected until 2025, making the RLUSD launch the most immediate and impactful event in the short term. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.42, reflecting a 2.14 % decline in the past 24 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Targets and Technical Insights Analysts have identified several key price levels that XRP could achieve. Vincent Van Code maintains that surpassing $2.90 is critical for initiating a rally, while other experts provide additional insights into potential price targets. Arjantit, a technical analyst, has observed a bullish flag formation on XRP’s 8-hour chart, indicating a strong likelihood of upward momentum. He suggests that breaking above this pattern could push the price to $2.91, with $3.20 being the next target. Arjantit advises traders to look for confirmation of this setup before making decisions. Similarly, another analyst known as FinanceBro has expressed optimism about the token’s potential surge. He asserts that the bull flag pattern has fully developed, paving the way for a rally that could reach $4.40. FinanceBro also speculates that $4.40 might only be an intermediate target, with the possibility of even greater gains in the longer term. As XRP trades within a narrow range, the market eagerly anticipates news that could catalyze a breakout. The expected launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin stands out as the most immediate trigger, with analysts forecasting significant price gains once critical resistance levels are breached. If these predictions hold, the asset’s price could exceed $2.90 and continue its uptrend toward $3.20 and $4.40, offering promising prospects for investors and traders.

Starting today, businesses can measure their Bitcoin holdings at current market prices, making financial reporting more accurate and transparent. Starting fully in 2025, the change could drive more firms to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Following the two breaking news, Bitcoin surged above $105,000 today, adding U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s comments about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, similar to the country’s oil reserve. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $105,142 before settling at $104,609. It has seen a 55% rise post-election, with a whooping trading volume of $62B. HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 What’s Changing? This update, highlighted by Pete Rizzo of Bitcoin Magazine in a post on X, reflects a significant shift in how companies report their cryptocurrency holdings. Rizzo referenced a prior post by Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, to emphasize the importance of this change. Until now, companies recorded Bitcoin at its purchase price. If the value dropped, losses were reported, but if it went up, the gains weren’t included. This created a major gap in how companies reflected their true financial standing. With the new rules, Bitcoin’s value will now be updated in financial statements every reporting period, showing both profits and losses based on market prices. This change makes life easier for companies holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Big names like MicroStrategy and Tesla, which are known for their Bitcoin investments, will now have a smoother reporting process. Investors, creditors, and stakeholders will also get a clearer picture of a company’s financial health, making it easier to assess risks and performance. Who Benefits? The new standards apply to fungible crypto assets that meet specific criteria. However, assets like NFTs, wrapped tokens, and internally generated digital assets are excluded. For companies, this means better alignment with traditional accounting practices and greater transparency in their financial statements. A Big Win for Bitcoin This move is expected to encourage more companies to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. With fair value accounting in place, businesses can better handle Bitcoin’s price swings while staying transparent about their holdings. This milestone comes as the crypto market buzzes with speculation about former President Donald Trump’s potential plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, rumored to be enacted through an executive order on his first day after taking charge in January. The gap between traditional markets and the crypto economy is narrowing, and Bitcoin’s position as a dominant financial asset is stronger than ever.

According to this model, XRP could be valued at an extraordinary $122,580 under specific conditions, underscoring its theoretical potential within a tokenized global financial system. Understanding the Collateralization Model Valhil Capital, a venture capital firm, introduced several valuation frameworks to explore XRP’s potential as a digital asset. Among these, the Collateralization Model stands out for its ambitious assessment of XRP’s role as a universal collateral asset in a tokenized economy. This model envisions a future where global financial systems are entirely tokenized, incorporating a wide range of assets—such as real estate, derivatives, central bank reserves, and commodities—onto blockchain networks. XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is positioned as a key asset for collateralizing these tokenized assets. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has confirmed XRPL’s focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a development that aligns with the Collateralization Model’s premise. The methodology evaluates XRP’s utility as a store of value and its potential to secure tokenized assets rather than facilitate everyday transactions. Breaking Down the $122,580 Valuation The Collateralization Model bases its projections on the total global wealth, estimated at $5.3 quadrillion. Factoring in a 1.25x risk adjustment ratio and calculating the present value of a tokenized economy, the model predicts that global tokenized assets could reach $6.2 quadrillion by 2030. By dividing this projected value by XRP’s circulating supply of approximately 50.7 billion tokens, the model arrives at an estimated fair market value of $122,580 per token. This analysis highlights XRP’s potential to become a foundational element of the tokenized financial ecosystem. The model emphasizes that this valuation depends on a scenario where blockchain technology fully represents global wealth and XRP plays a pivotal role in collateralizing assets across a highly interconnected system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Challenges to Realizing This Valuation Despite the Collateralization Model’s optimistic outlook, significant obstacles could hinder the realization of such a scenario. For instance, the global tokenization of assets would require overcoming technological, regulatory, and economic challenges. Additionally, the valuation excludes certain variables that could affect the accuracy of its estimates. Nonetheless, the model underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology and XRP’s role within it. It presents a theoretical analysis rather than a price prediction, aiming to illustrate what XRP’s value could be under ideal conditions. XRP’s Current Performance At the time of press, XRP is trading at approximately $2.40, reflecting strong performance in recent weeks as it maintains $2 support. While this is positive, it remains far below the Collateralization Model’s suggested fair market value. The disparity between XRP’s current price and theoretical valuation highlights the broader conversation around the cryptocurrency’s utility and potential within a tokenized global financial infrastructure.

He urged investors not to fall for “FOMO” (Fear of Missing Out) over possible early price fluctuations of the stablecoin. For the unversed, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that RLUSD has received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. Responding to concerns raised on X, Schwartz explained that during RLUSD’s early days, some individuals may be willing to pay unusually high prices, like $1,200 per fraction of an RLUSD, simply to be the first to purchase it. He wrote, “If you want to spend a lot of money to get a tiny bit of RLUSD before anyone else does, you can. But please don’t expect the price to stay over $1 once things stabilize, which I expect they will do very quickly. Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich.” As RLUSD goes live, there may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes.

Community Awaits the Launch: The XRP community is excited for the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD is a stablecoin tied to the US dollar, meaning its value will stay at one US dollar.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

Speculation also increased after some competitive pressure from platforms like Blur, which gained dominance through a very successful airdrop strategy. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is demanding crypto exposure disclosures from firms by 2025 to assess financial stability risks and policy options. In Japan, lawmaker Satoshi Hamada proposed a national Bitcoin reserve due to its potential economic benefits and the global trends toward Bitcoin adoption as a strategic asset. NFT Community Buzzes Over Potential OpenSea Token OpenSea, the well known NFT marketplace, ignited speculation about a potential token launch and user airdrop after registering in the Cayman Islands. The development was announced on Dec. 14 by Waleswoosh , a pseudonymous researcher that is associated with the Azuki NFT collection, who shared a screenshot of the registration. This led to widespread rumors in the NFT community that OpenSea may be planning to launch its cryptocurrency and reward users through an airdrop. The speculation comes on the heels of OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer's announcement on Nov. 4 about the platform's plans for a major relaunch. Although Finzer provided very limited details, he did promise that the revamped platform will be introduced in December. At the time, some users believed an airdrop might be part of the relaunch, but skepticism arose from people like DappRadar’s communications manager. Despite the absence of an official announcement, OpenSea’s Cayman Islands registration boosted hopes among users for an airdrop. Community members, including Matter Labs’ manager “ Golem ,” are optimistic that OpenSea will reward its early supporters to re-establish trust and loyalty. However, there are still concerns about whether the potential airdrop will actually adequately account for the high trading volumes from 2021 and 2022 , which was a period that was marked by billions in NFT sales. Users also speculated that OpenSea might emulate competitors like Blur and Magic Eden, which issued tokens to attract and keep users. OpenSea previously took measures to regain its market share, which included the introduction of zero fees in February to compete with Blur. However, Blur continued to dominate NFT trading volumes, with OpenSea and OKX trailing behind. Blur’s success was partially attributed to its airdrop strategy, where users earned tokens after each trading season. In one instance, a Blur user even reportedly earned $11 million in tokens after the platform’s second-season rewards. Magic Eden also adopted an airdrop strategy but faced some challenges during its rollout. Its ME token was launched earlier in December, and initially rallied to $13.10 before plummeting almost 70% due to user complaints about the claiming process and technical issues in its mobile app. ME price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) So far, OpenSea has not commented on the speculation surrounding its plans. Bank of England Demands Crypto Exposure Disclosures In Europe, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) issued a request for firms to disclose their current and future exposure to cryptocurrencies by March of 2025. The move was made to enhance the regulator's ability to monitor financial stability and shape policies regarding crypto assets. In a statement that was released on Dec. 12, the PRA asked firms to detail their “current and expected future crypto asset exposures” and provide information on how they are applying the Basel framework . This framework is an international standard for managing capital and risk in crypto exposures that was introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December of 2022. The PRA plans to use this information to evaluate the costs and benefits of different policy options and refine its prudential treatment of crypto assets. This initiative is also part of a broader attempt to understand the financial stability implications of crypto assets and emerging technologies like permissionless blockchains. Firms are being asked to provide insights into their planned crypto activities up to Sept. 30, 2029, with specific focus on areas like the application of the Basel framework and the use of decentralized ledgers. While the PRA acknowledges the potential benefits of permissionless blockchains, like increased transparency and efficiency, it still pointed out some serious risks, including settlement failures and a lack of guaranteed links between asset ownership and control mechanisms. The regulator stated that these risks are not yet sufficiently mitigated, although the classification remains under review. This development happened as a growing number of global firms and countries are investing heavily in Bitcoin. Some well known examples include Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International, which converted close to $50 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a treasury adjustment. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also announced plans to raise over $62 million to increase its Bitcoin holdings. Japan Urged to Consider National Bitcoin Reserve Many other counties are now also contemplating the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada recently asked some serious questions about the potential for Japan to establish national Bitcoin reserves. In a query that was submitted to Japan’s House of Councillors on Dec. 11, Hamada called on the government to assess global movements toward Bitcoin reserves. He specifically referenced initiatives in the United States and other countries. He argued that adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide major economic benefits, and stated that Japan should consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets like Bitcoin. Hamada’s questions were centered around the increasing global attention on Bitcoin as a strategic asset. He pointed to efforts by U.S. lawmakers and crypto advocates to introduce a Bitcoin reserve, a concept tied to Republican lawmakers' recent electoral success and former President Donald Trump’s campaign promises. Similar proposals emerged in Brazil , where lawmakers are exploring Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks. Hamada’s social media activity indicates that he is very closely following U.S. developments, including initiatives backed by well known people in the industry like Elon Musk. Hamada even retweeted posts from Musk's political action committee about the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, which could indirectly support crypto adoption. Japan has a gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $4 trillion, and ranks as one of the world’s largest economies, although it recently slipped from third to fourth place, behind Germany. Hamada implied that introducing a national Bitcoin reserve could boost Japan’s economy nicely and position it very well in global markets. This will also benefit crypto holders and enhance the country’s financial resilience. A national Bitcoin reserve is a strategic allocation of Bitcoin by a government as part of its foreign exchange or national reserves. Overall, it is actually very similar to how countries hold gold or foreign currencies. The idea is to use Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks, currency devaluation, or geopolitical uncertainties while still potentially benefiting from its long-term value appreciation and decentralized nature. This approach positions Bitcoin as a store of value and a tool for improving financial resilience and economic stability.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-16 06:05:35

Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,000, up 2.80% in the last 24 hours, and the price has pulled back slightly from its record high. Analysts attribute Bitcoin's record-breaking rally to a combination of institutional demand, rising adoption, and supportive market developments. “This new all-time high is a turning point for Bitcoin,” said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. “It signals that Bitcoin is shifting from a retail-focused asset to one increasingly dominated by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate adoption, further solidifying its status as a legitimate asset class.” Key Factors Behind the Increase US President-elect Donald Trump has sparked optimism in the crypto market with his recent announcement of creating a strategic crypto reserve and promising to “do something great” with crypto. MicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq 100 MicroStrategy, a major Bitcoin holder with reserves worth over $44 billion, announced on December 23 that it will join the Nasdaq 100 index. Co-founder Michael Saylor also fueled the excitement with social media posts hinting at additional Bitcoin purchases. Riot Platforms' Bitcoin Purchase Bitcoin mining giant Riot Platforms further boosted market sentiment on Friday by announcing that it purchased 5,117 Bitcoins at an average price of $99,669 per coin. The Federal Reserve’s final FOMC meeting of the year on Wednesday is drawing a lot of attention from investors. The probability of a 25 basis point rate cut is 97.1%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which could provide further support for Bitcoin and other risk assets. “The FOMC meeting will provide important insights into the Fed’s monetary policy trajectory,” said Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Research. “Any dovish signals, combined with expectations for Trump’s crypto-related policies, could trigger another rally for Bitcoin.” As we approach the end of 2024, market participants remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s continued growth potential. With deepening institutional participation and macroeconomic factors aligning, analysts are predicting a strong start for Bitcoin in the new year. *This is not investment advice.

Mark Longo, the owner of “Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT),” recently stated that he had sent a cease-and-desist letter to Binance through his legal team. Binance Faces Trademark Dispute In his statement, Mark Longo said that his legal team sent a cease-and-desist letter to Binance. He claimed that Binance used the “PNUT” trademark and the well-known image of Peanut the Squirrel on their platform without permission.

He pointed out that global platforms like Binance need to be careful about respecting copyrights and trademarks. For Longo, PNUT’s image and branding represent years of hard work and creativity, which he feels have been unfairly used. What Could Happen Next? As of now, Binance has not issued an official response to these allegations. If Binance fails to respond or address the issue, Longo may escalate the matter further with legal proceedings. For now, the focus remains on Binance’s reaction to the cease-and-desist letter and whether they will take steps to resolve the dispute.

While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, Van Code’s advice offers a prudent approach to managing potential gains responsibly and securely. Below is an analysis of his key points, emphasizing compliance, security, and long-term financial planning. If one day #XRP hits $100, there are some things you need to do to stay compliant when you decide to cash in: 1. Keep records of all your transactions. Especially if you are using a cold wallet 2. Spread tokens across more than 2 wallets, this way you can minimise losses if you… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 14, 2024 Maintain Comprehensive Transaction Records: Van Code underscores the importance of record-keeping, especially for those using cold wallets to store their cryptocurrencies. Keeping detailed records of every transaction is essential for tracking gains and complying with tax obligations. Failing to maintain accurate documentation can lead to complications during audits or when filing taxes. Diversify Wallet Usage: To mitigate the risk of losing funds in the event of a hack, Van Code advises spreading tokens across multiple wallets—ideally more than two. This approach ensures that the remaining funds are safeguarded if one wallet is compromised. Manage Bank Deposits Strategically: Cashing out large sums, such as depositing $100,000 into a bank account, can attract unwanted attention from financial institutions and tax authorities. Van Code recommends conducting smaller, incremental transactions to minimize scrutiny. Additionally, consulting with a financial adviser can help ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and reporting requirements. Set Aside Funds for Taxes: Investors must calculate their tax liability immediately upon cashing out and allocate the required amount in a separate account. This practice prevents unintentional overspending and ensures that tax payments are made on time. Crypto investors are often subject to capital gains taxes, which vary depending on jurisdiction and holding period. Exercise Caution in Sharing Information Online: Van Code warns against discussing cryptocurrency holdings or financial activities publicly, particularly on social media. Cybercriminals often use automated tools to gather personal information, which can be pieced together to target individuals for theft or fraud. Protecting one’s anonymity and digital footprint is critical in the crypto space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adopt Robust Security Measures: To safeguard accounts, Van Code advises enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), preferably through an authentication app rather than SMS, which is more vulnerable to interception. He also recommends using a password manager to generate and store unique passwords, as reusing passwords increases the risk of breaches. Invest in Appreciating Assets: When it comes to spending gains, Van Code advocates for purchasing appreciating assets like art, collectible watches, or property rather than depreciating items such as luxury cars or handbags. This approach ensures wealth preservation over time. Plan Investments Wisely: For those considering long-term investments, real estate and stocks are prudent options. Van Code emphasizes that substantial gains do not necessitate extravagant spending. Thoughtful investment strategies can ensure lasting financial security. Consult a Financial Adviser: While his advice is insightful, Van Code explicitly states that he is not a financial adviser and encourages individuals to seek professional guidance. A comprehensive financial plan tailored to personal circumstances is essential for maximizing the benefits of a windfall and avoiding costly mistakes. Van Code’s recommendations reflect a balanced approach to managing significant cryptocurrency gains, prioritizing compliance, security, and sustainable wealth-building. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, adhering to such principles can help investors navigate the complexities of digital assets responsibly.

Charles Hoskinson is reshaping Bitcoin’s DeFi future with bold innovations, while Rollblock offers early backers exciting features. Table of Contents Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision Bitcoin’s $23 billion accumulation wave Cardano’s multichain leap Rollblock is making waves Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, has provided insight into the next developments within Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. Envision a combination of Bitcoin’s capabilities with cutting-edge DeFi tools—that is the vision. Hoskinson said that his business, Input Output Global (IOG), would collaborate with Fairgate Labs to achieve this, ditching BitcoinOS. As an early supporter of Rollblock , this could mean thrilling prospects to capitalize on Bitcoin-driven DeFi. Read on to find out more. Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision Charles Hoskinson is shaking things up again. The Cardano founder just announced plans to build a cutting-edge DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin. This shift promises a fresh approach to bringing decentralized finance to the Bitcoin network, and if users are backing Rollblock, they’re in for some serious perks as these innovations unfold. For starters, Rollblock’s secure and private transactions mean interactions and trades are encrypted, keeping everything safe and confidential. It’s like having your own vault for crypto activities, perfect for navigating the DeFi space. Then, there’s the multicurrency staking feature. Whether users are Bitcoin loyalists, Ethereum enthusiasts, or Dogecoin fans, Rollblock lets users stake their assets and earn rewards across multiple blockchains. With its 9th presale raising over $7 million and trading at $0.0415, it’s clear Rollblock is attracting attention. To top it all off, Rollblock periodically burns tokens, creating scarcity and driving up value. For early backers, that means every move Rollblock makes is designed to grow users’ stakes. With Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision and Rollblock’s features, the future is bright, and profitable. You might also like: Analysts expect more gains for SOL but flag Arbitrum, Rollblock as strong competitors Bitcoin’s $23 billion accumulation wave Bitcoin is making waves with a massive $23 billion accumulation, solidifying the $96,000–$100,000 range as a key support zone. In just two weeks, 245,000 BTC have been added to this range, showcasing strong investor confidence. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) highlights $99,559 as the largest accumulation zone, with 125,000 BTC purchased for just under $100,000. This activity reflects optimism for Bitcoin’s future as investors position themselves for potential upward moves while maintaining a solid foundation in the current range. Cardano’s multichain leap As we stated earlier, Charles Hoskinson announced the incorporation of Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain, into Cardano. This will make Cardano a multichain environment that integrates Ethereum and Solana. Midnight’s zero-knowledge technology lets users communicate with dApps while protecting their data, an innovation poised to reshape DeFi. On the flip side, Cardano has dropped 17% recently, driven by whale sell-offs and profit-taking. As large holders reduce their positions, ADA’s price may struggle to stay above $1. Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision might be the spark Cardano needs to shoot to new highs. Rollblock is making waves As the DeFi space evolves, Rollblock is positioning itself as a true game-changer, with features like multicurrency staking, privacy, and play-to-earn perks. While other tokens, like Cardano, continue to innovate, Rollblock’s early backers stand to benefit the most. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials.

Investors are also looking ahead to several major central bank decisions due this week including the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose +0.04% rose to around 39,600, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.05% to 2,748 on Monday, the Japanese yen depreciated toward 154 per dollar on Monday, hitting its weakest levels in three weeks amid bets that the Bank of Japan will forgo an interest rate hike this week. On the economic front, data showed that core machinery orders in Japan, a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, topped expectations in October. Japan's factory activity shrinks for sixth straight month, services activity improves in December . China ( SHCOMP ) rose +0.01% to around 3,395 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.9% to 10,615 on Monday, with mainland stocks struggling for clear direction and the offshore yuan weakened further around 7.28 per dollar, as traders digested mixed economic data. Data showed that retail sales in China slowed more than expected in November , while industrial production grew more than anticipated. New home prices in the country also declined for the 17th consecutive month in November, amid a prolonged property downturn. Additionally, the unemployment rate held steady at 5%, in line with expectations. In November 2023, the surveyed unemployment rate was also 5%. Foreign direct investment into China shrank by 27.9% year-on-year to CNY 749.7 billion in the first eleven months of 2024, compared with a 29.8% plunge in the previous period, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. As reported by Bloomberg, citing the 21st Century Business, the People's Bank of China is set to cut interest rates and reserve requirements next year. In a statement released after the release of November activity data, the National Bureau of Statistics said China's domestic demand is insufficient while the external environment is complex. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -0.76% to 19,836, extending falls from the prior session as traders reacted to November activity data in China. India ( SENSEX ) fell -0.61% to 81,819 in Monday morning trade, as traders took profit after the BSE Sensex hit its highest level in over two months in the previous session. Total passenger vehicle sales in India grew by 4.3% year-over-year to 300,459 units in November 2024, following a 1.1% rise in the previous month, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. The figures exclude sales from BMW, Mercedes, JLR, and Volvo. The private sector in India expanded the most in four months, with the manufacturing expanding faster, while the services sector grew the most since August. Australia ( AS51 ) fell -0.56% to close at 8,250 on Monday, marking its lowest point in nearly a month, as mining stocks led the downturn amid weaker metals prices. The South Korean won ( USD:KRW ) stabilized at 1,433 per dollar following the weekend impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Political uncertainty in South Korea eased after the legislature initiated the impeachment on Saturday in response to Yoon's controversial attempt to impose martial law, which ended in failure. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended mixed with concerns over the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision and economic conditions limiting further gains. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Monday as investors braced for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision this week: Dow +0.05% ; S&P 500 -0.02% ; Nasdaq -0.04% . The price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged above $106,000 on Monday before paring some gains, driven largely by US President-elect Donald Trump's support for digital assets and plans to make the sector more regulated. Week Ahead : Traders are now shifting their attention to the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision later this week, where the bank is expected to deliver a 25bps cut. Other key highlights in the US include retail sales, PCE prices, personal income and spending, the final estimate of GDP growth, industrial production, manufacturing and services PMIs, building permits, housing starts, and existing home sales. In the UK, the BoE's policy decision, inflation figures, retail sales, and jobs report will draw attention. Japan will feature the BoJ's interest rate decision, inflation and foreign trade data.

Recent catalysts that have supported growth in BTC include increased speculation of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump creating a federal bitcoin reserve, and crypto companies such as Riot Platforms and MicroStrategy purchasing billions worth of the asset in past weeks. Optimism in U.S. policies are driving bitcoin ETFs inflows higher, contributing to increased prices, some point out. “TradFi inflows now dominate all sentiment and price action in BTC unlike any other prior crypto cycle before,” shared Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. “This influence will only grow as more and more traditional firms finally need to have a digital asset policy given the immense revenue opportunities and sea-change in the political environment.” Recent price action has shown bitcoin forming higher lows, indicative of a sustained uptrend. The formation of a bull flag or a bullish continuation pattern after recent highs could signal further upward movement. This month tends to be historically bullish for bitcoin in a move that’s colloquially termed the ""Santa Claus Rally."" Data from the past eight years shows that bitcoin ended December in the green six times since 2015, running at least 8% to as much as 46% (in the outlier year of 2020). Seasonality is the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. While it may look random, possible reasons range from profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, to the generally bullish November and December, a sign of increased demand ahead of holiday season. Meanwhile, some traders are now targeting the $120,000 level and above for BTC in the coming year. “We think bitcoin still has tremendous upside potential and could easily hit the $125k mark by the end of 2025,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, said over Telegram. “While some say the upside has already been priced in over the last month or so, we think the rally is just getting started.” “This is because it takes time for institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals to warm up to the idea of allocating 1%-3% of their portfolios to bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Once that happens, crypto inflows could skyrocket. And given Trump's pro-crypto appointments, continued rate cuts, and stimulus spending from China, there are a lot of reasons to be bullish,” Mei added.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-16 06:37:50

With a 14% increase, BTC can break above the market cap of Google. Strike CEO Jack Mallers said that Trump might issue an executive order to buy BTC. Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a historic milestone, climbing to a new all-time high of $106,488, giving it a market cap of $2.11 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap . Currently trading at $104,745 with a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin now stands on the verge of surpassing Google’s market cap of $2.3 trillion. With just a 14% increase in price, Bitcoin could become the 6th largest asset globally by market volume, solidifying its place as one of the most valuable financial instruments in the world. For context, Google—the tech giant with dominance across market sectors—has a market cap of $2.3 trillion, as reported by Yahoo Finance . If Bitcoin surpasses this benchmark, it would represent a historic milestone, solidifying its place among the world’s most valuable assets.

37704530,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393451,1734331999,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"Cryptocurrency Market Today: Bitcoin Smahes New Highs Along with Ondo (ONDO) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), While Fantom (FTM) Marks Huge Gains",https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-market-live-bitcoin-smahes-new-highs-along-with-ondo-ondo-virtuals-protocol-virtual-while-fantom-ftm-marks-huge-gains/,"The post Cryptocurrency Market Today: Bitcoin Smahes New Highs Along with Ondo (ONDO) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), While Fantom (FTM) Marks Huge Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The markets began the weekly trade on a bullish note after the price of Bitcoin recorded a new ATH above $106.6K . This triggered a massive upswing in some altcoins, while others chose to trade within a narrow range. Ondo, for instance, is leading the top 100 with an over 15% rise, while Fantom (FTM) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) maintain a growth of over 13% each. With a bullish start, the question arises as to whether these tokens can maintain their dominance until the end of the day. Ondo (ONDO) Price Analysis Ondo price has been maintaining a steep upswing for over 40 days, regardless of the volume, which has been draining. Meanwhile, the bulls continue to remain dominant as they can exert enough bullish pressure. This also flipped the death cross that occurred in the first few days of September, offering significant bullish momentum to the token that smashed a new ATH at $2.79. As the above chart suggests, the price remains within the bullish range of the FIB channels as the price surged above 1 FIB but is yet to reach the next target at 1.2 FIB. The on-balance volume (OBV) continues to rise, suggesting the continuity of a bullish trend. Besides, the +Di & -DI are departing from each other, indicating a rise in the bullish trend. Therefore, the ONDO price is believed to maintain an ascending consolidation and mark a new ATH at $2.33, probably before the end of the year. Fantom (FTM) Price Analysis The Fantom price has been trading in a strong ascending trend since the reversal of the August lows close to $0.26. The trading volume over the platform has risen since November, which appears to have declined to a large extent. However, the token could get a fresh bullish boost as the selling pressure seems to have faded over the token. Hence, the price is believed to secure some crucial levels that may help the token form a new ATH in 2025. The FTM price is trading within a rising parallel channel and has faced multiple rejections close to the resistance. Currently, the token is facing some bearish pressure, but the bulls are expected to revamp a strong rise. The MACD ( Moving Average Convergence Divergence ) shows a drop in the selling pressure, which could pave the way for the accumulation of fresh buying volume. Hence, with a rise in the buying pressure, the price is expected to break above the Bollinger bands , which are currently going parallel, and reach $1.68. However, sustaining above the range could push the price above $2, which may eventually help the token to head towards the new ATH. On the other hand, the Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) price continues to trade within a discovery phase, forming a new ATH around $2.79. With this move, the token is an inch close to entering the top 50 cryptos, surpassing the giants like BONK, WIF, INJ, & ONDO. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It went up, down, and up again in the past 12 hours or so, leaving over $300 million in liquidations, but one particular order stands out as the largest. Data from CoinGlass shows that the primary cryptocurrency’s rally has wrecked nearly 100,000 traders in the past 24 hours. However, the biggest single liquidated position took place on Binance and involved the BTC/USDT trading pair. The total value was a whopping $19.86 million, which the whale lost during the volatile ride. Although it sounds as if it was likely from a short position, BTC also retraced by about two grand immediately after the latest peak, which could cast some doubt on whether it could have been a trader expecting further gains. After all, just over 51% of the liquidations on Binance were for shorts. Nevertheless, these developments only go to show that traders should be wary when opening over-leveraged positions in the current volatile environment. Liquidation Heat Map.

These include ETH, SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and TON are up by around 2-3% each. SUI have jumped the most from the larger caps, having gained 9% and trading close to $4.8.

It is growing at a very fast pace with an intersection of AI and DeFi. Unlike conventional exchanges, it will integrate AI across all levels—the first true modern-gen exchange platform. As a trailblazer, experts anticipate massive adoption, primed for explosive growth. Experts suggest the INTL token will hit the $1 billion market cap milestone soon. IntelMarkets (INTL): A Novel AI-Powered Trading Platform IntelMarkets (INTL) might be this year’s most innovative crypto project. It adopts a novel strategy by fusing blockchain, DeFi, and AI technology. Industry analysts describe the resulting AI-driven trade system as revolutionary. It will differ from traditional platforms in a number of ways, including its sophisticated trading bots and ecosystem driven by an AI-based blockchain. Regardless of a user’s financial background, INTL’s trading bots will be built to provide them with access to top-notch trading methods. Furthermore, these bots may automatically enter profitable trading positions while processing large volumes of data from many sources at breakneck speed. Investors have started placing bets on the INTL cryptocurrency due to its imminent adoption. It is one of the greatest new cryptocurrencies to invest in because of its use cases, which include staking, governance, and administration. Huge Growth Prospects: On Track for a 9,500% Upswing As a new ICO and altcoin, INTL’s upside potential is staggering, outshining top crypto coins. With no bull market history, it has plenty of room to run, prompting traders to shift focus away from top altcoins to the new AI coin. In stage 7 of the ICO, a token costs only $0.064, heavily discounted and undervalued. Moreover, it is underpriced, allowing investors to position for substantial gains without breaking the bank—a retail favorite. Industry experts believe it is on track for a 9,500% upswing after its debut, making it arguably the best crypto to invest in. This significant upside potential is among the key reasons behind the presale selling out fast. Over $4.3 million has been raised, cementing its status as a top ICO and highlighting investor trust in its potential. Multichannel Analysis: A Key Feature Of IntelMarkets Multichannel analysis is a key feature of IntelMarkets. The Intelli-M trading system can perform technical calculations from multiple markets in seconds—the same can’t be said for other platforms. This is crucial as it would allow traders to maximize opportunities across different crypto pairs. Automatic and Self-Learning Trading Bots Sets INTL Apart INTL’s cutting-edge trading bots can identify profitable market opportunities, making it one of its kind. But that isn’t all; they can also take positions depending on users’ trading objectives. One only needs to adjust variables like leverage, risk, and position sizing to maximize this tech. Equally important, these trading robots can learn from their mistakes and real-time trading data, improving their performance. This ability to self-learn sets them apart. INTL’s Dual-Chain Functionality Makes It A Top Choice Lastly, IntelMarkets is a dual-chain functionality exchange that hopes to make the most of the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. It will be supported and can run on these mentioned chains, with traders able to choose their preferred blockchains based on specific requirements, such as preferences and strategies. For example, a trader might want to tap into Ethereum’s deep liquidity pools or robust ecosystem of dApps. Alternatively, Solana’s cost-effectiveness and scalability are also highly sought after. These features have catalyzed worldwide adoption and increased the popularity of the INTL tokens. Market analysts reveal that IntelMarkets is the most downloaded in this bull run. IntelMarkets (INTL): The First Quantum-Proof Trading Platform IntelMarkets ( INTL) will be the first of many things. It pioneered the world’s first quantum-proof custody solution, stirring up much buzz within the $264 billion global crypto trading market. Its recently launched QuantumX Wallet is a decentralized product developed after months of research aimed at preventing future security challenges arising from the de-encryption of data. The QuantumX Wallet will fend off cybersecurity attacks and the threat of quantum computing. It will provide the first retail solution to address this problem, and its outlook couldn’t be more bullish. Meanwhile, the Route X21 research initiative, seeded by a $1 million grant from partners in the MENA region, is dedicated to addressing the challenges posed by quantum computers. Given IntelMarkets’ real-world application, investors and retailers have been flocking to the ongoing INTL presale, tipped as the next big thing. Experts anticipate a $1 billion market cap for IntelMarkets soon.

According to reports, one bid on a Ripple ( XRP ) wallet called Xaman priced a portion of RLUSD at 511 XRP, which is more than $1,200. Schwartz explained that rather than reflecting actual market worth, such high bids probably reflect people looking for the novelty of holding the first RLUSD tokens.

Let’s dive in and see what sets these projects apart and why BTFD stands out as the best meme coin presale with 1000x potential.

Imagine diving into a gaming experience that combines entertainment with the thrill of earning crypto.

Special Agent David Paniwozik of the FBI’s Baltimore branch noted the growing trend, saying: “Criminals see cryptocurrencies as a quick and easy way to make money. Unfortunately, many investors are still unfamiliar with the technology, making them prime targets.” One of the key challenges, Paniwozik said, is the seamless and borderless nature of cryptocurrency transactions. “Whether it’s $1 or billions of dollars, money can be instantly transferred from a U.S.-controlled wallet to an offshore wallet,” he explained. Scammers often set up fake cryptocurrency exchanges, convincing victims that their investments are growing rapidly or demanding crypto payments to “unlock” lucrative job offers. The FBI warns that these scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, capitalizing on the public's excitement about cryptocurrencies and their potential for high returns. Related News: Watch Out: Very Important Week Ahead - Major Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up! Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List In addition to investment scams, the FBI is seeing an increase in employment scams involving cryptocurrency. Significant losses have been reported in Maryland alone, with reported losses rising from $32,033 in 2023 to a staggering $3.8 million between January and October 2024. The average person in Maryland loses between $15,000 and $20,000 in these types of scams, Paniwozik said. According to the FBI’s 2023 Cryptocurrency Fraud Report, cryptocurrency-related complaints account for just 10% of all financial fraud reports, but nearly 50% of total monetary losses. The FBI advises potential investors and job seekers to be careful when dealing with cryptocurrency-related opportunities. Key tips include verifying the legitimacy of exchanges, being skeptical of promises of guaranteed high returns, and avoiding cryptocurrency payments for job offers. *This is not investment advice.

The adoption of stablecoin in regions like Sub-Saharan African and Latin America has skyrocketed. Ripple President Monica Long stated that stablecoin for payments is the future. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies, have exploded in popularity. They’ve even beaten out Bitcoin (BTC) in transactions across the globe. Specifically, regions like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa have embraced these fiat-pegged assets, even as BTC hit $106,000 for the first time in history. This Chainalysis blog post explains how people in emerging markets use stablecoins to hedge against local monetary instability. They provide “a more reliable means of transacting and preserving value.” Furthermore, stablecoins have made a significant impact in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa due to their practicality for low-cost remittances, secure yield options, and access to DeFi services.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Cardano faces market struggles, Rexas Finance emerges as a promising alternative with smart asset tokenization and a projected $30 valuation by 2025. Table of Contents Cardano’s market challenges What makes Rexas Finance unique? Why $30 is realistic for RXS Challenges for Cardano vs. opportunities for Rexas Finance Conclusion Cardano, often described as one of the most original blockchain projects, has been one of the key actors in the cold crypto market. However, recent market activity has stalled; the altcoin lost 15.57% from $1.3 to $0.94 in one week. As Cardano suffers a bearish wave, a new alternative, Rexas Finance (RXS), is attracting investors’ attention. With analysts forecasting this rising cryptocurrency to reach $30 by 2025, it is positioned for exponential expansion at under $0.15. Cardano’s market challenges The current price behavior of Cardano shows a change in the market’s attitude. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has declined from 79 to 53 points due to growing selling pressure, and active network addresses have dropped noticeably, indicating declining user involvement. Its Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio also supports this story by implying an increasing market value that is not matched by transaction volume, a conventional measure of overbought conditions. With an increase in short positions among traders, Cardano seems caught in a correction wave that might bring its price considerably lower, thereby challenging the $0.77 barrier. Although ADA has long-term promise, its present difficulties have caused investor attention to more exciting prospects like Rexas Finance. What makes Rexas Finance unique? With a novel approach to blockchain adoption via real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance is fast becoming a noteworthy substitute for Cardano. The platform offers a creative link between conventional banking and distributed technology by allowing consumers to tokenize tangible items such as real estate, fine art, and commodities. Rexas Finance seeks a tiny but fast-expanding sector that addresses real-world financial inefficiencies, unlike Cardano, which primarily concentrates on smart contracts and distributed apps. This emphasis on tangible asset tokenization guarantees the platform provides valuable solutions with general appeal, enabling significant adoption. Rexas Finance is in the last phases of its very successful presale, which has already raised over $26,615,783 at its price of $0.15. The presale’s reaction shows great investor faith in the project’s long-term viability. Furthermore, Rexas Finance’s tokenomics reflects its growth-oriented approach. As demand rises, RXS tokens will value much more since their total quantity of 1 billion is meant to balance scarcity and usefulness. Further appealing to early investors with a chance for significant gains is the projected listing of RXS on top-tier exchanges in 2025 at an estimated launch price of $0.20. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Why $30 is realistic for RXS Rexas Finance’s strong foundations and strategic market orientation help to explain why it projects $30 by 2025. Rexas Finance is ready to take a sizable portion of the expanding asset tokenizing industry as demand for them keeps increasing. Moreover, the platform’s creative elements: the Rexas Token Builder, the Rexas GenAi, the Rexas Treasury, and the Rexas Launchpad, allow a broad spectrum of users, from institutional players to retail investors, accessibility. This adaptability guarantees consistent acceptance, which is essential for a continuous increase in token value. The cryptocurrency market also supports newly founded initiatives like Rexas Finance. Bull runs have historically witnessed a change in capital from recognized coins to attractive substitutes with more upward potential. Rexas Finance expects to gain, especially as its low entry price and unexplored market position appeal to consumers and institutional investors, even if analysts predict a market-wide surge in 2025. Challenges for Cardano vs. opportunities for Rexas Finance Although Cardano’s difficulties could be transient, they draw attention to projects’ established challenges in maintaining development and involvement. Cardano must pay attention to the declining active addresses and growing bearish attitude to regain momentum. On the other hand, Rexas Finance offers a new chance for those looking for high-growth potential in an emerging market sector. Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a leader in the upcoming wave of blockchain innovation by focusing on actual financial inefficiencies and providing a platform fit for general adoption. Conclusion The focus is moving toward interesting substitutes like Rexas Finance as Cardano negotiates its present bearish wave.

According to the AI model’s forecast, Stellar is poised to climb approximately 20% from its current value of $0.4164 to hit $0.50 by Christmas Day. This projection emerges despite XLM’s recent dip of 3.59% over the last 24 hours, suggesting the market may be primed for a short-term recovery. “Stellar’s consistent strides in fostering real-world blockchain adoption, combined with strategic partnerships and an optimistic market sentiment, make a 20% rally plausible as 2024 concludes,” ChatGPT stated. What’s Fueling the Optimism Around Stellar (XLM)? Several factors ChatGPT’s bullish forecast, including broader market sentiment and key developments in the Stellar ecosystem. Notably, cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG Crypto has also presented an ambitious outlook for XLM, predicting its value could surge to $2–$3 soon. EGRAG’s analysis, built upon his bullish stance over the last three years, continues to spotlight XLM’s potential as a transformative digital asset. Another thing that adds momentum to Stellar’s growth trajectory is the network’s recent announcement at the Meridian 2024 event in London. The event underscored Stellar’s commitment to expanding blockchain usability through innovative solutions and partnerships. Of particular note is the collaboration between Stellar and Mastercard , as revealed in a recent tweet from Stellar’s official X account. This partnership integrates Mastercard’s Crypto Credential solution with the Stellar network. This is a move to enhance security, trust, and usability for blockchain-based transactions. By ensuring verified and authenticated interactions on public blockchain networks, Stellar positions itself as a leader in the evolving digital payments space.

The $0.50 target would mark a significant milestone for XLM, reflecting renewed investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The prediction comes amidst broader market volatility but aligns with a growing consensus among analysts that blockchain assets with strong fundamentals, like Stellar, are well-positioned for growth. ChatGPT elaborated, “XLM has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a competitive market. Its partnerships with financial giants like Mastercard and focus on real-world applications make it a strong contender for price appreciation during seasonal bullish trends.” Historically, the cryptocurrency market experiences heightened activity during the final weeks of the year, often driven by increased trading volumes and optimistic market sentiment. If XLM capitalizes on these dynamics, a 20% rally to $0.50 is well within reach. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

If you’re looking to shake up your financial game and make some bold moves, the market this weekend offers some tantalising options. With the crypto market buzzing from price surges and exciting developments, these coins have positioned themselves as the ones to watch. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just testing the waters, you’ll want to join the bandwagon before it’s too late. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a groundbreaking project that’s turning heads with its presale momentum and real-world utility. Add Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for portfolio gold. Let’s break down why these are the best coins to invest this weekend and how they could boost your financial standing. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Innovation Redefined Let’s start with the breakout star of the moment: Qubetics ($TICS) . Forget what you know about presales—Qubetics is rewriting the playbook with its innovative QubeQode IDE , a game-changing platform that simplifies and streamlines blockchain development for everyone. Imagine you’re a freelance graphic designer in Portland looking to tokenise your digital assets for passive income. With QubeQode, all that’s as easy as pie. You don’t need a PhD in blockchain; this platform makes it as simple as dragging and dropping. Qubetics isn’t just about promises; it’s delivering results. The presale is in its 12th stage, with over 334 million tokens sold to 9,700 holders, raising a whopping $6.4 million. The current price of $TICS is $0.0311, but here’s the kicker—come the weekend, the price will spike by 10%. Don’t sleep on this one, because analysts are calling for insane ROI figures: 703% by presale end, 3,112% post-presale, and a jaw-dropping 48,092% after the mainnet launch. Yeah, you read that right—48,092%. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s not just about hype. Qubetics solves real-world problems that traditional blockchains never could, all while delivering mind-blowing growth potential. Plus, the FOMO is real—missing out on $TICS now could be the financial regret of the decade. 2. Cardano (ADA): The Scalablity and Sustainability Champion Next up, we’ve got Cardano (ADA) , the OG of sustainability and scalability. Cardano has always been the cool, calculated sibling in the crypto family, focusing on getting the fundamentals right before chasing flashy trends. Its recent developments are proof that patience pays off. Just last week, the network rolled out a hydra-head scaling upgrade , making transactions faster and cheaper. If you’ve been annoyed by Ethereum’s gas fees, Cardano might just be your saving grace. Cardano’s versatility is what makes it stand out. Picture a startup in Austin looking to launch a decentralised app or a social enterprise in Denver aiming to bring blockchain to underserved communities—Cardano provides the tools, the network, and the reliability. No wonder it’s gaining traction with developers and big-name partnerships alike. Analysts predict ADA could hit $1.50 by Q1 2025 , driven by its steady adoption and robust ecosystem. Trading at just $0.29 right now, this weekend is a prime time to snag ADA before it makes its next move upward. Remember, in the crypto world, slow and steady often wins the race. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano combines solid tech with tangible use cases, making it one of the best coins to invest this weekend . Plus, its steady climb means you can invest without losing sleep over wild volatility. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Your Trusted Powerhouse Rounding out our list is Binance Coin (BNB) —the powerhouse that’s as reliable as your grandma’s apple pie recipe. As the native coin of Binance, the largest crypto exchange on the planet, BNB is a cornerstone of the digital finance world. But don’t think for a second that BNB’s story is boring—it’s been making waves with recent updates. Binance is expanding its ecosystem with BNB Greenfield , a decentralised storage network that’s set to rival Amazon AWS and Google Cloud. Imagine a world where your data isn’t controlled by tech giants but is instead secure, private, and decentralised. That’s where BNB is headed. For crypto investors, this means more utility and higher demand, translating into price growth. Currently trading at $232 , BNB has held its ground during market downturns and is primed for a rally as market sentiment improves. Analysts are bullish, forecasting BNB to hit $450 by mid-2025 . Its deflationary mechanism (regular coin burns) ensures a steady increase in value over time. BNB is the Swiss Army knife of cryptocurrencies—practical, dependable, and always in demand. If you’re serious about boosting your portfolio this weekend, this one’s a no-brainer. Conclusion: Time to Make Your Move There you have it—three powerhouses poised to supercharge your portfolio this weekend. Whether it’s the mind-blowing ROI potential of Qubetics ($TICS), the steady growth of Cardano (ADA), or the multifaceted strength of Binance Coin (BNB), these coins are your ticket to financial gains. The crypto market waits for no one, and neither should you. Don’t let this weekend pass you by while others are cashing in. Qubetics’ presale is closing fast, and with analysts calling for explosive growth, this could be your shot at life-changing profits. Head over to the presale page, secure your $TICS tokens, and set your portfolio on fire. So, what are you waiting for? The best coins to invest this weekend won’t stick around forever. Dive in and start building your financial future today.

Between December 10 and 12, Riot bought roughly $510 million in Bitcoin, bringing the total value of its BTC holdings to nearly $1.7 billion. Leading bitcoin mining company Riot Platform recently raised $525 million to fund a significant addition to its BTC holdings, which now totals nearly $1.7 billion. The purchase comes just days after activist investor Starboard Value announced it had taken a significant stake in the bitcoin-mining company. Starboard Value Takes “Significant Position” in Riot Platforms Riot Platforms, a leading bitcoin mining company, has purchased an additional $510 million in Bitcoin to add to its holdings. Riot Platform announced that with the proceeds from a recent fundraising that netted the company $525 million, $510 million would be used to purchase 5,117 BTC at an average rate of $99,669 per BTC. The purchase brings Riot’s total holdings to 16,728 BTC. With the net proceeds from Riot’s recent $525 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 5,117 BTC at an average price of $99,669 per BTC, inclusive of fees and expenses.

(@RiotPlatforms) December 13, 2024 The purchase comes after activist investor Starboard Value took a “significant position” in the company. According to the Wall Street Journal , no financial details were disclosed, but the news of Starboard’s stake boosted Riot’s shares significantly. The WSJ reported that Starboard urged Riot Platforms to repurpose some of its Bitcoin mining capacity to service artificial intelligence models, and Riot’s purchase may have been due to pressure from Starboard as buying BTC has shown itself to be a way for miners to win over their investors. Riot reportedly told the WSJ: “We are committed to creating value for all shareholders, and we look forward to constructive dialogue with Starboard on ways to achieve this shared goal.” Shifting Focus to Artificial Intelligence The burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) market has progressed and become more integrated into most business and technology aspects. As the sector continues to expand, the demand for computational power from AI is rising, and the Bitcoin mining industry is well-equipped to service this need. To service their own enterprise, Bitcoin and crypto miners are equipped with expansive data centres and captive power supplies, making them the ideal candidates for AI involvement. According to the reports from the WSJ, Starboard Value wants Riot to convert some of its bitcoin-mining facilities into space for big data centre users. According to a report from asset fund manager VanEck, Riot could gain an estimated $4.8 billion in market capitalization by pivoting to AI businesses, which would more than double the company’s current market cap. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, explained the logic behind pivoting to AI, “The synergy is simple: AI companies need energy, and Bitcoin miners have it.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bithumb also announced that it has listed a memecoin called MOODENG on the KRW pair, in addition to MOCA. Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, commented on the support of South Korean exchanges to Mocaverse and MOCA, saying, “Thank you Upbit and Bithumb. You brought mass adoption to web3 by welcoming South Korea to Moca Network.” While the price of MOCA rose rapidly after the listing announcements, this rise did not continue at the same pace.

The ASU’s amendments improved the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring entities to measure them at fair value and recognize fair value changes in net income each reporting period. Richard Jones, the FASB Chair, said the new standard responded to feedback from stakeholders of all backgrounds who indicated that the Board should prioritize improving crypto assets’ accounting and disclosure. The amendments also required entities to improve the information provided to investors about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes between reporting periods. FASB enhances corporate Bitcoin accounting rules HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE 🙌 pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 FASB’s fair value accounting standard, which will be officially implemented starting today, allows companies like MicroStrategy to use fair value measurement methods to more accurately reflect the real value of Bitcoin assets. Previously, companies had to use the impairment loss accounting method, which reflected the falling value of Bitcoin as a loss in their accounting books. It was also difficult to reflect the actual increase in Bitcoin’s market value in accounting. Applying fair value accounting standards would allow Bitcoin’s market value fluctuations to be reflected in real time. The regulatory shift improved investor confidence and aligned Bitcoin valuation with market conditions. Many analysts expected this clarity to further increase institutional interest in Bitcoin. “It will provide investors and other capital allocators with more relevant information that better reflects the underlying economics of certain crypto assets and an entity’s financial position while reducing cost and complexity associated with applying current accounting.” ~ Richard Jones Early adoption of the ASU amendments would also be permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that still need to be issued. The ASU’s amendments will apply to all assets that meet the definition of intangible assets under the FASB accounting standard codification. Bitcoin to gain appeal as treasury reserve asset According to the FASB, the fair value rule marked a critical point for the role of digital assets like Bitcoin in corporate finance. Under the new standard, companies would be able to hold Bitcoin without concerns over impairment-driven reporting issues. MicroStrategy’s founder and Chair, Michael Saylor, said that upgrading accounting standards would facilitate corporations adoption of BTC worldwide, as a treasury reserve asset. He expected MARA to be the next Bitcoin company to be added to the Nasdaq 100. Saylor identified the FASB fair value rule as one of the three factors pushing Bitcoin’s price towards $1 million. He also emphasized that traditional bank custody would drive Bitcoin’s bullish trend. The MicroStrategy Chair added that bank custody services increased mainstream confidence and Bitcoin adoption by providing secure investment channels. While the new guidance applied to assets that met the scope criteria under ASC 350-60, not all assets would meet these criteria. Deloitte reported that wrapped tokens such as WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) would not be included in the scope of the new rule since such tokens provided their holders with the right or claim to the underlying wrapped crypto assets. Entities would need to use ‘judgment’ in accounting for wrapped tokens even if the underlying token was within the scope of the amendments.

Notably, this comes as the Ethereum price flirted near the $4,000 mark, with a surge of nearly 2% in its last 24-hour value. Besides, it also comes just after Sun has made a significant ETH selloff recently, which has sparked concerns among investors over its potential impact on the asset’s price ahead. Tron Founder Justin Sun Plans To Bag 53K ETH Tron Founder Justin Sun plans to acquire nearly 53,000 ETH, sparking discussions in the market. Notably, this move came just after Sun dumped a massive amount of the crypto recently, which has fueled speculations over its potential impact on Ethereum price. Notably, top on-chain analytics and transaction tracking platform, Spot On Chain has reported the recent development. According to the report, Sun has recently applied to withdraw 52,905 ETH, worth around $209 million, from Lido. Notably, the report also noted that this move is part of his accumulation of 392,474 Ether, which he “allegedly bought” at around $1.19 billion through three wallets between February and August. Meanwhile, his current ETH holdings showed that he has an estimated profit of around $349 million, indicating a 29% RoI. Notably, Sun has dumped 29,920 Ethereum, worth around $119.7 million, to HTX exchange last week, after the crypto’s price has touched $4k. Will It Impact Ethereum Price? The latest ETH price noted a surge of over 2% in the last 24 hours and traded at $3,961, while its one-day trading volume soared 11% to $30.5 billion. The crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $4,020 while noting a monthly gain of 27%. On the other hand, CoinGlass data showed that ETH Futures Open Interest soared nearly 5%, suggesting strong market confidence towards the asset. However, the recent move by Justin Sun has fueled speculations over his next move with his ETH holdings. Precisely, a flurry of market experts are discussing if Sun would continue his Ether selling spree, which might impact Ethereum price ahead. Meanwhile, despite the concerns, other Ether market trends appear to be optimistic. For context, popular crypto market expert Ali Martinez has recently said that ETH whales are on a buying spree since the crypto has soared past the $3,300 mark. Besides, a recent analysis showed that ETH price could target the brief $15K mark next, which has further fueled market sentiments.

In a new interview with Bitcoin firebrand Robert Breedlove, Gromen says the country is facing a national security crisis after Russia crushed US and NATO forces in Ukraine. Gromen believes that the defeat has changed the rules of the game, forcing the Department of Defense and the national security apparatus to abandon the fiat currency system. According to the macro guru, the US dollar system drove the country to shutter its factories, crippling America’s ability to manufacture armaments for national defense. But Gromen says the national defense and intelligence establishment now sees an opportunity to revitalize its industries by debasing the dollar and using Bitcoin to back the Treasury market. “The game theory has changed around this: for national political stability, for bringing back the middle and working class for defense base re-establishment. All of these things are pointing to a neutral reserve asset… Bitcoin has gone from an eye-roll laugh in this sentence a year ago… but I don’t think there should be. Treasury [Department] is talking about how to use stablecoins to create a balance sheet basically for T-bills to finance deficits. Paul Ryan, former speaker of the House [and] VP candidate, [wrote an] op-ed about how stablecoins could be used to create demand for T-bills. Trump saying Bitcoin is the new oil, reportedly, [and] the strategic [Bitcoin] reserve.” Gromen says the statements of politicians and the Treasury Department tell him that the US is gearing up to massively boost the market cap of Bitcoin, similar to what happened to oil in 1973 when it surged 400%. “What that oil price did by moving up that way was it effectively made oil big enough to back the dollar, to back the US deficits.” According to Gromen, elevating Bitcoin as a neutral reserve asset will allow the US to finance the re-establishment of its industries for national defense without making Americans poor. “The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee report has a chart: here’s the market cap of crypto, here’s the market cap of stablecoins, here’s how many T-bills stablecoins have bought, and it’s linear. That’s how they’re looking at it… When you think about it that way in the context of political stability issues that you need to address, the national defense issues you need to address, the game theory is turned on its head… Bitcoin isn’t a threat that is rising. It needs to go up faster so that we have more balance sheet capacity and so that our people, as we reinflate to re-shore all of this stuff because it is going to be inflationary, that’s not a bad thing to compensate your people to keep them whole on a real basis while that happens.” Source: Treasury Department At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,063.

Token launches are not inexpensive. With costs ranging from $40,000 to $200,000 , a well-executed exchange listing is not just desirable but essential. As major exchanges continue to refine their requirements and regulations in 2024, navigating these complexities has become increasingly challenging.

Saylor’s proposal, outlined at a recent meeting, is based on the idea that Bitcoin has emerged as the ultimate global reserve capital network. “Bitcoin is better than real estate, better than stocks,” Saylor said, adding that no corporate or real estate asset can rival Bitcoin as a long-term investment. He suggested that the U.S. could catalyze Bitcoin’s growth by purchasing 20-25% of the network on behalf of the government. Saylor has viewed Bitcoin as a transformative financial instrument that could strengthen the U.S. economy while diminishing the value of rival countries’ gold reserves. He argued that by selling all of its gold holdings and buying Bitcoin, the U.S. could cash in on Bitcoin’s growth while weakening the finances of countries with significant gold reserves, such as China and Russia. Related News: Watch Out: Very Important Week Ahead - Major Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up! Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List “Dump your gold,” Saylor urged, adding: “Sell all US gold, buy Bitcoin. This transaction is essentially free because you can buy 5 million Bitcoin for the price of gold.” Saylor also noted the broader implications of such a move, suggesting that demonetizing gold could reduce its value to near zero, which could significantly impact countries that rely on gold reserves, while Bitcoin’s value could skyrocket. “Our assets will reach $100 trillion, and we will control the world’s reserve currency network as well as the world’s reserve capital network,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Today’s BTC surge came following MicroStrategy’s addition to Nasdaq 100 index and bullish momentum amid Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve developments. Legendary trader Peter Brandt predicted Bitcoin could surge past $120K by the year-end. This Bitcoin price target looks reachable amid the Trump pro-crypto statements. Trump Rally For Bitcoin Price to Extend Further? With Donald Trump set to take charge of the White House next month, analysts are hopeful of a crypto-friendly regulatory landscape. Furthermore, the US is likely to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration. Last week while speaking at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Donald Trump announced plans for crypto without revealing much details about it. Last week, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy attained a significant milestone by joining the Nasdaq 100 Index. Over the last four years, business intelligence software firm MicroStrategy has transformed into a leveraged Bitcoin investment vehicle by raising billions of dollars through its MSTR stock sale and buying more Bitcoins from it. Speaking on the development, Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets said: “Now that MicroStrategy is in Nasdaq, index funds may buy its shares, and that will help the company to raise more equity to buy more Bitcoin”. On Sunday, Michael Saylor hinted that his company’s Bitcoin buying spree could continue even at new all-time highs. As per the Saylor Tracker data , MicroStrategy holds 423,650 BTC on its balance sheet worth $44.58 billion as of the current Bitcoin price.

Investors are looking forward to a sixth such announcement from MicroStrategy on December 16. Popular economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Brandt said: “Bitcoin is at a new all-time high again tonight. Most likely, we will find out tomorrow that Michael Saylor was the buyer. That seems to be the trend, as it’s happened the last five Mondays in a row”. Bitcoin extended its rally through Sunday, achieving a seven-week winning streak—its longest since 2021. The move was triggered by anticipation of having Bitcoin strategic reserve in January. Analysts Predict $120K Price Target for BTC Legendary trader Peter Brandt shared a chart showing a Bitcoin price breakout above the $101,435 level and suggesting that the next Bitcoin all-time high could be above $120K. The time frame that he expects for this milestone is between Christmas and New Year 2025.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez observed a sharp increase in the number of Bitcoin whales on the network following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential elections.

Moreover, traders must keep an eye on rate cut decisions by the Bank of Japan and Bank of England. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 6.2% up at $105,193.04 with its market cap surging past $2.08 trillion. Furthermore, the daily trading volume has also surged 64% to $63.2 billion.

While the market occasionally retests the high, the overall crypto market boom has lifted the price of SHIB past various technical resistance regions. Analysts predict Shiba Inu could reach a new all-time high as market enthusiasm grows, setting the stage for further gains before year-end. Can Shiba Inu Price Hit ATH This December? The Crypto expert tweeted that SHIB is currently facing a crucial price zone between 0.000027 and 0.000030. According to the analysis, this level holds the key to the asset’s next big move. According to the analyst, if SHIB is able to overcome this level of resistance it is set to soar towards the earlier high of its price. It appears that a bull formation is developing, which may lead to a penetration of the upper border in the nearest future. The expert pointed out that buyers have to break through the 0.000030 barrier for the momentum to pick up. If this happens, there will be a price jump that will attract investors in the market. With positive market sentiment, a breakout could trigger the anticipated upward move, paving the way for significant gains rally to $0.00008845 ATH seen in back 2021 bullish run. Source: X The BTC price touched an ATH of $106k, rallying for seven consecutive weeks, making it the highest weekly gain since 2021. This surge in crypto market may fuel the bullish optimism to hit new ATH in SHIB price and other top altcoins. Addition surge in other top meme coins including the DOGE, PEPE, WIF and among others mights fuel the surge in SHIB price. SHIB Price Analysis: Can Shiba Touch $0.00004 This Week? As of Monday, December 16, the latest SHIB price hovered at $0.00002747, marking a slight surge over the past 24 hours during the U.S. time zone. SHIB witnessed a 0.67% increase, reflecting mild upward momentum for the day. The price experienced fluctuations, reaching a low of $0.00002687 and a high of $0.00002826 within the last 24 hours. The MACD indicators is showing weakening momentum. The MACD line has crossed below the signal line, signaling a possible bearish reversal. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) shows declining green bars, which suggests diminishing bullish strength. Shiba Inu price chart: TradingView If the bullish momentum continues, the Shiba Inu price prediction could break the $0.00003 resistance level soon. A decisive push above this mark might trigger a rally toward $0.000035. A further move could see the price target at $0.00004, indicating a 41% gain by the end of this week. On the downside, if bears regain control, SHIB risks slipping below $0.000027. A decline to this level could weaken the current bullish setup and invite further losses. Breaking this support might send the price to retest $0.000025 or lower, reversing recent gains. The Shiba Inu price is at a critical resistance zone. A breakout above $0.000030 could lead to significant gains, potentially reaching its ATH if market conditions remain favorable.

According to blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain, Sun amassed 392,474 ETH across three wallets for an estimated $1.19 billion. At press time, his net profit from these transactions stands at $349 million, reflecting a 29% gain.

In October 2023, Sun unpledged 80,251 ETH (worth $131 million at the time) from Lido and transferred it to Binance within four days. Following this transaction, Ethereum’s price dropped by 5% mid-month. This recent withdrawal has reignited similar fears, with some analysts anticipating short-term price pressure on Ethereum as markets keep an eye on Sun’s actions. Ethereum lags behind Bitcoin in 2024 gains Ethereum has experienced a 71.5% uptick since the beginning of the year. However, it has underperformed compared to Bitcoin’s, which posted an impressive 142% gain over the same period. While Ethereum’s performance is commendable, its growth trajectory has not mirrored Bitcoin’s meteoric rise to new highs, leaving some investors questioning whether ETH can even achieve a new all-time high level. Per Chinese reporter Colin Wu, Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) increased by $2.22 billion in the past week, slightly trailing Bitcoin’s $3.09 billion increase. Between December 9 and December 13, Ethereum spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net inflow of $855 million, marking a record high for weekly inflows.

Analysts believe that increased ETF inflows could bolster Ethereum’s price stability, even amid short-term market fluctuations. Technical indicators point to a potential breakout Meanwhile, ETH’s technical chart patterns are providing reasons for investors to be bullish. According to several analysts on X, ETH charts are showcasing similar patterns to when it last hit an ATH in 2022, with the recent appearance of a “Golden Cross” on Ethereum’s weekly chart, a technical indicator signaling potential upward momentum. 🚨 Ethereum Golden Cross!!

The EMA50 trend line, which has been reinforcing Ethereum’s price from below, further supports the optimistic outlook. Analysts believe that breaking through the $3,845 resistance level could pave the way for a move towards $4,000 and beyond. Source: X However, a dip below this level might trigger a short-term correction, with potential downside targets around $3,680 before another rally attempt. Long-term price projections for Ethereum Ethereum’s long-term potential continues to attract speculative forecasts. Bybit and Block Scholes, for instance, have projected a price goal of $8,800 by the first quarter of 2025. These predictions are supported by ETH’s solid performance in the derivatives market and its rising triangle chart formation, which suggests sustained upward momentum. Even more optimistic is the forecast from Titan of Crypto, who told FX Business that ETH could climb above $5,000 by 2025. These projections largely hinge on historical technical patterns and the increasing institutional adoption of Ethereum.

Sharing an image of a detailed technical analysis chart, Amelie suggested that XRP might be on the brink of a massive breakout. Her prediction emphasized that if historical trends repeat themselves, XRP could achieve a new all-time high in the coming days or weeks. The chart accompanying Amelie’s tweet showcases XRP’s price movements on a multi-year scale. The analysis draws parallels between the current price structure and the period preceding XRP’s previous significant breakout in 2017. During that time, XRP experienced a massive rally that took its price to an all-time high of $3.317. Amelie’s analysis suggests that XRP is again positioned in a similar “breakout zone,” based on a symmetrical triangle chart pattern—a bullish indicator often seen before substantial upward movements. WOW! IF HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF, WE COULD BE ON THE VERGE OF A MASSIVE BREAKOUT FOR #XRP – A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH COULD BE REACHED IN A FEW DAYS/WEEKS! GET READY FOR EVERYTHING! pic.twitter.com/CuUrARaBUt — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) December 15, 2024 Historical Context and Technical Setup The chart shared in Amelie’s tweet identifies two primary moments of price consolidation and breakout in XRP’s history. The first occurred between 2014 and 2017 when XRP’s price hovered in a tight range before experiencing exponential growth. Notably, a similar symmetrical triangle pattern was observed, signaling a period of accumulation before a breakout to $3.317. In the present setup, spanning the last six years, XRP has again moved within a consolidating triangle pattern. The breakout point, marked clearly in the analysis, signals a potential beginning of another bullish phase. The upward movement indicated in the chart reflects a speculative future target as high as $99, representing extreme optimism among XRP supporters. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Market Sentiment Amelie’s tweet quickly garnered attention, with users expressing support and skepticism. In response, another X user, Sydney, argued that XRP’s recent developments extend beyond historical trends. Sydney pointed to XRP’s recent legal victories, particularly its high-profile case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This outcome boosted investor confidence and set a critical precedent for the broader cryptocurrency industry, clarifying XRP’s regulatory standing as not being a security. Additionally, Sydney mentioned Ripple’s ongoing success with its stablecoin (RLUSD) which could further strengthen XRP’s utility and demand. This view highlights a divergence in opinion within the crypto community where technical analysts focus on chart patterns and historical trends, while others emphasize XRP’s evolving fundamentals and real-world adoption. These factors have created a bullish narrative for XRP as it heads to 2025. Amelie’s tweet and accompanying analysis underscore the strong potential for XRP to achieve significant price appreciation if historical patterns play out. While chart patterns suggest an impending breakout, it is essential to consider the broader market environment and XRP’s ongoing adoption, particularly in cross-border payments and stablecoin infrastructure.

As the world’s leading cryptocurrency gained almost 200% this year, there was a key contributing factor to this price surge. The latest data suggest a notable increase in whale wallet activity that has pushed it to a new milestone. Bitcoin’s Record Finds Support From Whales Since the bull rally began on October 10th, the number of addresses holding at least 100 BTC has climbed from 16,062 to 17,644 – a net gain of 1,582 wallets, reflecting a substantial 9.9% increase in just nine weeks. According to Santiment analysis on Monday, this surge in whale accumulation has coincided with a 77% jump in Bitcoin’s price, highlighting the strong correlation between growing investor confidence among large holders and the asset’s upward momentum. The latest BTC rally followed comments from President-elect Donald Trump indicating his intention to form a US Bitcoin strategic reserve similar to the country’s oil stockpile. The announcement ignited excitement among cryptocurrency bulls, fueling the record-breaking rally. Many industry watchers suggest Bitcoin has entered “Santa Claus mode,” with a surge in buying as investors fear missing out and aim to allocate more funds to the asset class. Bitcoin’s Santa Claus Rally Since the November 5 election, where Trump and numerous pro-crypto candidates won, Bitcoin has gained more than 50%. Historically, December is viewed as a bullish month for the asset, but the “Santa Claus Rally”—defined as gains during the last five trading days of the year and the first two of January—has shown mixed performance in the crypto market. Between 2014 and 2023, Bitcoin rallied seven times before Christmas and five times afterward, recording returns of 0.20% to 13.19% pre-Christmas and 0.33% to 10.86% post-Christmas. Yet, the pattern remains inconsistent; for instance, in 2017, Bitcoin plunged 21.30% pre-Christmas during the post-ICO market correction. Still, December as a whole has averaged returns of 9.48%, as per CoinGecko’s findings .

The largest cryptocurrency has demonstrated a 5.37% and 15.19% in weekly and monthly gains, respectively, dominating the market with 56.13% with a market cap of $2.07 trillion. Although Bitcoin’s performance is remarkable, a specific collection of Ethereum tokens is creating even greater upheaval, achieving over 120% gains in merely a month. Ethereum Tokens Outperforming Bitcoin’s ATH with Over 120% Gains Let’s explore the leading Ethereum tokens that are surpassing Bitcoin: Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), Minotaurus (MTAUR), Ethereum Name Service (ENS), Ondo (ONDO), and Bitget Token (BGB). 1. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL): Ethereum Token as A Metaverse and AI Pioneer Virtuals Protocol is leading the charge in the metaverse and AI integration space. It recently hit an ATH of $2.79, after recording nearly 381% in monthly gains, achieving a market cap of $2.78 billion. VIRTUAL’s price began soaring after an announcement of its listing on Binance and significant whale interest. The protocol leverages AI and Big Data to create immersive digital experiences while enabling innovative generative AI applications. With its robust real-world utility and expanding market presence, VIRTUAL remains a key player for investors seeking transformative projects. 2. Minotaurus (MTAUR): Gaming Ecosystem Powerhouse The Minotaurus (MTAUR) presale is making waves with its compelling blend of affordability, utility, and security. Tokens are attractively priced at 0.00006001 USDT during the presale—a 70% reduction from the anticipated listing price of 0.00020 USDT, following an even lower initial price of 0.000040 USDT, demonstrating growth of over 200%. As the backbone of the Minotaurus gaming ecosystem, MTAUR unlocks access to exclusive in-game features, enhancing its utility. The project also fosters community engagement through a referral system and strategic vesting periods, promoting long-term growth. Security is paramount, with audits by SolidProof and Coinsult boosting market confidence. Positioned within the booming casual gaming industry, projected to reach a $15 billion valuation, Minotaurus is poised to meet increasing market demand. Early adopters not only join a dynamic community but also gain access to promising early-stage cryptocurrencies . 3. Ethereum Name Service (ENS): Simplifying Web3 Identity Ethereum Name Service soared in value over the past day by nearly 10%, after earning investors profits of nearly 179%, in the past month. ENS aims to revolutionize Web3 identity by decentralizing the Domain Name Service (DNS). Its recent collaboration with Ubisoft highlights its growing adoption in the gaming sector. ENS simplifies blockchain usability by replacing complex wallet addresses with human-readable names. With innovations like the Niji Warrior ID Card, the Ethereum ERC-20 token is securing its position as a vital infrastructure for Web3, attracting both gamers and blockchain enthusiasts. 4. Ondo (ONDO): Ethereum Tokens Bridging Real-World Assets and DeFi Ondo Finance is redefining decentralized finance (DeFi) by tokenizing real-world assets such as U.S. Treasuries. Recently, Ondo’s partnership with Wellington Management and its integration into BounceBit’s CeDeFi platform have enhanced its market visibility. The ONDO token supports institutional-grade yield opportunities, providing both security and liquidity. The price of the Ethereum token increased by nearly 129.53% over the past month, and became one of top gainers in the past day, hitting an all-time high of $2.14. With over $600 million in total value locked (TVL), Ondo is gaining traction as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance. 5. Bitget Token (BGB): Empowering Crypto Traders Bitget Token has also outperformed Bitcoin by recording monthly gains by nearly 131.89%, after achieving an all-time high of $3.50 just recently, on Dec 12, 2024. Bitget Token, the backbone of the Bitget ecosystem, offers discounted trading fees, staking rewards, and early access to exclusive projects. With a market cap of $4.51 billion, BGB has shown consistent growth. Its integration with Bitget’s flagship Copy Trade feature and its ability to handle high transaction volumes make it a favorite among active traders. Final Thoughts: Ethereum Tokens Outpace Bitcoin While Bitcoin Price ATH of $106,488.25 signals a bullish market, the Ethereum ecosystem is demonstrating greater dynamism. These five tokens showcase the diversity and innovation within the Ethereum network, from gaming and metaverse integrations to decentralized identity and real-world asset tokenization. Investors seeking outsized returns are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin, recognizing the potential of Ethereum-based tokens like VIRTUAL, ENS, and ONDO. With these tokens delivering gains over 120%, they remain a compelling choice for those seeking the next big opportunity in crypto.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 09:20:00

ONDO price surged by almost 20% following the purchase news, hitting a new all-time high of $2.14, before slightly pulling back to around $2.09 at press time. Source: CoinGecko World Liberty Financial adds 134,216 ONDO tokens to its portfolio The transaction, which took place on December 16th at 6:51 UTC+8, was facilitated through the Cow Protocol, according to on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence . The acquisition marks a notable expansion for World Liberty Financial, which has been actively acquiring digital assets in recent weeks. The purchase comes amid a broader strategy to bolster the platform’s crypto portfolio, which now stands at $83.98 million. The platform’s recent purchases include Ether, Aave, and Chainlink, adding significant digital assets to its portfolio. On December 12th, World Liberty Financial purchased 2,631 ETH for $10 million, 41,335 LINK for $1 million, and 3,357 AAVE for $1 million. According to Arkham, World Liberty Financial’s portfolio currently includes a significant holding in Ether valued at $58.51 million, alongside smaller amounts of CBBTC, USDC, and USDT stablecoins. The DeFi platform also owns tokens like LINK, valued at $2.27 million, and AAVE, valued at $2.30 million, and ENA tokens worth $627.25K. Source: Arkham The purchase of ONDO by World Liberty Financial is part of a larger trend of increased investment in digital assets by prominent figures in the crypto space. Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, recently invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial by purchasing its native token, WLFI. Sun’s investment came after the platform struggled to meet its presale goals, indicating confidence in the project’s potential. The Trump-linked crypto venture has been making waves since its launch in September, particularly following the involvement of major investors like Sun. The presale of WLFI tokens is still ongoing, with the Trump family aiming to sell 20 billion tokens. The sale has already seen 4.97 billion tokens sold at $0.015, with the remaining 15 billion still available. The DeFi platform’s strategy seems to be focused on attracting a wide range of investors, including accredited US investors who were offered the opportunity to participate in the presale starting October 15th. As World Liberty Financial expands its footprint in the DeFi space and continues to make strategic investments in digital assets, the market will be watching closely to see how ONDO and other tokens in its portfolio perform in the coming weeks and months.

The market trend flipped heavily with a major change in the leadership set to happen. Donald Trump won the election and was chosen to be the next president of the U.S., which triggered bullish waves across the market. This led the rally close to $100K in the first attempt and later rached the current highs, maintaining an ascending consolidation. In a recent update, Trump reportedly confirmed Bitcoin reserve plans that have increased the trading volume, which was slowly draining after reaching the highs close to $150 billion. Meanwhile, the participation of the bears remains within restricted levels, suggesting they could be waiting for the start token to reach certain highs. Although the price rose above $106K, no major liquidation was recorded that validates the above claim. Now the question arises: whether the BTC price will continue to surge beyond $107K? If yes, where are the trigger points for the bears? Above the chart is the Bitcoin liquidation heatmap, which shows the potential range where the shorts or the longs have been accumulated. The price is trading just above the interim support zone between $103,726 and $104,300, where nearly $250 million worth of shorts have been accumulated collectively. Although breaking these levels may certainly not drag the levels below $100K as a strong base of longs has been formed at $102K of an accumulated $190 million. Hence, these levels are expected to halt the bearish trend if bearish activity intensifies and also trigger a strong rebound. What’s next? How high can the Bitcoin price go if the bulls trigger a rebound from here? The above chart shows the potential leverage trades placed on multiple ranges, and the latest pullback from highs appears to be a result of the 100x & 50x being placed around those levels. Meanwhile, the long liquidations have started to accumulate at $106.8K & $107.2K. However, the $107.5K range is more attractive with close to $500 million cumulative short liquidation leverage with a ratio of 25%, 50%, and 100%. Therefore, this range currently appears to be tiny, but if the BTC price proceeds higher, the accumulation around this range may intensify. Therefore, the levels around $107.5K may be considered the next highs for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally that could be achieved before the 2024 end.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 09:23:10

Informal crypto businesses thrive in conflict zones, strengthening digital currency use. Syria’s geopolitical ties with Iran and Russia may drive future crypto adoption. Syria’s political landscape has shifted dramatically with the collapse of the Assad regime , which ruled the country for over 50 years. As the conflict enters a new phase, cryptocurrency has emerged as a key tool for militants, sparking debates about its role in Syria’s economy. While crypto adoption remains limited in Syria, the ongoing conflict has led to increased use of digital currencies. Opposition faction HTS has actively used crypto for fundraising.

That's not necessarily the case. On Friday, more than 13,000 contracts of the $30 out-of-the-money (OTM) put option expiring May 16 changed hands as the ETF rose 1.7% to $57.91, according to data from Amberdata. Volume in the $35 put option expiring Jan. 16, 2026, topped 10,000 contracts. Most of the activity probably stems from market participants looking to generate passive income through ""cash-secured put selling"" rather than outright purchase of the options as bearish bets, according to Greg Magadini, Amberdata's director of derivatives. A put seller, offering insurance against price drops in return for a premium, is obligated to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific expiration date. (That's opposed to the buyer of the put, who has the right but not the obligation to sell the asset.) That means savvy traders often write OTM puts to acquire the underlying asset at a lower price while pocketing the premium received by selling the put option. They do so by continuously maintaining the cash required to purchase the asset if the owner of the put option exercises their right to sell the asset. Hence, the strategy is called ""cash-secured"" selling of puts. In IBIT's case, sellers of the $35 put expiring in January 2026 will keep the premium if IBIT stays above that level until expiry. If IBIT drops below $35, the put sellers must buy the ETF at that price while keeping the premium received. The sellers of the $30 put expiring in May next year face a similar payoff scenario. ""The $35 Puts for Jan 2026 traded +10k contract with an IV range of 73.52% to 69.94%, VWAP at 70.75% suggests net selling from the street… potentially Cash Secured put selling flows (for traders who missed the rally),"" Magadini said in a note shared with CoinDesk. Saxo Bank's analyst suggested cash-secured put selling as the preferred strategy in Nvidia early this year. Calls are pricier than puts Overall, IBIT call options, which offer an asymmetric upside to buyers, continue to trade pricer than puts. As of Friday, call-put skews, with maturities ranging from five to 126 days, were positive, signaling relative richness of implied volatility for calls. The bullish sentiment is consistent with the pricing in options tied to bitcoin and trading on Deribit. On Friday, IBIT recorded a net inflow of $393 million, representing the majority of the total inflow of $428.9 million across the 11 spot ETFs listed in the U.S, according to data tracked by Farside Investors .",Markets|Bitcoin|Blackrock|Bitcoin ETF|Markets|Options,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-16 09:31:12

The rally reflects growing institutional interest, expanding adoption, and favorable market conditions that continue to drive momentum. Crypto analyst Rachael Lucas from BTC Markets noted that this record high signifies a turning point for Bitcoin. “This achievement highlights Bitcoin’s shift from being a retail-dominated asset to one increasingly shaped by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate adoption,” Lucas explained. This evolution is solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a mainstream financial asset. Key events have contributed to Bitcoin’s latest surge. US President-elect Donald Trump recently announced plans to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, sparking optimism in the market. His pledge to “do something great” with crypto has bolstered confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Additionally, MicroStrategy , one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, has added to the excitement. On December 23, the company announced its inclusion in the Nasdaq 100 index, a significant milestone for both the firm and Bitcoin. Co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at further Bitcoin acquisitions, amplifying investor enthusiasm. MicroStrategy’s reserves, valued at billions, continue to underscore institutional support for Bitcoin. Another major factor is Riot Platforms, a leading Bitcoin mining company, which recently revealed its purchase of thousands of Bitcoins. This move not only strengthens its position in the market but also reflects growing confidence in Bitcoin’s price trajectory. These high-profile actions have fueled positive sentiment, further driving demand. Meanwhile, macroeconomic factors also play a crucial role. The Federal Reserve’s upcoming FOMC meeting is being closely monitored by investors. Expectations of a rate cut are seen as favorable for Bitcoin, as such measures typically boost risk assets. Market participants are optimistic that these developments will continue to support Bitcoin’s growth. With Bitcoin breaking records, the market is now watching for its next move. Whether it can maintain its upward momentum or face a correction will depend on both market sentiment and broader economic conditions. Bitcoin’s latest milestone highlights its growing maturity and its increasing role in the global financial landscape.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-16 09:37:44

Recently Google announced its revolutionary “Willow” chip, which has quantum power to solve problems in a mere 5 minutes that would take classical supercomputers billions of years. These advanced machines could one day break the encryption that secures traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While crypto assets are safe for now, the risk grows as quantum technology advances. So if you think only Bitcoin can give you a safety net think again the threat of Quantum Community is giving chills to the crypto investors who are diving into the future with Quantum-resistant coins. Quantum-resistant coins use cutting-edge cryptography, like one-time digital signatures, to ensure security even against quantum computing. They act like locks that can’t be reused or easily broken, making them a safer choice for the long term. For investors Altcoin Daily has charted these coins that offer peace of mind, ensuring their holdings remain secure in the upcoming quantum computing threat. Algorand (ALGO) First up on the list is, Algorand leads the way in quantum resistance with its innovative use of Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature technology. Every 256 blocks, Algorand cryptographically signs its blockchain history, ensuring past transactions remain secure even against quantum threats. While it doesn’t yet secure future transactions, protecting the chain’s history is a crucial step in preparing for the quantum era. Cellframe (CELL) Next comes, Cellframe with a raking of 698 is a third-generation blockchain designed for quantum safety from the ground up. Its architecture supports post-quantum cryptography and features like multi-level sharding and hardware-friendly scalability. Written in pure C language, Cellframe offers unmatched performance and easy upgradeability, making it a strong contender for developers building quantum-safe applications. Currently, CELL is priced at $1.80, surging 17.27% in the last 24 hours with a trading volume of $5.6M. Hedera (HBAR) One of the popular coins, Hedera Hashgraph employs SHA-384 cryptography, a level of security that even the most powerful quantum computers are unlikely to breach. With its compliance with top-secret government standards, Hedera ensures its network remains secure as the quantum landscape evolves. Plus, its growing ecosystem, with big names like Karate Combat and Ton FM, adds to its appeal. HBAR is trading at $0.286, up 0.87% in the last 24 hours with a massive $662M trading volume. Ranked 18 it holds a market cap of $10.95B. Bitcoin (BTC) Surprisingly, Bitcoin remains a long-term safe bet despite quantum concerns. While it will require algorithmic upgrades to stay secure, its robust network and adaptability make it resilient. The only real risk lies in dormant wallets with lost keys, but active wallets can easily transition to quantum-resistant algorithms. Bitcoin (BTC) is soaring at $105,103, up 3.47% in the past 24 hours, with a whopping $63.77B trading volume. Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) Last but not least, QRL with a ranking of 601 in the crypto market is specifically designed to combat quantum threats, using XMSS (eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme) for unparalleled security. It focuses on ensuring that all aspects of the blockchain—from transaction signatures to the ledger itself—are quantum-proof. The current price of Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is $1.03, with a 24-hour trading volume of $1,014,462. The price has increased by 11.73% in the past 24 hours, showing strong momentum.

Stable Ethereum (ETH) prices and new Bitcoin (BTC) price records are already reflected in DeFi. More value is getting locked through Bitcoin and Ethereum, as their value grows at the end of the year. The effect of the bull market led to an overall recovery of DeFi in the past month. Funds are flowing into BTC staking protocols and ETH-based DeFi. Inflows were even more noticeable in liquid restaking, one of the growth sectors for the whole year. Additionally, Hyperliquid’s rise to prominence turned it into the biggest hub for value locked after BTC and ETH. Value inflows favored BTC, ETH, and the Hyperliquid DEX. | Source: Lookonchain Based on the change of total value locked, Hyperliquid accelerated its inflows. The value locked in BTC and ETH is growing as a result of the price rally, while also increasing the value of collaterals. Fund inflows into those top projects range from user deposits to DeFi and ETF buying. Fund inflows may differ for the various ecosystems, but the overall trend remains positive. The biggest outflow of funds is from TRON, while smaller inflows continue for the most active L1 and L2 chains with developed DeFi and Web3 apps. In the past week, BTC staking expanded after the Cap-3 event by Babylon Labs. The event wraps up on December 16, after drawing new non-custodial staking for 1,000 blocks. The event drew in an additional 59,983 BTC, valued at $5.38B. Those inflows will be counted in the coming weeks, reflecting the vertical expansion of TVL for Bitcoin’s network. The total value of locked BTC is now $6.92B , at prices above $104,000 per coin. Most of the value is locked with Babylon Labs, which carries $5.63B total liquidity. Hyperliquid grows TVL with new trading offers Hyperliquid is in the process of growing its decentralized futures trading platform. The DEX is adding new trading options, starting out with low leverage. Hyperliquid is also constantly expanding its open interest, drawing in inflows of stablecoins. The exchange does not carry spot markets, and only offers derivative pairs. Hyperliquid reached a new all-time high in open interest of >$4.3B. pic.twitter.com/8YUwBEEWEU — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) December 16, 2024 According to other metrics, Hyperliquid locks in $3.19B with vertical growth since its launch in December. The rise of the HYPE token and the potential for high-speed trading is boosting the positions of Hyperliquid as one of the actively growing protocols. As a result of the growth, the native HYPE token has been on an expansion track. HYPE trades at $26.50, with no drawdowns since the token generation event. HYPE holders are also not selling, unlike early Magic Eden (ME) recipients. Ethereum liquid staking and restaking boost DeFi The other source of liquidity and locked ETH are DeFi apps with requisite collaterals. Liquid staking now carries a total of $70.69B, producing $7.68M in daily fees. LidoDAO is still the leader with more than $39B in value locked. The other big source of inflows are liquid restaking protocols, which build another layer of liquidity. Over the course of 2024, liquid restaking expanded by more than 6,000%, with total value locked increasing above $17B. EtherFi is the leader, holding more than $9.37B, followed by KelpDAO. The sector started out with just $284M in January. Overall, the DeFi sector now locks in more than $140B, a level not seen since April 2022. DeFi value crashed since 2022, while protocols had to rebuild and liquidity flowed to new apps. One of the growth apps in 2022 was Aave (AAVE), which now holds upward of $22B in various assets. The creation of $196.8B worth of stablecoins is also adding to the available liquidity for pools, staking and lending.

This could affect Ethereum’s prices, says historical data. The withdrawal has been part of a larger Ethereum ( ETH ) accumulation strategy under which Sun allegedly purchased 392,474 ETH at an average price of $3,027, now showing an estimated profit of $349 million. This is not the first time that Sun has withdrawn large chunks of ETH. On Oct 4, 2023, Sun withdrew unstaked 80,253 ETH, coming around $131 million from Lido, and moved it to Binance within four days, around mid-October. Soon after, a 5% drop was observed in ETH prices. Analysts wonder if Sun will employ something similar when withdrawn assets are ‘delivered’ to exchanges for possible sell-offs. The $209 million withdrawn from Lido Finance is noteworthy because it stresses the magnitude of Lido’s importance to Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake infrastructure. As a liquid-staking protocol, Lido solves traditional staking problems, resource inaccessibility, and illiquidity by allowing users to stake ETH and remain liquid with traded stealth tokens. Justin Sun ( @justinsuntron ) applied to withdraw 52,905 $ETH (now $209M) from #LidoFinance an hour ago. This is part of the net 392,474 $ETH he allegedly bought at ~$3,027 ($1.19B) via 3 wallets from Feb-Aug, now having an est. total profit of $349M (+29%).

Big withdrawals such as Justin Sun ‘s withdrawal raise questions about staking liquidity and possible market effects. Though Lido’s liquid staking solution does make tokens more accessible, the fear of sudden large-scale withdrawals reveals a critically vulnerable point in staking protocols. Such moves can fuel fears of reduced liquidity. One such incident can be traced back to Aug. 5 of this year, when withdrawals, possibly by whales, dropped ETH’s price from $3317 to $2419.

Spikes in outflows often align with volatility, while Ethereum’s price surged to $3.9K in December, reflecting increased activity amid market movements. Although Lido withdrawals are not immediate, given that they must go through the Ethereum staking queue, such large moves can be indicative of market changes, especially if multiple large stakeholders follow suit, causing an imbalance between staked and unstaked assets.

With 14 million users verified and only 1 million left, Pi Network aims to launch its open network by December 31. However, delays and skepticism around the project continue to spark controversy. ‘Stay Safe,’ Pi Network Users The team behind the controversial cryptocurrency project Pi Network recently issued two important alerts for its users. First, the developers warned “pioneers” to rely only on information provided by official channels. They also provided a dedicated safety page showing all the sources and URL links the community can refer to. Shortly after, Pi Network reminded people to use only their Pi Wallets in the designated Pi Browser. “Ensure you’re in the correct Pi Wallet, not any fake one, to safeguard your Pi. The authentic Pi Wallet is also visually identified by a purple color in the navigation bar of the Pi Browser with a Pi logo featuring the Core Team apps logo,” the warning reads. Alerts of that type are essential for projects with a vast community base and, for that reason, are often targeted by scammers. Pi Network has amassed millions of users over the past few years, while its application recently hit the milestone of 100 million downloads. The project has a solid presence in Asia, with China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Singapore, and more turning into strongholds. Not long ago, Wu Blockchain revealed that the number of Pi Network’s users in South Korea has reached 1.34 million. The only two local crypto-related entities having more users are the popular exchanges Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million). Moreover, the figure outnumbers the domestic client base of leading crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Major Developments on the Horizon? Despite becoming quite popular and being around for over five years, Pi Network has yet to launch its native token and mainnet. This , combined with the numerous delays and broken promises, has caused some to label the project a scam, claiming such huge developments will never see the light of day. For its part, Pi Network’s team previously said it will launch its open network once 15 million users complete the necessary verifications. Not long ago, Pi News revealed that 14 million people have already complied with the rules, with only one million left to do so . The final deadline is December 31 (a date moved numerous times in the last few months). Additionally, the Pi Core Team promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap in December, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or if the pessimists will turn right.

Today it jumped to another high at $106,533 marking a 77% rally since the bull run started on October 10. With the rise in price, the number of BTC wallets are also taking a spike. Major Bitcoin Players Here’s a wild fact: the number of wallets holding at least 100 BTC jumped significantly in just nine weeks. According to blockchain data from Santiment, these large wallets went from 16,072 to 17,644. That’s nearly a 10% increase. Source : X.com/santimentfeed But not all big holders are the same. There are only 4 addresses that hold between 100k and 1 million bitcoins. Satoshi Nakamoto , the anonymous creator of the first crypto is supposed to hold around 1.1 million coins. Another big player is the public traded company Microstrategy that now own 423,650 BTC. There is one more known whale – Roger Ver, aka “ Bitcoin Jesus .” He owns 131,000 BTC. Apart from his crypto holding, he also got famous for getting arrested on charges of U.S. tax evasion in April this year. There are 17,671 wallet addresses that hold more than 100 Bitcoin. This is a very tiny number as compared to the 85 million addresses that own between $1 to $1000 worth of BTC. Now compare these numbers to approximately 460 million total bitcoin addresses. Source : bitinfocharts More than 88% of the circulating supply is controlled by retail investors. This ensures Bitcoin stays decentralized. It’s not controlled by a few wealthy players, so fears of market manipulation are minimal. Dormant Wallets Come to Life Another more interesting thing that adds fuel to the confidence of Bitcoin is the awakening of Dormant wallets. Some of them have been inactive since 2009. They are suddenly back in action. Many of these hold massive amounts, like 10,000 BTC or more. Traditionally, only crypto exchanges manage balances this large, but some investor holding this much amount, must be a great HODLER. Source : bitinfocharts However, many unknown wallets moved significant amounts of Bitcoin during Q4 2024. This renewed activity shows that long-term holders still believe in Bitcoin’s potential. What to Expect What does this mean for Bitcoin? The rise in large wallet holders and reactivation of old wallets signal growing trust in its long-term value. Retail investors still hold most of the supply, keeping Bitcoin decentralized and free from manipulation by a handful of players. As adoption grows and confidence remains strong, Bitcoin’s position as a leading digital asset only seems to strengthen. Whether you’re a whale, a sub-whale, or just getting started, the message is clear: Bitcoin’s future looks brighter than ever. We told you the names of 3 out of the top 4 bitcoin wallet addresses.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-stock-now-valued-at-114-51-per-share-heres-the-significance/,"According to the online investment platform Linqto, the blockchain company Ripple continues to garner attention in the investment community, as its private stock now trades at $114.51 per share. This valuation implies $19.6 billion, reflecting Ripple’s strong position in the blockchain and financial technology (fintech) sectors. #Ripple stock is now valued at $114.51 per share with an implied Valuation of $19.6 Billion on Linqto pic.twitter.com/mvxkqfIgxw — XRPDAILY (@XRPXLMVERSE) December 15, 2024 Ripple, headquartered in San Francisco, is best known for its payment protocol. The company’s private stock is not publicly traded but is made available to accredited investors through platforms like Linqto. The rise in Ripple’s stock price and valuation underscores growing investor confidence in the company, despite its ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Understanding Ripple’s Current Valuation The implied valuation of $19.6 billion positions Ripple as one of the leading companies in the blockchain and fintech industries. This figure reflects the company’s significant technological advancements, partnerships with financial institutions, and market adoption of its payment solutions. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which uses XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions, has been a key driver of its adoption, enabling faster and more cost-efficient international payments. This valuation also places Ripple in competition with other major fintech and cryptocurrency firms, further highlighting its market influence. While Ripple’s exact revenue figures remain private, the company has disclosed robust growth in the use of its ODL platform. The valuation could also be influenced by speculation about Ripple’s potential for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), a move that the company has hinted at in the past but has not yet confirmed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Impact of the SEC Lawsuit Ripple’s valuation increase comes amid a legal battle with the SEC, which began in December 2020. The lawsuit alleges that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP tokens. While the case has created regulatory uncertainty, recent developments have impacted the market positively. In July 2023, a U.S. District Court issued a partial ruling stating that XRP sales to retail investors did not constitute securities offerings. However, institutional sales were deemed to fall under securities laws. This decision provided some regulatory clarity and led to a resurgence in interest in both XRP and Ripple as a company. Investor Sentiment The rising valuation of Linqto signals continued interest in Ripple from institutional and private investors. Platforms like Linqto cater to a growing demand for access to private equity in tech and fintech companies before they go public. Ripple’s consistent presence on such platforms suggests strong demand among accredited investors, even amid regulatory challenges.

Interestingly, the crypto market rally with Trump’s win has affected this struggling token positively, as it is currently trading at $2.41 after achieving a seven-year high of $2.84 at the beginning of the month. With Trump becoming a pro-crypto supporter, Bitcoin achieved the biggest push in the previous month, further fueling the rest of the crypto assets. However, this is just the beginning, as the XRP ETF approval might push the token even higher, as this will bring increased accessibility for newer investors and create scarcity for the token, along with increasing its adoption. As a result, FOMO could propel the Ripple token price to $10 or even higher. Why XRP Price Could Jump With XRP ETF Launch? Until now, the two crypto assets spot ETFs are functioning and gaining momentum among investors. The Bitcoin ETF, which got the SEC’s approval in January, has played the biggest role in pushing the Bitcoin price to ATH of $106.4k. However, it took some time for the market to react to this news, as Bitcoin price dropped with BTC ETF inflows as investments flocked to exchange-traded funds. Regardless, the correlation builds between the two with time, pushing each other to new highs. Even now, the Bitcoin price is on a bullish trajectory, as it hit the ATH of $106,488.25 just a few hours ago. At the same time, Bitcoin ETF gained a weekly net inflow of $2.17 billion, confirming this theory. With that, the experts believe that the Bitcoin ETF AUM can Surpass Gold ETF by year-end. The same happened with Ethereum ETF as before the trading began for this ETF, the Ethereum price remained relatively stagnant with slight volatility, but after the approval in July 2024, the price began to move steadily with the increased inflows in the Ethereum exchange-traded funds. Although many factors contributed to these token’s growth, the inflows and price charts had similar trends. Even at present, Ethereum is following a bullish trajectory, currently trading at $3,963.13. At the same time, the Ethereum net inflow came out to $855M over the week, setting a record high for weekly net inflows. The XRP ETF could present similar outcomes, favoring the XRP price similarly. XRP Price To Hit $10 With XRP ETF Inflows XRP struggled for three years under the SEC’s influence, but now things have changed, as the token has grown significantly with Trump’s win and Gary Gensler’s resignation . This news boosted the token significantly, and the same will happen with the XRP ETF due to its institutional demand. The XRP holders have been awaiting this moment since the Ethereum ETF approval. Till now, many major firms like WisdomTree, Bitwise, and 21Shares have filed their application for XRP exchange-traded fund, waiting for the SEC’s approval. Despite the unfavorable relation between the two, the community is anticipating a positive response due to XRP’s top positioning in the market, as this is the fourth biggest crypto. Moreover, considering the monthly inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the XRP ETF inflows could push the XRP price to $10. In the first month of the Bitcoin ETF launch, it received inflows of $30.18B. Over the three months, it received $217.38B, showcasing exponential growth in adoptions. Similarly, in the first month of the Ethereum ETF launch, the total inflows it received were around $9.28B. In three months, these were $3.81B, comparatively lower. This indicates that the early institutional demand led to a heavy flow in the first month, but it stabilized over time. Based on that, the XRP ETF could witness $1.8B – $2.3B in inflows in the first month and $2.0B – $2.6B over the three months, considering this token’s high price sensitivity and a much smaller market cap in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result, the XRP price might take a slightly bullish turn, pushing it above $3. However, the $10 can only be possible if other factors, like Gensler’s resignation, RLUSD’s successful launch , and the SEC vs. Ripple case ending, align with the ETF launch. ** BREAKING NEWS ** #XRP is destined to be the #1 crypto and the world reserve currency: – Gensler resignation – XRPL meme coins – RLUSD approved – RLUSD launch – XRP ETF launch (Blackrock, etc) – Ripple-SEC case settled – Trump in office – New SEC Chair in… pic.twitter.com/hd6j8fhjYW — Kingdom Coins (@PropheticCoins) December 14, 2024 Final Thoughts The ETF market is growing exponentially with the success of Bitcoin and ETF exchange-traded funds. Now, the XRP exchange-traded fund is next in line, considering its high demand among investors and its recent price growth trajectory, as it hit a seven-year high just recently. With that, the XRP price could hit $3 before $10 after all the bullish factors like a successful RLUSD launch, Ripple vs SEC case conclusion, and better regulation. More importantly, if the XRP ETF inflows follow the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF trajectory, it could see around $2B in inflows in the first month only.

Key Levels to Watch,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-ethereum-price-hit-ath-this-week-key-levels-to-watch/,"The post Will Ethereum Price Hit ATH This Week? Key Levels to Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After an impressive performance in the past two months, Ethereum (ETH) price has reached a crucial resistance level above $3,953, which could either delay or confirm further bullish sentiment. The largest altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $476 billion and a daily average traded volume of about $30 billion, successfully retested its bullish breakout from the multi-year falling logarithmic trend. However, Ethereum price could consolidate in the near term to attract more buyers, especially as Bitcoin (BTC) price steals the show with a rally beyond $105k earlier today. Consequently, the highly hyped altseason could take much longer to materialize as large-cap altcoins take time to attract new liquidity amid slow cash rotation from Bitcoin. Ethereum Whale on the Move According to on-chain data analysis provided by Glassnode , the number of Ethereum whale addresses, with a balance of above 10k ETH, has continued to increase exponentially in the recent past. The notable rise of Ethereum whales coincides with the ongoing decline in Ether supply on centralized exchanges; more than 95k ETH units were withdrawn from CEXes in the past seven days. Remarkably, the US spot Ether ETFs have registered more than $2 billion in net cash inflows during the past three weeks. Led by BlackRockms ETHA, the US spot Ether ETFs registered the highest cash weekly inflow of about $854 million last week. What Next? Amid the rising demand for Ether by institutional investors, especially as a measure to diversify their respective crypto portfolios, the bullish prospects have significantly spiked. From a technical analysis standpoint, ETH’s price is aiming for $5,250 in the near term, which coincides with the daily Fibonacci extension. The parabolic rally for Ether will however be confirmed after the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) surges above the 70 percent level again since earlier this year.",News|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 09:54:36

However, discovering the next token that could skyrocket during this time may bring life-changing returns. Experts think that one such crypto coin is IntelMarkets (INTL) – a phase seven presale star that has already experienced a 610% price surge. Even if SHIB and DOGE work hard to break the $1 threshold, analysts expect that INTL will bring 3x returns long before these meme coins achieve their target price. This is why IntelMarkets is becoming the talk of the crypto market. IntelMarkets (INTL) Seen as a Disruptive Force in Crypto Trading As Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are soaring on the price charts, IntelMarkets (INTL) is also making headlines. Its crypto ICO event performance has been excellent, having raised over $4.3M and sold nearly 40M INTL tokens. Demand for this crypto coin is sky-high. IntelMarkets will introduce something never seen before – an AI-powered smart trading platform. With this platform, IntelMarkets will tap into the growing AI market, which Statista predicts could be worth $826B by 2030. Not only that, traders will get to experience features not seen anywhere else. Features like: Self-Learning Trading Robots: Access to self-learning trading robots that improve their performance over time. Omnichannel Processing: Instead of mixed signals, the Intell-Array monitoring system will provide one holistic signal backed by 100,000 data points. Autopilot Trading Robots: Trading robots automatically take up positions based on trader objectives or goals. INTL will be a big part of the IntelMarkets ecosystem. From its starting presale price of $0.009, this altcoin has seen an increase of 610% – giving early buyers massive returns. Since it is now valued at only $0.064 countless traders are stocking up on it as the next presale stage will trigger a jump to $0.73. Not only that but a Tier-1 crypto exchange listing is expected to push this price to $0.11, a 71% increase from its current price. Those who buy INTL now will capitalize on this growth and get governance voting rights, discounts on trading fees, and more. This could make INTL one of the best cryptos to watch. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Rises, Analyst Hints at More Growth Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the meme coin titans that has had big price gains. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of Shiba Inu has jumped over 15% in the past month alone. In that period, its value moved between $0.000024 and $0.000028. Crypto analyst The CryptoBull also made an exciting Shiba Inu (SHIB) statement. In a recent X post, he told his followers that this meme coin looks ready to skyrocket soon. His Shiba Inu price prediction points to a rise to $0.000088 soon. The technicals for the Shiba Inu coin also show bullish signs. This meme coin is currently valued above its 20-day EMA ($0.000028). However, its market cap also sits at $16B, which means it may need a lot of money to surge, a problem IntelMarkets will not face. Hardy: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) May Hit a New ATH Market analyst Hardy has also made some waves in the crypto market with his Dogecoin (DOGE) price prediction. According to his recent X post, this meme coin could see a new ATH in its value. This could mean Dogecoin soaring past $0.73. Regarding the Dogecoin price, CoinMarketCap shows its value soared nearly 5% in the past month alone. During that time, it saw movement between the $0.40 and close to the $0.50 levels. Although the Dogecoin crypto may see big price gains soon, IntelMarkets has some advantages. For instance, INTL will have actual utility, which means it could see more considerable adoption while DOGE focuses on meme hype. Can IntelMarkets (INTL) Surge Faster Than Shiba Inu (SHIB) & Dogecoin (DOGE)? Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are seeing green price charts. However, these meme coins have huge market caps, meaning that they will not give you the high returns they used to offer. But unlike them, IntelMarkets (INTL) is right at the beginning, needing less money to see big price gains. Therefore, many experts hint that a 3x surge could come for INTL in 2025.

This week’s spotlight falls on Bitcoin, Fantom, Avalanche, Stacks, and LayerZero, each of which is facing a pivotal milestone. The broader macro backdrop is also critical, particularly the December 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest-rate decision in the United States. #1 Bitcoin And Crypto Await The FOMC Decision Bitcoin traders and investors are watching the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday, December 18, at 2:00 pm ET, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference to follow at 2:30 pm ET. Saxo Bank writes in their latest investor note, “The Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver a 25 basis-points (bps) rate cut this week, reducing the target range for the federal funds rate to 4.25-4.50%.” According to futures data, there is a 95% probability of this move, which follows a similar cut in November. While the rate cut is seemingly priced in, the market will scrutinize the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and its “dot plot,” which depict the expected path of policy rates for 2025 and beyond. Any signal that the Federal Reserve could limit the pace of future cuts—particularly if it revises the dot plot from four rate cuts in 2025 down to three or even two—might weigh on risk-on assets such as Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Many analysts point to the labor market, which has been softening, and to easing shelter inflation, evidenced by slowing rental price growth, as key justifications for additional rate cuts. Related Reading: Crypto Market Hit Hard With $1.7 Billion Liquidated, Largest Event Since 2021 However, the Fed may convey a more cautious stance and highlight so-called “Trump-flation” risks, referencing the possibility of renewed trade tariffs under the incoming Trump administration that could push inflation higher. If such inflationary risks remain persistent, the Fed might pause or reduce the pace of cuts in 2025, which would be viewed as a hawkish twist. The new dot plot for 2025 is currently expected to show around 3.625%—a baseline assumption of three rate cuts next year—but the market has speculated that this could move to 3.875% if the Fed becomes more cautious. The immediate reaction in Bitcoin will likely hinge on the meeting’s tone, with a less dovish Fed potentially introducing volatility to BTC price action. #2 Fantom (FTM) Fantom is entering a new era with the upcoming Sonic L1 mainnet launch, a transformative upgrade that will dramatically improve network throughput and cost efficiency. Developers behind Fantom have highlighted that Sonic is capable of processing approximately 10,000 transactions per second, with near-instant finality—a marked leap from current network capabilities. The planned modifications are also set to cut operational expenditures, with a reported 66% decrease in validator node costs and minimized storage requirements. Another important detail is Fantom’s decision to maintain compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which should make it straightforward for EVM-based applications to migrate to the upgraded chain without modifying their underlying code. Sonic will also debut a new token, denoted as S, which will replace the existing FTM token at a one-to-one ratio. The crypto trader Jacob Canfield stated via X, “Shared this setup x subs last week, but FTM is close to a price discovery break. Needs to clear the bearish impulse base and close a 4 hour candle and we will probably see swift price discovery. The chart coincides nicely with the SONIC launch.” #3 Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche will be another focal point in the crypto industry, as the Avalanche9000 upgrade is set to go live on the mainnet today, on December 16. This follows a testnet debut on the “Fuji” testnet on November 25. Related Reading: Crypto Market Outlook: VanEck Issues 10 Predictions, Including Bitcoin Nearing $200,000 The highly anticipated mainnet launch is described by Avalanche’s core developers as the most significant upgrade in the chain’s history. Compounding the buzz is Avalanche’s December 12 announcement of a $250 million private token sale led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital, with more than 40 other entities participating. According to official statements, this fundraising round strengthens Avalanche’s treasury, already valued at around $3 billion in AVAX tokens, and comes on the back of a previous $230 million token sale in 2021. Avalanche9000 incorporates the Etna Upgrade and key community proposals ACP-77 and ACP-125, altogether reimagining how Avalanche’s subnets function—now referred to as layer-1s. In doing so, Avalanche transitions from a costly validator system requiring 2,000 AVAX per instance to a more subscription-like model that charges 1.33 AVAX per month. The upgrade also focuses on cross-chain connectivity, enabling more sophisticated interchain communication within Avalanche’s broader ecosystem. #4 Stacks (STX) Stacks is another name to keep on the radar as it prepares to launch sBTC on Tuesday, December 17, at 11:00 am ET. This new BTC-backed asset is designed to bring Bitcoin’s liquidity directly into the DeFi sphere on Stacks, offering a rewards program that is notably free of staking requirements. According to the project’s official announcement, the sBTC Rewards Program provides a 5% annual Bitcoin reward, paid out in bi-weekly installments, and the distribution is made in actual Bitcoin, not third-party tokens. The program’s first phase, commencing on December 17, will focus on deposit functionality and immediate rewards accrual for sBTC holders. The second phase, currently planned for March 2025, is expected to layer in more advanced DeFi capabilities and reward structures, thereby broadening the utility of sBTC. #5 LayerZero (ZRO) LayerZero rounds out the week’s watchlist with a governance milestone. On December 20, 2024, at 00:00 UTC, ZRO token holders will engage in the network’s first-ever fee switch referendum, a vote that could activate a protocol fee on every LayerZero message. The referendum is straightforward, posing the single question, “Turn the fee switch on?” A majority vote of “Yes,” assuming quorum is met, would enact a fee that matches the underlying DVN and Executor costs for each message, effectively doubling the cost of each cross-chain transmission. The collected fees would then be used to buy back and burn ZRO, potentially reducing the circulating supply and impacting the token’s economics. ZRO balances across Ethereum, Optimism, Base, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Arbitrum are all factored into each holder’s voting power, consolidated seamlessly through LayerZero’s lzRead feature. The referendum will last seven days, concluding on December 27, 2024. A 60% quorum of the circulating supply is required for the vote to be valid; if that threshold is not met, the outcome defaults to “No.” If the referendum passes, the protocol fee would be immediately activated, potentially shifting the dynamics of how developers and users manage cross-chain communications. This governance mechanism is set to repeat every six months, though the quorum requirement would decrease by 5% each time if it is not met, down to a minimum floor of 20%. At press time, Bitcoin traded at $104,748.

This comes in when the RLUSD is heading toward its market debut while Ripple Labs gains regulatory clarity in the United States. Bullish sentiments emerging from investors for Ripple can be seen in the recent XRP price action. Ripple’s native crypto price has surged by 142% in the last 30 days and more than 335% over the past 60 days. A major boost came in for the blockchain firm after US Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gensler decided to step down after Donald Trump’s presidential election win. Ripple CTO spots risk among investors Schwartz in a post addressed the risk of RLUSD trading above its $1 parity due to early supply shortages. He cited that pre-market bids valuing RLUSD as high as $1,200 are driven by buyer excitement. He added that the tools will show you the highest price that anyone is willing to pay, even if it’s just for a tiny bit. He suggested that this may be someone who wants to brag about the honor of buying the first bit of RLUSD on the DEX. The Ripple CTO clarified that such inflated prices would be short-lived and stated that the price would come back to very close to $1 as soon as supply stabilizes. He cautioned that If it doesn’t happen then something is seriously very wrong. He led out a warning and clarified that if one wants to spend a lot of money to get a tiny bit of RLUSD before anyone else does, they can. However, they don’t need to expect the price to stay over $1 once things stabilize. Schwartz also urged investors not to FOMO into RLUSD and highlighted that this is not an opportunity to get rich. He further added, “Please remember, that a stablecoin’s purpose is to have a stable price.” Ripple riding the bullish wave Ripple plans to use RLUSD to power cross-border payments on XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum. The New York Department of Financial Services approved the stablecoin on December 11, but a launch date has not been announced yet. Meanwhile, XRP price has surged to a seven-year high of $2.74, marking a fivefold increase in just 30 days. This rally marks renewed investor confidence in the ecosystem. XRP has beaten Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptos with a massive 290% year-to-date (YTD) jump. XRP is trading at an average price of $2.39, at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 67% to stand at $64.71 billion. With ongoing bullish momentum for Ripple, XRP has managed to climb up in the tally of the biggest cryptos. XRP displaced Solana (SOL) and BNB to bag the 4th spot in the rankings. It is holding a market cap of $136.3 billion, standing just short of Tether (USDT).

37710431,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393530,1734343771,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Are Desktop Platforms Better For Online Trading?,https://coinpedia.org/guest-post/are-desktop-platforms-better-for-online-trading/,"The post Are Desktop Platforms Better For Online Trading? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mobile phones started off as a convenient way to make a phone call when you’re away from home. However, it’s clear that, since then, they have morphed into something entirely different. This seems apparent from the fact that, on average, we touch our phones 3 times per minute. Or, if you prefer another statistic: Over half of American adults testify they “couldn’t live without” their smartphones. This doesn’t sound quite like a casual or utilitarian sort of relationship. Psychologists have suggested that our connections with our phones have become an “attachment relationship”, meaning that they take on the role of a significant other in our lives – one that is always available, controllable, and touchable. This explains our emotional responses to their being lost or broken, which seem completely out of proportion. At the basis of this issue, so they say, is a lack of self-esteem, from which about nine in 10 of us are said to suffer. Like any relationship, this one has its limits. It’s not healthy to bring it into every single corner of our lives. The focus of this article is on the extent to which you should bring it into the arena of online trading. The alternative, in this case, is a desktop platform which sits in a corner of your office, patiently waiting for the daily attention you bestow on it. Is your well-mannered PC, perhaps, a better partner in your battles with the markets than that frenzied mobile phone, which ceaselessly beeps and rings for your attention throughout the day? Let’s find out. Real Time There’s one clear advantage which mobile trading apps have over their desktop counterparts: You can carry them around with you. This quality might not be valuable in many of your other relationships, say with your spouse, but, in this case, it really is. That’s because it allows you to check on asset prices whenever and wherever you want, which can give you an edge in planning and executing your deals that you couldn’t get in any other way. By the time you get home, that perfect entry price may very well have slipped away. Securities are volatile, fluctuating all the time in response to various factors that act in complex ways. There’s no way of knowing what will be ahead for them, even on the immediate horizon. The only thing for it, at least if you’re in the business of short-term trading, is to carry around a mobile version of your trading app. On the other hand, you know what they say about too much of a good thing. Having a device in your purse that (a) never stops sending you price alerts, and (b) actually allows you to act on them, can sometimes be detrimental. The endless series of ringings can increase your nervousness and stir you to trade inappropriately and excessively. Deal making requires a calm spirit and a steady mind, which is difficult to maintain while hailing a taxi or paying your restaurant bill. Yes, there may come times when you must open trades on the go, but the concern is that you’ll become trigger happy if you get into the habit. And this concern should be taken seriously because you’ll often have a strong initial reaction to new data – one that may not be the wisest when considered in the quiet solitude of your office. The Interface Mobile trading apps often need to cut down on features in order to adapt the platform to their reduced storage and processing capabilities. To the extent that this is true for you, you need to shoot for desktop to ensure you are employing your app to the utmost. Mobile app developers have indeed made a lot of progress in adapting their products to the smaller physical scale, and this is likely to continue as more and more crafty minds are put to the task. When it comes to trading online, however, they face a unique problem: It just ain’t the same. Many traders like to keep several screens facing them simultaneously in order to monitor global news, check up on other assets, and peruse price charts. The process of staying on the ball with respect to the factors affecting price movements requires clear, compartmentalized thinking. For instance, you have to know whether or not the stock information you received yesterday came from a reliable source, and not some random voice on social media, and you need to confirm this quickly. Alternatively: Was the Head and Shoulders pattern you saw a few minutes ago on the price chart for USD/JPY or EUR/USD? Keeping things like this clear in your mind is more easily done on a desktop platform than a mobile one. Besides, toggling between different windows on your mobile phone in order to stay abreast of the markets is not exactly ideal. Online trading is like walking a tightrope, which you wouldn’t do while playing a game of chess. Therefore, make life easier for yourself and, even if you can’t afford to buy several screens, at least trade from a desktop workspace. A sense of spaciousness improves your psychological wellbeing, inspires creative thinking, and gives you the chance to focus intently on a single task for long periods. Each one of these things can literally make the difference between success and failure in your trading efforts. Add to this the fact that desktops work well when you’re collaborating with several other people, allowing you all to look at the same data together, which we cannot say for smartphones. Power Since the technological frameworks in our times exist on a tiny scale, you might think that your smartphone packs as big a punch as a desktop PC. This is not quite the case, especially in online trading, where specialized and complex software is put to use. Inside a desktop computer, you’ll find all kinds of specialized items like the CPU (central processing unit), RAM (random access memory), SSD (solid state drive), and GPU (graphics processing unit), and the list goes on. All of these are carefully selected and calibrated to work together harmoniously. The extra spaciousness in your desktop PC does make a difference to your processing power because it houses a larger CPU, which takes care of all the processing. The same goes for your RAM, which is considerably inferior on a mobile phone. What does RAM do? It lodges the short-term memory which the computer needs for daily functions like running apps. The CPU utilizes the RAM in order to run your applications. When RAM is fast, it implies the CPU can channel data more quickly and efficiently. Weaker RAM means you’ll be sitting and waiting longer for apps to open. Advanced trading software can be particularly demanding on the RAM, so it will work better on a desktop system than a mobile phone. Other Considerations Mobile phones run on batteries, which run out, and this can be rather frustrating when you’re trying to close a sensitive deal. By contrast, your desktop PC enjoys a more stable power supply. Similarly with regard to your internet connection, you’re likely to experience less trouble when operating from your home setup. Besides this, consider the fact that your phone can be stolen fairly easily, while your desktop sits obediently in your office, staying out of trouble. Needless to say, you don’t want a thief to able to take control of the deals you were setting up, (unless he has some really good ideas). In terms of damage, your phone is much more vulnerable than your desktop and can find itself out of commission after a single drop to the floor. The types of things that need repairing or replacing in your desktop, though, are comparatively cheap, for example the mouse and keyboard. Thus, when doing something as work intensive as online trading, it makes sense to go desktop. Wrapping Things Up As you may have gathered, we tend to favour desktop setups over mobile phones for active online traders. At the same time, we’ll say this: Why not use the mobile app to get price updates when you have to be on the move? After all, doing that doesn’t require much of a calm mind. Certainly though, for any type of research or analysis, it’s hard to see how you could do as good a job on a smartphone (even a big one) as on a high-fidelity computer monitor. Instead of pitting one against the other, let the phone and the PC do their designated jobs in peace and harmony together!

This includes a violation of the PNUT trademark along with the image of a squirrel wearing a cowboy hat. As a result, Longo’s law firm has issued a cease-and-desist letter to the crypto exchange. Did Binance Infringe Trademark About Peanut the Squirrel? On behalf of animal rights activist Mark Longo, law firm Barclay Damon LLP issued a strongly worded letter accusing crypto exchange Binance of infringing on intellectual property rights owned by their client. The letter also alleges that Binance used Longo’s “Peanut the Squirrel” image and trademark, in addition to using terms such as “PNUT THE SQUIRREL” and “PNUT”, without Longo’s authorization. It asserts that Binance’s actions constitute violations of Longo’s copyrights and trademarks. In his message on the X platform, Mark Longo, popular as Squirrel_Dad wrote: “My legal team initiated action against Binance for the unauthorized use of my intellectual property, including images and stories featuring my beloved animals. This is the first of multiple cease and desist letters to be issued. I’m committed to protecting my creative work and sending a clear message: unauthorized use of my IP will not be tolerated”. Longo, who operates the Peanut the Squirrel Instagram account and P’Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary, is demanding that Binance “immediately cease and desist such infringing activities.” The letter warns that Binance must comply with the demands by December 31st or risk further legal action. Additionally, the letter details that Longo’s Peanut the Squirrel image is subject to copyright protection in the United States. Amid the recent media coverage surrounding PNUT, the associated trademark has gained significant fame. The letter states that Binance’s use of these assets will confuse customers that PNUT is “somehow sponsored, endorsed, or related” to Longo’s animal welfare efforts. The letter cites the Copyright Act, noting that infringement of registered works can incur damages up to $150,000 per work, plus costs and attorney’s fees. It also highlights the widespread use of the “Infringing Marks” across Binance’s platform, which reportedly existed “long before you began using the Infringing Marks”. This is not the first time that Mark Longo has threatened over copyright infringement. Last month, he also threatened PNUT users with lawsuits for profiting from his sorrows. PNUT Price Remains Steady Amid today’s development, PNUT price has remained mostly steady at $1.11. Over the past week, PNUT has been on a downward trajectory with a brief 20% PNUT price surge mid-week. However, it couldn’t be sustained for a long time as sellers charged in once again. After hitting a top of $2.46 in November, the PNUT price has been moving sideways correcting nearly 60% from the top. However, with the announcement of a Coinbase listing , PNUT enthusiasts have turned hopeful once again of a rally ahead. However, it is still trading 2000% up from its launch price in November.

GAM Investments, a global asset manager, has urged SBI to focus more on its XRP holdings, suggesting that the company adopt a bold strategy to realize its hidden potential. Meanwhile, Ripple’s native token, XRP, has become the center of attention, surging an incredible 500% in just one month. Why XRP Matters to SBI? For years, SBI Holdings has been a strong supporter of Ripple and blockchain technology. The company holds an 8% to 9% share of Ripple Labs and owns a substantial amount of XRP tokens. Despite this, SBI’s market value doesn’t seem to reflect the true worth of these crypto assets. GAM pointed out that SBI’s current market capitalization of JPY 1.2 trillion is far below the estimated JPY 1.6 trillion value of its Ripple and XRP investments. This creates a significant gap between the company’s actual net asset value (NAV) and its perceived market value. A Game-Changing Proposal GAM believes SBI has a unique opportunity to follow in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy, which made headlines by heavily investing in Bitcoin. They suggested that SBI start buying XRP directly from the market, creating a buyback program that could boost the token’s value while showcasing SBI’s commitment to cryptocurrency. With this approach, GAM believes this strategy could increase SBI’s market value, bringing it closer to its estimated worth of JPY 3.9 trillion. By reducing the supply of XRP in circulation, the program might push up its price, benefiting both SBI and the crypto market as a whole. Ripple’s XRP Growing Popularity XRP has become one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the market recently. The token is attracting a lot of attention, thanks to the launch of RLUSD and growing excitement around a potential XRP ETF approval. As of now, XRP is trading at around $2.39 , showing a slight dip of 1.2%, with a market cap of $136.76 billion.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 10:13:50

Understanding Pips and Their Role in Trading,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/what-is-a-pip-in-forex/,"In Forex trading, the term pip stands for “percentage in point” or “price interest point” and represents the smallest price movement in a currency pair. Understanding what pips are and how to calculate them is crucial for managing trades, determining profits or losses, and making informed decisions. This guide explains what a pip is in Forex , how to calculate pip values, and its importance in trading strategies. What is a Pip in Forex? A pip is a standardized unit of movement in the value of a currency pair. It is typically the fourth decimal place for most currency pairs or the second decimal place for pairs like JPY-related currencies. Example of a Pip Movement For EUR/USD : A movement from 1.1000 to 1.1001 equals 1 pip . For USD/JPY : A movement from 110.00 to 110.01 equals 1 pip . Why Are Pips Important in Forex?

By using tools like a Forex risk calculator and applying sound risk management strategies, traders can minimize losses and sustain long-term success. This guide covers the basics of Forex risks, how to calculate your risk, and proven management strategies to safeguard your trading account. What is Forex Risk? Forex risk refers to the potential for financial loss in currency trading due to market fluctuations, leverage, or other factors. Managing these risks is crucial to avoid significant losses, especially in a highly volatile market. Types of Forex Risks Market Risk : Price fluctuations in currency pairs. Leverage Risk : Amplified losses due to high leverage ratios. Liquidity Risk : Challenges in executing trades during low-volume periods. Interest Rate Risk : Changes in interest rates impacting currency values. Political/Economic Risk : Events like elections, geopolitical tensions, or economic instability affecting currencies. Forex Risk Calculator: A Must-Have Tool A Forex risk calculator helps traders determine the appropriate position size and potential loss for a trade based on their risk tolerance. Inputs for a Risk Calculator Account Size : Total capital available for trading. Risk Percentage : Percentage of capital you’re willing to risk per trade (e.g., 1–3%). Stop Loss (Pips) : Distance between your entry point and stop-loss order. Currency Pair : The exchange rate of the pair being traded. Output The calculator provides the optimal lot size and potential monetary loss , ensuring you stay within your risk limits. Example of Risk Calculation Parameters Values Account Size $10,000 Risk Percentage 2% Stop Loss 50 pips Currency Pair (EUR/USD) Exchange rate = 1.1000 Calculation Risk Amount : 2% of $10,000 = $200. Lot Size : The risk amount divided by the pip value. Lot Size=Risk AmountPip Value\text{Lot Size} = \frac{\text{Risk Amount}}{\text{Pip Value}} Lot Size = Pip Value Risk Amount ​ For EUR/USD, the pip value for a standard lot is $10. Lot Size=20050×10=0.4 lots.\text{Lot Size} = \frac{200}{50 \times 10} = 0.4 \text{ lots.} Lot Size = 50 × 10200 ​ = 0.4 lots. Forex Risk Management Strategies Effective Forex risk management involves setting clear rules and adhering to them throughout your trading journey. 1. Set a Risk Percentage Per Trade Limit risk to 1–3% of your total account balance for each trade. 2. Use Stop Loss Orders Place stop-loss orders to cap potential losses and protect against market volatility. 3. Diversify Your Trades Avoid overexposing your portfolio to a single currency pair or market condition. 4. Avoid Overleveraging Use leverage wisely, as higher leverage increases the risk of significant losses. 5. Monitor Risk-to-Reward Ratios Maintain a favorable risk-to-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or 1:3) to ensure profits outweigh potential losses. Forex Risk Management Tools Risk Calculators Tools to determine position size, potential loss, and trade risk. Trading Journals Track trades and analyze performance to refine strategies. Economic Calendars Stay informed about upcoming events that may impact currency markets. Volatility Indicators Use tools like ATR (Average True Range) to gauge market volatility. Tips for Effective Risk Management in Forex Stick to Your Plan : Emotional trading often leads to poor decisions. Start Small : Begin with smaller lot sizes to minimize initial risks. Regularly Review Performance : Assess and adapt your strategy based on past results. Keep Learning : Stay updated with market trends and trading techniques. FAQs About Forex Risks and Management 1. What is a Forex risk calculator? A tool that calculates potential loss, position size, and lot size based on account size, risk percentage, and stop loss. 2. What is the safest risk percentage for Forex trading? Most traders recommend risking 1–2% of your total account balance per trade. 3. Can you trade Forex without taking risks? Trading inherently involves risk, but effective management can minimize it. 4. How does leverage increase Forex risk? Leverage magnifies both potential gains and losses, increasing the stakes for each trade. 5. Why is stop loss important in Forex? Stop loss limits potential losses, ensuring that a single trade doesn’t wipe out your account. Conclusion Managing risks in Forex trading is vital for long-term success. By using tools like the Forex risk calculator and implementing robust risk management strategies, you can protect your capital, make informed decisions, and trade with confidence.

This included assets from Ethereum ( ETH ), BNB Chain ( BNB ), and others, as evidenced by posts on X and web data indicating a total of over $300 million, according to data from deBridge Finance. 📊REPORT: Over $300 million has been bridged from other chains to @Solana in the last 7 days. (This includes more than $200 million from Ethereum to Solana alone) pic.twitter.com/0NM5CIhOg6 — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) December 16, 2024 Based on total-value-locked, bridge tokens allow for the act of locking an original token on a native blockchain, then minting or unlocking an equivalent token on Solana ( SOL ). Often termed as “wrapped” tokens, e.g., wETH for Ethereum on Solana, bridging allows for interoperability between different blockchains. One reason for the increased activity maybe diversification, alternative strategies and/or applications not being confined to one blockchain’s limitations. In the case of the recent influx of tokens into Solana, this could include some recent speed updates that raise block limits, the advent of 120 millisecond blocktimes, as well as some feature upgrades that make the blockchain appealing to investors.

In addition, investors may be attracted to Solana’s DeFi staking and yield ecosystem, which offers more attractive returns compared to similar opportunities on Ethereum. In contrast to Ethereum, Solana utilizes a combination of Proof of Stake and Proof of History, allowing for high transaction throughout. Staking on Solana can yield about 7% APR, higher than Ethereum due to its inflation rate and lower total staked supply. Moreover, Solana’s native staking is less liquid than Ethereum’s post-Shanghai, but liquid staking protocols like Marinade Finance or Jito provide liquidity through tokens like mSOL or JitoSOL. In sum, while Solana’s significantly lower fees make yield farming more viable for smaller investors compared to Ethereum, where high gas fees can eat into profits, other investors may lean more towards Ethereum based on volatility and it’s battle tested protocols, as well as Ethereum’s more established smart contracts and dApps.

The MicroStrategy shares’ price is also rising as the market reacts to news that the leading corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ) is set for inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 index. While the MSTR stock trades below its recent peak above $543, the pre-market surge on Dec. 16 has the MicroStrategy shares above $430. Ahead of the upcoming listing as part of Nasdaq 100, sentiment in the BTC-focused business intelligence and software company is highly bullish. Read more: MicroStrategy to join Nasdaq-100 Index following Bitcoin-driven stock surge In the announcement last Friday, Nasdaq disclosed MSTR’s inclusion in the 100 index takes effect on Dec. 23. Buying pressure that comes with the listing, often as funds scoop the new component, could fuel further gains for MicroStrategy’s price. MSTR has exploded in the past year as the surging BTC helps catalyze upside momentum for crypto stocks. MicroStrategy, which has and continues to inspire adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury for publicly-listed companies, first added the flagship cryptocurrency to its balance sheet in 2020. Since then, the Michael Saylor-led company has acquired a staggering 423,650 BTC for approximately $25.6 billion. The total holdings average purchase price is $60,324 per bitcoin and was valued at roughly $42.3 billion with Bitcoin price above $100k. Notably, the benchmark cryptocurrency has reached a new ATH of over $106k after the latest leg up. Pro-crypto comments from President-elect Donald Trump helped buoy bulls. Read more: Bitcoin hits $106K, an all-time high fueled by Donald Trump’s intention to do “great with crypto” The MicroStrategy stock has on its part soared by more than 350 year-to-date. Over the past four years, MSTR has outperformed the S&P 500, gold, real estate and bonds. Its annualized performance stood at 124%, compared to 64% for Bitcoin, 15% for the S&P 500 and 10% for real estate. In this period, and as of Dec. 13, safe haven asset gold had an annualized return of just 7%. Meanwhile, bonds stood at -5%. Founder and Chairman Michael Saylor, who sees Bitcoin as ‘digital property’, shared this performance on X. On July 3, 2002, $MSTR stock fell to an all-time low of $0.42. Yesterday, it closed at $421.88. Never. Never. Never give up. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) November 23, 2024 MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has analysts looking at its potential to continue outpacing peers in the market. The move to have MSTR make up the Nasdaq-100 index has analysts noting it could be headed to the S&P 500 next. MSTR closed at $408 on Dec. 13. The hot stock hovered above $431 at the time of writing.

It's aged like fine wine, but only shows the original price tag. That's how U.S. companies have been told to value their bitcoin ... stuck in the past instead of reflecting its true worth. As of today, that changes. Yes, today is when the FASB fair value accounting rule, which passed in 2023, takes effect , allowing companies to report their bitcoin holdings at fair market value instead of the purchase price. The change gives firms more control over how they classify these assets and may accelerate corporate adoption. Note, though, the new standard doesn’t apply to NFTs, wrapped tokens or internally generated digital assets. Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at The FXPro, said, quoting a JPMorgan report, that publicly traded companies have already begun implementing a MicroStrategy-like strategy to add BTC to their balance sheets. The rule change might also explain why BTC spiked above $106,000 in Asia, boosted further by President-elect Donald Trump's assurance to create a strategic BTC reserve and a short squeeze on Deribit. The price has now pulled back to around $104,500, probably due to concern the Fed's much anticipated rate cut this Wednesday will come with projections for fewer reductions next year. BTC is trading at a discount on Coinbase compared with Binance, a sign of weaker demand in the U.S., a CryptoQuant tracker shows. Looking more broadly, ETH failed to establish a foothold above $4,000 amid reports of large withdrawals of staked ether from Lido Finance. Payments-focused XRP traded more than 2% lower, weakening a bullish technical pattern. Ripple CTO David Schwartz raised concerns about FOMO-driven volatility before the debut of the company’s RLUSD stablecoin, which it plans to use for cross-border payments alongside XRP. Early price fluctuations and high pre-launch bids don’t quite reflect the true market value, Schwartz said. On a brighter note, Solana's industry-beating revenue generation has been grabbing eyeballs. Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, said: ""Solana generated a staggering $431 million in fees over the past 30 days – more than all other Layer 1s combined!"" Solana now captures 53% of the global layer 1 fee pool, largely driven by the surge in AI activity. Still, the token dipped 3%, threatening to break below the 50-day SMA, a key indicator for near-term market trends. Chainlink’s LINK defied the weakness in major tokens, rising 4% thanks to whale buying. Data from LookOnChain revealed that a whale withdrew 429,999 LINK, worth over $12 million, over the weekend. Lastly, in traditional markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note looks to break out of a prolonged downtrend as observers anticipate a hawkish Fed rate cut this week. This hardening of yields could inject volatility into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. So, stay alert! What to Watch Crypto: Dec. 18: CleanSpark (CLSK) Q4 FY 2024 earnings.

Expect continued strong inflows into the spot ETFs as a result. AAVE's perpetual open interest has increased 7% in 24 hours, the most among major coins. The cumulative volume delta (CVD), however, has declined, indicating net selling pressure in the market. Looking at BTC options expiries extending to Jan. 31, we’re seeing calls trading at less than a 2.5 volatility premium to puts, a decline from last week's 4-5 premium. It seems traders aren't jumping on the latest surge to record highs quite as eagerly. It's similar in ETH options. Notable traders include a BTC bull call spread involving $115,000 and $125,000 strikes expiring Jan. 31 and a large short position in ETH $4,100 call expiring on Dec. 20.

XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced significant growth over the past six months, soaring by 379.42%. In the last month alone, it surged 212.42%, marking a remarkable uptrend. However, the past week saw a downturn with a 7.32% decline, indicating short-term volatility in the market. Currently trading between $2.22 and $2.95, XRP is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $2.42 and $2.40 respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51.94, suggesting that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Stochastic indicator is at 37.97, reinforcing a neutral market position. Looking ahead, XRP faces its nearest resistance at $3.30. A breakthrough could propel it toward the next resistance level of $4.03. On the downside, immediate support lies at $1.83, with a secondary support at $1.09 if bearish momentum continues. Traders are watching these levels closely, as movements could signal significant shifts in market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum’s price has shown mixed movements recently. Over the past week, ETH has decreased by 2.68%. However, in the last month, it has climbed by 27.26%. Over the past six months, the price has increased by 10.87%. This indicates substantial growth over the longer term despite short-term fluctuations. Currently, Ethereum is trading between $3643 and $4233. The 10-day simple moving average is $3873.26, and the 100-day SMA is $3883.85. The relative strength index stands at 55.00, suggesting neutral market sentiment. The stochastic oscillator is at 72.74, indicating that the asset is approaching overbought conditions. The MACD level is -1.149, which may signal a bearish trend. The nearest resistance level is at $4458. If ETH rises to this point from its current price, it would be an increase of about 13%. Breaking above this could lead to the second resistance at $5047, a rise of approximately 28%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3279, a decrease of about 17%. The second support level is at $2689, representing a drop of around 32%. These levels are important for traders watching for potential breakouts or reversals. Conclusion XRP and Ethereum show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) might lead this bull run by uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem aiming for massive growth.

Early projects blending AI and blockchain, such as Fetch.ai or Ocean Protocol, helped pioneer the integration of these two emerging technologies by building systems that could automate real-world processes and allow data owners to monetize and share datasets securely. By demonstrating how blockchain and AI can complement one another, these early projects set the stage for future collaborations. You might also like: Put developers at the center of web3 | Opinion Once generative AI tools demonstrated their powerful capabilities and disruptive potential, the crypto and blockchain space began theorizing additional use cases. Web3 enthusiasts and developers quickly recognized the prospect of decentralized AI models, the possibility of automated and chatbot-powered crypto services, and numerous other innovative applications. While many of these conversations were dismissed as crypto hijacking a conversation through its characteristic overhyping, the integration of web3 and advanced AI systems is well underway. Nothing illustrates this more than CoinMarketCap dedicating a market capitalization category for “AI and Big Data tokens.” However, with 335 dedicated token projects focused on AI and Big Data, it’s now easier than ever to envision AI empowering crypto and decentralized finance to provide enhanced features and a better user experience, which could fuel mass adoption. A symbiotic relationship Web3 introduced the power of decentralization through blockchain technology, but the next internet iteration promises to take it a step further by integrating adaptive interfaces and AI-powered smart contracts. Web4, or the “symbiotic web,” smoothly blends blockchain and AI systems to create a more positive and safe user experience that could have major implications for web3 and beyond. Imagine a future where a user’s engagement with crypto and DeFi is personalized, secure, and ultra-responsive, transforming everything from staking and trading to digital asset management. The symbiotic web builds off of web3’s decentralized model, adding an AI layer to improve user interfaces, create smart contracts capable of adapting dynamically to user needs and changing market conditions, and provide enhanced security and privacy. This could introduce trading platforms that adjust to a user’s unique trading patterns, DeFi systems that anticipate one’s next move, and smart contracts that respond in real-time to market shifts. Potential DeFi benefits In the fast-paced DeFi environment, where quick and informed decisions provide a real edge, adaptive user interfaces that provide real-time data and tailored insights not only create a better user experience but could also hold the key to mainstream adoption. Since many novel investors find crypto and DeFi’s user experience unfriendly due to a high learning curve regarding complex systems and technical know-how, creating a better and more intuitive experience will help onboard more users. A personalized trading dashboard highlighting the most relevant metrics to a given user could reduce information clutter and simplify the trading experience, empowering users to act confidently with assets known to be volatile. Beyond real-time updates, the symbiotic web’s predictive AI could make crypto platforms even more proactive. For instance, a DeFi platform might anticipate a user’s need to make a particular transaction and present relevant insights or alerts regarding critical market movements in advance. This proactive approach could make crypto trading less reactive and more intuitive, minimizing response times and further enhancing the user experience. Enhanced smart contracts While smart contracts helped bring about the web3 revolution and enabled DeFi’s existence, they are occasionally vulnerable to faulty coding that has led to hackers stealing users’ funds. The symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain could potentially see smart contracts adapt to live market data and personalized insights, creating a new type of responsive, user-centric transaction that prioritizes efficiency and security. AI-enhanced smart contracts could create real-time adjustments on rates from a lending platform, allowing users to get notified when they reach a favorable position. This adaptability also benefits DeFi platforms by fostering an environment where transactions are optimized by both fairness and liquidity. On a crypto exchange, these responsive, AI-powered smart contracts could automatically adjust margins if volatility spikes, reducing exposure or pausing a transaction during unusually extreme market conditions. This could boost user confidence and security while assisting traders in navigating a volatile market with a complex investing process. Web4 privacy and security Considering the degree of hyper-personalized data introduced by web4, there will be a need for the highest standard of privacy and security. Fortunately, AI and blockchain also have the answer to this through data privacy algorithms and decentralized storage solutions. To secure web4, privacy protocols can constantly monitor data flows, encrypting information and leveraging decentralized storage capabilities to protect user data. Furthermore, web4 could empower users with real-time control, allowing them to easily adjust privacy settings on the go and receive alerts when their data is being accessed. This level of transparency and control will empower users to feel secure and confident that their personal information will be protected in a future where data will be increasingly valuable and vulnerable. While web4 is still only a concept, it has the potential to reshape the crypto landscape for the better. The symbiotic vision where blockchain and AI collaborate to put the user’s needs at the forefront will make crypto and DeFi more palatable for a broader segment of society. With its ability to provide real-time information, adapt, and make intuitive decisions across complex DeFi platforms, web4 could be the trigger that ushers in a more intelligent, adaptable, and safe digital environment.

Understanding Forex Swap Fees,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/what-is-swap-in-forex/,"Forex trading , a swap refers to the interest fee traders pay or earn for holding a position overnight. Understanding how swaps work is crucial for managing trading costs and optimizing strategies. This guide explains what Forex swaps are, how they’re calculated, and how to navigate their impact on your trading. What is a Forex Swap? A Forex swap, also called a rollover fee , is the interest charged or earned when a trader keeps a position open overnight. Swaps occur because Forex trading involves borrowing one currency to buy another, and interest rates between the two currencies vary. Swap Charges : Paid when the interest rate of the base currency is lower than the counter currency. Swap Credits : Earned when the interest rate of the base currency is higher than the counter currency. Key Characteristics Swaps are calculated daily and automatically applied to open positions. They differ between long positions (buying a currency pair) and short positions (selling a currency pair). How is Swap Calculated in Forex? The swap rate depends on: Interest Rates : The difference between the interest rates of the two currencies in a pair. Trade Size : The larger the position, the higher the swap fee or credit. Broker’s Markup : Some brokers add additional charges to the swap rate. Swap Formula Swap Fee=Trade Size×(Interest Rate Difference)×Broker’s Commission\text{Swap Fee} = \text{Trade Size} \times (\text{Interest Rate Difference}) \times \text{Broker’s Commission} Swap Fee = Trade Size × ( Interest Rate Difference ) × Broker’s Commission Example of Swap in Forex Scenario 1: Positive Swap (Earned Interest) You buy EUR/USD and hold the position overnight. If the interest rate for EUR is higher than USD, you earn a positive swap. Scenario 2: Negative Swap (Paid Interest) You sell GBP/JPY and hold the position overnight. If the interest rate for GBP is lower than JPY, you pay a negative swap. Types of Swaps in Forex 1. Long Swap Applicable when holding a buy position overnight. Reflects the interest rate differential between the currencies. 2. Short Swap Applicable when holding a sell position overnight. Calculated based on the reverse interest rate differential. Factors Affecting Swap Rates Central Bank Policies : Changes in interest rates set by central banks directly affect swap rates. Market Conditions : Volatility and liquidity influence how brokers calculate swaps. Currency Pair : Exotic pairs often have higher swap rates due to greater volatility and interest rate differentials. How to Avoid or Minimize Swap Costs Use Swap-Free Accounts Many brokers offer Islamic accounts (swap-free accounts) for traders who do not want to incur swap charges due to religious beliefs. Close Trades Before Rollover Avoid holding positions overnight to eliminate swap fees. Choose Favorable Currency Pairs Trade pairs with a positive interest rate differential to earn swap credits. Plan Around Wednesday Swaps On Wednesdays, brokers often triple the swap fee to account for the weekend rollover. Advantages and Disadvantages of Swaps Advantages Earn Extra Income : Positive swaps add to profits when trading currency pairs with favorable interest rate differentials. Reflects Economic Fundamentals : Swap rates provide insights into the strength of different currencies. Disadvantages Added Costs : Negative swaps increase trading expenses, particularly for long-term positions. Complexity : Understanding and calculating swaps can be confusing for beginners. FAQs About Forex Swaps 1. What is a swap-free account? A swap-free account eliminates overnight interest charges, suitable for traders with religious restrictions or those avoiding extra costs. 2. When are swap fees applied? Swaps are applied at the end of each trading day, typically at 5 PM New York time . 3. Can swaps affect profitability? Yes, especially for long-term positions. Positive swaps can boost profits, while negative swaps can reduce earnings. 4. Are swaps the same for all brokers? No, swap rates vary between brokers based on their markup policies. 5. Do all currency pairs have swaps? Yes, but the rate varies depending on the currency pair and its interest rate differential. Conclusion Swaps play a vital role in Forex trading, influencing costs and profitability. By understanding how swaps work and adopting strategies to manage them, traders can minimize their impact on trading performance.

This milestone reflects the growing strength and competitiveness of the Bitcoin network as more miners participate. The next difficulty adjustment, projected in about 13 days, is expected to slightly decrease by 0.08% to 108.44 T . What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? Mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is for miners to validate transactions and add new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain. Adjusted approximately every two weeks (or 2,016 blocks), it ensures that blocks are mined at a consistent interval of roughly 10 minutes. Key Metrics Current Difficulty : 108.52 T (record high). Adjustment Cycle : Occurs every 2,016 blocks. Next Adjustment : Estimated at 108.44 T (-0.08%). Factors Behind the Record Difficulty 1. Increased Hashrate The mining difficulty adjustment corresponds to the Bitcoin network’s total computing power, or hashrate . A higher hashrate indicates: More miners joining the network. Increased competition for block rewards. 2. Network Security Higher difficulty enhances the security of the Bitcoin network , making it more resilient to attacks. 3. Price Incentives With Bitcoin trading above $100,000, the high profitability has attracted more miners, pushing up difficulty levels. Impact on Bitcoin Mining 1. Rising Costs for Miners Increased difficulty means miners must deploy more computational power, leading to: Higher energy consumption. Greater operational costs. 2. Reduced Profit Margins Smaller or less efficient mining operations may struggle to stay profitable as competition intensifies. 3. Benefits for the Network Despite the challenges for miners, higher difficulty reinforces Bitcoin’s decentralization and security, benefiting the overall ecosystem. What Happens at the Next Adjustment? The next difficulty adjustment is expected to slightly decrease to 108.44 T , a marginal 0.08% drop . This reflects the dynamic nature of Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustments, balancing network activity with block production times. Historical Context of Mining Difficulty Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has steadily increased over the years, reflecting: Advances in mining technology. Growth in the number of miners. Rising interest in Bitcoin as a store of value. Date Difficulty Key Milestone 2020 16.55 T Pre-halving low. 2021 25.05 T Post-halving surge. December 2024 108.52 T New record high. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Future? 1. Enhanced Network Resilience Higher mining difficulty strengthens the network against potential attacks, ensuring greater security and decentralization. 2. Miner Consolidation As difficulty increases, smaller mining operations may exit the market, consolidating the network among larger, more efficient players. 3. Long-Term Sustainability While mining becomes more competitive, the consistent block production interval ensures Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability and predictability. Conclusion Bitcoin’s record-breaking mining difficulty of 108.52 T underscores the network’s growth and resilience. While miners face increased operational challenges, the milestone reflects Bitcoin’s expanding adoption and the robust security of its blockchain. With the next adjustment expected to bring a slight decline to 108.44 T , the network’s dynamism remains a testament to its self-regulating design. As Bitcoin continues to scale new heights, its underlying infrastructure grows stronger, reinforcing its role as the leading cryptocurrency.

Platforms like PayPal and Cash App have made crypto more accessible to the average consumer. 3. Regulatory Optimism Pro-crypto policies, particularly under the administration of President-elect Donald Trump, have bolstered market confidence. The potential for clearer and more favorable crypto regulations could further enhance adoption.

Furthermore, the President-Elect has given investors much to look forward to – at least in terms of promises and rhetoric. Specifically, he pledged to make the U.S. the digital assets capital of the world, create a strategic BTC reserve , and nominated a number of blockchain-friendly individuals for critical government and regulatory positions, including for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair . Is this the most bullish 2025 BTC price target? Under such circumstances, there has been no shortage of bullish price targets with $250,000 appearing a popular choice for 2025 as it is, at press time, the forecast provided by legendary Wall Street analysts like Tom Lee and consistent – if unreliable – BTC bulls like Robert Kiyosaki . Still, by December 13, another and unprecedented optimistic prediction appeared when Perianne Boring, the Founder and CEO of The Digital Chamber, estimated Bitcoin could rise above $800,000 before the end of next year, per the stock-flow model. Should BTC climb to such a price, it would boast a market capitalization of approximately $15 trillion – $13 trillion above the late 2024 valuation – and would be less than $3 trillion from overtaking the biggest asset in the world, gold . On the other hand, for Bitcoin to truly become bigger than gold, the precious metal would either have to decline from its press time prices, or the cryptocurrency would have to rise another $100,000 to the price of approximately $900,000. Finally, it is worth pointing out that, shortly before outlining the price target, Boring reflected on the hoped-for regulatory clarity under Donald Trump as a major driver of cryptocurrency investments and industry. Indeed, she described the situation under the Biden administration – believed by many to be marked and marred by a turf war between the SEC and the CFTC over digital assets – as hostile to blockchain companies and developers. $800,000 Bitcoin price target ambitious, but not out of reach Despite the bullishness, both $250,000 and $800,000 remain highly ambitious targets. Since the start of 2024 – an indubitably strong year for the cryptocurrency market – Bitcoin rocketed 146% to its press-time price of $104,172. BTC YTD price chart. Source: Finbold For comparison, a rally from the December 16 price to $250,000 would require a 139% surge and 667.98% for a rise to $800,000. Still, considering the magnitude of the rally since November 5, the fact that the forecasts are optimistic does not indicate they are implausible.

Bitcoin Season : Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin. Index Range : Scores range from 1 to 100 , with daily updates reflecting market changes. Current Market Status: Altcoin Season At a score of 65 , the index indicates that altcoins are outpacing Bitcoin in performance, a trend that has sparked increased interest in the broader cryptocurrency market. Why is the Market in Altcoin Season? Increased Investor Diversification Traders are seeking opportunities beyond Bitcoin, allocating funds to high-performing altcoins. Altcoin Innovation Emerging blockchain projects and DeFi platforms are driving innovation and attracting capital. Bitcoin’s Slower Momentum Bitcoin’s relative stability compared to its 2021 bull runs has shifted attention to more volatile altcoins. How the Index is Calculated CoinMarketCap calculates the Altcoin Season Index by analyzing the top 100 cryptocurrencies’ performance over a 90-day period, excluding: Stablecoins : Tokens like USDT or USDC that maintain a fixed value. Wrapped Tokens : Assets like WBTC, pegged to other cryptocurrencies. By excluding these assets, the index offers a clearer picture of the performance dynamics among major cryptocurrencies. Implications of Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index provides valuable insights into market sentiment and trading opportunities: 1.

This score suggests: Strong Altcoin Market : The majority of altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin but with room for further gains. Balanced Opportunities : While Bitcoin remains a stable choice, altcoins are offering greater short-term returns. Key Takeaways for Traders 1.

The index, up three points from the previous day, signals heightened optimism among investors as market momentum and trading volumes improve. With a range from 0 (Extreme Fear) to 100 (Extreme Greed) , the index captures the prevailing sentiment in the crypto market, offering valuable insights into potential investor behavior. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative , measures market sentiment by analyzing six key factors: Factor Weight What It Reflects Volatility 25% Measures price fluctuations and fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Assesses trading activity to gauge confidence. Social Media 15% Tracks mentions, engagement, and sentiment on platforms. Surveys 15% Collects opinions from investors to evaluate sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Indicates Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market. Google Trends 10% Monitors search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. The resulting score serves as a sentiment barometer, guiding investors on market conditions. Why is the Index in the “Extreme Greed” Zone? 1. Rising Market Momentum and Volume The recent surge in trading activity and price movements, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum, has strengthened investor confidence, pushing the index higher. 2. Improved Sentiment on Social Media Increased mentions of bullish terms and positive engagement across platforms like Twitter and Reddit have contributed to the index’s rise. 3. Bitcoin’s Stability and Dominance While Bitcoin remains stable above critical support levels, its dominance over altcoins has provided a sense of security for investors, further fueling optimism.

Neutral 50 Balanced sentiment; no clear direction. Greed 51–74 Bullish sentiment; market showing confidence. Extreme Greed 75–100 High optimism; potential for overvaluation. Currently, the index’s 83 score indicates heightened greed, suggesting potential short-term market risks despite the bullish sentiment. What Does “Extreme Greed” Mean for Investors? While a high Fear & Greed Index signals positive sentiment, it also raises cautionary flags: 1. Potential Overvaluation Markets in “Extreme Greed” territory are often overbought, increasing the likelihood of corrections. 2. FOMO Among Investors Fear of missing out (FOMO) can drive irrational decision-making, leading to price spikes that may not be sustainable. 3. Short-Term vs. Long-Term Outlook While the index reflects short-term enthusiasm, investors should remain aware of long-term fundamentals to avoid hasty decisions. How to Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The index serves as a helpful tool for assessing market sentiment and planning investment strategies: For Cautious Investors Use high scores (Extreme Greed) as a signal to consider taking profits or diversifying holdings. For Opportunistic Buyers Low scores (Extreme Fear) may present buying opportunities , as they indicate market undervaluation. As a Complementary Tool Combine the index with technical and fundamental analysis for a comprehensive market view. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s climb to 83 highlights a surge in investor confidence, fueled by strong market momentum and improved sentiment. However, the current “Extreme Greed” zone serves as a reminder for investors to proceed cautiously and consider potential market corrections.

While it wasn’t completely smooth sailing, with the leading digital asset hitting several speed bumps on its way to $100,000, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has now surpassed that mark, and was trading at approximately $104,807 by press time on December 16. Over the last week, BTC has seen prices rise by 6.52% — bolstering monthly returns to 14.78% and year-to-date (YTD) gains up to 146.81%. BTC price weekly chart. Source: Finbold There are a lot of favorable tailwinds at play as we draw closer to the end of the year. A favorable regulatory environment is expected going forward, and the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve would go a long way in cementing the cryptocurrency’s role as an authentic store of value. Investor activity is also showing signs of a strong, robust uptrend — with volume having experienced a sustained rise since the beginning of November. While the actions of retail investors should never be underestimated, it’s the undertakings of large market participants — hedge funds, institutional investors, and banks, that have a much more pronounced effect on price action. This point is increasingly relevant as Bitcoin continues to see accelerated institutional adoption and mainstream appeal. Now, one cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out that the number of whales — accounts in this case holding more than 100 BTC, has skyrocketed since early November. Thousands of BTC whales have entered the market It cannot conclusively be stated that these were investments made by institutions — however, seeing as how Bitcoin prices have ranged from approximately $67,000 at the beginning of the rally to $104,807 at press time, buying 100 BTC would have required between $6,700,000 and $10,480,700. And transactions of this caliber have indeed skyrocketed — the number of addresses holding more than 100 BTC has increased from roughly 16,400 at the beginning of the rally to approximately 17,600, as explained by cryptocurrency expert and on-chain analyst Ali Martinez in a December 15 X post . Chart detailing the number of BTC whales. Source: Ali Martinez on X Beyond the scale of these addresses, how numerous they’ve become is also notable — suggesting that this is, after all, an influx of either institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals entering the market Readers should note, that while there is no set definition of a ‘whale’ in the cryptocurrency market, the term is generally used to refer to addresses holding more than 1,000 BTC — whereas Martinez used a significantly lower cutoff point of 100 BTC. However, the influx still constitutes a strong bullish signal — as analysts are eyeing price targets as high as $150,000 or $250,000 for 2025, this degree of optimism only serves to bolster the case that BTC is set for another year of stellar gains.

As the king of the cryptocurrencies starts to run out of steam, the altcoins are beginning to feel the effects of this new wind change. What’s next for Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SUI), and Sui ($SUI)? It really does look like gravity is starting to have its effect on the price of Bitcoin. Most indicators are now showing a very overbought condition, and therefore it is likely that a correction could be about to happen. So what about the altcoins when/if this takes place? Market wisdom so far in this bull market is that whenever $BTC drops in price, the altcoins do the same, but at a more accelerated pace. Could things be different this time? There is the possibility that as Bitcoin potentially tracks down and sideways for a time, the altcoins could take the opportunity for a bit of an altseason surge. Bitcoin Dominance breakdown about to be confirmed? Source: TradingView The Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) shows a real tussle right now. Dominance rose above the top trendline of the wedge at one point, then fell all the way through the wedge, and is now creeping back up to perhaps test the bottom trendline. If a strong rejection takes place, that would be the signal perhaps for altcoins to have some fun. $ETH bulls need to hold $3,900 Source: TradingView The $ETH price is at a very important juncture. If the price can hold above what is now extremely strong support at $3,900, there is the possibility that this could be the new base support for the rest of this bull market. In the short term price action, the price may well go lower, but holding the support at the weekly close is the aim. Last week’s hammer candle with a huge wick to the downside is a sign that there may well be plenty of upside to come. This week’s price action could be critical. $SOL heading back to very strong $202 support level Source: TradingView The $SOL weekly chart looks fairly straightforward. The price is within a bull flag, although it looks as though the price may well revisit the very strong horizontal support at $202 before making the next upward bid. This could result in $SOL finally breaking through the top of the bull flag and heading much higher. $SUI rejected at 2.618 Fibonacci Source: TradingView The $SUI price really took off in early November, once the cup and handle pattern was confirmed. Only now, at the 2.618 Fibonacci for the entire $SUI price action, has it been rejected. Looking at the Fibonacci levels just for this upward move, it can be seen that $3.97 and $3.70 are decent possibilities as targets for this reversal. Looking at the worst case scenario, If the price falls below $2.98, this could signal the end of the upward trend. Otherwise, this is likely just a healthy correction.

After hitting a new high above $106,000 recently, Bitcoin continues to show strength, signaling the possibility of further growth into the new year. What To Expect In 2025 As we move into 2025, the cryptocurrency market shows strong signs of a continued bull run. Q4 is usually a good time for Bitcoin, with a typical rally at the year’s end. However, some experts believe the “Santa Claus rally” may not be as significant for those focused on global trends and liquidity. In the past, Bitcoin has rallied into December, followed by a pullback in January. These dips are often short-lived, and Bitcoin has continued to rise after. Many believe this pattern may repeat in 2025, with a possible dip in January before another rally in Q1 and Q2. On the other hand, some analysts even expect the market to slow down by summer, but it remains uncertain. A pullback in early 2025 could test support levels around $88,000 or $80,000, but overall, the bullish sentiment remains strong. Bitcoin Price Eying For $120K Bitcoin’s recent price surge beyond $106,000 has attracted both retail and institutional investors. With expectations of Bitcoin reaching new highs in the coming months, the end-of-year rally could continue into Q1 2025, as we’ve seen in the past. Meanwhile, Bitcoin could rise to $114,000 or even $120,000, according to analysts using Fibonacci levels for price predictions. Altcoin Market To Thrive The altcoin market is also showing strong signs of growth, with the total market cap already surpassing $1.5 trillion its all-time high from 2021. This signals a positive outlook for altcoins heading into 2025. Ethereum, in particular, is poised for a breakout, especially with Ethereum ETFs that could drive institutional interest. Out of the top 50 altcoins, 31 have already outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. However, the Altcoin Season Index is currently at 63, indicating that the Altcoin season hasn’t fully started yet. As Bitcoin continues its rally, altcoins are expected to follow suit, potentially leading to major gains in the altcoin space.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 12:16:06

He posted the headline along with a sarcastic caption of “probably nothing…” accompanied by a laughing emoji. The crypto industry figurehead linked the post to a previous one he made in early December with the same caption. The post showed a similar move that happened in Russia , when a lawmaker suggested the creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve in light of current geopolitical issues. CZ’s post seemingly hints at a growing global trend, where people are starting to urge their governments to form Bitcoin reserves, ultimately following in America’s footsteps. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1868118429749899762?s=61&t=Goh7F7TZjoAVMq_tusVLpw Many X users were quick to comment under CZ’s post, expressing their certainty that Bitcoin domination was evidently happening across the globe after President-elect Donald Trump confirmed his plans to build a Bitcoin reserve. “Imagine the space race equivalent when countries start buying BTC as a reserve currency,” wrote @Cryptoking on X. “We love to see progress in the space!” wrote @FEGtoken in another comment. You might also like: Bitcoin hits $106K, an all-time high fueled by Donald Trump’s intention to do “great with crypto” On Dec. 11, a Japanese lawmaker — ironically named Satoshi Hamada — submitted questions for the government, asking whether they would consider forming a national Bitcoin reserve. Hamada directly referred to the U.S. government’s efforts to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the country, claiming that such a move could add a “tremendous amount of power” to the markets. “Should Japan also introduce a system to convert part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin?” asked Hamada in his translated submission . As reported by crypto.news earlier this month, Anton Tkachev, state deputy of Duma, Russia urged the government to consider creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve in the country. In Tkachev’s proposal, he stated that Bitcoin would not only serve as a currency but also as an alternative asset for storing national funds. He argued that Bitcoin was not impacted by inflation nor cross-border sanctions, unlike the traditional currencies. Brazil’s Congress joined the race early on in Nov. 26, when Brazilian legislators in the Chamber of Deputies proposed a Bitcoin bill that would limit Brazil’s reserves to approximately $18.5 billion worth of Bitcoin. Regulators also recommended allocating 5% of the nation’s $370 billion treasury to the Bitcoin strategic reserve. Since the start of his presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to create a national Bitcoin reserve. After his presidential win, Senator Cynthia Lummis reaffirmed Trump’s plans to create a strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the U.S. A number of states across America have also been inching towards establishing Bitcoin reserve bills, including Texas, Alabama and Pennsylvania among others. The Canadian city of Vancouver also recently jumped on the wagon with councilors voting in favor of Mayor Ken Sim’s “Bitcoin-friendly” motion, which included converting a portion of Vancouver’s current financial reserve.

As Trump and his family’s DeFi project World Liberty Financial continues to grow, new altcoin purchases have also arrived. World Liberty Financial, which is closely followed by cryptocurrency investors, bought altcoins called Ethena (ENA) and ONDO. It recently expanded its project portfolio, focusing on purchasing Chainlink (LINK) and AAVE, and added ENA and ONDO. According to Lookonchain's post, the project purchased $500,000 worth of ENA and $250,000 worth of ONDO, while purchasing a total of $45 million worth of altcoins in the 15 days since November 30.

It remains to be seen whether the major exchange will still proceed with its PNUT listing after Longo’s warning to Binance. Binance listed the Peanut the Squirrel meme coin on its platform last month on Nov. 11 at 10:00 UTC. Shortly after, PNUT witnessed a “god candle” chart topping moment as the Binance listing raised its price to as high as 478%. Following the listing, Longo’s lawyers asked Binance to stop using the infringing photograph owned by Longo as well as the trademarked Peanut the Squirrel on the exchange platform. “You are hereby notified that its unlawful copying of the PNUT Image in the advertisement, distribution, and sale of cryptocurrency infringes upon our client’s exclusive copyrights,” wrote Sara M. Dorchak in a letter addressed to Sandra Epp Ryan, the Attorney of Record for Binance Holdings Limited. In the letter, Dorchak explained that Longo’s team submitted an application for registration of the copyrighted IP to the United States Copyright office. Therefore, when it is officially registered, the use of Peanut’s image on the Binance platform will fall under violation of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.

Therefore, Longo launched his own token that he named JUSTICE (For Pnut and Fred) as a way to assert control over his narrative and denounce the PNUT community. Mark Longo saved Peanut from a car accident and shared their experiences on an Instagram account dedicated to Peanut and a raccoon named Fred. However, the New York City Department of Environmental Conservation later seized the animals from Longo’s residence following anonymous complaints.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

This move could set the stage for global expansion, raising questions about which cryptocurrencies might follow. Speculation surrounds Solana and XRP, with experts suggesting they could debut ETFs by 2025. However, Rollblock , a rising star in GambleFi, might outpace both altcoins in growth. Rollblock’s unique casino games and innovation could redefine expectations in the competitive crypto market. Solana ETFs Expected To Face Challenges From Current SEC Leaders Solana witnessed an all-time high of $263 in Q4 and is certainly demonstrating its rise in the blockchain space. This surge reflects Solana’s ability to draw in users with low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Decentralized applications like pump.fun have benefited from these features. However, pump.fun’s recent ban in the UK and potential regulations raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of Solana’s innovations. Also, the short-term prospects for Solana ETFs face challenges. Reports suggest the SEC plans to reject two of five pending Solana ETF applications under its current leadership. This decision dampens immediate investor enthusiasm. However, optimism is rising as Paul Atkins, a known crypto advocate, prepares to take over as SEC Chair in January. Appointed by President-elect Trump, Atkins is expected to support proactive crypto policies. Several industry experts think his leadership may boost Solana ETF approvals, bringing it closer to Ethereum and other major cryptos. XRP’s Price Keeps Up Impressive Momentum XRP (XRP) rallied to $2.84, a peak price last seen in early 2018. However, the price faced strong resistance and retraced. Currently, Ripple is consolidating around $2.50 after buyers quickly purchased the dip to $2.25. This particular rally pushed XRP’s market cap to $142 billion, well above Solana, BNB and Tether. This made XRP the third biggest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Ripple is planning to launch its RLUSD stablecoin following extensive testing. This development places Ripple in a strong position within the stablecoin market. Analysts believe this innovation could fuel new rallies, potentially pushing XRP above $3 before the year ends. Why Rollblock’s GambleFi Platform is a Game-Changer in Online Gambling Missing the XRP and XLM boom may have been unavoidable for some investors. Fortunately, Rollblock offers a new chance to buy a promising token at a low price and achieve substantial gains soon. The Rollblock presale is currently in stage 9, with each token priced at $0.0415. Early investors have already benefited from a 310% increase since the initial coin offering (ICO) began. Rollblock’s optimistic predictions stem from its innovative features and growth potential. The project stands out in the online gambling industry with its unique GambleFi platform. This platform blends a traditional casino’s experience with the benefits of cryptocurrency investing. Players can access thousands of casino games and earn Rollblock tokens weekly through a revenue-sharing system. RBLK token holders also enjoy staking opportunities with up to 30% annual percentage yield (APY). This feature allows users to earn passive income while engaging in enjoyable gaming activities. The presale is nearing stage 10, where the token price will rise to $0.047. Investors have a limited window to purchase Rollblock tokens at the current low price. Entering the market early is the key to maximizing returns from promising presales like Rollblock. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Veteran trader Peter Brandt announced the milestone on X, stating that it now takes 40 ounces of gold to purchase one Bitcoin. The ratio surged as Bitcoin’s price soared past $106,000 , while spot gold traded around $2,650 per ounce. The Bitcoin-to-gold ratio, a key metric in the crypto market, measures Bitcoin’s purchasing power in terms of gold. This historic peak underscores Bitcoin’s growing dominance as an alternative store of value. Brandt, a prominent voice in the trading community, expressed confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. “Next stop will be 89 to 1,” he predicted, suggesting that Bitcoin could command the equivalent of 89 ounces of gold in the future. Bitcoin Growing Over Gold This milestone aligns with a broader narrative championed by cryptocurrency advocates who see Bitcoin as the successor to gold’s $15 trillion market. Cathie Wood, founder of ARK Invest and a noted Bitcoin proponent, reiterated this sentiment earlier in December. Wood emphasized Bitcoin’s potential for exponential growth, especially given the significant gap in market capitalization between the two assets. Currently valued at $2.1 trillion, Bitcoin still trails gold’s market by a wide margin. However, its recent breakthroughs, including surpassing the $100,000 mark on December 5, have fueled optimism. Even U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged Bitcoin’s role as “digital gold,” further validating its status as a viable asset class. Rising Challenges for Bitcoin Miners While Bitcoin celebrates its triumphs in market valuation, its growing mining difficulty poses challenges for the network. As of December 15, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hit a record high of over 105 trillion, according to CoinWarz data. This metric, which adjusts approximately every two weeks, reflects the increasing computational power required to secure the blockchain. With the next adjustment scheduled for January 1, 2025, mining operations are under pressure to maintain efficiency amidst intensifying competition. However, this rising difficulty also strengthens Bitcoin’s network security, reinforcing its position as a robust and reliable digital asset.

Meanwhile, a hardware wallet user reported the devastating loss of $2.5 million in Bitcoin and NFTs due to a phishing scam dating back several years. Drake's X Account Hacked to Promote Fraudulent Solana Meme Coin ”Anita” Canadian music icon Drake became the latest high-profile victim of a social media hack when his X account was compromised on Saturday night. The hacker used the account to promote a fraudulent Solana-based meme coin dubbed ”$ANITA,” a token reportedly inspired by Drake's cartoon ”alter ego,” Anita Max Wynn. Drake, born Aubrey Drake Graham, has long been known for his love of gambling, a theme reflected in his cartoon persona, Anita Max Wynn. The name, a playful nod to the phrase “I need a max win,” resonates with the gambling community and fits seamlessly with Drake’s partnership with Stake, a popular crypto betting platform. Exploiting this association, the hackers reposted and quoted a now-deleted X account to promote the coin as an official collaboration between Drake and Stake. The fraudulent ”$ANITA” token also capitalized on Drake’s current ”Anita Max Wynn” tour, which marks his return to Australia and New Zealand after a seven-year hiatus. By tying the token to Drake’s brand and tour, the hackers created a veneer of credibility, enticing unsuspecting fans and crypto traders to buy into the scam. The promotion to Drake’s 39 million followers resulted in a swift surge in activity around ”$ANITA.” According to DexScreener data , the meme coin saw an astonishing $5 million in trading volume before traders began to realize the project was fraudulent. The price of the token collapsed as the scam unraveled, leaving many buyers at a loss. The posts were later removed from Drake’s account, and neither Drake nor his representatives have issued a public statement about the incident at the time of writing. Drake’s hacked account is part of a troubling trend of social media exploits targeting influential figures and organizations to push fraudulent crypto schemes. Just a week earlier, the Cardano Foundation’s X account was similarly hacked and used to promote a meme coin scam. However, that scam managed to generate only a fraction of the trading volume—just 10% of the ”$ANITA” coin’s total. Other recent victims include chart-topping musicians Cardi B and Doja Cat, as well as legendary rock band Metallica. These incidents have exposed the vulnerabilities in X's security protocols and raised concerns about the platform’s ability to safeguard accounts with massive followings. The hack sheds some light on the risks of unregulated and hype-driven cryptocurrency projects, particularly meme coins , which often lack intrinsic value and are fueled by speculative trading. It also demonstrates the ease with which bad actors can exploit the trust and influence of celebrities to deceive the public. For Drake, the incident may prompt a reassessment of security measures for his social media accounts. For X, the platform faces mounting pressure to bolster its defenses and provide enhanced security tools for high-profile accounts. Crypto Community's Reaction The crypto community and Drake’s fans have expressed mixed emotions about the incident. Some traders voiced frustration over losing money to the fraudulent token, while others saw it as a cautionary tale about the risks of investing in projects promoted through unofficial or suspicious channels. As celebrity-endorsed scams become more prevalent, this latest incident with Drake’s X account reiterates the urgent need for better education around cryptocurrency scams and stronger security measures on social media platforms. While the fraudulent ”$ANITA” meme coin may have been short-lived, its impact will serve as a warning to both fans and the broader crypto community about the dangers of blindly trusting promotional posts—even from trusted public figures. Crypto Investor Loses $2.5 Million in Phishing Scam, Highlighting Ongoing Security Risks In other security news, the cryptocurrency community was dealt another stark reminder of the risks lurking in the digital asset space as a hardware wallet user, identified as “Anchor Drops” on X, reported losing $2.5 million in Bitcoin (BTC) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) due to a phishing attack. On Dec. 13, Anchor Drops revealed on X that their Ledger Nano S hardware wallet had been compromised, resulting in the loss of 10 BTC, worth approximately $1 million at current market prices, alongside $1.5 million worth of NFTs. The incident was traced back to a phishing attack that reportedly occurred years ago but only recently came to light. Blockchain security analysts and Ledger, the wallet’s manufacturer, have since analyzed the breach and confirmed its connection to a malicious transaction from February 2022. Ledger, a leading manufacturer of hardware wallets, pointed to a phishing transaction tagged “Fake_Phishing5443” on Etherscan as the likely source of the hack. According to blockchain analyst KDean, Anchor Drops unknowingly signed a phishing transaction nearly three years ago, granting token approval to a malicious actor. The phishing transaction allowed the attacker to quietly monitor the wallet for years before eventually draining it. This ”dormant hack” strategy has become increasingly common among cybercriminals, allowing them to avoid detection until the right moment to strike. Hakan Unal, a senior scientist at blockchain security platform Cyvers, explained, “Blockchain evidence shows they signed a phishing transaction nearly three years ago, unknowingly granting approval to a malicious actor. The hacker remained dormant for years before eventually draining the wallet.” Unal emphasized that the incident had no connection to Ledger’s hardware or software, adding that users should regularly review token approvals to safeguard their assets. While the NFT theft was tied to Ethereum transactions, the method used to drain the victim’s Bitcoin holdings remains unclear. Tony Ke, lead security researcher at blockchain firm Fuzzland, noted, “For the NFT, KDean’s comment can explain everything. But I don’t understand how the BTC is stolen.” Experts suggest that if the phishing attack also compromised the user’s recovery phrase, it could have granted the attacker access to the wallet across all supported blockchains, including Bitcoin. “If the phishing attempt also captured the user’s recovery phrase, the attacker could gain access to the wallet across all supported chains,” Unal explained. Ledger echoed this assessment, indicating that user error might have played a role in the Bitcoin loss as well. The incident highlights several important lessons for crypto users: Understand Token Approvals: Phishing scams often exploit token approvals, granting malicious actors access to wallet funds. Regularly reviewing and revoking unnecessary approvals can help prevent such attacks. Secure Recovery Phrases: A compromised recovery phrase is akin to handing over the keys to a safe. Users should store their recovery phrases offline and away from potential phishing attempts. Be Cautious with On-Chain Interactions: Signing transactions without fully understanding their implications can have catastrophic consequences. As Ledger and other security experts stress, using a hardware wallet is only part of the equation; users must remain vigilant and informed about every interaction. An Ongoing Problem in Crypto Security The phishing attack on Anchor Drops adds to a growing list of high-profile crypto scams, with criminals becoming increasingly sophisticated in targeting unsuspecting users. According to blockchain security firms, phishing remains one of the most effective tools for attackers, particularly in the crypto space, where transactions are irreversible, and assets are self-custodied. As decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs gain mainstream traction, the stakes for protecting digital assets have never been higher. While hardware wallets like Ledger are designed to provide enhanced security, incidents like this reveal that user education and awareness are just as crucial as the technology itself. In light of the incident, Ledger has reiterated its commitment to user education and security. The company encourages users to adopt best practices, such as: Regularly reviewing token approvals and revoking unnecessary ones. Storing recovery phrases securely and offline. Verifying all on-chain interactions before signing transactions. “While using hardware wallets is crucial in terms of security enhancement, it’s equally important to understand every interaction with the wallet and make informed decisions,” said Fuzzland’s Ke. The $2.5 million loss suffered by Anchor Drops serves as a harsh reminder of the risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market. Despite the sophistication of hardware wallets like Ledger, no solution is foolproof without user vigilance. As the crypto space continues to evolve, staying informed and cautious will be key to avoiding similar tragedies. For the broader crypto community, this incident underscores the importance of cybersecurity practices and regular audits of on-chain permissions, particularly during periods of heightened market activity.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|WALLET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-16 13:31:50

Its upswing also follows anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) upcoming interest rate changes, possibly a 25-basis-point cut during the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on December 18. Still, if it’s the last cut for a while (as anticipated), Bitcoin’s price might plummet while the US dollar and treasury yields rise. Luckily, the meme coin project Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) offers trading insights that safeguard against market volatility. 97.1% Chance of Fed Slashing Interest Rates CME Group’s FedWatch Tool highlights that the Fed is 97.1% likely to drop US interest rates at the upcoming FMOC meeting. The Federal Reserve is highly anticipated to reduce rates between 4.25% and 4.50% in two days time. Lower interest rates typically lead to more market liquidity, encouraging investments in riskier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Also signaling prosperous times for crypto is the rate cuts weakening the US dollar, making crypto cheaper when acquired in USD. However, the Fed is expected to implement a ‘hawkish rate cut,’ which suggests less easing next year, possibly harming Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Raises $25M+ on Presale In light of economic shifts, Wall Street Pepe equips investors with the tools to make informed decisions amidst market volatility. The Pepe-inspired meme coin offers token holders exclusive crypto trading insights. Its ultimate aim is to prevent market manipulation by bringing together crypto investors to give the whales and insiders a run for their money. Crypto traders have already noticed its potential, as evidenced by $WEPE garnering over $25M on presale. Exploiting its trading insights currently costs just $0.0003644 per $WEPE. Notably, the coin’s price increases every time it hits a milestone, pointing to now being a good time to buy. $WEPE Equips Crypto Investors for Success Although Bitcoin is still hitting ATH after ATH, investors must remain cautious and consider long-term factors instead of just short ones for financial stability and sustainability. As Americans brace for financial change, tools like $WEPE become increasingly necessary. Its trading insights give crypto investors leverage against unpredictable market movements. However, this isn’t financial advice.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others.

According to authorities, Hussein impersonated an Uber driver in order to steal cryptocurrency from unsuspecting passengers by accessing their phones. Elaborate Crypto Theft Scheme Hussein reportedly worked outside Scottsdale’s W Hotel, targeting victims waiting for a ride. The police say he called the passengers by name to make them think that he was their Uber driver. Once the victims were in his car, Hussein allegedly borrowed their phones, under the guise of troubleshooting the Uber app or fixing a device issue. Police allege during this time, he accessed the victims’ Coinbase accounts, transferring funds to a cold storage wallet. Court records reflect that Hussein executed this scheme on at least two occasions, in March and then again in October. Authorities would not say how Hussein obtained names of the victims but described his actions as premeditated and calculated. Threats and Intimidation One of the victims reportedly became suspicious of Hussein’s actions and demanded their phone back. In response, Hussein is alleged to have threatened the victim, warning them to “chill or something bad would happen.” This act of intimidation further demonstrates the length he allegedly went to execute his thefts. Arrest and Legal Actions On Dec. 11, Scottsdale detectives and Secret Service agents arrested Hussein. He has been charged with theft, fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors had secured a $200,000 cash bond and requested Hussein be electronically monitored if he posts bail. He has been barred from access to the internet and international trips due to the risk of evidence tampering and flight. Court documents showed trips he made to Ethiopia as recently as this year sparked concerns about his potential to flee the country. A trial date is set for Dec. 18. Offline Crypto Crimes Now on the Rise The incident has been part of an alarming increase in crypto crimes happening offline. According to GitHub , there were 19 cases of in-person cryptocurrency theft in 2024, up from 17 in 2023. These incidents are very innovative, targeting crypto holders directly. Another such incident occurred earlier this month when thieves in Melbourne, Australia, stole a Bitcoin ATM from a shopping center. It was later found pried open and set on fire.

Notably, the rally comes due to a flurry of positive market trends surrounding the asset, which has boosted the traders’ sentiment. Besides, top market experts predict further LINK rally ahead, potentially setting the target to $60. Chainlink Price Rally Amid Positive Market Trends The surge of over 5% in Chainlink price comes amid a flurry of developments related to the project. Notably, the recent developments appeared to have boosted the market sentiments, with top experts anticipating more gains ahead for the crypto. Notably, the recent surge of over 22% in Grayscale Chainlink Trust (GLNK) price also indicates strong market confidence towards the digital asset. Over the last 30 days, the investment instrument has soared more than 190%, bolstering market sentiment. Meanwhile, this LINK price rally comes after the network’s Oracle network was integrated into Coinbase’s project Diamond . This integration announcement between Coinbase and the project has sparked significant discussions in the market as the top crypto exchange tapped LINK’s infrastructure to boost the Tokenized Asset ecosystem. On the other hand, Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial (WLF) has made a significant investment in LINK. According to recent updates, WLF has spent $1 million to purchase 41,335 LINK recently, which showcased the project’s confidence in the project. In addition, with pro-crypto regulatory environment anticipation soaring with Donald Trump’s election win, this latest investment by the Trump-backed project has fueled discussions. LINK Rally To $60 Imminent? The latest LINK price chart showed that the crypto has surged 5.11% and exchanged hands at $29.90. Notably, the crypto has soared past the $30 mark recently, marking its highest level since 2021. Over the last 24 hours, LINK has touched a high of $30.72, while recording monthly gains of 105%. Furthermore, CoinGlass data showed that Chainlink Futures Open Interest rose nearly 6%. Amid this, top crypto market expert Ali Martinez said that if LINK holds above the $30.4 mark, it could potentially target $34 next. Considering that, the investors are keeping a close track of LINK’s performance while anticipating a rally ahead. Besides, a recent LINK price prediction also showed that the crypto is likely to hit $35.95 by January 2025. Source: Ali Martinez, X On the other hand, another popular market analyst Alan Santana also shared a bullish forecast for LINK. In a recent analysis, the expert said that Chainlink price is poised to hit $61 in the coming days. However, he has highlighted certain conditions for LINK to hit the bullish target. For context, Santana noted that LINK has an “immediate resistance” of $32 and $35, which must be crossed. The next levels for the crypto stands at $47 and $53. If it soar past the $53 mark, the next target for the crypto will be at $61. Furthermore, he even predicted that if the bullish momentum holds, it could potentially rally to $130 in 2025.

Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) price hit $2.96 across major crypto exchanges to record a new all-time. The project, which offers an AI agent Launchpad on layer-2 platform Base, spiked as Bitcoin ( BTC ) smashed past $106,000. However, its gains came as the market continued to pay attention to AI-powered autonomous software. AI agents are the new buzz since Terminal of Truths hit millionaire status as the first agentic account on X, with its posts about Goateus Maximus ( GOAT ) sending the meme coin parabolic.

Massive and viral interaction with protocols, apps and other agents, has related tokens skyrocketing. The Virtuals Protocol project is a co-ownership layer for AI agents. Launchpad users can create AI agents with new tokens or leverage ecosystem ones. The VIRTUAL token began to skyrocket last week, with multiple catalysts including the listing announcement from crypto exchange OKX. On Dec. 11, OKX announced VIRTUAL/USDT perpetual futures. On Dec. 16, layer 1 decentralized crypto trading platform Hyperliquid announced it added Virtuals Protocol, allowing investors to long or short VIRTUAL. The platform offers up to 5x leverage. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, has also added support for VIRTUAL futures trading. According to data from Coinglass , open interest in VIRTUAL has spiked more than 45% in the past 24 hours to over $107 million. VIRTUAL token’s price has rocketed 426% in the past month and more than 14,500% since touching the all-time low of $0.02018 on July 5, 2024.

Bitcoin ( BTC ), Kiyosaki’s most discussed – though not the only favored as evidenced by his stakes in Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) – cryptocurrency breached $100,000 in December and is, at press time, trading above $104,000. Despite a slowdown in the last month and a half, gold likewise performed remarkably well, and many believe it will not be long before it continues the rally toward $3,000 per ounce. Given such a setup, it is unsurprising that, in a December 16 X post, Kiyosaki revealed his next investment should neither be in the world’s premier cryptocurrency nor the world’s biggest commodity . This is Robert Kiyosaki’s next big investment Specifically, in the same tweet in which he confirmed attendance at the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference (VRIC) in January, Robert Kiyosaki revealed he is in the market for a new silver mine. LEARNING & INVESTING CONFERENCE: I will be attending the much awaited VRIC Vancouver Resources Investor Conference….in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada… January 19, 20. I will speaking, learning, and investing… specifically…I am looking for a new silver mine to invest… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 16, 2024 In fact, the author explained his interest in VRIC with the fact that ‘expert speakers, and real miners with real mines to talk one-on-one-with’ will be in attendance. The investor particularly emphasized that he isn’t interested in talks with ‘financial planners or stock brokers’ but exclusively with the ‘real miners.’ As for his reasoning behind a silver mine being the next big investment, Robert Kiyosaki merely pointed toward gold’s price performance – the fact it had ‘already taken off’ – and opined that silver would be next. Why is Robert Kiyosaki looking to invest in a Silver mine Looking at silver’s performance since January 2024, Robert Kiyosaki’s logic appears obvious. Despite the precious and industrial metal having a seemingly more decisive rally than gold this year – 33.3% against 28.93 – it is, unlike its yellow counterpart, at the press-time price of $30.64, well below its all-time highs. Silver all-time price chart. Source: TradingView Furthermore, silver would need to rally another 53.6% to reclaim its old heights near $47 – and 60% if the manipulated 1980 highs are accounted for – proving there is ample room for the commodity to surge before hitting uncharted territory. The comparison with Kiyosaki’s third favored asset – Bitcoin – is even more obvious as the world’s premier cryptocurrency is approximately 140% in the green in 2024, though it is, by the famous investor’s own reckoning , likely still a good investment as it is predicted to rally another 150% in the coming 12 months.

The UK is one of the countries that are trying to bring strict regulations to protect the investors. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has shared its latest proposals for tight regulations on crypto assets. The objective behind them is to make the market safer. The FCA has made it clear: if you’re trading crypto, you’ll need to play by their rules. But what does that mean for the average investor—or the companies behind these digital coins? Are crypto regulations in the UK going to be tougher? Let’s find out. What’s the FCA’s Endgame? The FCA says it’s all about protecting people and keeping the market fair. Crypto has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons—scams, insider trading, market manipulation. You name it. So, the FCA is stepping in to sort things out. Source : FCA One of the big changes? Public offers of crypto assets will only be allowed if they’re listed on regulated trading platforms. That means fewer shady coins slipping through the cracks. The idea is to ensure that anyone investing in crypto has access to safer, more legitimate options. What Will Actually Change? For companies offering crypto assets, the rules are about to get a lot tougher. They’ll need to provide clear, detailed information about their crypto projects. This includes risks, governance, and even environmental impacts like energy usage and emissions. The FCA also wants to see stricter checks on teams behind these projects. Think of it as a trust test—if they can’t pass, they’re out. And it’s not just about paperwork. The FCA is cracking down on insider trading and other shady practices. Trading platforms will be expected to have systems in place to detect and report market abuse. No more turning a blind eye. Transparency is another big focus. Any documents tied to crypto offerings will need to be publicly accessible through the FCA’s National Storage Mechanism. It looks like they are adapting to the transparency feature of blockchain . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitget Secures Bitcoin Service Provider License in El Salvador , Implementing Crypto Regulations in The UK The FCA has openly invited industry experts and the public to share their feedback on the proposals by March 2025. They will fine tune the rules according to the feedback and then might roll them out by 2026. The new crypto regulations in the UK might make the market a safer place for investors but there would be challenges involved. The cost of meeting these new standards could be steep for companies. Also, for investors, it might mean lesser options. But for FCA, its all about striking a balance between encouraging innovation and consumer protection. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The USDtb token aims to keep a steady $1 price and holds 90% of its reserves in BUIDL , the tokenized money market fund issued by asset management behemoth BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize. ""In light of the rapidly accelerating demand for different stablecoin options, we saw a clear opportunity to provide a new product that offers users an entirely different risk profile from USDe without them having to leave our trusted ecosystem,” Ethena founder Guy Young said in a statement. Ethena is one of the fastest-growing DeFi platforms this year, attracting nearly $6 billion of user funds since its public launch in early 2024. The protocol's flagship token USDe, marketed as a ""synthetic dollar"" with a steady $1 price, generates yield to investors by shorting bitcoin ( BTC ), ether ( ETH ) and solana ( SOL ) perpetual swaps and farming the funding rates. This investment strategy offers lofty yields – currently 27% annualized – when crypto markets are in bull mode, but can quickly turn unprofitable when things turn bearish with persistently negative funding rates. The new offering will allow Ethena close the underlying derivatives positions behind USDe and divert the backing assets to USDtb during periods of negative funding rates and mitigating risks, the Ethena team explained. The protocol also aspires to get USDtb accepted as collateral in the future for margin trading on centralized exchanges.

Ethena also applied with the new USDtb stablecoin for Sky's, formerly MakerDAO, so-called Tokenization Gran Prix program that aims to invest up to $1 billion funds in tokenized real-world asset (RWA) products. The protocol's governance token recently garnered the attention of President-elect Donald Trump DeFi project World Liberty Financial, which purchased some $500,000 worth of tokens on Saturday, blockchain data showed.

The stablecoin recently secured approval from the New York Department of Financial Services and is expected to boost XRP demand by settling transactions on the XRPL and EVM sidechain. Meanwhile, stablecoin industry partnerships are intensifying. Paxos is collaborating with Standard Chartered to boost USDG and USDL in Singapore and the UAE. Circle and Binance also recently announced a strategic partnership to expand USDC adoption. Ripple Warns Against FOMO as RLUSD Prepares for Launch Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz , warned investors about potential ”supply shortages” and volatility after the launch of Ripple's U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RippleUSD (RLUSD). In a post on Dec. 15, Schwartz shed some light on the possibility of major fluctuations in RLUSD’s value in its early days, despite its design to maintain a 1:1 parity with the U.S. dollar. He shared that some early pre-market bids for RLUSD were already inflating its perceived value, with one Ripple wallet listing 1 RLUSD for 511 XRP , equivalent to over $1,200 at current prices. Schwartz dismissed the inflated valuation, and suggested that it was likely an attempt by someone looking for the symbolic honor of buying the first RLUSD. He also reassured potential users that the stablecoin’s price will return to its intended $1 parity once supply stabilizes. Schwartz warned against ”FOMO” buying into the stablecoin, and clarified that it is not a vehicle for speculative profit and urged users to exercise restraint. RippleUSD recently received its final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services, which was announced by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse on Dec. 11. The stablecoin is designed to work alongside XRP in the company’s cross-border payments solutions. According to Ripple, RLUSD is expected to serve large institutional players and complement XRP, with both assets paired to enhance liquidity and stabilize RLUSD’s price. Ripple’s president, Monica Long, previously described RLUSD as “ complementary and additive” to XRP. XRP’s widespread availability on exchanges will support RLUSD’s liquidity, while pairing mechanisms will prevent potential depegging. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is specifically designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset, like a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar, a commodity like gold , or a basket of assets. This pegging mechanism helps reduce the price volatility that is typically seen in other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins achieve their stability through reserves held in fiat currencies or other assets, algorithms, or a combination of both. They are widely used for transactions, remittances, and as a store of value, which essentially makes them a bridge between traditional financial systems and the world of digital assets. RLUSD Stablecoin Poised to Boost XRP The upcoming RLUSD stablecoin is also expected to drive increased demand for XRP in 2025, according to Georgios Vlachos , co-founder of the Axelar interoperability platform. Axelar serves as the canonical bridge connecting the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to the XRPL EVM chain and 69 other blockchains. Vlachos pointed out that stablecoins like RLUSD are widely used in emerging economies for transactions and as a store of value. With RLUSD transactions and remittances settling on the XRPL and XRP-EVM sidechain, gas fees paid in XRP will burn tokens, benefiting XRP holders and adding to the demand for the cryptocurrency. XRP price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) XRP recently saw a historic rally after reaching a seven-year high of $2.90 on Dec. 3 of 2024, before retreating to its current level of $2.39. The pullback happened after a surge in the relative strength index (RSI) to 95, indicating overbought conditions. However, XRP continues to attract investor interest due to several catalysts. These include political tailwinds from Donald Trump’s election victory, which boosted pro-crypto sentiment and hopes for a favorable regulatory environment in the U.S. XRP also gained some momentum after flipping Solana in market capitalization on Dec. 1, which allowed it to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $136 billion. This is just shy of Tether’s $140 billion. Top cryptocurrencies by market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Further fueling optimism, major asset management firms like WisdomTree, Bitwise, Canary Capital, and 21Shares, have filed for XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with the SEC. Paxos and Standard Chartered Partner In other stablecoin-related news, Paxos partnered with Standard Chartered to strengthen the management of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins, Global Dollar (USDG) and Lift Dollar (USDL), in Singapore and the UAE. Through this collaboration, Standard Chartered will provide cash management, trading, and custody services to enhance the infrastructure supporting these stablecoins. The partnership will also integrate Standard Chartered’s banking capabilities across transaction banking, financial markets, and securities services with Paxos’ global tokenization platform. One of the main goals of this partnership is to offer institutional-grade solutions for the growing stablecoin industry. Adam Ackermann, the head of treasury and portfolio management at Paxos, pointed out just how important Standard Chartered’s expertise in risk management and compliance are in supporting Paxos as a regulated stablecoin issuer. John Collura, global head of banks and broker dealer sales at Standard Chartered, shared that the bank is fully committed to advancing secure and regulated digital asset solutions that promote global adoption and economic inclusion. Global Dollar (USDG) is issued by Paxos Digital Singapore, and complies with the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) forthcoming stablecoin regulations. Lift Dollar (USDL) was introduced by Paxos International and is regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market. It also offers holders a daily programmatic safe yield. Circle and Binance Team Up Circle and Binance also recently announced a strategic partnership to enhance the global financial services ecosystem and support the growth of digital assets. The alliance was unveiled during Abu Dhabi Finance Week. As part of the partnership, Binance will integrate Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) into its platform, increasing its availability for users. Binance plans to offer additional USDC trading pairs, promotions, and other platform products to encourage its adoption. Circle will provide Binance with technology, liquidity, and support to strengthen Binance’s connections within global finance and commerce. During Abu Dhabi Finance Week, Circle also announced its incorporation in the Abu Dhabi Global Market and a new partnership with LuLu Financial Holdings . This collaboration will facilitate cross-border payments and remittances using USDC, taking advantage of LuLu Financial’s extensive operations in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the Indian subcontinent, and the Asia-Pacific region. Looking ahead, Circle also plans to relocate its headquarters to New York in early 2025 and pursue an initial public offering (IPO) once it receives approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-16 13:43:25

37717278,https://blockworks.co/news/two-vaneck-funds-back-depin-dawn,1734356700,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,Exclusive: 2 VanEck funds back Solana-based DePIN DAWN,https://blockworks.co/news/two-vaneck-funds-back-depin-dawn,"VanEck is putting $2.5 million into DAWN, a DePIN project aiming to create a decentralized internet service provider. The investment comes from VanEck’s Digital Assets Alpha fund and VanEck Ventures. The strategic funding round marks the first time that “multiple funds at VanEck have made a direct investment into the same company,” the firm exclusively told Blockworks. The newest raise comes after Andrena, the company behind DAWN, raised $18 million in a round back in August.* Andrena CEO Neil Chatterjee told Blockworks that DAWN was designed to capitalize on the “transformation of our lives” as society goes from being wired into the internet to being completely wireless following the rollouts of 5G and Starlink. Read more: Turning Tesla cameras into data engines “So now that we are kind of as a society going from a transition from a wired society to a more wireless one, we can actually use that wireless transformation in a way that we can wield it to benefit the end consumer, to benefit the end household, in a way [so they] are owning their own network. With this new transformation, we want homes to be the ones that are taking the benefit,” he explained. DAWN’s hardware can be used to reshare internet “no matter what provider you’re with,” and doesn’t need to be DAWN’s specific internet, the Andrena team explained to Blockworks. Chatterjee said his project aims to give “anybody all across the globe that has underutilized bandwidth…the means to sell it without having to worry about the customer acquisition.” The $2.5 million figure will partially be used to scale retail engagement through the hardware, allowing users to create mini networks for internet sharing and let DAWN expand internationally. Right now, the user base is predominantly in the US. Read more: Solana Foundation exec departs for ‘the most interesting experiment in crypto’ Through that, Chatterjee’s team is looking for “partnerships with data centers, internet service providers, real estate, companies, that can kind of give you a very big footprint very quickly, and then we’ll be using our capital to help expedite that deployment process.” The two biggest goals for the team are trickled down through their plans: onchain revenue and households. Chatterjee declined to give specifics on either metric, but noted that the team is moving to get both in the “millions.” For VanEck Ventures, which launched back in October, DAWN offers a product that’s not only “economically competitive” but also challenges the “monopolistic nature” of legacy internet service providers, general partner Wyatt Lonergan told Blockworks. The investment aligns with the new venture fund’s philosophy, which is jumping into an early-stage project with a check from $500,000 to $1 million, as Lonergan explained to the Empire newsletter in October . According to Lonergan, DAWN aims to disrupt the monopoly held by traditional ISPs while giving “the consumer a better product, [and putting] them in control, [so the] token is kind of pouring fuel on the fire. It creates the really amazing network effects that you wouldn’t otherwise get and turns these users into owners. And that kind of strengthens the entire network, in our opinion. So I love the idea of using these mesh networks to bootstrap businesses that otherwise would be really hard to do. That is kind of the promise of tokens.” But what really drew him, and the Digital Assets Alpha Fund, was the team behind DAWN. “WiFi is something, to me, that’s really easy to understand,” which pushes this project more mainstream than other crypto projects, he explained. For VanEck, Lonergan said the goal is to back a “category-winning team,” which both funds believe DAWN is.

Which Altcoins Should You Be Paying Attention To?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/when-will-altseason-begin-which-altcoins-should-you-be-paying-attention-to/,"The post When Will Altseason Begin? Which Altcoins Should You Be Paying Attention To? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After the bullish start for the month, the Altseason was believed to have kicked off, reclaiming 3.5 years of resistance. Meanwhile, they are failing to gain momentum even in times when the BTC price consolidates after a notable rise. This suggests the market participants have currently concentrated on the star crypto and may remain until the token does not reach the peak of the prevailing bull run. Not all the altcoins are behaving in a similar fashion at present. While the tokens like LINK, AAVE, etc. are pushing higher, others like MANA, ETH, ADA, etc. are consolidating and waiting for their moment. The Altcoin market cap was testing the crucial resistance at $1.64 trillion but the rejection that followed has circulated bearish waves with a fear of an extended pullback below $1.5 trillion. Does this suggest the wait for a strong altseason could consume more time than expected? As seen in the above chart, the market capitalisation excluding Bitcoin has faced a rejection just below it’s ATH at $1.71 trillion. It was expected to be a small pullback, but the second consecutive week under bearish influence raises many concerns. Mainly because the volume has reached the 2021 levels and a similar rejection could validate the bearish possibilities. However, the RSI, which has displayed a bearish divergence, is yet to mark the highs, which could be close to 85. The Altseason experienced a Golden Cross in the past few days, which appeared to be much similar to the 2020-21 cycle. Therefore, considering a similar impact in the upcoming days, the Q1 of 2025 is expected to be pretty explosive. Although Bitcoin dominance has hit hard and is trying to rise, it is expected to fall eventually, leading the markets to witness one of the strongest Altseasons ever in history. With this, it is required to be away from the memecoin FOMO and focus more on the projects with strong fundamentals. For instance, Worldcoin that works for identity & finance, Uniswap, is called the OG of DEXs with staying power. Meanwhile, AAVE, known as a DeFi powerhouse, Chianlink, which is called the backbone of DEX oracles and Maker-A key in stablecoins. Along with these, Ondo is working on tokenized real-world assets, Solana is focusing on speed, scalability, & a thriving ecosystem, and BinanceCoin is the native token of a huge exchange with a wide range of utility.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 13:47:41

Despite a recent increase to $0.44, DOGE exceeding $20 is unlikely due to inflation, excess supply, and low utility. Using groundbreaking real-world asset tokenization and smart tokenomics, Rexas Finance (RXS), currently trading at $0.15, might reach this milestone within 90 days. Let's examine Dogecoin's challenges and how Rexas Finance offers a more likely exponential development path. Why Dogecoin’s $20 Dream Might be a Fallacy Dogecoin's economics make $20 nearly unfeasible. Its inflationary process slowly devalues the token, with 140 billion in circulation and 5 billion issued annually. The market capitalization must reach $2.8 trillion, more than Bitcoin and Ethereum, to reach $20. The lack of value and institutional backing make this an intractable issue. Furthermore, Dogecoin uses are limited. The coin has a committed community but is not integrated into large financial institutions or widely used in decentralized finance. Its main usage is speculative trading and tipping, with no innovative applications to boost prices. Dogecoin's future is restricted without fixing these core flaws. Also, meme coins like DOGE are known for huge gains followed by notable sheddings that impact their ability to reach notable prices over the year. For instance, Dogecoin soared to its all time high of $0.73 in 2021. Notable dips followed this and, at a point, trading below $0.10. In contrast, with a similar price action, Solana had surged from its 2022 dip to $10 back to a new ATH of $264 this cycle. Traders use meme coins like DOGE for short-term gains, which might remain so for ages. Why Is Rexas Finance Unique? In contrast to DOGE’s uncertain path to $20, Rexas Finance is becoming a revolutionary crypto player with the means and strategy to reach a $20 valuation quickly. Rexas Finance stands out for combining cutting-edge technology with real-world applications. Rexas Finance's main innovation is tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) like real estate, commodities, and fine art. It breaks traditional, illiquid assets into fractional shares that can be traded easily on the blockchain. For instance, an investor can buy a part of a $10 million mansion with just $100 in RXS tokens. This increases liquidity, investor participation, and access to high-value markets. The RWA industry is vast. Global real estate is $379.7 trillion, while commodities will reach $121.2 trillion by 2024. Rexas Finance enters multi-trillion-dollar markets, increasing token demand and leading this fast-growing industry. Through its incredible presale performance and community incentives, Rexas Finance has gained market share. The project raised $27.50 million within three months and sold 340 million RXS tokens. The token's price rose 400% from $0.03 to $0.15. This huge increase shows investor confidence and bodes well for post-listing prospects. Running alongside the presale is a $1 million giveaway that rewards the community’s loyalty and reaches more investors. With over 450,000 entries received, the top 20 participants stand to earn $50,000 worth of RXS tokens. Unlike speculative coins, RXS has value due to its strong ecosystem and practical applications. The platform's exchange listings will boost liquidity and visibility, causing exponential price hikes. Its deflationary tokenomics and 1 billion token production limit ensure scarcity and value appreciation. Token buybacks and burns limit circulating supply, aligning investor interests with long-term growth. The Rexas Finance ecosystem also includes various tools and features intended to increase user engagement and utility. The Rexas Token Builder makes creating tokens easier for individuals and institutions. At the same time, the QuickMint Bot interfaces with popular platforms such as Telegram to allow for smooth token distribution. Rexas AI Shield offers continuous smart contract monitoring and audits for improved security, ensuring trust and reliability. Furthermore, Rexas Treasury automates yield farming across various blockchains to maximize investors' profits. These capabilities make Rexas Finance an all-in-one platform that promotes adoption and long-term growth. RXS To Surge to $20 in 90 Days Rexas Finance's capacity to reach $20 in 90 days is not speculative but supported by statistics and market patterns. Historical evidence from other high-growth coins like Solana demonstrates that companies with good presale success and thriving ecosystems frequently enjoy exponential gains after listing. For example, SOL surged sporadically from $0.05 in 2020 to an all-time high of $259 in 2021, reaching a multibillion-dollar market cap within a year of inception. With its deflationary supply, vast addressable market, and presale momentum, RXS is poised to emulate or even outperform previous triumphs. Post-listing trading volumes, greater institutional interest, and continued use of RWA tokenization will drive price increases. While Rexas Finance has a lot of potential, it's important to evaluate the risks, such as market volatility or regulatory changes in asset tokenization. However, the platform's Certik audit, adherence to regulatory requirements, and innovative use of blockchain technology all alleviate many of these worries. Rexas Finance earns investor trust by ensuring transparency and security and positions itself for long-term growth. Conclusion Dogecoin's architectural faults and lack of utility make it unlikely to reach $20, even in the long run. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, with its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, deflationary tokenomics, and an innovative ecosystem, provides a viable and data-backed road to achieving this ambitious goal in 90 days. Rexas Finance is a platform that revolutionizes decentralized finance and makes conventional asset markets more reachable to everyone, not just a token. RXS presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking a high-growth possibility to participate in the future of blockchain evolution. Seize the chance to be part of the Rexas movement.

ENA eyes new all-time high above $1.5 as its synthetic dollar USDe hits $6 billion in market cap. Built on the Ethereum network, USDe, which functions similarly to other stablecoins has been quickly gaining market share this year. Ethena Price Eyes New All-Time High Amid USDe Dominance ENA is gaining investor attention as its USDe synthetical dollar continues to gain massive traction. On the monthly chart, Ethena’s USDe has seen its market cap soaring by nearly double and moving closer to $6 billion. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin is on the rise, nearing a total supply of $6 billion—marking an impressive 140% increase since its October lows. Despite this rapid growth, Ethena’s synthetic dollar currently accounts for just 2.83% of the stablecoin market, leaving it well behind industry leaders like USDC and USDT. However, the growth trajectory highlights significant potential for Ethena’s stablecoin to capture a larger market share in the future. Built on Ethereum, Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol that offers a crypto-native alternative to traditional banking infrastructure. Ethena’s synthetic dollar, USDe, aims to be the first censorship-resistant, scalable, and stable crypto-native solution for money. Top crypto derivatives exchange Deribit has also announced the integration of USDe as margin collateral. Following the strong demand for its synthetic dollar, the Ethena price has surged amid strong buying interest and is up 122% on the monthly chart. As per the Coinglass data , the open interest has surged to $712 million with the 24-hour liquidations soaring to $6.69 million.

Inflation remains sticky, but the job market is showing resilience, and policymakers are uncertain about the path ahead. Federal Reserve officials are expected to reduce interest rates for the third consecutive month, with economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecasting another quarter-point cut at the upcoming December 17-18 meeting. The cuts would bring the central bank’s key benchmark rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, marking a cumulative one percentage point reduction since September. Alongside this move, the Fed is expected to scale back its projections for the number of rate cuts in 2025. The Federal Reserve’s 2024 rate cut Per a recent Yahoo news report, investors are keeping tabs on the Fed’s quarterly “dot plot,” a chart where each Federal Reserve official projects the future direction of the federal funds rate. This tool helps businesspeople keep track of the Fed’s monetary policy stance and insights into the central bank’s thinking. In September, the dot plot showed that the Fed expected to reduce rates twice more in 2024, followed by four additional cuts in 2025. However, recent inflation data and cautious comments from officials have led some to question the viability of these projections. The Federal Reserve’s Dot Plot from September. Source: Bloomberg These uncertainties are amplified by the possible impact of new government policies under the upcoming Trump administration, which will complicate the Fed’s decision-making process. Loretta Mester, former president of the Cleveland Fed, told Yahoo Finance that the forecast for four cuts in 2025 may need to be revised. Mester suggested that a “slowing down” of the pace of rate reductions next year is likely, with two or three cuts appearing more realistic. This shift is being debated, as some economists believe the Fed will still adhere to its original plan. “The story overall is they still expect inflation to come down,” said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust. Tilley believes the median estimate for 2025 will remain at four rate cuts, reasoning that Fed officials continue to view rates as restrictive and still anticipate inflation will moderate. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has allowed room for a more cautious approach if necessary. In early December, Powell noted that “we can afford to be a little more cautious” in light of stronger-than-expected economic conditions. Powell’s comments suggest that while the Fed is likely to continue with a measured pace, it is prepared to adapt its stance based on emerging data. Inflation and job market resilience test Fed’s 2025 projections The potential for a revision in the Fed’s 2025 policy outlook is largely influenced by two developments in late 2024. First, the job market showed no significant signs of weakening, continuing to support consumer spending and economic growth. Second, inflation has proven more persistent than many expected, failing to show consistent signs of easing toward the Fed’s 2% target. 12-month percentage change, CPI, and selected categories as of November 2024. Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics The latest inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed a 2.7% increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November, up slightly from October’s 2.6% year-over-year gain. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Wholesale prices also climbed more than anticipated in November, suggesting inflationary pressures are not yet fully abated. CPI & CPI Core data from 2020 to 2024. Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Despite these inflationary readings, markets are betting heavily on a rate cut this week, with traders now assigning a 95% probability to a 25-basis point reduction. Many expect the Federal Reserve’s 2025 forecast will remain largely unchanged, despite the recent inflation data. Tilley of Wilmington Trust maintains that the Fed will stick with its projection for four cuts in 2025. He believes the central bank will focus on the labor market’s volatility while also factoring in recent inflation trends. Tilley remains particularly concerned about the labor market, where private sector job growth has slowed significantly. He predicts job creation will drop to an average of 100,000 positions per month in the coming months, which he views as a potential risk to the broader economy. Wilmington Trust’s bond portfolio manager, Wilmer Stith, also believes the Fed will continue with its original plan for 2025. Stith anticipates Powell will highlight progress made in tackling inflation, particularly with regard to shelter prices and other components of the CPI. Stith views a 25-basis point rate cut as almost certain this week and expects Powell to emphasize that the Federal Reserve is moving closer to its inflation target. Fed officials remain divided on the 2025 outlook Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin has expressed optimism about the inflation outlook, suggesting that inflation will continue to decrease in 2025. Barkin attributed recent flat core inflation readings to tough year-over-year comparisons and expects inflation data in early 2025 to appear more favorable due to higher base numbers from the previous year. Similarly, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee pointed to the significant drop in inflation since it peaked at 9% in 2022, the highest level in four decades. Goolsbee remains confident that the Fed will reach its 2% target over time, reinforcing the Fed’s commitment to returning inflation to sustainable levels. However, Mester is less optimistic about 2025, cautioning that recent inflation data and potential fiscal policy shifts could force the Fed to reconsider its rate-cutting plans. “I think there’s going to be a rethink about what that appropriate policy path may have to look like next year,” Mester remarked. While Mester expects a rate cut this week, she anticipates a pause in January, as the Federal Reserve will likely reassess the economic landscape heading into 2025. The current economic environment presents a delicate balancing act for the Federal Reserve: it must navigate stubborn inflation while avoiding triggering a recession, given the mixed signals from the labor market.

While MicroStrategy's addition to the Nasdaq 100 index and Donald Trump's strategic Bitcoin reserve expectations were influential in today's BTC rise, 10x Research founder Markus Thielen stated that they expect BTC to reach $120,000 before Trump takes office. Bitcoin (BTC) Could Be $120,000 in January! Thielen said Bitcoin could hit $120,000 by January 20, 2025, before Donald Trump is inaugurated as US president. Thielen stated that there were large BTC outflows from centralized exchanges (CEXs) last week, causing constant supply pressure on the BTC price. Markus Thielen also highlighted that MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq 100, the possibility of additional BTC purchases, and the adoption of new fair value accounting standards for cryptocurrencies by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could increase institutional BTC adoption and fuel BTC’s year-end rally. “New Bitcoin trading signal targets $120,000 by Trump’s inauguration in January.

Bitcoin has already surged to a record high, and many altcoins could follow. So, here are some of the top red-hot crypto to buy ahead of the Santa Claus rally. Best Crypto to Buy Ahead of The Santa Claus Rally Some of the best altcoins to buy in preparation for the Santa rally are Ethena (ENA), DexBoss, and Ondo Finance. Ethena (ENA) Ethena is one of the best cryptos to invest this year. The coin has soared from a low of $0.1933 in September to $1.3 on Monday. This rally intensified after Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance (WLFI) bought more coins and as USDe’s total value locked jumped to over $6 billion for the first time ever. Investors are embracing USDe because of its 27% yield, which is higher than most assets. Athena price is in the process of forming a cup and handle pattern whose upper side is at $1.5216. A C&H pattern is one of the most bullish continuation patterns. Therefore, the initial target for ENA is the year-to-date high of $1.5216. A move above that level will bring its target to $2.7685. This target is identified by measuring the depth of the cup and then extrapolating it from the upper side. Ethena Price Chart DexBoss (DEBO) The concept of decentralized finance is doing well this year as the volume handled by the networks surged. DexBoss, an upcoming DEX network, currently in a presale, is one of the best crypto to buy and hold. A key benefit for buying it is that it is trading at $0.01 and will then list at $0.050, which is about 400% above the current level. DexBoss aims to be a better platform than other popular platforms like Uniswap and Raydium by having low costs, over 2,000 coins to trade, and cross-chain compatibility. You can buy the DEXBOSS token here . Ondo Finance (ONDO) Ondo Finance price has also jumped, making it an ideal red-hot cryptocurrency to buy and hold. Its rally has happened as demand for Real World Asset Tokenization assets rose and as the total value locked jumped to over $613 million . The daily chart shows that the ONDO token formed a cup and handle pattern and has already moved above the upper side at $1.4840. It has also remained above the strong pivot reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines at $1.90. By measuring the depth of this cup, we can assume that the ONDO token will jump to $2.53, which also coincides with the overshoot of the Murrey Math Lines. A drop below the top of the trading range at $1.8 will invalidate the bullish view and point to more downside, potentially to the upper side of the cup at $1.4840. More cryptocurrencies to Buy There are other popular cryptocurrencies to buy ahead of the Santa Claus rally. Some of the most notable ones are Hedera Hashgraph, Chainlink, Mantra, and Polkadot.

The collaboration will leverage blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent data sharing while creating a liquid market for compute assets such as graphics processing units ( GPUs ). Monetizing AI resources Kite AI and GAIB seek to provide stakeholders with the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) tools necessary to monetize AI-related resources, including GPU-backed stablecoins and lending markets . As such, the partnership is expected to empower smaller players in the sector , accelerate adoption, encourage innovation, and address a number of issues in an industry dominated by large corporations. Kony Kwong, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of GAIB, described compute as the ‘new currency’, implying market access is essential: “In the AI era, compute is the new currency, and GPUs are the new assets driving this currency. Partnering with Kite AI allows us to dismantle barriers for people to access the marketplace, unlocking new financial opportunities of the AI industry for all.” Chi Zhang, Co-founder and CEO of Kite AI, echoed Kwong’s sentiment, stating: “We envision an AI landscape where innovation is driven by a diverse ecosystem of contributors, not monopolized by a few giants. Our partnership with GAIB is a critical step toward that goal. Together, we’re building a decentralized, democratic, and trustless AI economy.” How can Kite AI and GAIB increase AI liquidity? As part of the collaboration, Kite AI will rely on a blockchain-based coordination layer to bring AI models, datasets, and agents to a decentralized platform. On the other hand, GAIB will leverage its economic framework to turn illiquid AI resources into tokenized, tradable assets. This approach not only creates new revenue streams for stakeholders but also makes compute and data resources more available. Consequently, the two partners expect the collaboration to promote future AI innovation that emphasizes more than just centralized control and empowers more participants in the sector.

This research comes at a critical moment as autonomous agents increasingly influence economic systems and financial services, with the Eliza framework providing a proven foundation for developing reliable and scalable agent-based systems. “This collaboration represents a unique opportunity to shape how AI agents will interact within digital economies,” said Professors Dan Boneh and David Mazières, who will oversee the research fellowship program. “By combining FDCI’s established infrastructure with Eliza Labs’ expertise in multi-agent systems, we’re positioning ourselves at the forefront of this transformative technology.” “We are incredibly excited to partner with Stanford’s Future of Digital Currency Initiative, one of the most prestigious programs for digital currency research, to explore how AI agents can reshape the future of financial systems,” said Shaw Walters, Founder of Eliza Labs. “Together, we’re combining Stanford’s academic rigor with our widely used Eliza AI agent framework to drive trust and governance in decentralized economies.” The research program will unfold across three phases throughout 2025, focusing on three core areas: Agent Trust Mechanisms: Developing new frameworks for how autonomous agents establish and verify trust within digital currency networks, building upon Eliza Labs’ existing agent trust architecture Multi-Agent Economic Systems: Investigating how agents interact and coordinate in economic contexts Decentralized Agent Governance: Creating new protocols for managing autonomous agent communities The initiative will produce open-source frameworks, simulation platforms, and practical applications in automated market-making systems and decentralized financial services. Early-stage findings and developments will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and industry presentations. The partnership is actively seeking select industry collaborators, offering early access to emerging technologies and direct involvement in shaping research directions. For venture firms and blockchain infrastructure partners, this represents an opportunity to position themselves at the forefront of agent technology development while accessing emerging technical talent in the field. Research outcomes will include novel trust frameworks for autonomous agents, scalable multi-agent coordination protocols, and formal models for agent governance in decentralized systems. These developments aim to establish foundational standards for agent interaction in digital economies.

Interestingly, Peter Schiff was quick to intercept the announcement with another criticism against Saylor, his company, and BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,350 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$100,386 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 46.4% QTD and 72.4% YTD.

The firm’s total stash has grown to 439,000 BTC, valued at well above $44 billion at current prices, while it spent $27.1 billion to acquire it. MicroStrategy’s BTC yield has grown to 46.4% in the past quarter alone, with the number standing above 72% for the entire year. Thus, the company has continued a recent tradition that started several weeks ago: announcing massive purchases worth over $1 billion on Monday. Another thing that didn’t change this week is the vocal criticism of well-known bitcoin hater – Peter Schiff. The gold bug commented under Saylor’s post that BTC’s price will plunge once the firm stops buying. “Just as I suspected. Imagine how much lower the Bitcoin price will fall when you stop buying. Then imagine how much lower it will go when creditors force you to sell.” The post MicroStrategy Announces First Bitcoin Purchase With BTC Prices Above $100K appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Michael Saylor|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-16 14:02:22

While community-driven tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to dominate headlines with their viral appeal, projects like Lightchain AI (LCAI) are paving the way for real-world innovation. With the Lightchain AI Presale now live, this platform is set to blend blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle practical challenges across industries. [Join the Lightchain AI Presale today!] Shiba Inu has gained fame for its accessibility and strong community backing, but the crypto landscape is shifting beyond memes to focus on utility and transformative potential. Lightchain AI represents this new wave of innovation, aiming to deliver impactful solutions that go beyond hype. The question now is: Can Shiba Inu’s community-driven buzz compete with the groundbreaking advancements Lightchain AI is bringing to the table? Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Meme Token’s Rise to Fame The Origin Story Shiba Inu entered the crypto scene in 2020 as a direct competitor to Dogecoin (DOGE). Self-described as the “Dogecoin Killer,” SHIB leveraged its meme-inspired branding and grassroots marketing to quickly build a loyal following. The Shiba Inu ecosystem now includes projects like ShibaSwap (a decentralized exchange), NFTs, and the promise of Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution aimed at increasing scalability. The Appeal of Shiba Inu Accessibility: Like Dogecoin, SHIB’s low price per token allows everyday investors to hold millions of coins, fostering a sense of ownership and community. Community Power: SHIB’s success is largely driven by its passionate fanbase, known as the Shib Army , which has propelled the token to global fame. Evolving Ecosystem: With plans for Shibarium and utility tokens like BONE and LEASH , Shiba Inu is attempting to expand beyond its meme origins. The Challenges SHIB Faces Lack of Real-World Utility: While SHIB has made strides in DeFi and NFTs, it still struggles to find applications beyond its ecosystem. Volatility and Speculation: SHIB’s price movements are often tied to market hype rather than fundamental value. Scalability Issues: Despite promises of Shibarium, the Shiba Inu ecosystem relies heavily on Ethereum, which faces its own scalability challenges. Lightchain AI: Where Blockchain Meets Real-World Impact Lightchain AI enters the blockchain space with a bold mission to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. By combining the power of these two transformative technologies, Lightchain AI focuses on solving real-world problems and delivering innovative solutions to complex challenges. Their efforts are set to redefine how industries tackle critical issues in healthcare, such as improving data security and patient outcomes, finance, by enhancing transaction transparency and fraud prevention, supply chain, through optimized tracking and efficiency, and many other sectors. Lightchain AI envisions a future where AI-driven blockchain solutions empower industries to operate smarter, faster, and more securely. Real-World Use Cases: Lightchain AI’s Edge While Shiba Inu thrives on community engagement and meme culture, Lightchain AI brings tangible benefits to multiple industries: 1. Healthcare AI-Powered Diagnostics: Lightchain AI enables faster and more accurate medical diagnostics by leveraging machine learning models on its AIVM. Predictive Healthcare Models: Hospitals and healthcare providers can use AI to forecast patient needs, reducing costs and improving outcomes. 2. Supply Chain Transparency Real-Time Tracking: With blockchain-backed AI, Lightchain AI enhances supply chain visibility, ensuring accountability and reducing inefficiencies. Fraud Prevention: AI algorithms on Lightchain AI’s platform detect anomalies in supply chains, preventing fraud and loss. 3. Finance DeFi Optimization: Lightchain AI brings advanced analytics to decentralized finance, improving yield farming, risk assessment, and trading algorithms. Fraud Detection: Its AI-driven mechanisms flag suspicious transactions, ensuring a safer financial ecosystem. 4. Dynamic NFTs Interactive Digital Assets: Unlike static NFTs, Lightchain AI enables NFTs that evolve based on user interaction or real-world data, offering new possibilities in gaming and art. Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Compete With Lightchain AI’s Real-World Use Cases? While Shiba Inu continues to ride the wave of community-driven hype, Lightchain AI’s focus on real-world impact and utility sets it apart. With its innovative use cases in industries like healthcare, supply chain management, finance, and NFTs, Lightchain AI has positioned itself as a leader in merging blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. However, this doesn’t mean that SHIB and Lightchain AI are direct competitors. Both projects have their strengths and cater to different audiences. While SHIB may appeal to those looking for a fun and accessible entry point into crypto, Lightchain AI attracts investors interested in innovative solutions with tangible benefits. In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, there is room for both Shiba Inu and Lightchain AI to thrive. As the landscape continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how these two projects continue to make their mark and drive innovation in the industry. So, whether you’re a passionate Shib Army member or a tech-savvy investor, keep an eye on both SHIB and Lightchain AI as they continue their journeys towards success. Let’s see who comes out on top! Shiba Inu’s Efforts to Expand Utility Shiba Inu is not without its own ambitions. The development of Shibarium, its Layer 2 solution, aims to: Reduce Gas Fees: By scaling its ecosystem, Shibarium could lower transaction costs for DeFi and NFT projects. Encourage Adoption: A more scalable network could attract developers to build dApps within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Improve Speed: Shibarium promises faster transaction confirmation times, potentially making SHIB more practical for everyday use. However, these efforts are still in progress, and it remains to be seen whether Shibarium can compete with platforms like Lightchain AI, which are designed for scalability and real-world use from the ground up. Community vs. Utility: Who Wins? Shiba Inu: The Power of Buzz Strength: SHIB’s community-driven approach makes it a cultural phenomenon, capable of rallying massive support. Weakness: Its lack of utility beyond its ecosystem may limit its long-term viability. Lightchain AI: The Power of Innovation Strength: With real-world applications across industries, Lightchain AI provides tangible value beyond speculative trading. Weakness: As a newer platform, it faces the challenge of building a community as strong as Shiba Inu’s. Lightchain AI Presale Is Live!

In a new interview with Fox Business, longtime crypto bull Anthony Pompliano says that as long as the US government keeps the money printers on, the top crypto asset by market cap will continue to rally. “I think that Bitcoin is going to continue to go up as long as the government keeps printing money. So at the same time that Trump has been elected and has stepped into the White House, saying that he’s going to be the ‘first Bitcoin president’ – which obviously is very bullish for the asset class – you also see that the national debt is exploding in the last 100 days or so.” According to Pompliano, investors and institutions are increasingly using the flagship digital asset as a store of value and as a means of countering inflation, noting that the US national debt is “out of control.” “If you overlay [the rising national debt and BTC’s price], they’re like married together forever because ultimately what I think is happening is people [are] realizing the national debt leads to debasement of the currency and so if Bitcoin is a store of value, they are hiding from dollars and they’re going into Bitcoin… I mean we were adding $1 trillion every 100 days or so [to the debt], which obviously is out of control… You have tons of financial institutions and corporations who are saying, ‘Well hold on a second, let’s go buy a lot of Bitcoin.’ So you have a finite asset with tons of demand coming in and that’s leading to higher prices.” Bitcoin is trading for $104,607 at time of writing, a 3.01% increase during the last 24 hours while the US national debt is currently at $36.13 trillion , according to the US Treasury Department.

The company is a dedicated miner operating North America’s largest mining facility. With a market capitalization of approximately $4.41 billion, the company is among the largest and most prominent stocks within the Bitcoin mining sector. Riot Platforms Cements Leading Position as a Major Bitcoin Miner with New Bitcoin Purchase Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms announced it added more BTC to its portfolio. According to its official announcement , the company utilized proceeds from the recent issuance of $594 million in 0.75% convertible bonds to purchase 667 BTC at approximately $101,135. The purchase reportedly cost approximately $67.457 million. This will increase the miner’s total Bitcoin balance to 17,429.

(@RiotPlatforms) December 16, 2024 The announcement comes around the same time MicroStrategy confirmed acquisition of an additional 15,350 BTC worth $1.5 billion, its sixth acquisition in six weeks. From the latest purchase, MicroStrategy will have a total holding of 423,650 Bitcoins. Primarily a business intelligence and cloud computing services provider, MicroStrategy has been one of the longstanding corporate advocates for cryptocurrency, especially now that Executive Chairman Michael Saylor sees the largest cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge and much superior to any other investment tool. Riot Platforms, meanwhile, is a focused miner operating the most significant mining facility in North America. With a market capitalization of about $4.41 billion, this miner represents one of the larger stocks within the sector. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin once again moved past $105,000 on Monday, gaining 2.9% to reach $105,801. $525 Million For Bitcoin Domination In addition to its BTC acquisition, Riot Platforms has focused on securing its future growth through a $525 million convertible senior notes offering. That’s more than previously planned $500 million . The convertible notes, as per the conversion terms into equity, give the company flexibility and liquidity to address market opportunities effectively. The company has deployed the proceeds to purchase additional BTC, enhance operational expansion, and explore advancements in mining efficiency. This audacious fundraising strategy stamps this company’s commitment to outpacing an industry rife with rapid innovation and volatility. Strong Operational Performance Riot’s November 2024 production results further underscore its position as a leader in the crypto mining space. The company successfully mined 495 Bitcoins, demonstrating consistent operational efficiency and scalability. The miner’s increasing hash rate—a key measure of mining power—reflects its determination to strengthen its foothold in the competitive mining industry. The company has been proactive in investing in renewable energy partnerships, further situating it as a sustainable player in the crypto space. This makes the company resonate with environmentally conscious investors who have concerns regarding the consumption of energy in mining.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Bull run sparks new highs, but tokens like PEPE and DOGE lag. Analysts see 1Fuel, in presale, primed for 500% growth. Table of Contents Breaking barriers, but not expectation: Pepe’s journey to meeting the hype Dogecoin’s lost bark: Meme coin’s underperformance raises questions about its future 1Fuel ignites interest: How its privacy features Are revolutionizing DeFi Conclusion It’s no longer news that the bull run has begun, with several cryptocurrencies experiencing new highs. Despite this surge, big names such as Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have underperformed, failing to meet analysts’ expectations. Holders of the tokens are beginning to jump ship in search of a project with great profit potential. According to the top crypto analyst, 1Fuel has the most potential among other altcoins. The token is in the second presale stage, and metrics show signs of exponential growth. Aside from impressive presale numbers, the privacy features have also generated interest in the DeFi world. Combining both aspects, analysts expect the token to increase by 500% or more. You might also like: Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem expands while 1FUEL changes DeFi wallets Breaking barriers, but not expectation: Pepe ‘s journey to meeting the hype On December 9, 2024, PEPE achieved a new all-time high (ATH) of $0.00002803. Although this was good news for the project, the price didn’t meet analysts’ expectations. An overview of the 30-day chart shows PEPE increased by 29.2%, which is disappointing. At the moment, the token is 12.7% down from its ATH. As a meme coin, Pepe’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment. Failing to maintain its ATH paints a picture of little to no community support. Without the backing of crypto enthusiasts, analysts anticipate Pepe price stagnation on the charts. Investors looking for gains during this bull are advised to purchase 1Fuel, as it isn’t wholly dependent on sentiment. 1Fuel has functionality such as its privacy feature, which Pepe lacks. It is currently on presale and has the potential to outperform Pepe. Dogecoin ‘s lost bark: Meme coin’s underperformance raises questions about its future Being the top dog, analysts predicted that Dogecoin would skyrocket towards the end of the year. However, the token has failed to meet these expectations. DOGE is 44.4% below its ATH of $0.7316, recorded on May 8, 2021. The price has been steady in the last 30 days on cryptocurrency exchanges, with a slight 0.3% decline. Seeing red on the Dogecoin chart is surprising to many, as the original meme coin is often expected to lead during a bull market rally. Does this indicate that the market no longer supports Dogecoin? The short answer is ‘No.’ The market is currently consolidating, which tends to impact cryptocurrencies like DOGE that lack significant utility With DOGE being sluggish, it’s best to invest elsewhere. 1Fuel, which is currently in presale, serves as the best investment vehicle as it offers real-world utility. 1Fuel ignites interest: How its privacy features Are revolutionizing DeFi The cryptocurrency market is growing steadily. New tokens are introduced daily, but most are hype-driven rather than practical. To change financial services, blockchain tokens must have real-world value. Additionally, these tokens must provide solutions to the technological hurdles within the sector. 1Fuel is coming to rewrite the rules and introduce a whole new level of functionality. The project will create a cryptocurrency wallet that automates complex operations while ensuring top-tier security and privacy. This will allow users to interact with digital assets more confidently and comfortably. It is friendly to both new and seasoned traders. Holding 1Fuel tokens earns users a 30% staking reward. This converts investment into an ongoing revenue source. Second, there would be a peer-to-peer exchange. This function removes the middleman, allowing users to trade directly with other users. Finally, 1Fuel takes things to the next level by offering debit cards. This allows users to effortlessly spend from their cryptocurrency wallet in the real world. At the moment, 1Fuel is in its second presale stage. The first stage was a huge success as the tokens were sold out in record time. This momentum has been passed on to the second stage, as 1Fuel has sold over 13% of the tokens allocated to this stage. This is the ideal time to purchase 1Fuel as a token costs $0.012. Conclusion Meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin have failed to meet market expectations. However, 1Fuel’s approach has set it on the right path for massive growth. At $0.012/token, the presale offers 1FUEL at a cheap price. Buy and watch an investment soar when 1FUEL hits the top cryptocurrency exchanges!

Ripple CTO David Schwartz has clarified that these fluctuations are attributed to limited supply and heightened demand during the early phase of the stablecoin’s release. David Schwartz Explains $1,200 Ripple RLUSD Price Spike Ripple’s USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, recorded an unexpected valuation of $1,200 on decentralized exchanges (DEX) before its official launch. This has been linked to supply shortages and heightened demand for the token during its pre-release phase. David Schwartz, Ripple’s CTO, explained that the inflated valuation stems from market tools that reflect the highest price bidders are willing to pay. He emphasized that the pricing is not the actual value of RLUSD but rather a result of limited availability. Schwartz assured investors that once the stablecoin reaches sufficient circulation, its price would stabilize near the $1 benchmark. Additionally, last week, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) granted regulatory clearance for Ripple’s RLUSD, positioning it for entry into the stablecoin market. This approval was a critical step for Ripple, as the company expands its portfolio with a regulated USD-pegged asset. Testing for RLUSD has been underway since August, with developers and institutional partners refining its functionality to ensure parity with the U.S. dollar. The stablecoin’s official launch will boost its role in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. Early Transactions Indicate Demand Despite Price Instability In the days leading up to its launch, RLUSD saw limited minting, with speculative traders engaging in high-priced transactions on platforms like the Xaman XRP wallet. Reports indicate that one such transaction priced a fraction of RLUSD at 511 XRP, equivalent to over $1,200. Schwartz noted that some users may be paying inflated amounts for the perceived novelty of holding the first batch of Ripple RLUSD. He reiterated that these prices will revert to $1 once supply meets demand. The Ripple CTO emphasized, “The whole point of a stablecoin is to have a stable price. Short-term changes in prices due to shortages of supply or demand are certainly possible, especially around launch, but they shouldn’t remain for very long as arbitragers rapidly fix the market. Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich.” The stablecoin will complement XRP’s utility, leveraging its established exchange presence to ensure liquidity and minimize the risk of depegging. More so, reports indicate that the XRP company minted 13.9 million RLUSD tokens across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum Network. The minting includes 2.6 million RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and 11 million RLUSD on Ethereum. Following the imminent launch of Ripple RLUSD stablecoin, XRP has seen notable price activity, currently trading at $2.37. Over the past month, XRP price surged by 111%, driven by investor anticipation and growing market confidence.

According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings , Riot Platforms bought 667 Bitcoin ( BTC ), increasing its total crypto holdings to 17,429 BTC. Riot acquired this tranche at an average price of $101,135 per coin, bringing the total value of its Bitcoin balance to nearly $2 billion at the December 16 peak price of $106,000. The company began mining Bitcoin in 2018 at its Oklahoma facility after shifting its corporate focus. Inspired by MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor’s “sell shares, buy BTC” strategy, Riot expanded its approach to include Bitcoin purchases and share buybacks, further growing its crypto reserves. You might also like: MicroStrategy registers new $1.5b Bitcoin buy By combining mining operations with strategic market purchases, Riot has generated a notable BTC yield. This metric measures the difference between BTC holdings and share dilution. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, Riot has achieved a 36.7% BTC yield, with a year-to-date yield of 37.2%. Despite ongoing debates surrounding the Saylor-instigated practice, BTC miners like Riot and other corporations have increasingly offered share rights to raise capital for Bitcoin purchases, albeit less aggressively than MicroStrategy. Riot recently closed a $594 million convertible bond sale, channeling the proceeds to finance more BTC buys. Marathon Digital, another BTC miner, executed a similar plan – selling senior notes for cash to acquire BTC.

Zhang emphasizes the importance of AI and digitalization in future investment strategies. Investment success requires adapting to market dynamics with smart technologies and AI. China’s capital markets may enter a new bull cycle, driven by digital innovations. The future of capital markets lies in the transformative power of smart technologies. Zhang Bao Long, a renowned investor and strategic advisor for Finanx AI , often called China’s “Warren Buffett,” emphasizes that digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI) will shape investment strategies as market complexities grow. He believes that smart tools are critical for improving market efficiency and helping investors adapt to volatile global markets. The convergence of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology is already transforming the financial landscape, creating new opportunities for innovation and efficiency. Finanx AI leads this revolution, using cutting-edge AI combined with blockchain to take trading to new heights. This vision is matched by Zhang’s forward-thinking insights about the necessity that investors embrace innovation for future success in an increasingly digitized market. Evolution of Investment Strategies Zhang views capital markets as a domain requiring systematic expertise, combining strategy design, knowledge, and empirical analysis. He stresses that investment success demands more than buying and selling; it requires understanding complex market dynamics. According to him, future growth opportunities lie in emerging sectors, particularly those leveraging digital assets, AI, and big data technologies. As smart technologies evolve, traditional investment approaches will need to incorporate these tools to keep pace. The Role of Quantitative Trading in Modern Markets Quantitative trading has significantly advanced, but Zhang believes its implementation must account for localized market systems. In China, the T+1 trading mechanism demands tailored strategies to achieve greater flexibility. Zhang predicts that technology-driven trading systems will allow for more agile decision-making, unlocking new opportunities. However, he urges investors to remain vigilant about policy changes, as these significantly influence market trends. Modern investing is increasingly driven by behavioral finance principles. Zhang argues that market movements often follow emotional patterns, creating both risks and opportunities. Identifying these signs can assist investors in keeping their cool during periods of extreme fluctuations and making rational decisions. Comprehending behavioral patterns are important for managing the risks associated with volatile markets, and more importantly, securing revenues in volatile conditions. Emergence of a Bull Market Cycle Zhang is optimistic about China’s capital markets entering a new bull cycle in 2024. He links this potential growth to global economic shifts, with digital and intelligent sectors leading the way.

This highlights improving investor sentiment toward the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. The Market: Zooming Out According to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , overall, digital asset investment products saw $3.2 billion in inflows last week. This was the 10th consecutive week of positive momentum, bringing total inflows this year to a whopping $44.5 billion – over four times higher than any previous year. ETPs have seen weekly trading volumes averaging $21 billion, making up 30% of Bitcoin trading on trusted exchanges. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume across all investment types on trusted exchanges averaged $8.3 billion this year, twice that of the FTSE 100. Interestingly, Bitcoin investment products contributed $2 billion to the weekly inflows, reaching $11.5 billion since the US election. Amidst recent price surges, short Bitcoin products gained $14.6 million, although assets under management (AuM) for this category remain modest at $130 million. XRP Sees Renewed Interest After Ethereum, XRP was the biggest winner among the altcoins, seeing inflows of $145 million as hopes rose for a US-listed ETF. Another factor that could have catalyzed this trend was the imminent debut of Ripple’s newly NYDFS-approved stablecoin RLUSD. Next up was Litecoin, with $2.2 million in inflows over the past week, followed by Cardano with $1.9 million and Solana with $1.7 million. Additionally, Binance and Chainlink attracted $0.7 million in inflows each. On the other hand, multi-asset products faced yet another setback, with $31 million in outflows during the same period. Meanwhile, there was a positive trend across regions, with inflows recorded in all areas. The US topped the list with $3.14 billion in inflows. Next up were Switzerland with $35.6 million and Germany with $32.9 million over the past week. Brazil also saw strong inflows of $24.7 million, with Hong Kong, Canada, and Australia adding $9.7 million, $4.9 million, and $3.8 million, respectively. In contrast, Sweden faced outflows of $19 million.

In a filing shared on X by Longo, the owner claims Binance unlawfully used his “Peanut the Squirrel” trademark and mascot likeness to promote the PNUT crypto coin without authorization. According to the complaint from his legal team, Longo has operated under the PNUT brand since 2017, focusing on educational outreach and animal welfare. The cease-and-desist letter demands that Binance immediately halt all use of the PNUT marks and mascot imagery. If the exchange does not comply, Longo’s attorneys will reportedly push for it to pay fines of up to $150,000 per infringement. Source: CoinMarketCap The PNUT token initially gained traction after being listed on Binance but has since seen fluctuating performance. At press time, per CoinMarketCap data, PNUT’s price has declined by about 9% from its value 24 hours ago and about 19% in the last 30 days. Longo disputes PNUT token branding Longo’s legal team alleges that Binance used the terms “PEANUT THE SQUIRREL” and “PNUT,” as well as a copyrighted image of Longo’s squirrel mascot, without permission. The branding associated with the PNUT memecoin reportedly mimics Longo’s mascot, creating confusion among consumers and falsely suggesting Longo’s endorsement. Source: Squirrel_Dad via X The PNUT token launched in early November, gaining rapid popularity amid a controversial backstory. The memecoin draws inspiration from a pet squirrel named Peanut, who became the center of public outrage after being euthanized by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) during a rabies-testing operation. Binance has not yet publicly responded to the allegations outlined in Longo’s cease-and-desist letter. Peanut had reportedly lived indoors for years and exhibited no signs of the disease, leading critics, including Elon Musk and President-elect Trump, to denounce the incident as unnecessary. The uproar surrounding Peanut’s death quickly garnered massive attention online, with Musk provocatively commenting that “Donald Trump would save the squirrels.” The controversy, coupled with the token’s viral appeal, spurred significant interest in PNUT. Early adopters of the token saw meteoric gains as the coin’s price surged during its initial market bull run. Battle with the crypto community Despite its success, Longo has accused the PNUT community of exploiting his story for financial gain. In a now-deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), Longo stated, “ The $PNUT community USED MY STORY, MY SQUIRREL, AND MY LIKENESS TO MAKE MILLIONS! ” He also claimed the PNUT community raised $50,000 in donations on his behalf but misappropriated the funds. Furthermore, he says he received no substantial support despite the token’s financial success. It’s insane! He asks insane amounts of money to people, and Mark if you are reading this, do not deny please because that will just make it ugly! The community token @OGpeanut_sol gave you money, as a support donation to the cause of Peanut! You think you can just do this and… — Dennis ‘The Crypto Lion King’ (@TheL1onK1ngCryp) November 25, 2024 In response to the controversy, Longo launched his own token, JUSTICE, on the Solana blockchain. He described JUSTICE as the only legitimate tribute to Peanut and another squirrel named Fred, aiming to reclaim his story. A few weeks after JUSTICE was launched, news surfaced about insider trading, and analysts raised concerns about a potential 80% of its supply being controlled by “insiders.” As seen in several replies to the cease and desist filing post on X, the community threatened to sue Lango for the “farms and rugs.” he’s supposedly involved in, citing memecoins such as Justice for Peanut, a token that performed rather poorly since its inception. Should I sue you too, you shameless liar? The FBI should shoot you dead and let you go to heaven with your squirrels. pic.twitter.com/SgfZw7ogzw — 六子 | 搞笑小猫.sol🦄🀄 (@0x_CryptoFury) December 16, 2024 One user explained how PNUT came into the market to “bring attention” to Lango’s cause, and without it, not many would have been aware of his story. Community-driven memecoin tokens thrive on viral stories, memes, or cultural references to attract widespread attention and investor enthusiasm. They typically rely on decentralized networks, with branding and marketing often shaped by the community rather than a centralized authority. Longo’s lawsuit could be dismissed if the PNUT token’s creators argue that their branding constitutes fair use or parody, common defenses in the memecoin space. Additionally, due to the decentralized nature of the token, Binance may argue that it merely facilitated the trading of the asset rather than creating or endorsing it.

PNUT is one such coin that has gained maximum traction by over 1000% within a few days of its launch. If you’ve missed the profit-making opportunity through the PNUT, here’s the next memecoin that is going to revolutionize. Header, a quirky and entertaining meme coin built on the unpredictable nature of chickens, has officially hatched on Solana. Flap, flutter, and get ready to soar into the wild nest of cryptocurrencies with Header! It is about to launch and will skyrocket by over 1000% in a few days. Headerworld Launches the Quirky HEADER The Header meme coin is launched on the idea that chickens are the ultimate metaphor for success. Chickens represent huge opportunities as they hustle and survive on Earth and even on Mars! In a parallel universe, President-elect Donald Trump and tech mogul Elon Musk entered into a bizarre yet memorable conversation. The light-hearted conversation spiraled into a meme, and fans demanded a meme token. And there marks the birth of HEADER. The meme originates from Trump’s recent advocacy for cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. His promise to transform the US into a market leader and Musk’s aid has caught the community’s attention. Inspired by these influential figures’ support for the crypto space, HEADER is here to make history! Memecoin Market The $133.3 billion meme coin market has seen a rollercoaster ride, with the top tokens plummeting. Popular meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), dogwifcat (WIF), Bonk (BONK), and Floki (FLOKI) have experienced notable declines. Meanwhile, the Solana-based Pnut, the Squirrel (PNUT), took center stage, rallying by over 2000% since its launch. PNUT’s Remarkable Journey Amidst the overarching downtrend in the crypto market in general, and memecoins in particular, PNUT bucked the trend, marking notable gains. The token was launched at the onset of November 2024, inspired by a pet squirrel named Peanut. While the squirrel’s euthanasia for a rabies test caused controversy, Musk called it the “government overreach” and called out Trump to save the squirrels. Later, Musk’s reference to a cryptic Squirrel meme took PNUT to an astonishing jump. How will these high-profile leaders’ involvement in HEADER influence the token?! HEADER: The Beginning of a New Trend The HEADER token relies on Trump’s deal to make everything great and Musk’s aim of taking everything to Mars. Unlike other meme coins, HEADER leverages the unmatched combination of Trump's deal-making prowess and Musk's vision for space conquest. This unusual blend of personalities highlights the project's ambitious targets, setting it apart from the rest of the memecoin space. Tokenomics and Presale: Empowering a New Era of Innovation HEADER is committed to making a lasting impact, with a staggering 1 trillion token supply and 0% tax. The community is excited with the news of a 40% token presale, priced at an unbeatable 0.0000000075 SOL. To participate, investors must purchase a minimum of 0.05 SOL worth of tokens. The presale aims to raise a minimum of 300 SOL (soft cap) and a maximum of 3000 SOL (hard cap). Interestingly, the team has allocated 46% of tokens for DEX listing, liquidity, and community airdrop, ensuring a strong foundation for the project's growth. In addition, a 10% is scheduled for the marketing, events, and listing. And finally, the team will retain a 4%. Moreover, in a surprise twist, a mystery event will be unveiled when the hard cap is reached. Header Coin’s Use Cases The Header token is launched to redefine the blockchain space with its innovative use cases, leveraging the Solana network. The ecosystem provides unparalleled speed and utility to the holders. Being a community-powered coin, HEADER boasts a vivacious online culture. The dedicated community of supporters and developers collaborate to drive adoption and enhance its utility, creating a rich and dynamic ecosystem that continues to evolve and grow. Conclusion While new memecoins are launched daily, the HEADER token is set to leave its mark in the sphere with its unique blend of humor, innovation, and ambition. With its impressive tokenomics, engaging community, and commitment to crossing the boundaries, HEADER is set to redefine how we think about memecoins.

After trading in a sideways range within an ascending triangle for weeks, the price finally broke through the crucial $103,600 resistance level established on December 5. This breakout has sparked renewed excitement, with traders and investors now eyeing Bitcoin’s next potential targets. Related Reading: Ethereum Forming A Symmetrical Pattern – Key Resistance At $4,100 Top analyst Jelle shared his insights on X, highlighting that Bitcoin’s breakout from the ascending triangle is a clear bullish signal. According to his technical analysis, the pattern indicates significant upside potential, with Jelle setting a $130,000 price target for BTC in the coming weeks. He noted that the breakout marks a shift in market sentiment, paving the way for sustained momentum as Bitcoin continues its climb. This milestone solidifies Bitcoin’s dominant position in the crypto market as the leading asset, attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors. Now, the focus turns to whether BTC can maintain its bullish momentum and how quickly it might reach the $130,000 target. The market awaits the next move, with analysts emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin holding above its previous resistance to sustain this historic rally. Bitcoin Price Remains Strong Bitcoin has been consolidating around the $100,000 mark since late November, creating a tense atmosphere among investors who are now speculating about a potential correction. Despite this, Bitcoin’s price action remains firmly bullish, with consistent support above key levels, suggesting that the uptrend is far from over. The consolidation phase, while uneventful on the surface, often sets the stage for significant moves. Top analyst Jelle recently shared his technical analysis on X, highlighting that Bitcoin has broken out of an ascending triangle formation—a bullish continuation pattern that signals further upside potential. Following this breakout, Bitcoin has re-entered price discovery, pushing beyond its previous all-time high and igniting fresh excitement among market participants. Jelle has set an ambitious $130,000 target for Bitcoin, emphasizing that the breakout could accelerate the asset’s momentum in the coming weeks. As Bitcoin’s rally progresses, the broader market dynamics are likely to shift, with altcoins historically following BTC’s lead during bull runs. Analysts and investors anticipate that once Bitcoin resumes its climb, the altcoin market will respond with its own significant gains, marking the start of another euphoric phase for the crypto space. Related Reading: AAVE Dominates DeFi Lending – Metrics Reveal 45% Market Share For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin, with its ability to sustain above $100,000 and break through resistance levels like $103,600, which is critical for maintaining its bullish trajectory. Testing Fresh Supply Into Price Discovery Bitcoin is trading at $105,100 after reaching a new all-time high at $106,533 earlier today. The price broke above the critical $102,200 resistance, a level that had previously capped upward movements. This breakout has reignited bullish momentum, signaling that Bitcoin could be on track for even higher prices. For the rally to sustain, the $102,200 level must now act as support, providing a solid foundation for the next leg up. If Bitcoin holds above this level, traders anticipate continuing toward higher targets, with $110,000 and beyond within reach. However, market volatility remains a concern. A loss of the psychological $100,000 mark could signal underlying weakness, leading to a potential correction. In such a scenario, BTC might retrace to test lower demand zones, possibly around $95,000, before finding renewed support. Related Reading: ONDO Exchange Inflows Grow – Volatility Ahead? Despite the risks, Bitcoin’s bullish structure remains intact as long as key levels hold. The breakout above $102,200 highlights strong buying interest, and many analysts believe this could be the start of an extended rally. However, the next few days will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin can maintain its momentum or if it will face a short-term pullback. For now, the market is closely watching for Bitcoin’s next move.

RLUSD will be initially listed on several exchanges and crypto platforms including Uphold, MoonPay, Archax and CoinMENA, the company said in a press release, with further listings on Bitso, Bullish, Bitstamp, Mercado Bitcoin and Independent Reserve, Zero Hash and others in the coming weeks. The company also announced two additions to its stablecoin advisory board: Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Kenneth Montgomery, former first vice president and COO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. The pair join board members announced in October including Sheila Bair, former chair of FDIC, and Chris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman and co-founder of Ripple. The launch follows Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse's announcement last week that RLUSD sealed ""final approval"" from the New York Department of Financial Services, paving the way for rolling out the stablecoin for the public from its test phase . RLUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. government bonds and cash equivalents and aims to keep a steady price at $1. With RLUSD, Ripple aims to compete for a piece in the rapidly growing stablecoin market, currently dominated by Tether's $140 billion USDT and Circle's $40 billion USDC tokens. Stablecoins are a key piece of infrastructure bridging digital asset markets and traditional finance, serving as liquidity for trading, vehicle for blockchain-based transactions and increasingly as a payment method across borders. Traditional financial institutions such as banks and payment companies including PayPal, Visa and Societe Generale have also entered the stablecoin space as regulators around the world put rules and guidelines in place for the asset class, bringing much-desired regulatory clarity. “Early on, Ripple made a deliberate choice to launch our stablecoin under the NYDFS limited purpose trust company charter, widely regarded as the premier regulatory standard worldwide,"" Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a statement. ""As the U.S. moves toward clearer regulations, we expect to see greater adoption of stablecoins like RLUSD, which offer real utility and are backed by years of trust and expertise in the industry."" RLUSD will be initially available in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, UK and Middle East regions via its distribution and exchange partners, Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoin at Ripple, said in an interview with CoinDesk. He was CEO of Standard Custody & Trust, a company acquired by Ripple earlier this year that holds a New York Trust license. The token won't be accessible in the E.U. in the beginning as Ripple does not hold the necessary license under the bloc's MiCAR regulations, but the company is ""actively exploring"" ways to enter the bloc's market, he added. RLUSD volatility warning RLUSD, which aims to hold a $1 price, may see an unusual price volatility due to early demand from traders and limited supply. ""There may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes,"" David Schwartz, chief technology officer at Ripple, warned in an X post . He said that some traders ""are willing to pay"" as much as $1,200 token price to buy a fraction of RLUSD. ""Please don't FOMO into a stablecoin,"" he added. ""This is not an opportunity to get rich.""",Finance|Stablecoin|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-16 16:00:50

The transformations started early and just kept coming. What’s astounding to me is that at no time during this year did the overall direction or the market change. The only thing that happened was constant acceleration. At the end of 2023, we already knew that 2024 was looking likely to turn out well. The European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MICA) act was going to come into effect. This created a legal framework for crypto-assets, real-world assets and stablecoins in Europe. We were already seeing business turn up across the region in anticipation of this transformation. And then as we entered 2024, the hits just kept on coming. The first Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision to officially approve the Bitcoin ETF came 10 days into the year, followed by Ethereum in May. By the middle of the year, the conversation shifted from one of two cool things happening to a more general vision of global regulatory convergence: everywhere around the world, crypto, digital assets and stablecoins are becoming legally accessible to individuals and enterprises. As if things were not going well enough, a string of regulatory and legal successes in the U.S. was capped off by an election that, among many other things, has sealed the direction and fate of this industry. It is not an exaggeration to say that on the morning of Nov. 6, the world of blockchain looked vastly different. What was a gradual shift towards regulatory approvals, public blockchains and legalized digital assets has become a sprint. Most importantly, permissioned blockchains, tokenized deposits and other aspects of the blockchain ecosystem that existed solely because they were seen as more acceptable to regulators than public blockchains have all lost their market value and position. Clients that were cautious in October now suddenly worry that they are losing an intensely competitive race. Two months ago, the U.S. was a laggard in global regulatory convergence. Today, the prospects are that the U.S. will accelerate significantly and, possibly, leave other parts of the world behind in a rapid path towards acceptance and scaling of digital assets. Early cabinet picks and appointments in Trump’s administration announced already, show a strong pro-crypto and digital assets bias, though none of these will take effect until 2025. Furthermore, on Nov. 26, a federal appeals court rejected efforts by the Treasury Department to sanction Tornado Cash, a piece of privacy software used to make anonymous payments. The Treasury alleges that this technology was used to launder money for North Korea. Advocates for crypto technology did not dispute that but argued that the Treasury should go after individuals or entities responsible rather than a particular piece of software, especially one that operates on a decentralized network with no specific owner or operator. The U.S. and Europe are still pursuing cases against individuals who are deemed responsible. Privacy technology is going to be especially important in driving future adoption of blockchain technology among enterprises and institutions. Tornado Cash was never an attractive option for business users, as it intertwined two different concepts: privacy and anonymity. Business users are not looking for anonymous payments and transfers, but they do, however, need to keep details from their competition. A favorable court ruling on privacy generally will make business users feel more comfortable leveraging privacy technologies on-chain. It would be great to end the story of 2024 here. A happy ending. But there are storm clouds on the horizon and there’s no sense in ignoring them. The blockchain industry has traditionally always delivered, often around the holidays, a series of “gifts” for the industry’s critics. Usually this is in the form of spectacular frauds, thefts, or business collapses. This year, though we haven’t yet had the kind of collapse that will push politics off the table at holiday gatherings, we do seem to be speed-running the traditional crypto business cycle. If you’ve been following pump.fun, you will have seen the casino-like atmosphere that’s taken hold. People have been chaining themselves to toilets and inventing memes to create tradeable tokens and make money. It’s all (sometimes) very funny until someone loses their child’s college fund. Don’t let a few clouds on the horizon spoil the good end of year vibes. 2024 was an exceptional year for blockchain. We didn’t change direction, but we started moving a lot faster. 2025 will see revolution by acceleration and plenty of sunshine.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. A veteran trader predicts Bitcoin at $150K and Ethereum at $5K by summer, spotlighting 5 altcoins primed for big gains. The crypto market is on the cusp of a seismic shift as a veteran trader predicts Bitcoin’s surge to $150,000 and Ethereum’s climb to $5,000 by summer. These ambitious projections come alongside a focus on five altcoins that could mirror this bullish momentum. From unique meme coins like Catzilla to established players like Solana and Uniswap, these assets are set to capitalize on the anticipated market upswing, drawing the attention of savvy investors eager for substantial returns. Catzilla: The roaring meme coin set to shake the crypto world The meme coin arena is brimming with fresh contenders, but Catzilla is carving out a unique niche with unmatched potential. Drawing inspiration from icons like Dogecoin (DOGE) , Shiba Inu (SHIB) , and PEPE, Catzilla combines meme-worthy fun with robust growth strategies. Its standout feature? A bold narrative of a colossal, Godzilla-like cat tearing through cities—a nod to Japanese kaiju culture that fuels its viral appeal. But Catzilla isn’t just about the memes. It merges gaming, storytelling, and crypto, capturing the attention of anime enthusiasts, gamers, and meme coin investors alike. This chaotic yet clever branding positions Catzilla as more than just a passing trend — it’s a movement.

With its action-packed game mechanics, players can earn rewards while diving into a world of epic kaiju battles. At its core, Catzilla champions a mission to create a decentralized, inclusive ecosystem, uniting its vibrant community of cat lovers, crypto enthusiasts, and anime fans. Join the Catzilla uprising As a symbol of resistance against greed and manipulation in the crypto world, Catzilla embodies a rebellious spirit that resonates with its audience. Its playful yet purpose-driven mission seeks to restore the original ethos of meme coins: fun, community-driven, and transparent. Uniswap poised for a bullish breakout amid altcoin season hype Uniswap’s price has surged over 100% in the past month, signaling strong upward momentum. Despite a slight pullback of around 8% this week, UNI remains above key support levels. The Relative Strength Index is 46.28, suggesting there’s room for growth. With the nearest resistance at $23.88, breaking through could propel the price toward the next target of $30.92. This represents a potential gain of over 40% from current levels. As the crypto market gears up for a new altcoin season, Uniswap’s decentralized exchange platform positions it favorably to capture market interest and possibly lead the next rally. Solana poised for growth amid altcoin season anticipation Solana (SOL) has been trading between $219.27 and $251.07. The coin recently saw a monthly price increase of 4.66% and a substantial six-month rise of 53.02%. With an RSI near the neutral mark, Solana is neither overbought nor oversold. The slight negative MACD suggests potential upward movement. If SOL breaks the nearest resistance at $264, it could target the next level at $296, representing a possible gain of around 20%. The simple moving averages show consolidation, with the 10-day at $220.35 and the 100-day at $224.51. The anticipated altcoin season might propel Solana’s price even higher. Raydium poised for growth amidst altcoin season hype Raydium’s price ranges between $4.64 and $5.33, showing steady movement. The nearest resistance level is at $5.68; breaking this could lead to a rise toward $6.38. The nearest support is at $4.30, providing a safety net. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $5.29 and $5.38, suggesting consolidation. The RSI stands at 46.62, indicating neutral momentum. In the past six months, RAY’s price has increased by 234.18%, reflecting significant growth. If the altcoin season gains momentum, RAY might continue its upward trend. However, market indicators show mixed signals, so monitoring the price action is essential. Cronos poised for breakout as altcoin season nears Over the past week, Cronos (CRO) dipped by over 13%, but monthly gains are close to 17%, and the past six months show an impressive 86% growth. The price is currently between $0.1725 and $0.2311. Technical indicators like RSI at 43.58 and Stochastic at 17.62 suggest the coin is oversold. The nearest resistance is at $0.2616. If CRO breaks this level, it could move towards the next resistance at $0.3202, offering potential gains of over 40%. With altcoin season approaching and a global crypto bull run expected, CRO has strong potential to rise significantly. Conclusion As the crypto market braces for a potential breakout, Bitcoin and Ethereum’s projected milestones could set the stage for altcoin dominance. Tokens like Catzilla, with its engaging narrative and robust ROI potential, and established assets like Uniswap, Solana, Raydium, and Cronos, are uniquely positioned to benefit from the anticipated bullish trends. Whether someone is seeking meme coin thrills or the stability of seasoned altcoins, this lineup offers diverse opportunities to ride the wave of crypto’s next big rally.

Although this was good news for the project, the price didn’t meet analysts’ expectations. An overview of the 30-day chart shows PEPE increased by 29.2%, which is disappointing. At the moment, the token is 12.7% down from its ATH. As a meme coin, Pepe’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment. Failing to maintain its ATH paints a picture of little to no community support. Without the backing of crypto enthusiasts, analysts anticipate Pepe price stagnation on the charts. Investors looking for gains during this bull are advised to purchase 1Fuel, as it isn’t wholly dependent on sentiment. 1Fuel has functionality such as its privacy feature, which Pepe lacks. It is currently on presale and has the potential to outperform Pepe. Dogecoin ‘s lost bark: Meme coin’s underperformance raises questions about its future Being the top dog, analysts predicted that Dogecoin would skyrocket towards the end of the year. However, the token has failed to meet these expectations. DOGE is 44.4% below its ATH of $0.7316, recorded on May 8, 2021. The price has been steady in the last 30 days on cryptocurrencies exchanges, with a slight 0.3% decline. Seeing red on the Dogecoin chart is surprising to many, as the original meme coin is often expected to lead during a bull market rally. Does this indicate that the market no longer supports Dogecoin? The short answer is ‘No.’ The market is currently consolidating, which tends to impact cryptocurrencies like DOGE that lack significant utility With DOGE being sluggish, it’s best to invest elsewhere. 1Fuel, which is currently in presale, serves as the best investment vehicle as it offers real-world utility. 1Fuel ignites interest: How its privacy features Are revolutionizing DeFi The cryptocurrency market is growing steadily. New tokens are introduced daily, but most are hype-driven rather than practical. To change financial services, blockchain tokens must have real-world value. Additionally, these tokens must provide solutions to the technological hurdles within the sector. 1Fuel is coming to rewrite the rules and introduce a whole new level of functionality. The project will create a cryptocurrency wallet that automates complex operations while ensuring top-tier security and privacy. This will allow users to interact with digital assets more confidently and comfortably. It is friendly to both new and seasoned traders. Holding 1Fuel tokens earns you a 30% staking reward. This converts investment into an ongoing revenue source. Second, there would be a peer-to-peer exchange. This function removes the middleman, allowing users to trade directly with other users. Finally, 1Fuel takes things to the next level by offering debit cards. This allows users to effortlessly spend from their cryptocurrency wallet in the real world. At the moment, 1Fuel is in its second presale stage. The first stage was a huge success as the tokens were sold out in record time. This momentum has been passed on to the second stage, as 1Fuel has sold over 13% of the tokens allocated to this stage. This is the ideal time to purchase 1Fuel as a token costs $0.012. Conclusion Meme coins like Pepe and Dogecoin have failed to meet market expectations. However, 1Fuel’s approach has set it on the right path for massive growth. At $0.012/token, the presale offers 1FUEL at a cheap price. Buy and watch your investment soar when 1FUEL hits the top cryptocurrency exchanges!
