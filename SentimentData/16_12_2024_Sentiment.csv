While some, like AAVE, are showing signs of strength, others, like MANA, remain in consolidation mode, waiting their turn in the spotlight, according to the analyst. Martinez noted that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market due to a combination of strong rhetoric and fundamentals. The key factors include: The growing importance of the US Bitcoin Reserve. Anticipation surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock's 2% portfolio allocation recommendation to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is included in the Nasdaq 100. Martinez noted that Ethereum (ETH) has historically outperformed Bitcoin every December, pointing to the importance of timing and positioning. “If you’re investing in altcoins, the important thing is to get into projects with strong fundamentals early on,” he said. Martinez warned investors not to chase memecoins and be tempted by the lure of quick riches, instead focusing on altcoins with real utility and strong fundamentals that have a better chance of generating sustainable gains. Related News: An Extraordinary Proposal for Bitcoin: ""Make 1 Satoshi Now 1 BTC"" According to Martinez, several altcoins stand out as potential winners in the next market cycle: Worldcoin (WLD): A new project that aims to revolutionize identity and global finance. Uniswap (UNI): Leading decentralized exchange with a proven track record. AAVE: A DeFi leader that is already showing its strength. Chainlink (LINK): The home of widely adopted decentralized oracles. Maker (MKR): A stablecoin and one of the cornerstones of DeFi. ONDO: Positioned to capitalize on the narrative of tokenized real-world assets. Solana (SOL): Known for its speed, scalability, and thriving ecosystem. BNB: Exchange token with wide usage and market relevance. “These are not just ‘hype coins,’” Martinez said. “These are projects with solid use cases that can weather market volatility.” “For sustainable gains, position yourself where the smart money is flowing,” he said, suggesting that the next altcoin season may be closer than expected. *This is not investment advice.

Qubetics Brings a Fresh Start for High-Growth Investments,https://thecoinrise.com/did-you-overlook-crypto-trends-qubetics-brings-a-fresh-start-for-high-growth-investments/,"Have you ever wondered what might have been if you’d acted on early crypto trends? AAVE is a prime example of a project that started small but exploded into a major force in decentralised finance. It began quietly, with many sceptical of its potential, but today, AAVE is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. If you missed the boat then, you’re not alone. Luckily, new opportunities are always around the corner. This time, Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in with its groundbreaking innovations and a presale that’s catching the eye of investors.

It started as ETHLend in 2017, launching with an ICO that priced its tokens at just $0.0162. At the time, decentralised finance was still a niche concept, and many overlooked its potential. Fast forward to today, AAVE has grown into a powerhouse, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their assets without traditional intermediaries.

Partnerships and integrations have only added to its credibility, making it a long-term success story. For those who missed out on AAVE’s early days, the regret is real. Its value has multiplied many times over, showing what’s possible when you invest early in a project with strong fundamentals.

BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now – Don’t Regret It Twice!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bonks-moonshot-btfd-coin-is-the-best-meme-coin-presale-to-join-now-dont-regret-it-twice/,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on meme coins, you’ve probably heard of BONK. It exploded onto the scene as Solana’s first dog-themed meme coin, driving a frenzy in the crypto world. Back when it launched, early adopters were laughing all the way to the bank, turning tiny investments into jaw-dropping gains. BONK wasn’t just another token; it was a movement, a viral sensation. But here’s the thing – if you weren’t there to grab BONK during its early days, you might’ve missed the chance to cash in big time. Fast forward to today, BONK still holds a solid spot in the meme coin landscape, but the astronomical gains are harder to catch now. As it stabilises, those dreams of turning a hundred bucks into a small fortune feel like a distant memory. If you’re wondering whether history will repeat itself, well, it kind of is—but not with BONK. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a meme coin rewriting the playbook and turning heads during its explosive presale phase. Why BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now Launched with the mantra “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD Coin has become the hottest topic in crypto circles. With over $3.9 million raised in its presale and a price of $0.00013 per coin, BTFD is delivering on its promise to make sure you never miss a juicy dip again. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a full-blown movement, complete with its own P2E game, staking rewards, and an engaging community called the Bulls Squad. Here’s the kicker: when the presale ends, the listing price will jump to $0.0006. That means if you put in just $1,500 now, you’d snag a whopping 15 million BTFD coins. Once the coin hits the market at its projected price, your investment could skyrocket to $9,000 . Multiply that by the staking APY of up to 90%, and you’re looking at gains that most meme coins can only dream of. The presale has already sold over 55 billion coins to 5,400 holders, and with every passing stage, the price edges higher. Whether you’ve got 1 Ethereum (buying you 38,863,600 coins) or 1 Solana (grabbing 2,287,200 coins), the entry points are as diverse as they are lucrative. And if you’re into gaming, the BTFD P2E platform offers even more ways to earn. But what makes BTFD truly revolutionary is its community-driven ethos. With its Bulls Squad leading the charge, this token is built to withstand the wild swings of crypto markets and turn every dip into a launchpad for growth. Missed BONK? Don’t miss the lucrative BTFD presale . BONK vs. BTFD: A Tale of Two Meme Coins Comparing BONK to BTFD is like comparing yesterday’s news to tomorrow’s headline. BONK had its moment of glory, rallying meme coin enthusiasts around its quirky branding and strong community vibes. When it launched, its price surged astronomically, creating millionaires out of early believers. Even today, BONK remains a staple of Solana’s ecosystem, celebrated for its contribution to meme coin culture. But let’s not sugarcoat it: BONK’s peak growth is behind us. Its current price movements are more about consolidation than explosive growth. Analysts predict steady, albeit modest, increases in BONK’s value as it integrates deeper into Solana’s ecosystem. While that’s great news for existing holders, it leaves little room for the kind of exponential gains new investors crave. On the other hand, BTFD Coin is fresh out of the gates, riding a wave of excitement that shows no signs of slowing down. Its Ethereum-based foundation ensures scalability and security, while its built-in staking and gaming mechanisms make it far more than just a token – it’s an ecosystem. This combination of innovation and community engagement positions BTFD as the best meme coin presale to join now , eclipsing BONK’s fading spotlight. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Your Second Best Chance Crypto opportunities don’t come with guarantees, but they do come with patterns. BONK’s meteoric rise was a wake-up call for anyone sleeping on meme coins. If you missed that boat, don’t let BTFD Coin sail without you. With its presale already turning heads, this coin is set to redefine what it means to “buy the dip.” BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement, a rallying cry, and your ticket to being part of the next big thing. As the presale heats up and stages fly by, waiting could cost you dearly. So, what are you waiting for? Join the BTFD presale today and stake your claim in crypto history. Don’t let hindsight be 20/20 again. If BONK taught us anything, it’s that timing is everything. BTFD Coin is here to prove that lightning does strike twice – if you’re bold enough to catch it.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 22:07:57

Justin Bons, Cyber Capital founder and CIO, argues in a recent tweet that AI-enabled wallets will be the death of ETH’s ambitions of streamlining its ecosystem. Bons wrote: AI agents embedded in user wallets will revolutionize the crypto User Experience! Hilariously it will also be the last nail in the coffin for ETH alignment. ~Justin Bons He added that the situation would arise from AI objectively choosing the blockchains with the best offerings in fees, security, and transaction speeds. Thus, it would do away with what he termed as “all the tribalistic BS!” Netizens pushback on Bons’ claims Those claims kicked a Twitter storm with several netizens pushing back on his suggestions. One X user tdubb led the assault terming Bons’ prediction the worst take on the subject that he had ever seen. He insisted that the intention of the AI is what will matter as these tools will work according to their creator’s instructions. “AI will objectively choose chains with the best fee/security/speed properties” is up there with one of the worst takes on AI i’ve ever seen icl — tdubb — ux/acc (@tdubbdoteth) December 15, 2024 He suggested that there were other factors other than speed, cost, and security that would determine the working of AI-embedded wallets. These include the chain’s liquidity, product, and interoperability. But ultimately the AI agent’s design would hold sway. Another user @calebini also took Bons to task on his assertion that the AI agents wouldn’t choose Base as it was slow, costly, and totally centralized. He made fun of Bons’ apparently forgetting that virtuals, a prominent AI-agent platform was running on the network. @calebini also slammed Bons for relegating his platform to attacking ETH or BTC at every chance he got. He wondered why he (Bons) wouldn’t use it to highlight the positive developments within the entire crypto ecosystem. To him, Bons’ hostility towards the two was tiresome and undermined his credibility. Vitalik Buterin pushes for Ethereum alignment to unite the ecosystem The Ethereum alignment concept grew from the complexities that emerged from the blockchain’s evolution. As the network grew it accommodated many projects with diverse views, goals, and operating principles. This divergence threatens the realization of ETH’s core principles. To bring back all the players to Ethereum’s founding philosophies, the network’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the Ethereum alignment concept. Its key components are ecosystem unity and coordinated governance. Through it, the Ethereum Foundation hopes to build a stronger network with an enhanced ecosystem value. It also looks to improve the user experience by easing user navigation of the blockchain’s services and promoting the interoperability of applications.

In a Dec. 13 complaint, BiT Global accused Coinbase of delisting wBTC to promote its own product, cbBTC. The move allegedly caused significant financial losses and damaged consumer confidence in wBTC. The lawsuit claims attempted monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act, predatory practices to undermine wBTC, and false statements suggesting wBTC failed to meet listing standards. Coinbase announced the token delisting on Nov. 19, citing undisclosed failures to meet its listing standards. A Coinbase spokesperson defended the decision, stating: “Coinbase is committed to maintaining the high integrity of our listing standards, and we regularly evaluate assets listed on our platform. Should an asset fail to meet those standards, it is delisted.” BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has been a joint custodian of wBTC reserves with BitGo since August. The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, alleges Coinbase favored memecoins while challenging wBTC’s compliance with listing standards. Attorney Kevin Kneupper stated, “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space. If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” The lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $1 billion and demands injunctive relief to prevent further harm. BiT Global claims Coinbase aimed to eliminate competition, stating: “It’s clear that Coinbase’s decision is an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, pushing forward their own wrapped Bitcoin product, cbBTC, and removing the largest and most influential competitor in wBTC.” Coinbase previously announced: “Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC on Dec. 19, 2024, on or around 12 pm ET.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 22:55:00

He learned that the government planned to restrict AI development to a few large companies. This led him to endorse Donald Trump, who he believes supports less government control over tech. Marc Andreessen is the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, an influential figure especially when it comes to the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, he exposed his deep concerns over the Biden administration’s plan to regulate and control AI technology, after attending a series of meetings with government officials in May 2023. Andreessen criticizes Biden’s AI regulations Andreessen described the experience as “horrifying,” and it had a significant impact on his decision to endorse Donald Trump in the upcoming election. In the meeting, Andreessen learned that government officials were planning to take strong control over the AI sector, limiting its development and access to a few large companies that cooperate closely with the government. According to Andreessen, the officials clearly stated that AI startups would not be allowed to exist. He recalled the statement, “Don’t fund AI startups. That’s not something that we’re going to allow to happen.” The government’s plan was to establish a situation where only two or three major companies, tightly controlled and “wrapped in a government cocoon,” would be allowed to develop AI technology. These companies would receive government protection from competition and be fully directed by the administration on how to move forward with AI development. Government plans to limit AI Innovation What alarmed him was that the government would go even further by restricting access to the fundamental technology that powers AI. He explained that government officials suggested they could follow a similar path to the Cold War, where certain scientific areas, including physics, were classified and kept secret from the public and the research community. Andreessen was shocked when the officials suggested that AI could also be “classified” in a way that would limit or even prevent open research and development. This discussion raised serious concerns for Andreessen, especially since he had investments in AI startups. His firm has funded several cutting-edge AI companies, including Elon Musk’s xAI, Mistral AI, and Character.AI. The idea of controlling AI development would threaten his business interests and the tech innovation ecosystem. For Andreessen, this wasn’t just about his personal investments it was about the future of AI innovation in the United States. The Biden administration has taken an approach to AI, like issuing an executive order in October 2023 asking companies to voluntarily follow safety and transparency guidelines. The executive order called for companies to share safety test results with the government and for Congress to review data privacy practices. However, Andreessen claims that the government’s actual plan is much more controlling and stricter. He believes their anti-capitalist stance threatens innovation and the spirit of American business. His view is that the government’s approach to AI reflects a shift towards a more controlled economy. After the meetings, Andreessen decided to support Trump, who he saw as a leader promoting innovation. Trump’s approach of reducing government control over business and encouraging private companies in tech was the opposite of the Biden administration’s policies.

These sentiments from the crypto analyst mirror the dynamic nature of the market and the constant shift in investors interest. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Next Big Player In Crypto While PEPE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are household names in cryptocurrency, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves with its decentralized crypto wallet that gives investors absolute control over their digital assets without the interference of third parties. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is known for its adoption of AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that promote financial literacy, security and decentralization among its users. Touted as the SHIB of this cycle, the leading crypto analyst believes WallitIQ (WLTQ) is significantly positioned to benefit from the billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market as the demand for efficient crypto wallets continues to rise. In addition to the leading crypto analyst predictions of WallitIQ to replicate SHIB’s previous success, WallitIQ’s projected $10 million monthly revenue has attracted both retail and institutional investors who missed out on SHIB in 2021, with its low token price and an opportunity to create generational wealth. Following the crypto analyst predictions, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale has seen massive interest from investors, selling millions of tokens in just a few weeks. Early investors have positioned themselves to enjoy several benefits, including governance participation, early gains from token price appreciation, premium features, etc. The crypto analyst has also mentioned that the best time to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens is now to enjoy the benefits that come with its rapid price growth. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained popularity through its meme status and community-driven support, WallitIQ (WLTQ) distinguishes itself by providing tangible benefits such as annual percentage yields (APY) of 180% as rewards for users who stake their tokens. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides its users with access to over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, giving them an efficient and secure platform to diversify their portfolios. As a platform that prioritizes security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has won the heart of the crypto analyst with its combination of the advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) that protects user private keys and transactions from fraudulent individuals. In addition, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a smart contract audit conducted by a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known as SolidProof . This firm specializes in protecting financial institutions and preventing hackers from penetrating blockchain projects. PEPE As Dogecoin (DOGE) Replacement Just recently, PEPE crossed the $11 billion market cap milestone for the first time. With the latest price rally stretching its year-to-date (YTD) to 2,570%, PEPE is positioned to outperform rival meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the current bull cycle. As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to experience fluctuations, many are turning to PEPE as a fresh opportunity. The crypto analysts believe that PEPE could capitalize on the momentum previously enjoyed by Dogecoin, especially with PEPE’s increasing demand increasing social media buzz. According to data from CoinGecko , PEPE’s market cap is at $10.3 billion with a daily trading volume of $5.5 billion. As of the time of this writing, PEPE is trading at a price of $0.00002459. On the other hand, Dogecoin’s market cap is $60.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.7 billion. As of writing time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at a price of $0.4121. Be Part Of The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale With PEPE positioning itself as a viable replacement for Dogecoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) aims to capture the spirit of SHIB, attracting all classes of investors with its discounted token price. With the presale moving faster than expected, smart investors are seizing this opportunity to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens for a low price of $0.0243 each. Millions of tokens have been sold, reflecting the growing demand for innovative solutions that offer both utility and security.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 23:12:00

A new report from Electric Capital has revealed that Asia now commands 32% of the world’s crypto development. This is a sharp rise from just 12% in 2015. As North America’s influence declines, emerging markets, especially India, are becoming the main source of new talent in crypto. Asia’s Rapid Growth and the Emergence of India Asia’s growing dominance in crypto development is undeniable. The region’s 32% share of global developer activity marks a substantial shift in industry trends. What was once a Western-centric field is now expanding rapidly eastward, with India leading the charge. Since 2023, India has accounted for a larger share of new crypto developers than any other country. This underscores the country’s growing importance in the crypto ecosystem. India’s large talent pool and booming tech industry are driving its rise in blockchain development. The country is becoming a key player in the global crypto ecosystem. Its contributions are shaping the future of the industry. In a recent report, the country emerged as the global hub for Web3 innovations . A Decline in North America, But Veteran Developers Are Flourishing While Asia rises, North America’s dominance in the crypto field is dwindling. The region’s share of global developer activity has dropped from 43% in 2015 to just 24%. Still, the outlook remains positive. The crypto space has seen a 7% drop in active developers this year, but the picture is far from discouraging. Developers with over two years of experience have grown significantly, increasing by 27%. These seasoned experts now contribute over 70% of code commits in leading blockchain ecosystems, underscoring their importance to the industry. Their expertise drives innovation, sustains key projects, and stabilizes the fast-changing field. Despite fewer newcomers, the growing presence of experienced developers highlights the maturing nature of the crypto ecosystem. New Talent Flocks to Solana and Other Blockchain Ecosystems Ethereum remains the top platform for crypto developers, but its dominance is being challenged. Solana is rising quickly, attracting new developers , and becoming the preferred choice by mid-2024 in key markets like the U.S., U.K., China, and Canada. Alongside Ethereum and Solana, other blockchain ecosystems are also gaining traction. Platforms like Internet Computer, Aptos, Coinbase’s Base , Bitcoin, Sui, NEAR, Polkadot, and Polygon are seeing a significant influx of new developers, each adding at least 1,000 new contributors in the past year alone. This shift shows growing interest in diverse blockchain solutions and expanding innovation in previously overlooked markets. The surge of talent entering the crypto space, with over 39,000 new developers this year alone, signals the start of a new era for blockchain development.

This comes as optimism remains sky-high on the back of a crypto-friendly US presidential administration. As we reported just last night, President-elect Donald Trump confirmed his plans to back the national Bitcoin strategic reserve proposed by crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis. Since his election victory in November, Bitcoin has been on a tear, climbing by 50% in just over a month. Investors are betting big on the changes coming under his administration. Trump has made it clear he’s no fan of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose regulatory crackdowns have been a thorn in the side of the crypto community. The decision to replace Gensler with Paul Atkins, a known crypto ally, has made the market even more bullish. Bitcoin-based ETFs have been a game changer this year, and 2024 has been all about capital flowing in at an insane pace. Just last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $676 million in inflows. The derivatives market is also on fire. Open interest in Bitcoin futures and options has hit record levels. Everyone is betting on where it’s headed next, and the sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish. Altcoins have been left in the dust, with Bitcoin’s market share growing as investors double down on the one crypto they trust the most. While enthusiasm is high, there are signs of caution. Liquidity clusters around $100,000 suggest some volatility ahead. If prices dip, it’s likely a temporary pullback as the market resets before making another run.

The report reveals that countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and the Philippines are driving significant growth in awareness, ownership, and participation in crypto-related activities. Emerging Markets at The Forefront The survey shows that 93% of people globally are aware of cryptocurrencies, with 51% claiming to understand them. Ownership levels stand at 42%, with the highest rates reported in Nigeria (73%), South Africa (68%), and the Philippines (54%). These countries also displayed a notable increase in Web3 activities, such as holding NFTs, using decentralized finance (DeFi), and staking. In Nigeria, 77% of respondents correctly defined blockchain, while 80% knew about decentralization. Similarly, South Africa reported 74% familiarity with the latter concept, while 61% of participants in the Philippines shared the same understanding. Per the report, crypto adoption in these areas is driven by various factors, with a large number of proponents perceiving it as a solution to local economic challenges. Additionally, many in these markets view digital assets as a lifeline, with 65% of Nigerians seeing them as a way to store value amid currency instability and another 58% considering them as the “future of money.” Individuals in these countries are also more likely to invest in crypto in the coming year. The Philippines has been capitalizing on the opportunities provided by such assets, with a 7% increase in ownership over the last 12 months. Entry Barriers and Blockchain Solutions Despite the growing enthusiasm for crypto in these regions, the survey also highlights persistent barriers to entry. Concerns about market volatility, scams, and the lack of understanding of its purpose remain widespread globally. However, these obstacles are less prevalent in emerging markets, where respondents demonstrated a willingness to embrace virtual currencies despite the challenges. The report also reveals that blockchain could be key in addressing concerns about artificial intelligence (AI), with 75% of those interviewed worried about its potential to generate fake news and perpetuate fraud. About 54% of participants globally believe blockchain could provide the transparency and accountability needed to combat AI-driven misinformation. Speaking on the increasing importance of data privacy as highlighted by the survey, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin said: “The critical role of blockchain and decentralization in enhancing privacy, trust, and transparency for how our data is managed cannot be overstated.” He added that the last few years have shown growing momentum for crypto, blockchain, and Web3 adoption, with 2024 marking a significant period. He explained that this is due to various factors, including the recent U.S. presidential election , which could lead to greater regulatory clarity for the industry.

RCO Finance: Which Can Turn $1k into $100k by January 1?,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu-vs-rco-finance-which-can-turn-1k/,"Among the numerous digital assets, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and RCO Finance (RCOF) stand out as three distinct choices with significant potential in 2025. However, while each of these coins has its own narrative and market dynamics, the key question remains: which one holds the potential to turn a modest $1,000 investment into $100,000 by January 1? Dogecoin Could Hit $1.48 in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE), originally conceived as a meme coin, has grown to become one of the market’s most recognizable and widely traded cryptocurrencies. Known for its fun, community-driven nature, Dogecoin saw a significant price surge earlier this year, doubling in value within a month following Trump’s re-election, reflecting the strong bullish sentiments surrounding the coin. Despite its reputation as a meme coin, Dogecoin’s performance has shown potential for substantial gains, with an impressive 350% rise in a year to trade at $0.4055 at press time. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, with some bullish predictions putting its price at around $0.8392 by early 2025 and others hinting that it could soar to $1.48 after Trump assumes office on January 20, 2025. Nevertheless, while the projection of $1.48 is quite ambitious, it still can not convert a $1,000 investment in DOGE into $100,000. Buying DOGE at its current price could get you approximately 2,466 DOGE tokens, which at $1.48 would be worth a modest $3,649. Shiba Inu Price Could Hit $0.0000879 in 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB), often called the “Dogecoin killer,” has carved out a unique space in the cryptocurrency market with its playful branding and vibrant community. Also launched as a meme coin, Shiba Inu quickly gained attention due to its low entry price and speculative appeal. It has seen notable activity, including several token burns to reduce supply and increase scarcity. Although these burns represent only a small fraction of Shiba Inu’s total supply, they contribute to the deflationary narrative that can be attractive to investors looking for assets with limited supply and potential for price appreciation. Over the past year, Shiba Inu has experienced a notable price increase, soaring by 196% despite witnessing wild price swings. And while it is still way down from the $0.00008616 all-time high achieved in October 2021, predictions are placing the meme coin at $0.0000879 in 2025. However, while $0.0000879 would represent quite a huge gain for SHIB, it still would not be enough to convert a $1,000 investment into $100,000. $1,000, at the current SHIB price of $0.000028 , can get you 35,714,285 SHIB tokens, which at $0.0000879 would only be worth $3,139.285. RCO Finance Emerges as a Compelling Alternative Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are both meme coins and RCO Finance is emerging with a more structured and professional approach to cryptocurrency investing. As an AI-powered financial platform, it aims to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is the AI-powered Robo Advisor , which analyzes market data and tailors investment strategies to individual user preferences, optimizing portfolio performance without requiring manual oversight. This level of automation is particularly beneficial for novice and experienced investors, allowing them to focus on their long-term financial goals without getting bogged down by day-to-day market fluctuations. Additionally, RCO Finance will provide access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, from traditional stocks and bonds to digital assets and real-world assets like real estate. This wide range of tradable assets allows investors to diversify their portfolios and balance risk across different markets. Another unique aspect of RCO Finance is its KYC-free ecosystem, which ensures user privacy and simplifies the onboarding process, making it more accessible to privacy-conscious investors. Furthermore, the platform also features an audited smart contract , enhancing security and trust among users. These features position RCO Finance as a viable option for investors seeking more than just short-term gains. Investors can invest in the project through the ongoing RCOF token presale. Taking Advantage of the Ongoing RCOF Token Presale The RCO Finance presale represents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to maximize their returns. In its fourth stage, the RCOF token has already experienced a 509% price surge, reaching $0.07770, and is expected to see further gains as it progresses through the presale stages. The next stage, the final presale stage, is set to see the price of RCOF reach $0.21420 before public listing at between $0.4 and $0.6. This price trajectory indicates substantial potential for profit as the RCOF token approaches its public listing, where it could see even more significant gains as investors take advantage of early access to the platform’s features and the ecosystem’s expected growth. For those looking to transform a $1,000 investment into $100,000, the ongoing presale of RCO Finance presents a promising opportunity to capitalize on the projected price increases. A $1,000 investment in RCOF at the current presale price could earn you 12,870 RCOF tokens and if the token soars to $10 as projected by most analysts due to the current hype around AI and DeFi, the investment could turn to a cool $128,700.

Don’t Let This Best Meme Coin Presale for Massive Return Potential Be Your Second Mistake!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-brett-dont-let-this-best-meme-coin-presale-for-massive-return-potential-be-your-second-mistake/,"Meme coins have been shaking up the crypto world for years, delivering wild profits and unforgettable stories. Remember Dogecoin’s meteoric rise or Brett creating overnight millionaires? One thing’s clear: early movers always win big. Now, there’s a fresh chance to jump in early, and it’s making waves— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . In just 14 days , this presale sensation has raised over $2.6 million, selling over 44 billion coins to more than 3,900 holders. BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a movement redefining what meme coins can achieve with innovative staking rewards, a thrilling play-to-earn game, and a vibrant community called the Bulls Squad. This isn’t just another crypto; it’s your ticket to ride the next bull wave. BTFD Coin: The New Frontier for Meme Coin Enthusiasts Unlike the usual meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin brings substance to the table. Built on Ethereum’s rock-solid foundation, it flaunts unmatched security, scalability, and liquidity. The concept of “ Buy the Dip ” is more than a tagline—it’s a rallying cry for those ready to seize opportunities. With presale prices starting at just $0.000004, BTFD Coin offers prime entry points. The current stage 10 price of $0.0001 is still a steal. By the presale’s end, it’s set to launch at $0.0006 per coin. For context, a $2,500 investment at $0.0001 could fetch you 25 million BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, that $2,500 could skyrocket to $15,000 . Presale Success and Features BTFD Coin’s presale journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Hitting $1 million in under ten days, it’s sold over 44 billion coins. The Bulls Squad—a charismatic community of dip-buying enthusiasts—embodies resilience and camaraderie. For investors, BTFD’s staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, making it a top choice for long-term holders. The play-to-earn game adds another layer of engagement, allowing users to earn while having fun. Connect your wallet, level up, and turn in-game rewards into real-world profits. Tokenomics for Growth BTFD’s tokenomics ensure stability and growth. With 48% allocated to presales, 18% for staking rewards, and 17% for game incentives, every aspect fuels its ecosystem. Unsold tokens will be burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Brett Coin: The Opportunity You Missed Launched earlier this year, Brett Coin (BRETT) emerged as a memecoin powerhouse. Its 142% rally over the past 30 days captured the market’s attention, and it currently trades around $0.2053 with a market cap of $2.035 billion. This meme coin ranked #68 on CoinMarketCap and became a favourite among investors seeking high returns. However, not all has been smooth sailing. Brett faced a 47% drop in April 2024 due to insider holding concerns. Yet, it rebounded fiercely, proving its resilience. Investors who got in early reaped massive rewards, turning small bets into life-changing gains. What Makes Brett Unique Brett isn’t just another meme coin. Its community-driven ethos and market-savvy strategies have earned it a loyal following. Its success underscores one critical lesson: getting in early is everything. Those who sat on the sidelines when Brett was first gaining traction are now regretting it. Why BTFD Coin is Your Next Big Chance While Brett’s success is undeniable, BTFD Coin is positioned to be the next big thing. With its presale pricing, staking rewards, and innovative ecosystem, it offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors. Unlike Brett, which is now in its mature phase, BTFD Coin is just getting started, and its presale is the perfect time to dive in. Consider this: with 1 Ethereum, you can buy 38,863,600 BTFD coins. That’s a staggering amount compared to what you’d get with established meme coins like Brett. The same holds for 1 Bitcoin, which can fetch you 984,470,000 BTFD coins. The math is simple—early entry equals massive potential. Moreover, the BTFD play-to-earn game and community-driven initiatives ensure continuous engagement and value creation. The presale structure incentivises early investors, with prices escalating in each stage. As we approach the end of the presale, FOMO is building, and the buzz is palpable. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Dip—Ride the Wave Meme coins like Brett have shown us the power of early investments. But if you missed Brett’s meteoric rise, don’t let BTFD Coin slip through your fingers. With its presale gaining momentum, staking rewards offering high returns, and a play-to-earn game set to captivate, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin presale for massive return potential. So, what are you waiting for? The presale won’t last forever, and neither will these prices. Join the BTFD movement today and secure your place in the next big crypto success story.

37693393,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627921,1734308574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37693393.jpeg,Japan ‘far behind’ US in cyber attack preparedness — But that’s actually a good thing for crypto,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-far-behind-us-in-cyber-attack-preparedness-but-thats-actually-a-good-thing-for-crypto/,"Japan’s government is currently pushing for an “active cyber defense” (ACD) policy, and major media in the country are falling all over themselves to aid in the effort with stories to alarm the public. However, copying the examples of the US and UK, as major outlet Nikkei implies ought to be done, is in the very worst interest of peaceful crypto and privacy advocates in Japan. Not long ago, Cryptopolitan reported on Masaaki Taira, Japan’s digital transformation (DX) minister, being commanded by self-described “defense geek” prime minister Ishiba to accelerate work on an “active cyber defense” (ACD) bill. The bill is controversial because it involves state-level spying via private telecom companies on the people of Japan, even in peacetime, and supplying the info to the United States. Some Japanese are also suspicious of scandal-embroiled Taira potentially having connections with anti-Japan interests in the Chinese Communist Party. Major news outlet Nikkei has now joined the push for the “active cyber defense” agenda, publishing a report (or propaganda piece, depending on who you ask) promoting greater cyber-attack preparedness. The December 16 report goes so far as to imply that centralized misinformation control and even state-level “debunking” need to be increased, and done in tandem with major nations like the US and UK. But mimicking Five Eyes intelligence giants in surveillance is a horrible idea for cryptocurrency adoption and privacy in Japan, especially with a digital yen now on the table. The combined effect of all this is to threaten the culturally self-reliant populace with even more influence from a global banking cabal, and pressure to align with cartoonish foreign figures like Musk and Trump , whose actions Taira wants to “closely follow.” Of course Nikkei knows this. And of course the new prime minister Shigeru Ishiba doesn’t actually care about the security or economic freedom of the people he supposedly governs. But nor does any politician, really. This should go without saying. Nikkei shills for surveillance, Japan falls further from crypto grace While the years of independent bitcoin ATMs in Tokyo (ca. 2015-2017) operating free and unfettered are far behind us, and popular trading sites like Local Bitcoins have long since been destroyed by the same restrictive red tape that took out the ATMs, things yet continue to spiral downward when it comes to the Japanese government’s approach to finance, cryptocurrency, and information control. And the media is right there behind them, fueling the fire. “Cyber ​​attacks are posing increasing threats to national security,” the new Nikkei report (translated by Google) reads. “Attacks on governments and military-related targets in various countries have increased by more than 70% compared to the same period last year.” The piece continues: “Japan is currently aiming to strengthen its cyber security system, including the introduction of ‘active cyber defense (ACD)’ that detects signs of cyber attacks and prevents damage before they occur.” As mentioned above, the ACD bill aims to spy on public communications via private companies ostensibly to stave off cyber attacks and the spread of misinformation before they happen. According to other reports from local media, the new legislation could even include shutting down people’s computers. The terms “thoughtcrime” and “pre-crime” might pop into the heads of readers and film buffs familiar with the horrific dystopias of 1984 and The Minority Report. Japan’s NISC, responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings, issued far less alerts than its foreign counterparts in England (middle) and the United States (top), according to Nikkei’s research. Source: Nikkei Combine all this with the looming CBDC , (read: centrally programmed, censorable digital JPY) also shilled/predictively programmed by Nikkei interests, and a pretty clear picture of what is happening emerges: Japanese state officials are painting themselves as the victims, while clamping down even harder on the true victims — everyday folks just trying to get by. Crypto is taxed at insanely high rates in Japan (up to 55% on gains), and increasing regulation of the cryptocurrency and banking industries in the nation is making it near impossible for individuals and small businesses to leverage the true benefits of peer-to-peer digital currency — that is, without facing potential jail time. It’s now common in Japan for even normal bank accounts to unilaterally freeze customer funds if the smallest abnormality or “suspicious behavior” is detected with a deposit or transfer. Further, Japan’s financial regulator, the FSA, is in closed door talks about how to more effectively capture the asset class. Debunking the need for government debunking The Nikkei report notes that Japan’s NISC (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity), responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings to the public, lags far behind its foreign counterparts in Britain and the US. But in Japan, perhaps worrying about the inflation problem , the rampant overtourism, and suicides from overwork might be good to put on the agenda, as opposed to Shigeru Ishiba’s plans for military spending on steroids and drafting of cyber-security bills that spy on everyone. Perhaps instead of lending military support and money to the United States/Israel genocide in the Middle East, politicians on the archipelago might start worrying about the aging population of retirees unable to survive on the national pension. But alas, that is wishful thinking. Which is why permissionless cryptocurrencies became so important in the first place. The report compares the number of “debunkings” Japanese embassies have issued on X, compared to other embassies. Source: Nikkei As if to insultingly answer these ponderings with a non-sequitur, however, the Nikkei report reads: “The Nikkei Shimbun compiled the number of debunkings from April 2011 to July this year for the X (formerly Twitter) accounts of the Japanese, US and UK embassies … the Japanese embassies in the US and UK only sent out one debunking each from their respective countries … that denied the danger of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.” Nikkei’s report then lauds the intelligence giants overseas: “On the other hand, the US embassy in Japan sent out 13 debunkings, and the UK embassy sent out 10.” Is this really a litmus for social progress? Which government sends out the most “debunkings”? I don’t personally think so. A litmus for social progress is how much economic freedom an individual has, and the respect of others for that freedom. On that front, the Japanese government, and those of the whole world, are miserably and intentionally failing. So, if dystopian spying and “pre-crime” cybersecurity bills are what Japan is lagging behind in, perhaps that particular lack of ambition is for the best.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 00:23:00

The Dogecoin price is projected to achieve a $150 billion market cap, propelled by its loyal community and speculative momentum. The XRP price is expected to reach a $400 billion market cap, driven by increasing adoption in cross-border payments. Meanwhile, ETFSwap (ETFS) is on track for a $100 billion market cap, emerging as a transformative force in crypto. Among the Dogecoin price, XRP price, and ETFSwap (ETFS), ETFSwap (ETFS) stands out as a balanced investment option combining innovation and practicality. Its recent listing on Uniswap and accessible price point make it a strong contender for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the growth predictions. Why ETFSwap (ETFS) Leads Among 2025 Predictions ETFSwap (ETFS) is set to reshape the cryptocurrency landscape with its innovative features and investor-focused tools. Among its standout offerings is a real-time ETF price tracker , which provides precise and immediate updates on ETF performance. This tool allows investors to monitor trends and make informed decisions in a fast-moving market. The real-time tracker is an essential resource for those aiming to capitalize on the projected $100 billion market cap. Unlike the speculative nature of the Dogecoin price or the institution-driven XRP price, ETFSwap (ETFS) prioritizes functionality and actionable insights, setting it apart as a forward-thinking investment option. ETFSwap (ETFS) also allows investors to diversify their portfolios by offering access to crypto ETFs and traditional commodities such as oil, silver, and gold. This feature bridges the gap between decentralized trading and conventional markets, creating a balanced approach to risk and growth potential. Unlike the Dogecoin price and XRP price, which are tied to specific market narratives, ETFSwap (ETFS) provides a broader range of opportunities to align with varied financial goals. Introducing an AI-powered ETF screener further heightens the appeal of ETFSwap (ETFS), simplifying the decision-making process. For those targeting the predicted ETFSwap (ETFS) $100 billion market cap, the AI-powered screener efficiently maximises returns. The 2025 market cap predictions highlight distinct strengths for the Dogecoin price, XRP price, and ETFSwap (ETFS) price. With its listing on Uniswap, ETFSwap (ETFS) remains affordable, offering investors who missed the presale a chance to secure their positions before further growth. Dogecoin Price, XRP Price And Projected Market Cap Due to its community-driven growth and market popularity, the Dogecoin pric e has consistently drawn attention. Predictions of a $150 billion market cap reflect its ability to thrive during bullish cycles. Its speculative nature, amplified by high-profile endorsements, has made it a favorite for quick gains. Despite its appeal, the Dogecoin price relies heavily on market sentiment, which can lead to unpredictable fluctuations. This dependency may deter investors seeking long-term stability, making ETFSwap (ETFS) a compelling alternative with features designed to support sustained growth. Ripple (XRP) has established itself as a leader in cross-border payments, with the XRP price reflecting its growing use case among financial institutions. The $400 billion market cap prediction underscores its role in modernizing global transactions. Its ability to deliver efficient, low-cost solutions has earned it a strong position in the crypto market. However, regulatory challenges and competition in the payment sector may impact the XRP price trajectory. For investors seeking diversification, ETFSwap (ETFS) offers a platform that combines decentralized trading with traditional asset classes, delivering a unique approach to portfolio management. Conclusion The 2025 crypto market cap predictions showcase exciting possibilities across the market. The Dogecoin price’s $150 billion target reflects its speculative appeal, and the XRP price’s $400 billion prediction underscores its institutional credibility. However, ETFSwap (ETFS) shines as a well-rounded investment option, set to reach a $100 billion market cap through its unique features and market positioning. Savvy investors are taking action now. Acting now gives access to a platform that addresses the needs of today’s investors while offering the potential for substantial returns. Don’t miss out.

This Layer One Blockchain Proves It’s Not Too Late,https://thecoinrise.com/didnt-believe-in-early-crypto-success-stories-this-layer-one-blockchain-proves-its-not-too-late/,"Have you ever looked at projects like Solana and thought, “Why didn’t I invest earlier?” For many, watching Solana’s rise was a lesson in missed opportunities. But the truth is, crypto always has another game-changer waiting in the wings. This time, Qubetics ($TICS) could be that golden ticket, offering a fresh opportunity for those searching for the best crypto to buy for explosive returns. While Solana revolutionised blockchain speed and scalability, Qubetics is bringing its own innovations to the table. From simplifying blockchain development to offering a lucrative presale, Qubetics is poised to turn heads and change fortunes. Why Missing Qubetics Presale Could Be a Big Mistake Qubetics is not just a blockchain project; it’s a complete ecosystem designed to make blockchain technology accessible to everyone, whether they’re developers, small businesses, or large enterprises. At the core of its innovation is the QubeQode IDE , a visual development environment that eliminates the complexity of blockchain coding. Here’s how the QubeQode IDE is changing the game. Developers can use drag-and-drop components to add features like user authentication, token management, and data storage. A small business looking to create a custom token can do so in minutes without hiring a team of developers. Plus, the form-based configuration lets users set up smart contracts through intuitive forms—no coding required. The code snippet library adds another layer of simplicity by offering pre-written templates for common blockchain tasks. Now let’s talk about the Qubetics presale . Currently in its 12th stage, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.031. Over 334 million tokens have already been sold to more than 9,700 holders, raising $6.4 million. With each presale stage lasting just 7 days and a 10% price increase at the start of each new stage, the time to invest is now. By the 13th stage, the price will rise to $0.0341. Solana’s Rise Shows Why Acting Early Matters Solana is one of the most talked-about blockchain projects, thanks to its unparalleled speed and low transaction costs. Launched with an ICO in 2020, Solana’s initial token price was just $0.22. Fast forward, and Solana is now a major player in the blockchain world, powering decentralised applications and attracting developers worldwide. What makes Solana special is its proof-of-history mechanism, which allows it to process thousands of transactions per second. This innovation has made it a favourite for projects requiring high throughput, from NFT platforms to DeFi applications. Its success underscores the importance of solving real-world blockchain challenges, which is exactly what Qubetics aims to do. For those who missed Solana’s ICO, it’s a reminder of how early action can lead to exponential gains. While Solana continues to grow, Qubetics offers a chance to get in early on a project with equally groundbreaking potential. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy for Explosive Returns Qubetics combines cutting-edge technology with practical solutions, making it a standout project in the blockchain space. Its QubeQode IDE makes blockchain development accessible to anyone, while its presale offers an affordable entry point for investors looking to maximise returns. For those who regret missing projects like Solana in their early days, Qubetics offers a fresh opportunity to be part of something big. With a clear roadmap, innovative tools, and analysts predicting significant growth, $TICS is the best crypto to buy for explosive returns. Don’t wait until the presale ends and the prices climb higher. Take a closer look at Qubetics and see how it could transform your portfolio.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 01:50:00

As the 9th largest crypto by market cap, Cardano’s market maturity is severely impeding its capacity for explosive growth. While Cardano has a solid technological foundation and a loyal community, its price has remained the same compared to the explosive growth seen in other altcoins. This situation is further exacerbated by the emergence of AI altcoins, which are revolutionizing the market with their ingenious solutions and reshaping investor expectations. For instance, altcoins like RCOF have innovative features, such as the robo-advisor, which offers personalized investment strategies based on extensive market analysis. This capability enhances the user experience and democratizes access to sophisticated trading tools, making these AI altcoins more attractive to traditional crypto assets like Cardano. These projects also garner attention for their impressive presale performances and projected returns. This potential for explosive growth and advanced technological capabilities appeal to Cardano investors looking for high-ROI opportunities. RCO Finance: The AI Altcoin Poised for Market Domination RCO Finance is an AI altcoin catching the eye of Cardano investors because of its innovative features. It has built a comprehensive ecosystem, transforming how investors interact with crypto and traditional financial products. Leading this AI revolution is its AI-powered robo-advisor , which provides tailored investment strategies based on your preferences. These strategies are developed after analyzing vast amounts of historical data, current market trends, financial goals, and risk appetite. By customizing your investment plans, the robo-advisor ensures every move you make is geared toward fulfilling your goals and that its recommendations are within your limits. This is useful for beginners since it can recommend low-risk investments to test the waters before moving on to higher-risk, higher rewards assets. For seasoned professionals, the robo-advisor provides advanced insights and customizable tools you can use to enhance your investments further. RCOF allows users to invest in over 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized stocks, ETFs, bonds, etc. This tokenization democratizes access to high-value assets previously hard to reach. It also enables users to buy fractions of these assets, meaning you don’t need the high capital previously required to purchase them. This accessibility presents unparalleled investment and diversification opportunities. In addition to breaking down price barriers by tokenizing real-world assets, RCOF is breaking down geographical barriers with its non-KYC policy, which allows users from anywhere in the world to sign up and participate. This means users from areas typically locked out because they can’t meet these stringent KYC requirements can invest and trade on RCOF. This non-KYC feature also appeals to users who prefer to maintain anonymity while transacting online. This platform relies on AI for updates and optimizations. This approach eliminates human error, increases security, and ensures it adapts to the changing needs of its users and the market.

Under the new rules, companies will measure crypto assets at fair value and update them at each reporting period in their financial statements. This will help companies realize both profits and losses based on Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market prices, helping them keep pace with the often fluctuating traded status of the currency. FASB ASC Subtopic 350-60 outlines a new accounting standard that is suitable for fungible crypto assets that meet certain requirements. However, NFTs, wrapped tokens, and internally generated digital assets are exempt from the scope. NFTs are unique and non-interchangeable, which means no two are the same, unlike Bitcoin, and factors like inconsistent pricing, low liquidity, and subjective valuations make it challenging to gauge the fair value of an NFT. Also, unlike BTC, NFTs typically entail specific rights and utilities. All of these reasons make NFTs inappropriate for the standardized, fair value measurement as mandated by ASU 2023-08 . “Nonfungible tokens (ASU 2023-08 applies only to “fungible” intangible digital assets because it is difficult to obtain market prices that meet FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, fair value criteria for nonfungible digital assets; thus, it is unclear how to account for and disclose other types of digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens. Reporting entities accounting for NFTs need to fully understand the rights associated with these tokens and what the tokens transfer.” reads FASB Accounting Standards Update You might also like: Best altcoins to watch as phase 2 of the bull market prepares for liftoff HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE 🙌 pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 What FASB’s new rules mean for investors Companies holding BTC as treasury reserve assets can now benefit from simplified reporting processes due to FASB’s decision to embrace fair value accounting. The update is anticipated to accelerate corporate adoption by providing greater transparency and a more precise valuation of crypto holdings for investors, creditors, and other stakeholders. As businesses increasingly turn to BTC as a long-term strategic reserve , this rule change will cement BTC’s dominance further into the fabric of modern finance.

Any gains were left out of the records, and only losses were recorded if the value decreased. Offering this option will also give retail investors an unrounded view of a company’s financial position. The new rules, which mandate reporting of BTC at current market value, will provide more transparency and accuracy of the financial statements, allowing investors to assess risks, cash flows, and performance more effectively for companies such as MicroStrategy , Tesla and so on. Differences between traditional markets and the crypto economy fade as BTC’s grip as a financial asset becomes firm and clearer, and fair-value accounting standards are now in place.

Don’t Miss Out Again—Grab The Best Meme Coin to Buy Today!,https://thecoinrise.com/skipped-goatseus-maximus-moonshot-dont-miss-out-again-grab-the-best-meme-coin-to-buy-today/,"Picture this: it’s early 2024, and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) launches quietly into the crypto world. You hear the buzz, but you brush it off—“just another meme coin,” you tell yourself. Fast forward a few months, and the whispers have turned into roars. Early investors are flaunting life-changing profits while you’re left with a lingering question: Why didn’t I act sooner? Now, history is handing you a second chance. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is here, and it’s not just riding the meme coin wave—it’s making a tsunami. Already in its 12th presale stage, BTFD has raised a staggering $3.9 million, selling over 55 billion coins. With a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards boasting a 90% APY, and a passionate community, BTFD is more than a meme—it’s a movement. If you’ve ever wished for a do-over in crypto, this is it. The best meme coin to buy today is right here, right now. Don’t miss it. BTFD Coin: The Dip You Won’t Want to Miss The crypto world is buzzing about BTFD Coin , and for good reason. This Ethereum-based gem has taken the “buy the dip” mantra and turned it into a movement. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a meme coin newbie, BTFD offers a unique opportunity to ride the next big bull wave. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin riding the hype train. It’s a fully-fledged ecosystem that blends entertainment, community, and financial growth. The coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game lets you rack up rewards while smashing through levels with the Bulls Squad. Imagine earning real crypto while gaming—sounds like a win-win, right? Staking is another major draw. Offering an average APY of 90%, BTFD’s staking rewards are designed for long-term holders. For example, staking just $1,000 BTFD coins could nearly double your holdings in a year. By the end of three years, compounded rewards could multiply your stash several times over. Presale Frenzy: Numbers Don’t Lie BTFD’s presale has entered its 12th stage, and the excitement around it is off the charts. Priced at just $0.00013 per coin, it offers an unmatched opportunity for early investors to get in before the big launch. So far, over 55 billion coins have been sold, raising an impressive $3.9 million . With its target listing price set at $0.0006, investors stand to gain significantly once it hits the open market. This presale buzz highlights the growing demand for BTFD and its potential to dominate the meme coin landscape. Let’s break that down. An investment of $750 today would get you 7.5 million BTFD coins. Once the coin hits its listing price of $0.0006, your stash could be worth $4,500 . Now imagine if the price soared beyond that—your potential gains could be life-changing. Accessibility and Community Power You can snag BTFD using multiple currencies. For example: 1 Ethereum buys 38,863,600 BTFD coins. $1 USDT gets you 9,981 BTFD coins. 1 Bitcoin? A whopping 984,470,000 coins. The project’s community is growing fast, with over 5,400 holders already. With its Play-to-Earn game live and staking rewards in full swing, BTFD is poised to become the best meme coin to buy today.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 03:17:00

The price has experienced a shallow pullback since the local top, and this could be forming a sideways triangle pattern, suggesting market indecision. The pattern is narrowing, and a breakout decision is expected soon. Key Support and Resistance Levels: Support Levels: The key support lies around $2.28 (the internal low of the triangle). A break below this would likely lead to a test of the lower support range between $2 and $2.23. Resistance Levels: The primary resistance lies at $2.53. A break above this could signal the start of a move toward $2.64 to $2.76. Bullish Outlook: If the price breaks above $2.53, this would suggest that the C-wave has started, potentially leading to further gains. The target resistance areas are around $2.64 and $2.76. However, a drop below $2.28 could signal a deeper correction. Bearish Scenario: A break below the red line at $2.28 would invalidate the bullish triangle breakout scenario. In that case, XRP could revisit the lower support levels between $2 and $2.23. Analyst Weighs In According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, XRP had a bullish breakout from a flag pattern, and it’s now retesting the previous resistance, which has flipped to support. If XRP holds above $2.37, the bullish flag pattern targets a price around $3.79, offering a potential 50-60% upside. This target would only be invalidated if the price drops below $2.37, especially if it breaks below $2.28.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 03:27:30

Bullish on Bitcoin with a price target of $125k by March, driven by strong ETF inflows, low exchange reserves, and potential regulatory support. Mt. Gox repayments and MicroStrategy's aggressive buying strategy are unlikely to disrupt the current bullish trend significantly. Key risks include potential market downturns in early 2025 and increased supply from miners if Bitcoin prices drop. The ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) holds futures instead of spot Bitcoin. For now, I prefer various competitors that hold Bitcoin. Probably the best thing, if you can manage, is to hold your Bitcoins through a hardware wallet. ProShares charges 0.95% on an annualized basis. The fund also distributes some gains, which can make it a bit tedious to keep your exposure up. On the other hand, you're automatically selling some over time. Futures also tend to suffer from roll-yield. This is one reason why it doesn't track the Bitcoin price perfectly: BITO lags bitcoin price (Seeking Alpha) The fees on U.S. traded Bitcoin ETF's tend to be lower: BITO GBTC IBIT ARKB BITB BTC Fund Name ProShares Bitcoin ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF Fund Type Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Alternative Issuer ProShares Grayscale iShares 21Shares US LLC Bitwise Investments Grayscale Inception 10/18/2021 09/25/2013 01/05/2024 01/10/2024 01/10/2024 07/31/2024 Expense Ratio 0.95% 1.50% 0.12% 0.21% 0.20% 0.15% AUM $2.60B $21.15B $53.00B $4.85B $4.07B $3.90B Only the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) is a more expensive way to get exposure. However, there can be advantages to going through futures. Some cryptocurrencies have a yield. That's currently not the case with Bitcoin. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is a well-known example. In Europe, there are a lot of cryptocurrency products that pass along (part of) that yield. In the U.S. that's not the case. For most U.S. investors, it is hard to get access to those products. However, professional global traders can buy these (collect yield) and offset the crypto exposure by selling futures. These kinds of arbitrage trades can then have an effect on the futures curve and implicitly pass on some of the yield. However, I'd still rather pick and choose which futures to buy but wanted to mention it. In any case, I think the details of BITO vs any of these other products are overshadowed by the consideration of whether you want Bitcoin exposure or not. The volatility level is so high that these, often important, issues take a bit of a back seat. Mt. Gox On Bitcoin, I remain bullish. In my most recent article about Bitcoin, I set a price target of $88k for the end of the year. That's been exceeded now, and I'll move the goalpost in the conclusion. There are several reasons I'm not too worried $100k Bitcoin marks the top yet. I've commented on the Mt. Gox repayment saga quite a few times in the past. Some money has been repaid. Creditors got to choose whether they wanted to be repaid asap or were okay with a bit of an outdrawn procedure. The reason for that being there always remain small issues to be resolved, and it isn't great if that's holding up the entire process. Of course, the creditors picking the early option gave up some of the ultimate theoretical economics. The holdouts should ultimately be slightly better off but get to endure. The rehabilitation trustee posted the following English doc laying out the reasons. In practice, at the time of posting, there was still 44,905 BTC that needed to be sent out, and the deadline was moved to October 31, 2025, due to a variety of reasons like having to find the right people, legal dispute, etc. Here's a quote: With the exception of certain types of repayments, the Rehabilitation Trustee has largely completed the Base Repayment, Early Lump-Sum Repayment, and Intermediate Repayment (collectively, the ""Repayments"") for rehabilitation creditors who have completed the necessary procedures for receiving repayments and have not encountered any issues during the Repayments process. However, many rehabilitation creditors still have not received their Repayments because they have not completed the necessary procedures for receiving Repayments. Additionally, a considerable number of rehabilitation creditors have not received their Repayments due to various reasons, such as issues arising during the Repayments process. This just makes for a more gradual release of this BTC. Given we're in a bull market for Bitcoin, I'm not too worried about this additional supply because holders will be more inclined to continue hodling, the market is able to absorb any selling better, and the repayments likely continue throughout the year as issues get solved. Inflows Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are strong. Inflows are at levels similar to when ETFs were launched. The difference being this time there are virtual no offsetting outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). At the time, investors were migrating from this higher fee product to the newly available and cheaper alternatives. In other words; there is a lot of interest currently. spot bitcoin flows (THE BLOCK) Exchange reserves Because exchange reserves have hit a multi-year low and are trending down hard since April I wanted to highlight this: Exchange reserve assets (Crypto Quant) Elevated (and especially rising) exchange reserves can indicate future selling. If you want your Bitcoin to be secure, you don't have it on an exchange. The reason it is moved there is for trading purposes (which means selling). With Bitcoin, this can be tracked because blockchain movement can be followed. The inverse (dollars getting moved there) can't be tracked in the same way. Trump's election In this article , I wrote: Personally, I expected Bitcoin to benefit from either election outcome. If only because the uncertainty of the election would end. I'm bullish on Bitcoin for other reasons as well, more deeply explored in this article . Q4 tends to be a very good quarter for Bitcoin (since 2016) and November specifically (an average of +50% and +30% results according to Tastylive ). For good measure, Trump wasn't as pro-Bitcoin during his previous run. In my view, the pre-market run will likely continue. I severely underestimated how excited the crypto community responded to a Trump victory. I still mentioned and expected Bitcoin and crypto companies to do well in the article mentioned but not to the extent it has. It is impossible to prove, as there are no counterfactuals, but I expected Bitcoin and the market to rise with a Kamala win as well. Anything was simply an improvement from the status-quo under Biden. Most interestingly, Trump has indicated he likes the idea of establishing a national Bitcoin reserve. It's an idea that's been worked on by Senator Cynthia Lummis, who advocates for the government to buy 1 million Bitcoins over 5 years. At most there will be 21 million of these things out there, so that's a considerable amount. If this idea gets implemented, I'd expect the outcome to be staggering, but it's not my base case. Just a more positive regulatory environment should have a positive effect, if nothing else, on the capital raising for crypto-associated companies. MicroStrategy I've been writing on Seeking Alpha about Bitcoin since 2016. Almost always favorably, as I think there's real merit to this interesting novel asset with all its widely discussed properties. I'm not a huge fan of certain derivatives of Bitcoin, like MicroStrategy (MSTR). I'd only touch something like that if you knew exactly what you were doing. But as I discussed here in more detail, MicroStrategy can have a large effect on Bitcoin's price. Since my last Bitcoin article, MicroStrategy has announced an astounding $42 billion plan to raise capital . Saylor is generally very upfront about what he will do with raised capital; buy Bitcoin. Historically, MicroStrategy follows this up with another capital raise if the price continues to rise. It will play defense if/when prices fall. Only part of the capital raising has happened, and it is likely designed to get some headlines, but it's an aggressive buyer who's waking up after being absent for a while. Risks The current key risks to me are that we've moved past November, which is a very good month for Bitcoin, and are moving towards early 2025. Especially, January can be a tough month. Perhaps with some of the buzz generated during the holidays slowing down. I've written often about the halving of 2024 and what it could potentially mean because miners bring less supply to market. However, when Bitcoin is rallying, crypto firms like MicroStrategy, but also the miners get to raise money at much more favorable terms. They tend to pounce on these opportunities: capital raising by miners (TheMinerMag) When this money gets converted into crypto-mining hardware, that results in more and more supply coming to market. When demand flags, the additional supply can start having an effect. Bitcoin prices go down, decreasing revenue miners are generating, causing them to sell more of their Bitcoin production and/or reserves. Conclusion I'm still quite bullish in the short term and the very long term. I'll likely get a bit more careful around Q1 2025. I'd strongly reconsider exposure if we move to $70k. This would be a clear change from the current bullish trend. Depending on the events driving such a drop, I'd either sit or potentially buy back in later. As for the upside, based on seasonal Bitcoin performance data, I think we could see Bitcoin $125k before the end of March. In my previous article I arrived at a price target of $88k primarily based on historical seasonal Bitcoin returns. Updating that number with seasonality return data up to March, starting from today's price, I get to $125k. Keep in mind that's just a possible target, and I'm more confident near-term prospects remain fine as with any exact target being achieved. For example, with the right tweets from a fresh President, higher prices are possible. Given all of the above, BITO and other Bitcoin funds remain a buy.",ARKB|BITB|BTC|ETH-USD|GBTC|IBIT|BITO,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-16 03:53:14

Analyst Says DOGE Is Basically Ready For the Next Move,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-to-24-analyst-says-doge-is-basically-ready-for-the-next-move/,"Cantonese Cat, a recognized cryptocurrency market analyst, has projected an extraordinary price target for Dogecoin, suggesting that the meme coin could rise to $24. This ambitious forecast represents a potential gain of over 5,823% from current levels, fueled by technical indicators and recent whale activity. Dogecoin has experienced mixed performance in recent weeks. After a sharp rally in early November that saw its price climb 132% in three weeks to $0.4800—marking a three-year high—the cryptocurrency has since retraced by 16%, currently trading around $0.4052. Despite this pullback, optimism remains strong among analysts and investors. According to Cantonese Cat, the asset’s recent price movements suggest the cryptocurrency is positioned for a significant breakout. The analyst highlighted that the token has successfully defended key support levels, particularly around the 0.786 Fibonacci extension. Based on historical trends, Dogecoin followed a similar pattern during its 2021 bull cycle, when it rallied from this level to surpass the 2.272 Fibonacci extension, peaking at $0.73995. Cantonese Cat predicts that Dogecoin could replicate this historical pattern and reach the same Fibonacci level at $24. If this target is met, the token’s market capitalization will exceed $3.5 trillion, solidifying its position as a major player in the crypto market. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Whale Accumulation Signals Growing Optimism In addition to technical analysis, recent whale activity further supports the bullish outlook for the asset. Market analyst Ali Martinez has observed significant accumulation among large holders, signaling increased confidence in the asset’s future potential. Martinez shared data that whales holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE purchased 160 million tokens, valued at approximately $64 million, within the last 24 hours. This accumulation has brought the total to 22 billion DOGE, worth around $9 billion. Such large-scale acquisitions indicate strong market sentiment and often precede substantial price rallies. The willingness of high-value investors to buy during a dip suggests they anticipate a significant upward movement in the token’s price. While the broader cryptocurrency market has shown bullish momentum, Dogecoin’s trajectory remains uncertain as it contends with critical resistance levels. Nevertheless, analysts like Cantonese Cat and Ali Martinez believe the token is well-positioned for future growth, supported by historical trends and whale activity.

Qubetics’ dVPN, Ripple’s Speed, and Monero’s Anonymity Stand Out as Smart Choices",https://timestabloid.com/searching-for-the-best-cryptos-to-invest-in-today-qubetics-dvpn/,"What makes a cryptocurrency worth your attention? With so many choices in the market, selecting the best cryptos to invest in today can be tricky. The exciting part is that some projects bring revolutionary solutions to the table. This article dives into three top contenders: Qubetics ($TICS) , Ripple, and Monero. Each of these offers something unique, from privacy enhancements to real-world use cases. Qubetics has quickly turned heads with its cutting-edge decentralised solutions, especially its decentralised VPN (dVPN). Unlike its predecessors, Qubetics doesn’t just push innovation—it actively addresses real-world challenges that other blockchains have struggled to solve. Let’s take a closer look at what sets these cryptos apart and why they’re the talk of the town. Qubetics Tackles Privacy with Game-Changing Solutions Qubetics ($TICS) has been causing a stir with its focus on decentralisation and user-centric applications. Its most talked-about innovation, the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , is a huge leap forward for internet privacy and security. Unlike traditional VPNs that depend on centralised servers, Qubetics creates a peer-to-peer network that ensures no single authority controls user data. This guarantees unparalleled transparency and privacy. To understand its impact, let’s consider a real-world example. Picture an entrepreneur who frequently handles sensitive business communications. Traditional VPNs may leave gaps for data breaches. With Qubetics’ dVPN , they can send and receive information securely, without worrying about third-party interference. Similarly, in regions with strict censorship, individuals can access the web freely, bypassing restrictions while staying anonymous. But there’s more to Qubetics than privacy. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, it connects leading blockchains under one platform. This means smoother cross-chain transactions and a unified ecosystem. The ongoing Qubetics presale has grabbed attention too. Currently in its 12th stage, it has raised over $6.4 million, sold 334 million $TICS, and attracted more than 9,700 token holders. Each presale stage lasts just seven days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at midnight. These structured stages have created buzz around the $TICS presale , with analysts predicting significant growth in its value. If you’re curious to learn more about Qubetics, this video dives deeper into its features: Learn everything you need about this project . It’s clear that Qubetics isn’t just another blockchain project; it’s solving real problems in a practical, user-friendly way. Ripple Focuses on Revolutionising Cross-Border Payments Ripple has made a name for itself as the go-to solution for cross-border payments. Using its native digital asset XRP, Ripple enables near-instant money transfers across borders at a fraction of the cost charged by traditional banking systems. Banks and financial institutions have adopted Ripple’s technology to modernise their payment infrastructure, making it a favourite among investors looking for practical utility. One of Ripple’s standout features is its consensus algorithm, which replaces the energy-intensive mining process used by many blockchains. This not only makes Ripple faster but also more eco-friendly. Transactions settle within seconds, a significant improvement over traditional systems like SWIFT, which can take days. For businesses and individuals who regularly send or receive international payments, Ripple offers a seamless experience that’s hard to ignore. However, Ripple’s journey hasn’t been without challenges. Its ongoing legal battle with the SEC over whether XRP is a security has created uncertainty in the market. Despite this, Ripple continues to thrive, forging new partnerships with major institutions worldwide. As the case inches closer to a resolution, many investors see this as an opportunity to get involved at a potentially pivotal time. Ripple’s focus on solving real-world problems makes it one of the best cryptos to invest in today. Its practical applications in the financial sector and growing adoption by banks make it a strong contender for long-term growth. Monero Brings Privacy to the Forefront If privacy is your top priority, Monero might be the cryptocurrency for you. Unlike most blockchains that operate with transparent ledgers, Monero uses advanced cryptographic techniques to keep transactions private. This means senders, receivers, and transaction amounts are all hidden, offering unmatched anonymity for users. Monero’s appeal lies in its ability to provide true financial freedom. Whether you’re a freelancer who wants to keep payments private or a business looking to maintain confidentiality, Monero’s features cater to diverse needs. Its RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) technology ensures that no one can trace the source, destination, or amount of a transaction. However, this level of privacy has also attracted criticism. Some governments and regulatory bodies have raised concerns about Monero’s potential misuse for illegal activities. Despite this, Monero remains a popular choice for users who prioritise privacy and security in their financial dealings. Another strength of Monero is its active developer community, which continuously works on updates and improvements. This ensures that the network remains robust and secure, even as other blockchains face scaling and security challenges. For investors seeking a cryptocurrency with a clear focus and loyal user base, Monero offers a unique proposition. Wrapping Up on Today’s Best Cryptos The best cryptos to invest in today depend on what you’re looking for. Ripple stands out for its role in revolutionising global payments, Monero caters to those prioritising privacy, and Qubetics shines as a blockchain innovator addressing real-world challenges. Each of these projects has its unique strengths, making them worthy of attention. As Qubetics presale continues to break records, it’s clear that $TICS is more than just a cryptocurrency—it’s a platform poised for growth. With over $6.4 million raised and a growing community of token holders, Qubetics is creating waves in the crypto world. If you’re ready to explore a crypto project with real utility, now might be the perfect time to take a closer look at these options.

Known for its focus on scalability and user-friendly decentralised applications, Near Protocol has been making waves in the blockchain space. Its rise in value has left early adopters grinning ear-to-ear, while those who missed the boat are left wondering, “What now?” If you’re feeling that FOMO, don’t worry—you’re not out of options yet. While Near Protocol continues to thrive, there’s another project that’s catching the crypto world’s attention for all the right reasons. Meet Qubetics ($TICS) , a revolutionary Web3 aggregator that’s taking blockchain innovation to a whole new level. With its focus on real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics is emerging as the best crypto to buy in December 2024, offering investors a rare opportunity for sky-high returns. Qubetics ($TICS): The Best Crypto to Buy in December 2024 for Groundbreaking Growth Let’s talk about Qubetics . This isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s a trailblazer in the blockchain space, tackling problems that most projects don’t even attempt to solve. Qubetics is the world’s first Web3 aggregator, making real-world asset tokenization not only possible but practical for businesses, creatives, and individuals alike. Imagine you’re a small business owner in Chicago with a warehouse full of inventory you can’t liquidate. Traditionally, you’d have to jump through hoops to get a loan, but with Qubetics, you can tokenize that inventory, turning it into blockchain-backed digital assets. Suddenly, you’ve got liquidity without the hassle of dealing with banks. Now think about a landlord in Austin who wants to unlock equity from a property without selling it outright. Qubetics allows them to tokenize a portion of their property, opening up new revenue streams while retaining ownership. It’s not just for businesses. Imagine an artist in Los Angeles who wants to sell their work directly to buyers around the world. By tokenizing their creations on Qubetics, they cut out the middlemen, keep more of their earnings, and reach a global audience with ease. Here’s the kicker: Qubetics is still in presale, and it’s already creating a buzz. Currently in Phase 12, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.0311. The project has raised over $6.4 million, with more than 334 million tokens sold to over 9,400 holders. The presale price increases by 10% every week, and the final phase will see a 20% jump. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 after the presale ends, offering a jaw-dropping 900% ROI for those who get in early. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy in December 2024, Qubetics isn’t just an option—it’s the frontrunner for anyone seeking massive returns and meaningful innovation. Near Protocol (NEAR): A Blockchain Powerhouse for Scalable Solutions Near Protocol has made a name for itself as one of the most innovative projects in the blockchain world. With its focus on scalability, speed, and ease of use, Near Protocol has become a go-to platform for developers building decentralised applications (dApps). Its unique architecture and innovative solutions have earned it a loyal following and a spot among the top blockchain projects. In 2024, Near Protocol has continued to build on its success. Its integration with other blockchains through its Rainbow Bridge technology has expanded its ecosystem, making it a key player in the world of interoperability. Near’s user-friendly tools and developer-focused approach have drawn in projects from across the crypto space, helping it maintain its momentum. Price-wise, NEAR has seen steady growth throughout the year, reflecting its strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Analysts predict that its upward trajectory is likely to continue as the platform attracts more developers and users. However, while Near Protocol is a solid project with a bright future, its early explosive growth has already passed. For investors looking for a ground-floor opportunity with the potential for sky-high returns, Qubetics offers a unique and compelling alternative. Why Qubetics and Near Protocol Are Both Worth Considering Here’s the thing: you don’t have to choose between these two projects. Qubetics and Near Protocol serve different purposes and cater to different types of investors, making them both valuable additions to a diversified portfolio. Near Protocol is perfect for those who believe in the future of dApps and blockchain interoperability. Its focus on scalability and user-friendliness ensures that it will remain a key player in the crypto space for years to come. It’s a great option for investors seeking steady, long-term growth in a proven project. Qubetics, on the other hand, is all about real-world impact and explosive potential. Its focus on real-world asset tokenization is innovative and practical, opening up new opportunities for businesses, creatives, and individuals. With its presale offering a rare opportunity for massive ROI, Qubetics is the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone looking to maximise their returns. Both projects are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in blockchain, and together, they offer a balanced mix of stability and high-growth potential. Regret skipping Near Protocol’s rise?

The on-chain analytics platform Nansen has shared with CryptoPotato key insights into important institutional trends that will gain momentum in the crypto market in 2025. However, these narratives are expected to do well under a clearer regulatory framework, which is anticipated under the Trump administration. Institutional Interest to Rise in 2025 The crypto industry is likely to experience a surge in institutional interest in both listed crypto products. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) could become part of the default-balanced asset allocation among asset managers and pension funds. Nansen analysts noted that buy-side investors may begin integrating crypto into standard allocations – moving from a traditional 60/40 equity-bond split to a 55/40/5 equity/bond/crypto split. “This comes from a feeling of “missing out” on the past 40% BTC rally three weeks after the election. Can investors afford not to be allocated at all to crypto going forward?” the report questioned. Bitcoin could also emerge as a frequently used collateral in traditional lending and decentralized finance (DeFi). Word is spreading that stablecoin issuer Tether is already in talks with the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald about a $2 billion BTC lending project. The Tokenization Trend Furthermore, the launch of new derivative products like Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) options indicates increasing institutional adoption. Nansen mentioned that such products and their trading platforms will also attract fees for financial intermediaries, so the sector is likely to surge. Moreover, institutions are exploring the tokenization of financial assets at an increasing pace. U.S. firms are taking major strides toward integrating blockchain in financial markets, and this could be the basis for significant growth if authorities provide clear rules for such operations. One more trend that could drive growth in the crypto sector is stablecoin regulation. If the U.S. makes progress on stablecoin regulatory frameworks, then there could be higher institutional adoption of tokenized fiat currencies. In the meantime, Nansen says the market is seeing a healthy rotation among outperforming cryptocurrencies amid a relatively shallow consolidation after the election. While December’s historical seasonality suggests a positive environment, there could be heightened volatility by January as the new U.S. administration takes office.

Bitcoin investments are best made countercyclically, during periods of low interest and panic, not during peak hype. The Company's bullish case is convoluted and lacks clear, sustainable cash flow generation, unlike straightforward business models like McDonald's or Google. For Bitcoin exposure, consider Bitcoin ETFs or even futures instead of MSTR, which carries additional risks and complexities and is inefficient. Before I start my discussion on MicroStrategy: I would like to set the tone that I'm not a crypto-denier: I was on the record strongly bullish on Coinbase ( COIN ) on October 10, 2022, during the crypto winter, and it has since gone up 367%. Coinbase coverage (Seeking Alpha) Ironically, as shown below, Bitcoin was trading at $20-30k apiece at that time and interest in Bitcoin was much more muted. Bitcoin price (StockCharts) After briefly introducing my crypto ""credentials"" of honking the bullhorn during the winter stage, I'm going to expand on why I think MicroStrategy should be avoided by investors. Now there is already a lot of bearish coverage on Seeking Alpha, so I'm not going to repeat their points, rather this article will focus on adding a few points: 1. Bitcoin investments are best done countercylically In fact, in the past 5 years, the good buy points were when there was panic and uncertainty, prices were low and sentiment was muted, e.g. as shown in the green boxes below (1) during the COVID panic in early/mid-2020, (2) the subsiding of the bubble during late 2022 and (3) during many uncertainties in mid-2024. Remember when there was worrying over Germany selling crypto in June/July 2024 ? Turns out that was near the low point of the whole year (a cynic might suggest the news of Germany selling a mere $1-$2 billion worth of bitcoin was exaggerated to drive down prices for accumulation, but that would just be pure guessing). Bitcoin price (StockCharts) Another way to gauge sentiment is by using Google Trends and searching for Bitcoin (a lower reading on the indicator indicates less search interest comparatively and vice versa). Note how periods with low search interest were usually bullish for Bitcoin (green boxes), while periods of high search interest and high anticipation (red boxes, i.e. right now, with hype of Strategic National Bitcoin Reserve ) were usually not so good for Bitcoin price performance. So even if an investor were bullish on Bitcoin for the long run, this is probably not the ideal time. Bitcoin Google Trends 2. Convoluted logic and unclarity of MSTR's business model Peter Lynch had a rule that analysts could deliver their pitch for why a stock was a good investment in 90 seconds. That's because the best investments have business models that are easy to clearly articulate. Many of the best investments of all time are easily understandable by any layman if articulated professionally. For example, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, Google etc. You can see the customers going to and from McDonald's, you can see people smoking and not really quitting, and you can see people using Google every day (whether or not these products and services have any negative externalities that need to be otherwise regulated or managed is a different topic). Their business models are visible and verifiable and there's no question about their existence and utility and popularity with customers. However, when it comes to MicroStrategy bulls, in my opinion, their bullish case is so circuitous and convoluted, it's hard to understand, and you need to continuously try to convince yourself that it makes sense and that in itself is a huge red flag to me. Maybe in the end it'll work out, but I highly doubt it. If we browse through some of the recent analysis on Seeking Alpha, bullish arguments about MSTR include raising debt at 0% to buy ""an appreciating asset (i.e. Bitcoin""). But Bitcoin, unlike real estate, does not yield cash flow, so where does the cash flows come from in the long run? Even Michael Saylor admits that ""MicroStrategy found a way to outperform Bitcoin. The way that we outperform Bitcoin, in essence, is we just lever up Bitcoin."" That does not sound to me like much of a business model. When an investor buys McDonald's or Google, he's buying into the perpetual future cash flows that these businesses can generate in the future. If MSTR is essentially just a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, why should an investor buy MSTR (which is trading at a massive premium to the Bitcoin MSTR owns. MSTR has a market cap of $88 bn while it owns roughly $40bn of Bitcoin at current prices of $100k/coin, and that's before considering the bonds MSTR has issued that will need to be repaid somehow, further diluting the current shareholder and increasing MSTR's effective ""premium to net asset value"") and not just buy Bitcoin futures? What exactly are investors paying MSTR for that they cannot get in terms of adding or reducing leverage ratio in Bitcoin futures? This reminds me of what Greenspan wrote in his memoir ""The Age of Turbulence"" about Enron. Now, I'm not saying or alleging that MSTR is doing anything improper or anything like Enron; however, the similarity is that Greenspan viewed Enron's explanation of its business case as complicated and no one knew how it was making money. Eventually, it turns out it was not making money at all and was a house of cards. My view is that at times when darling stock prices have surged, investors in the market are at max gullibility and any story stock with a stock price still appreciating lures in believers. With NVDA going up 1000+% in a year and a half, anything seems possible. Investors should have learned from the Everything Bubble of 2021 receding that when the tide goes out, these speculative issues go kaput, but it seems like they are just doubling down. In fact, when the Everything Bubble of 2021 went out, MSTR fell by 90% from peak to trough as shown below. An investor would have made substantial gains by buying Bitcoin in mid-2020 in the $10ks and in late 2022 Bitcoin even at its trough was mostly in the 20ks. But joining the rollercoaster in MSTR, especially at times of peak interest, was calamitous the last time around and my assessment is that it is not a good risk-adjusted bet this time around either. MSTR stock price (StockCharts) Risks to bearish thesis Again, I would not recommending shorting this stock. Market enthusiasm can continue for way longer than anyone can predict (or sustain) and maybe MSTR doubles or triples and keeps their money machine going on for much longer. Conclusion Individual investors are strongly cautioned against buying MSTR or putting substantial amounts of their life/retirement savings into it. Its business model is unclear and if MSTR is just a levered bet on Bitcoin, then investors can just buy Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin futures to gain the same exposure. Note that I am not suggesting a leveraged exposure to Bitcoins, but if that's what investors are looking for, it would probably be more efficient than buying MSTR.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-16 04:36:00

Now, he’s back with a new creation: the XRP $ARMY logo. Lobanovskiy described it as “the helmet of courage, an unstoppable ‘X’ of strength,” symbolizing the power of the XRP Army. As he puts it, “The XRP Army is more than just a community—it’s a movement. We shall prevail.” XRP enthusiasts appreciated his efforts and thanked him for the logo. A user said, “Wow. I didn’t even know that you are behind the xrp logo. I was always fan of your work Eddie, but now you are officially one of my super top favorite artists.” Another wrote, “I’m really proud of being part of the #XRPArmy movement. But now with the new logo… This is just the next level, thanks so much for this.” https://twitter.com/lobanovskiy/status/1866877220209250806 The XRP Army has been a strong supporter of Ripple, especially during the tough SEC lawsuit.In October this year, they started a petition on Change.org asking the SEC to stop its appeal in the case. The petition has almost 10,000 signatures. Ripple supporters believe that the SEC’s ongoing legal actions are causing unnecessary instability. The petition brings to light the four-year fight with the SEC, where Ripple supporters have worked to protect the company’s legitimacy. The XRP Army believes the SEC’s actions go against its goal of protecting investors and ensuring fair markets. Ripple Vs SEC: An Ongoing Saga The Ripple lawsuit started in December 2020 when the SEC accused Ripple Labs of selling XRP as an unregistered security, which Ripple denies. In the latest developments, the SEC must file its appeal-related opening brief by January 15, just days before Chair Gary Gensler leaves the agency. His successor, Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, is known for advocating more lenient regulation, especially in the crypto space. With Gensler leaving soon, there’s speculation he may try to settle big cases like Ripple’s before he goes, but it’s unclear if that will happen.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 04:40:36

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 04:41:00

The U.S. central bank is expected to reduce the benchmark borrowing cost by 25 basis points to the 4.25% to 4.5% range, marking a total easing of 100 basis points since September. However, there are concerns that the accompanying Fed commentary will seek to temper expectations for further easing, potentially diminishing the bullish impact of the rate cut. The Fed will announce its rate decision, the dot plot, comprising interest rate projections, and economic forecasts on Dec. 18 at 14:00 ET. A press conference by the Fed Chair Jerome Powell will occur a half hour later. The previous dot plot released on Sept. 18 showed 2.5 points of rate cuts by the end of 2026, pushing the borrowing cost below 3%. Some observers believe the Fed will trim these forecasts on Wednesday. ""We suggest the risk of a 'hawkish' cut with less rate hikes next year than anticipated in September in the Summary of Economic Projections (dot plot), recognition that economy is stronger than it had expected previously, and inflation is on a bumpy path that allows the Fed to be patient,"" Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said in Sunday's edition of the newsletter. If the projections reflect slower or fewer rate cuts, Treasury yields and the dollar will likely extend their recent run higher, potentially making it harder for risk assets, including BTC, to stay as strongly bid as they have been of late. That said, seasonality is quite bullish for BTC, and with President-elect Trump sending positive regulatory vibes to crypto, a potential hawkish Fed may not have a long-lasting impact on the cryptocurrency. Besides, the Fed rate cuts will still remain on the table alongside an expected easing from China, keeping BTC's bull case intact. ""Yet, whilst lots of ink will be spilled on the pace of cuts going forward, little detracts from the supportive macro dynamic of a global central bank rate cutting cycle and rising global liquidity, set to be propelled by China,"" founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub said. Later this week, markets will get the latest core PCE reading, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, which will reveal whether the recent upticks in consumer price inflation are a fluke or hints of a genuine inflation rebound.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-16 04:53:33

Despite this impressive performance, some analysts believe the cryptocurrency has the potential to achieve even higher milestones. EGRAG CRYPTO, a well-known market analyst, recently shared insights suggesting that XLM could climb to $2, representing a 371% increase from its current price levels. #XLM – The Squeak Update!

He referenced a significant event in 2020 when the asset broke above its exponential moving average (EMA) on the two-week chart. Following that breakout, the asset experienced a dramatic rally, gaining over 3,100% to reach $0.80. The analyst noted that Stellar (XLM) once again broke above this same EMA in 2023, showing the possibility of a similar upward growth. Based on historical performance and current charts, he set a potential target of $2.27 for the digital asset. As of now, the token is trading at approximately $0.4134 and reaching the $2 target would require a 360% increase from its current price. Price Action and Resistance Levels While EGRAG is confident in XLM’s potential, he emphasized that the journey to $2 will not be immediate or without obstacles. In a follow-up post, he provided a detailed roadmap for how the asset could achieve this milestone. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst suggested that XLM’s first major test will be breaking its all-time high of $0.90. Once this resistance is cleared, he expects the price to retrace slightly before climbing to $1.20 and beyond. This prediction is based on XLM’s weekly price action, which positions the asset in the middle of an ascending channel. EGRAG highlighted that the $0.90 level represents a strong resistance zone and will likely serve as a key inflection point. If the asset successfully breaks through this barrier, it could set the stage for further gains. Stellar’s Strong Momentum The asset’s recent performance has been part of a broader bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market. Over the past 30 days, the asset has delivered substantial returns to investors, fueling optimism about its long-term potential. Analysts like EGRAG believe the ongoing rally and favorable technical indicators provide a solid foundation for continued growth. While the path to $2 may be gradual, the projection underscores the strong momentum behind the token and its potential to deliver significant returns. Investors will likely monitor resistance levels and market conditions closely as the asset attempts to reach new heights.

Just 6 hours before the price surge, two multisign wallets with a common creator address withdrew their first ETH and staked them. Has some new institution started accumulating Ethereum, maybe. Their unrealized profit grew to $517,754 before coming back to $157,570 as ETH price fell to $3,930. The Break down Two multisign wallets 0x23a…dad and 0xc9c…d04 withdrew a total of 4,502 ETH worth $17.54 from Binance. This was the first withdrawal for both the wallets. Interestingly, both these multisign wallets have a common creation wallet 0x7cf…617. The withdrawals were executed between ETH price $3,880 and $3,900. These tokens were then staked to KelpDAO. Source : Spotonchain With the amount and timing of these transactions, it looks like these actions belong to some institution. It timed the movement of Ethereum perfectly as just 6 hours later, the token reached $4,022. The value of staked tokens rose by 3% creating an unrealized profit of $517k. One thing to keep in mind is that multisign wallets are commonly used by institutions. The Mysterious Institution It would not be possible to clearly state if this is some institution or a new fund. The wallets have no history and hence there is no way of tracking it. There are many possibilities. Source : X.com These addresses might belong to some new fund, or a DAO or even some major investor testing the waters. One of the multisign wallet is 4 days old and the other one is made just 15 hours ago. Even their creator wallet originated 51 days ago. Correlation with ETH Price Movement The most interesting part of these transactions is their timing. Were the transactions made based on some analyses as the time aligns perfectly with Ethereum recovery to $4k. Or it was vice versa? Did these transactions fill confidence in the market to push the price up. Whether this is a coincidence or a direct influence, it gives a clear message that the market is sensitive towards significant transactions. The Market Movement At the time of writing Ethereum is trading at $3,930, a0.28% drop in the last 24 hours. Before falling the token rose by 2.06% reaching $4,022. The price is facing rejection from upper levels and Moving Average is the first line of defence at the support level around $3,940. RSI is following the price action and has fallen to 53.19, still holding solid. Currently there is no reason for the market to fall down . The rise in trading volume by 11.26% shows traders are showing interest. Source : Tradingview What to Expect? With time, we might discover who was behind this major ethereum transaction but it is sure, after bitcoin, institutions are also getting interested in ETH. The price stands solid near $4k.

With a recent price of $105,688, the cryptocurrency has increased by more than 50% since the election on November 5. Plus, ether increased by about 3% to $4,014. On Chain data revealed that nearly 27,000 Bitcoins, worth $2.8 billion, were withdrawn from major exchanges over the weekend, potentially driving prices higher due to reduced supply. This is an electrifying effect of Trump’s ultimate vision is to ensure America’s dominance in crypto before anyone else takes over, particularly against competitors like China, has fueled confidence among investors. Moreover, his selection of crypto-friendly figures, including David Sacks as the White House AI and crypto czar and Paul Atkins to head the SEC, signals a policy shift towards mainstream adoption. This move is a green flag for global powers, including Russia, to explore Bitcoin’s potential to counter geopolitical challenges, signaling a possible “Bitcoin cold war.” President Vladimir Putin explores alternatives to the U.S. dollar. Putin recently emphasized Bitcoin’s resilience against restrictions, highlighting its appeal as a hedge against traditional currencies. The Bitcoin reserve plan gained traction as companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla adopted Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks. MicroStrategy now holds 423,650 BTC, worth $43.6 billion, showcasing Bitcoin’s potential as a modern reserve asset. Trump’s proposal for a Bitcoin reserve echoes his earlier promise at the Bitcoin 2024 Conference, where he predicted Bitcoin’s market cap could rival gold’s $16 trillion. Supporting this vision, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the BITCOIN Act, advocating for the U.S. to acquire 1 million Bitcoins over five years to address the $35 trillion national debt. Critics Have Mixed Views on Trump’s Bitcoin Plan Trump needs Congress to approve funding, clear SEC and Treasury guidelines, and Fed cooperation to succeed. In the meanwhile, Strike CEO Jack Mallers believes Donald Trump could issue an executive order on day one to make Bitcoin a U.S. reserve asset. While it wouldn’t involve buying 1 million BTC, Mallers calls it a “significant position” that could reshape Bitcoin’s role in the U.S. economy. Others argue that making Bitcoin part of national reserves could go against its decentralized nature. While price fluctuation are also expected with the plan. Bitcoin Current Scenario Market experts predict Trump’s plans could dramatically impact Bitcoin’s value. Perianne Boring, founder of the Digital Chamber, estimates Bitcoin could reach $800,000 by next year, creating a $15 trillion market cap. She highlighted Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a key driver: “The sky is the limit if Trump’s proposals take shape.” Notably, there are speculations 0.25% interest rate cut from the U.S. Federal Reserve on December 18 could further boost Bitcoin’s momentum, according to analysts.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-16 05:09:55

Aave (AAVE) and Mantra (OM) are outperforming in the DeFi sector while Rollblock (RBLK) is the undisputed top altcoin in crypto gambling. This crypto casino’s presale price increases are accelerating as the demand for its tokens explodes. With only a few weeks left in Rollblock’s crypto presale, investors are racing to get in on the potential for 100x growth while they still can. Aave’s Crypto Lending Tops Sector as DeFi Adoption Rates Soar Aave has been a dominant figure in the DeFi sector for years now. However, the Aave price has only recently started to take off after rising DeFi adoption rates saw users pour into its crypto lending business. Aave now has more than $13 billion in loans and over $33 billion in deposits on its books. The revenue generated by this incredible growth has sent the Aave price 125% higher this month. This strong monthly performance has brought Aave to the top of the DeFi sector for 2024 with over 206% yearly growth. Real World Assets Craze Sends Mantra Soaring 15,000% Mantra has made an even bigger impact on the DeFi sector in 2024 as the demand for Real World Assets (RWA) functionality explodes. Mantra is the top altcoin in RWA, and it has experienced explosive growth as the result of soaring interest in this newest frontier of the crypto industry. The Mantra price outperformed the rest of the DeFi sector this month with a 126% rally. This latest push brings Mantra’s total 2024 growth to more than 15,000%. Analysts expect this rate to slow somewhat in 2024, but the rapid growth in RWA is expected to continue to push the Mantra price higher. Rollblock Bets Big on Crypto Gambling Revolution Rollblock’s crypto gambling wager is set to outperform even DeFi superstars Aave and Mantra. Crypto gambling is an even bigger craze than DeFi, and the gambling industry’s $500 billion in annual revenue dwarfs the potential of the DeFi sector. The excitement over this top altcoin’s take on crypto gambling is because it uses blockchain technology to solve all the problems that have weighed on online gambling for decades. Blockchain gambling with Rollblock means free, fast and seamless access to more than 7,000 of the best provably fair games in the industry and a premier sports betting platform. Rollblock also has a unique gambling token that allows its community to share in the profits of the casino. These tokens are purchased off the market every week with a portion of the casino’s revenue. These tokens are either burned to reduce the market supply or awarded for staking to increase the market demand. Rollblock’s crypto gambling revolution is driving a potential for 100x or higher growth from its current price of only $0.0415. Rollblock recently entered the ninth stage of its crypto presale, which leaves only three more stages before its tokens hit the open market.

MicroStrategy, spearheaded by Michael Saylor, is set to join the Nasdaq-100, marking a major milestone as the first Bitcoin treasury company to enter the prestigious index. Meanwhile, MARA Holdings, a prominent crypto miner, is positioning itself to follow suit, bolstered by substantial Bitcoin investments and a growing market presence. Michael Saylor Hints at MicroStrategy’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase as BTC Hits Six Figures MicroStrategy , under the leadership of Michael Saylor, continues its relentless pursuit of Bitcoin dominance. Over the weekend, Saylor dropped a cryptic hint suggesting that the firm may have made another significant Bitcoin purchase — its first acquisition with an average purchase price exceeding $100,000 per Bitcoin. In a Dec. 15 post on X, Saylor teased followers by asking if the SaylorTracker portfolio tracker was “missing a green dot.” The reference is widely understood by the Bitcoin community as an indication of a new addition to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings. The timing aligns with the firm’s recent pattern of Sunday hints, which have consistently been followed by Bitcoin purchase confirmations on Monday. If confirmed, this acquisition would mark a historic milestone for MicroStrategy: its first Bitcoin purchase in the six-figure price range. Bitcoin has remained above $100,000 since 5:00 PM UTC on Dec. 13, according to CoinGecko . Previous purchases by the business intelligence firm were made at average prices of $97,862, $95,976, and $98,783, with acquisitions amounting to $1.5 billion and $5.7 billion during the last three purchase rounds. As of Dec. 16, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings total 423,650 BTC, valued at over $43.6 billion. Should the latest purchase fall near the upper range of previous acquisitions, the firm’s Bitcoin portfolio would inch closer to a staggering $50 billion valuation. The latest hint comes just ahead of Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $106,554. This monumental price level reinforces Saylor’s confidence in Bitcoin’s future. He has previously stated that MicroStrategy has no intention of slowing down its Bitcoin purchases, even as the cryptocurrency climbs to unprecedented price levels. In a bold statement, Saylor asserted he’s ”sure” the company will continue buying Bitcoin even if its price reaches $1 million per coin. This unwavering strategy has made MicroStrategy synonymous with Bitcoin investment in the corporate world. The company’s stock, MSTR, has reaped the rewards of this approach, skyrocketing 496.4% year-to-date, according to Google Finance data . Such stellar performance has propelled MicroStrategy into the elite Nasdaq-100, a stock index comprising 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq. A Game-Changer for Bitcoin Advocacy Saylor’s commitment to Bitcoin has extended far beyond the corporate realm. As an influential advocate, he has played a crucial role in driving institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. His public comments often serve as a barometer for Bitcoin’s broader acceptance in financial markets. If MicroSrategy’s latest acquisition is confirmed, it could bring the firm tantalizingly close to a $50 billion Bitcoin portfolio. Such a milestone would solidify its status as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, a title it has held for years. As Bitcoin continues to climb to new heights, all eyes are on MicroStrategy to see how far its ambitious Bitcoin strategy can go. Whether Bitcoin reaches $1 million or more, Saylor appears determined to lead the charge. Michael Saylor Predicts MARA Holdings Will Be Next Bitcoin Firm to Join the Nasdaq-100 In related news, Saylor has tipped MARA Holdings, a leading cryptocurrency mining firm, as the next Bitcoin-focused company to join the Nasdaq-100 Index. The prediction came in a Dec. 14 post on X, where Saylor responded to MARA Holdings chairman and CEO Fred Thiel, who congratulated MicroStrategy on its recent inclusion in the prestigious index. “Thanks, Fred. I expect $MARA will be the next,” Saylor remarked, signaling confidence in MARA Holdings’ trajectory toward becoming one of the largest publicly traded companies on the Nasdaq exchange. MicroStrategy’s inclusion in the Nasdaq-100, set to take effect before the trading day on Dec. 23, cements its position as a trailblazer in Bitcoin adoption among publicly traded firms. The company, recognized as the first Bitcoin treasury company to achieve this milestone, has seen its market capitalization soar to $94.77 billion as of Dec. 13, according to Financecharts. Fred Thiel, MARA Holdings’ CEO, acknowledged MicroStrategy’s achievement, stating, “Congratulations to $MSTR and @saylor for being the first Bitcoin treasury company to join the Nasdaq 100.” He further emphasized that MARA is “working hard to get there,” pointing to the firm’s ambition to follow MicroStrategy’s footsteps. MARA Holdings, a leading Bitcoin mining company, has aggressively expanded its Bitcoin holdings. In the last two months alone, the firm has invested over $600 million in Bitcoin, according to a Dec. 2 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Despite its smaller market capitalization of $7.32 billion compared to MicroStrategy, MARA is positioning itself as a key player in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Its stock price has also demonstrated growth, closing at $22.73 on Dec. 13 — up 16.74% over the past six months, according to Google Finance data. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 is reserved for the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange by market capitalization. Being part of this elite index signals strong financial performance, innovation, and investor confidence. MicroStrategy’s addition to the Nasdaq-100 coincides with the removal of three companies: Illumina, Super Micro Computer, and Moderna. The change reflects the dynamic nature of the index, where only the most competitive companies maintain their positions. MARA’s Call for US Leadership in Bitcoin MARA Holdings has not only focused on expanding its Bitcoin holdings but has also emerged as a vocal advocate for US dominance in Bitcoin mining and adoption. In a Nov. 26 post on X, the firm urged the US government to take more aggressive steps to secure its leadership in Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, framing the issue as a matter of national security. “The United States faces an urgent need to secure its economic and national security interests,” MARA stated, drawing parallels between Bitcoin and gold as strategic reserves. The firm’s call to action comes amidst a global trend of de-dollarization, as countries increasingly diversify away from reliance on the US dollar. MARA’s push for US leadership in Bitcoin aligns with the growing narrative of Bitcoin as a strategic asset in the global economy. As geopolitical dynamics shift and the role of the US dollar in international trade faces challenges, Bitcoin’s decentralized and borderless nature is seen by many as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Michael Saylor’s unwavering belief in Bitcoin as a superior treasury asset has been instrumental in driving institutional adoption. His prediction that MARA will join the Nasdaq-100 suggests an increasing convergence of cryptocurrency firms with traditional financial markets. As MicroStrategy prepares to officially join the Nasdaq-100, it sets a precedent for other Bitcoin-focused firms like MARA Holdings to follow. The crypto miner’s recent investments and advocacy efforts underscore its commitment to becoming a major player in the Bitcoin space. With Bitcoin adoption continuing to rise and institutional players making significant moves, the inclusion of more crypto-centric companies in major indices like the Nasdaq-100 appears inevitable. Saylor’s prediction for MARA Holdings could be a glimpse into a broader trend where Bitcoin firms solidify their positions in traditional financial markets. Whether MARA will indeed be next remains to be seen, but its trajectory suggests it is well on its way to joining the upper echelons of the financial world. For now, the spotlight remains on MicroStrategy’s achievement, serving as a reminder of Bitcoin’s growing influence in global markets.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-16 05:30:44

However, market analysts emphasize that the digital asset is likely waiting for impactful news to trigger this movement. Vincent Van Code, a software engineer and prominent figure in the crypto community, has highlighted an ascending triangle pattern on XRP’s daily chart, which traditionally indicates a bullish trend. He believes that the lack of major news has kept the token trading within a narrow range, a condition often observed when markets are in a holding pattern. While the token has exhibited price fluctuations between 10% and 20%, Van Code predicts a decisive rally will occur once the price breaks through $2.90. Key Developments Driving Anticipation The community closely monitors several anticipated events that could catalyze a price surge. Among the most notable is the imminent launch of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Ripple recently secured regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to list RLUSD, marking a significant milestone for the company. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, confirmed that RLUSD will soon be available on partner exchanges, with an announcement expected in the coming days. Other potential drivers include XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the resolution of Ripple’s ongoing legal dispute. However, these developments are not expected until 2025, making the RLUSD launch the most immediate and impactful event in the short term. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $2.42, reflecting a 2.14 % decline in the past 24 hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Price Targets and Technical Insights Analysts have identified several key price levels that XRP could achieve. Vincent Van Code maintains that surpassing $2.90 is critical for initiating a rally, while other experts provide additional insights into potential price targets. Arjantit, a technical analyst, has observed a bullish flag formation on XRP’s 8-hour chart, indicating a strong likelihood of upward momentum. He suggests that breaking above this pattern could push the price to $2.91, with $3.20 being the next target. Arjantit advises traders to look for confirmation of this setup before making decisions. Similarly, another analyst known as FinanceBro has expressed optimism about the token’s potential surge. He asserts that the bull flag pattern has fully developed, paving the way for a rally that could reach $4.40. FinanceBro also speculates that $4.40 might only be an intermediate target, with the possibility of even greater gains in the longer term. As XRP trades within a narrow range, the market eagerly anticipates news that could catalyze a breakout. The expected launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin stands out as the most immediate trigger, with analysts forecasting significant price gains once critical resistance levels are breached. If these predictions hold, the asset’s price could exceed $2.90 and continue its uptrend toward $3.20 and $4.40, offering promising prospects for investors and traders.

Starting today, businesses can measure their Bitcoin holdings at current market prices, making financial reporting more accurate and transparent. Starting fully in 2025, the change could drive more firms to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Following the two breaking news, Bitcoin surged above $105,000 today, adding U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s comments about creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, similar to the country’s oil reserve. The cryptocurrency hit a high of $105,142 before settling at $104,609. It has seen a 55% rise post-election, with a whooping trading volume of $62B. HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 What’s Changing? This update, highlighted by Pete Rizzo of Bitcoin Magazine in a post on X, reflects a significant shift in how companies report their cryptocurrency holdings. Rizzo referenced a prior post by Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, to emphasize the importance of this change. Until now, companies recorded Bitcoin at its purchase price. If the value dropped, losses were reported, but if it went up, the gains weren’t included. This created a major gap in how companies reflected their true financial standing. With the new rules, Bitcoin’s value will now be updated in financial statements every reporting period, showing both profits and losses based on market prices. This change makes life easier for companies holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Big names like MicroStrategy and Tesla, which are known for their Bitcoin investments, will now have a smoother reporting process. Investors, creditors, and stakeholders will also get a clearer picture of a company’s financial health, making it easier to assess risks and performance. Who Benefits? The new standards apply to fungible crypto assets that meet specific criteria. However, assets like NFTs, wrapped tokens, and internally generated digital assets are excluded. For companies, this means better alignment with traditional accounting practices and greater transparency in their financial statements. A Big Win for Bitcoin This move is expected to encourage more companies to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. With fair value accounting in place, businesses can better handle Bitcoin’s price swings while staying transparent about their holdings. This milestone comes as the crypto market buzzes with speculation about former President Donald Trump’s potential plan for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, rumored to be enacted through an executive order on his first day after taking charge in January. The gap between traditional markets and the crypto economy is narrowing, and Bitcoin’s position as a dominant financial asset is stronger than ever.

According to this model, XRP could be valued at an extraordinary $122,580 under specific conditions, underscoring its theoretical potential within a tokenized global financial system. Understanding the Collateralization Model Valhil Capital, a venture capital firm, introduced several valuation frameworks to explore XRP’s potential as a digital asset. Among these, the Collateralization Model stands out for its ambitious assessment of XRP’s role as a universal collateral asset in a tokenized economy. This model envisions a future where global financial systems are entirely tokenized, incorporating a wide range of assets—such as real estate, derivatives, central bank reserves, and commodities—onto blockchain networks. XRP, the native cryptocurrency of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is positioned as a key asset for collateralizing these tokenized assets. Ripple CTO David Schwartz has confirmed XRPL’s focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, a development that aligns with the Collateralization Model’s premise. The methodology evaluates XRP’s utility as a store of value and its potential to secure tokenized assets rather than facilitate everyday transactions. Breaking Down the $122,580 Valuation The Collateralization Model bases its projections on the total global wealth, estimated at $5.3 quadrillion. Factoring in a 1.25x risk adjustment ratio and calculating the present value of a tokenized economy, the model predicts that global tokenized assets could reach $6.2 quadrillion by 2030. By dividing this projected value by XRP’s circulating supply of approximately 50.7 billion tokens, the model arrives at an estimated fair market value of $122,580 per token. This analysis highlights XRP’s potential to become a foundational element of the tokenized financial ecosystem. The model emphasizes that this valuation depends on a scenario where blockchain technology fully represents global wealth and XRP plays a pivotal role in collateralizing assets across a highly interconnected system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Challenges to Realizing This Valuation Despite the Collateralization Model’s optimistic outlook, significant obstacles could hinder the realization of such a scenario. For instance, the global tokenization of assets would require overcoming technological, regulatory, and economic challenges. Additionally, the valuation excludes certain variables that could affect the accuracy of its estimates. Nonetheless, the model underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology and XRP’s role within it. It presents a theoretical analysis rather than a price prediction, aiming to illustrate what XRP’s value could be under ideal conditions. XRP’s Current Performance At the time of press, XRP is trading at approximately $2.40, reflecting strong performance in recent weeks as it maintains $2 support. While this is positive, it remains far below the Collateralization Model’s suggested fair market value. The disparity between XRP’s current price and theoretical valuation highlights the broader conversation around the cryptocurrency’s utility and potential within a tokenized global financial infrastructure.

He urged investors not to fall for “FOMO” (Fear of Missing Out) over possible early price fluctuations of the stablecoin. For the unversed, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse recently announced that RLUSD has received final approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. Responding to concerns raised on X, Schwartz explained that during RLUSD’s early days, some individuals may be willing to pay unusually high prices, like $1,200 per fraction of an RLUSD, simply to be the first to purchase it. He wrote, “If you want to spend a lot of money to get a tiny bit of RLUSD before anyone else does, you can. But please don’t expect the price to stay over $1 once things stabilize, which I expect they will do very quickly. Please don’t FOMO into a stablecoin! This is not an opportunity to get rich.” As RLUSD goes live, there may be supply shortages in the very early days before the market stabilizes.

Community Awaits the Launch: The XRP community is excited for the launch of the RLUSD stablecoin. RLUSD is a stablecoin tied to the US dollar, meaning its value will stay at one US dollar.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA.

Speculation also increased after some competitive pressure from platforms like Blur, which gained dominance through a very successful airdrop strategy. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is demanding crypto exposure disclosures from firms by 2025 to assess financial stability risks and policy options. In Japan, lawmaker Satoshi Hamada proposed a national Bitcoin reserve due to its potential economic benefits and the global trends toward Bitcoin adoption as a strategic asset. NFT Community Buzzes Over Potential OpenSea Token OpenSea, the well known NFT marketplace, ignited speculation about a potential token launch and user airdrop after registering in the Cayman Islands. The development was announced on Dec. 14 by Waleswoosh , a pseudonymous researcher that is associated with the Azuki NFT collection, who shared a screenshot of the registration. This led to widespread rumors in the NFT community that OpenSea may be planning to launch its cryptocurrency and reward users through an airdrop. The speculation comes on the heels of OpenSea co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer's announcement on Nov. 4 about the platform's plans for a major relaunch. Although Finzer provided very limited details, he did promise that the revamped platform will be introduced in December. At the time, some users believed an airdrop might be part of the relaunch, but skepticism arose from people like DappRadar’s communications manager. Despite the absence of an official announcement, OpenSea’s Cayman Islands registration boosted hopes among users for an airdrop. Community members, including Matter Labs’ manager “ Golem ,” are optimistic that OpenSea will reward its early supporters to re-establish trust and loyalty. However, there are still concerns about whether the potential airdrop will actually adequately account for the high trading volumes from 2021 and 2022 , which was a period that was marked by billions in NFT sales. Users also speculated that OpenSea might emulate competitors like Blur and Magic Eden, which issued tokens to attract and keep users. OpenSea previously took measures to regain its market share, which included the introduction of zero fees in February to compete with Blur. However, Blur continued to dominate NFT trading volumes, with OpenSea and OKX trailing behind. Blur’s success was partially attributed to its airdrop strategy, where users earned tokens after each trading season. In one instance, a Blur user even reportedly earned $11 million in tokens after the platform’s second-season rewards. Magic Eden also adopted an airdrop strategy but faced some challenges during its rollout. Its ME token was launched earlier in December, and initially rallied to $13.10 before plummeting almost 70% due to user complaints about the claiming process and technical issues in its mobile app. ME price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) So far, OpenSea has not commented on the speculation surrounding its plans. Bank of England Demands Crypto Exposure Disclosures In Europe, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) issued a request for firms to disclose their current and future exposure to cryptocurrencies by March of 2025. The move was made to enhance the regulator's ability to monitor financial stability and shape policies regarding crypto assets. In a statement that was released on Dec. 12, the PRA asked firms to detail their “current and expected future crypto asset exposures” and provide information on how they are applying the Basel framework . This framework is an international standard for managing capital and risk in crypto exposures that was introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December of 2022. The PRA plans to use this information to evaluate the costs and benefits of different policy options and refine its prudential treatment of crypto assets. This initiative is also part of a broader attempt to understand the financial stability implications of crypto assets and emerging technologies like permissionless blockchains. Firms are being asked to provide insights into their planned crypto activities up to Sept. 30, 2029, with specific focus on areas like the application of the Basel framework and the use of decentralized ledgers. While the PRA acknowledges the potential benefits of permissionless blockchains, like increased transparency and efficiency, it still pointed out some serious risks, including settlement failures and a lack of guaranteed links between asset ownership and control mechanisms. The regulator stated that these risks are not yet sufficiently mitigated, although the classification remains under review. This development happened as a growing number of global firms and countries are investing heavily in Bitcoin. Some well known examples include Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International, which converted close to $50 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Bitcoin (BTC) as part of a treasury adjustment. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also announced plans to raise over $62 million to increase its Bitcoin holdings. Japan Urged to Consider National Bitcoin Reserve Many other counties are now also contemplating the idea of a Bitcoin reserve. Japanese lawmaker Satoshi Hamada recently asked some serious questions about the potential for Japan to establish national Bitcoin reserves. In a query that was submitted to Japan’s House of Councillors on Dec. 11, Hamada called on the government to assess global movements toward Bitcoin reserves. He specifically referenced initiatives in the United States and other countries. He argued that adopting a strategic Bitcoin reserve could provide major economic benefits, and stated that Japan should consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets like Bitcoin. Hamada’s questions were centered around the increasing global attention on Bitcoin as a strategic asset. He pointed to efforts by U.S. lawmakers and crypto advocates to introduce a Bitcoin reserve, a concept tied to Republican lawmakers' recent electoral success and former President Donald Trump’s campaign promises. Similar proposals emerged in Brazil , where lawmakers are exploring Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks. Hamada’s social media activity indicates that he is very closely following U.S. developments, including initiatives backed by well known people in the industry like Elon Musk. Hamada even retweeted posts from Musk's political action committee about the proposed Department of Government Efficiency, which could indirectly support crypto adoption. Japan has a gross domestic product (GDP) of more than $4 trillion, and ranks as one of the world’s largest economies, although it recently slipped from third to fourth place, behind Germany. Hamada implied that introducing a national Bitcoin reserve could boost Japan’s economy nicely and position it very well in global markets. This will also benefit crypto holders and enhance the country’s financial resilience. A national Bitcoin reserve is a strategic allocation of Bitcoin by a government as part of its foreign exchange or national reserves. Overall, it is actually very similar to how countries hold gold or foreign currencies. The idea is to use Bitcoin as a hedge against economic risks, currency devaluation, or geopolitical uncertainties while still potentially benefiting from its long-term value appreciation and decentralized nature. This approach positions Bitcoin as a store of value and a tool for improving financial resilience and economic stability.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-16 06:05:35

Bitcoin Reaches All-Time High Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,000, up 2.80% in the last 24 hours, and the price has pulled back slightly from its record high. Analysts attribute Bitcoin's record-breaking rally to a combination of institutional demand, rising adoption, and supportive market developments. “This new all-time high is a turning point for Bitcoin,” said Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst at BTC Markets. “It signals that Bitcoin is shifting from a retail-focused asset to one increasingly dominated by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate adoption, further solidifying its status as a legitimate asset class.” Key Factors Behind the Increase US President-elect Donald Trump has sparked optimism in the crypto market with his recent announcement of creating a strategic crypto reserve and promising to “do something great” with crypto. MicroStrategy Joins Nasdaq 100 MicroStrategy, a major Bitcoin holder with reserves worth over $44 billion, announced on December 23 that it will join the Nasdaq 100 index. Co-founder Michael Saylor also fueled the excitement with social media posts hinting at additional Bitcoin purchases. Riot Platforms' Bitcoin Purchase Bitcoin mining giant Riot Platforms further boosted market sentiment on Friday by announcing that it purchased 5,117 Bitcoins at an average price of $99,669 per coin. The Federal Reserve’s final FOMC meeting of the year on Wednesday is drawing a lot of attention from investors. The probability of a 25 basis point rate cut is 97.1%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which could provide further support for Bitcoin and other risk assets. “The FOMC meeting will provide important insights into the Fed’s monetary policy trajectory,” said Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Research. “Any dovish signals, combined with expectations for Trump’s crypto-related policies, could trigger another rally for Bitcoin.” As we approach the end of 2024, market participants remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s continued growth potential. With deepening institutional participation and macroeconomic factors aligning, analysts are predicting a strong start for Bitcoin in the new year. *This is not investment advice.

Mark Longo, the owner of “Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT),” recently stated that he had sent a cease-and-desist letter to Binance through his legal team. Binance Faces Trademark Dispute In his statement, Mark Longo said that his legal team sent a cease-and-desist letter to Binance. He claimed that Binance used the “PNUT” trademark and the well-known image of Peanut the Squirrel on their platform without permission.

He pointed out that global platforms like Binance need to be careful about respecting copyrights and trademarks. For Longo, PNUT’s image and branding represent years of hard work and creativity, which he feels have been unfairly used. What Could Happen Next? As of now, Binance has not issued an official response to these allegations. If Binance fails to respond or address the issue, Longo may escalate the matter further with legal proceedings. For now, the focus remains on Binance’s reaction to the cease-and-desist letter and whether they will take steps to resolve the dispute.

While the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, Van Code’s advice offers a prudent approach to managing potential gains responsibly and securely. Below is an analysis of his key points, emphasizing compliance, security, and long-term financial planning. If one day #XRP hits $100, there are some things you need to do to stay compliant when you decide to cash in: 1. Keep records of all your transactions. Especially if you are using a cold wallet 2. Spread tokens across more than 2 wallets, this way you can minimise losses if you… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 14, 2024 Maintain Comprehensive Transaction Records: Van Code underscores the importance of record-keeping, especially for those using cold wallets to store their cryptocurrencies. Keeping detailed records of every transaction is essential for tracking gains and complying with tax obligations. Failing to maintain accurate documentation can lead to complications during audits or when filing taxes. Diversify Wallet Usage: To mitigate the risk of losing funds in the event of a hack, Van Code advises spreading tokens across multiple wallets—ideally more than two. This approach ensures that the remaining funds are safeguarded if one wallet is compromised. Manage Bank Deposits Strategically: Cashing out large sums, such as depositing $100,000 into a bank account, can attract unwanted attention from financial institutions and tax authorities. Van Code recommends conducting smaller, incremental transactions to minimize scrutiny. Additionally, consulting with a financial adviser can help ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and reporting requirements. Set Aside Funds for Taxes: Investors must calculate their tax liability immediately upon cashing out and allocate the required amount in a separate account. This practice prevents unintentional overspending and ensures that tax payments are made on time. Crypto investors are often subject to capital gains taxes, which vary depending on jurisdiction and holding period. Exercise Caution in Sharing Information Online: Van Code warns against discussing cryptocurrency holdings or financial activities publicly, particularly on social media. Cybercriminals often use automated tools to gather personal information, which can be pieced together to target individuals for theft or fraud. Protecting one’s anonymity and digital footprint is critical in the crypto space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adopt Robust Security Measures: To safeguard accounts, Van Code advises enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), preferably through an authentication app rather than SMS, which is more vulnerable to interception. He also recommends using a password manager to generate and store unique passwords, as reusing passwords increases the risk of breaches. Invest in Appreciating Assets: When it comes to spending gains, Van Code advocates for purchasing appreciating assets like art, collectible watches, or property rather than depreciating items such as luxury cars or handbags. This approach ensures wealth preservation over time. Plan Investments Wisely: For those considering long-term investments, real estate and stocks are prudent options. Van Code emphasizes that substantial gains do not necessitate extravagant spending. Thoughtful investment strategies can ensure lasting financial security. Consult a Financial Adviser: While his advice is insightful, Van Code explicitly states that he is not a financial adviser and encourages individuals to seek professional guidance. A comprehensive financial plan tailored to personal circumstances is essential for maximizing the benefits of a windfall and avoiding costly mistakes. Van Code’s recommendations reflect a balanced approach to managing significant cryptocurrency gains, prioritizing compliance, security, and sustainable wealth-building. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, adhering to such principles can help investors navigate the complexities of digital assets responsibly.

Charles Hoskinson is reshaping Bitcoin’s DeFi future with bold innovations, while Rollblock offers early backers exciting features. Table of Contents Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision Bitcoin’s $23 billion accumulation wave Cardano’s multichain leap Rollblock is making waves Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, has provided insight into the next developments within Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. Envision a combination of Bitcoin’s capabilities with cutting-edge DeFi tools—that is the vision. Hoskinson said that his business, Input Output Global (IOG), would collaborate with Fairgate Labs to achieve this, ditching BitcoinOS. As an early supporter of Rollblock , this could mean thrilling prospects to capitalize on Bitcoin-driven DeFi. Read on to find out more. Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision Charles Hoskinson is shaking things up again. The Cardano founder just announced plans to build a cutting-edge DeFi ecosystem for Bitcoin. This shift promises a fresh approach to bringing decentralized finance to the Bitcoin network, and if users are backing Rollblock, they’re in for some serious perks as these innovations unfold. For starters, Rollblock’s secure and private transactions mean interactions and trades are encrypted, keeping everything safe and confidential. It’s like having your own vault for crypto activities, perfect for navigating the DeFi space. Then, there’s the multicurrency staking feature. Whether users are Bitcoin loyalists, Ethereum enthusiasts, or Dogecoin fans, Rollblock lets users stake their assets and earn rewards across multiple blockchains. With its 9th presale raising over $7 million and trading at $0.0415, it’s clear Rollblock is attracting attention. To top it all off, Rollblock periodically burns tokens, creating scarcity and driving up value. For early backers, that means every move Rollblock makes is designed to grow users’ stakes. With Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision and Rollblock’s features, the future is bright, and profitable. You might also like: Analysts expect more gains for SOL but flag Arbitrum, Rollblock as strong competitors Bitcoin’s $23 billion accumulation wave Bitcoin is making waves with a massive $23 billion accumulation, solidifying the $96,000–$100,000 range as a key support zone. In just two weeks, 245,000 BTC have been added to this range, showcasing strong investor confidence. The Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) highlights $99,559 as the largest accumulation zone, with 125,000 BTC purchased for just under $100,000. This activity reflects optimism for Bitcoin’s future as investors position themselves for potential upward moves while maintaining a solid foundation in the current range. Cardano’s multichain leap As we stated earlier, Charles Hoskinson announced the incorporation of Midnight, a privacy-focused sidechain, into Cardano. This will make Cardano a multichain environment that integrates Ethereum and Solana. Midnight’s zero-knowledge technology lets users communicate with dApps while protecting their data, an innovation poised to reshape DeFi. On the flip side, Cardano has dropped 17% recently, driven by whale sell-offs and profit-taking. As large holders reduce their positions, ADA’s price may struggle to stay above $1. Charles Hoskinson’s DeFi vision might be the spark Cardano needs to shoot to new highs. Rollblock is making waves As the DeFi space evolves, Rollblock is positioning itself as a true game-changer, with features like multicurrency staking, privacy, and play-to-earn perks. While other tokens, like Cardano, continue to innovate, Rollblock’s early backers stand to benefit the most. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials.

Investors are also looking ahead to several major central bank decisions due this week including the Bank of Japan and the People’s Bank of China. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose +0.04% rose to around 39,600, while the broader Topix Index gained 0.05% to 2,748 on Monday, the Japanese yen depreciated toward 154 per dollar on Monday, hitting its weakest levels in three weeks amid bets that the Bank of Japan will forgo an interest rate hike this week. On the economic front, data showed that core machinery orders in Japan, a leading indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, topped expectations in October. Japan's factory activity shrinks for sixth straight month, services activity improves in December . China ( SHCOMP ) rose +0.01% to around 3,395 while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.9% to 10,615 on Monday, with mainland stocks struggling for clear direction and the offshore yuan weakened further around 7.28 per dollar, as traders digested mixed economic data. Data showed that retail sales in China slowed more than expected in November , while industrial production grew more than anticipated. New home prices in the country also declined for the 17th consecutive month in November, amid a prolonged property downturn. Additionally, the unemployment rate held steady at 5%, in line with expectations. In November 2023, the surveyed unemployment rate was also 5%. Foreign direct investment into China shrank by 27.9% year-on-year to CNY 749.7 billion in the first eleven months of 2024, compared with a 29.8% plunge in the previous period, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. As reported by Bloomberg, citing the 21st Century Business, the People's Bank of China is set to cut interest rates and reserve requirements next year. In a statement released after the release of November activity data, the National Bureau of Statistics said China's domestic demand is insufficient while the external environment is complex. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -0.76% to 19,836, extending falls from the prior session as traders reacted to November activity data in China. India ( SENSEX ) fell -0.61% to 81,819 in Monday morning trade, as traders took profit after the BSE Sensex hit its highest level in over two months in the previous session. Total passenger vehicle sales in India grew by 4.3% year-over-year to 300,459 units in November 2024, following a 1.1% rise in the previous month, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. The figures exclude sales from BMW, Mercedes, JLR, and Volvo. The private sector in India expanded the most in four months, with the manufacturing expanding faster, while the services sector grew the most since August. Australia ( AS51 ) fell -0.56% to close at 8,250 on Monday, marking its lowest point in nearly a month, as mining stocks led the downturn amid weaker metals prices. The South Korean won ( USD:KRW ) stabilized at 1,433 per dollar following the weekend impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. Political uncertainty in South Korea eased after the legislature initiated the impeachment on Saturday in response to Yoon's controversial attempt to impose martial law, which ended in failure. In the U.S., on Friday, all three major indexes ended mixed with concerns over the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision and economic conditions limiting further gains. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Monday as investors braced for the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision this week: Dow +0.05% ; S&P 500 -0.02% ; Nasdaq -0.04% . The price of bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged above $106,000 on Monday before paring some gains, driven largely by US President-elect Donald Trump's support for digital assets and plans to make the sector more regulated. Week Ahead : Traders are now shifting their attention to the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision later this week, where the bank is expected to deliver a 25bps cut. Other key highlights in the US include retail sales, PCE prices, personal income and spending, the final estimate of GDP growth, industrial production, manufacturing and services PMIs, building permits, housing starts, and existing home sales. In the UK, the BoE's policy decision, inflation figures, retail sales, and jobs report will draw attention. Japan will feature the BoJ's interest rate decision, inflation and foreign trade data.

Recent catalysts that have supported growth in BTC include increased speculation of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump creating a federal bitcoin reserve, and crypto companies such as Riot Platforms and MicroStrategy purchasing billions worth of the asset in past weeks. Optimism in U.S. policies are driving bitcoin ETFs inflows higher, contributing to increased prices, some point out. “TradFi inflows now dominate all sentiment and price action in BTC unlike any other prior crypto cycle before,” shared Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. “This influence will only grow as more and more traditional firms finally need to have a digital asset policy given the immense revenue opportunities and sea-change in the political environment.” Recent price action has shown bitcoin forming higher lows, indicative of a sustained uptrend. The formation of a bull flag or a bullish continuation pattern after recent highs could signal further upward movement. This month tends to be historically bullish for bitcoin in a move that’s colloquially termed the ""Santa Claus Rally."" Data from the past eight years shows that bitcoin ended December in the green six times since 2015, running at least 8% to as much as 46% (in the outlier year of 2020). Seasonality is the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. While it may look random, possible reasons range from profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, to the generally bullish November and December, a sign of increased demand ahead of holiday season. Meanwhile, some traders are now targeting the $120,000 level and above for BTC in the coming year. “We think bitcoin still has tremendous upside potential and could easily hit the $125k mark by the end of 2025,” Jeff Mei, COO at crypto exchange BTSE, said over Telegram. “While some say the upside has already been priced in over the last month or so, we think the rally is just getting started.” “This is because it takes time for institutions, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals to warm up to the idea of allocating 1%-3% of their portfolios to bitcoin and crypto as a whole. Once that happens, crypto inflows could skyrocket. And given Trump's pro-crypto appointments, continued rate cuts, and stimulus spending from China, there are a lot of reasons to be bullish,” Mei added.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-16 06:37:50

With a 14% increase, BTC can break above the market cap of Google. Strike CEO Jack Mallers said that Trump might issue an executive order to buy BTC. Bitcoin (BTC) has reached a historic milestone, climbing to a new all-time high of $106,488, giving it a market cap of $2.11 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap . Currently trading at $104,745 with a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin now stands on the verge of surpassing Google’s market cap of $2.3 trillion. With just a 14% increase in price, Bitcoin could become the 6th largest asset globally by market volume, solidifying its place as one of the most valuable financial instruments in the world. For context, Google—the tech giant with dominance across market sectors—has a market cap of $2.3 trillion, as reported by Yahoo Finance . If Bitcoin surpasses this benchmark, it would represent a historic milestone, solidifying its place among the world’s most valuable assets.

37704530,https://coinpedia.org/?p=393451,1734331999,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,"Cryptocurrency Market Today: Bitcoin Smahes New Highs Along with Ondo (ONDO) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), While Fantom (FTM) Marks Huge Gains",https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/crypto-market-live-bitcoin-smahes-new-highs-along-with-ondo-ondo-virtuals-protocol-virtual-while-fantom-ftm-marks-huge-gains/,"The post Cryptocurrency Market Today: Bitcoin Smahes New Highs Along with Ondo (ONDO) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), While Fantom (FTM) Marks Huge Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The markets began the weekly trade on a bullish note after the price of Bitcoin recorded a new ATH above $106.6K . This triggered a massive upswing in some altcoins, while others chose to trade within a narrow range. Ondo, for instance, is leading the top 100 with an over 15% rise, while Fantom (FTM) & Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) maintain a growth of over 13% each. With a bullish start, the question arises as to whether these tokens can maintain their dominance until the end of the day. Ondo (ONDO) Price Analysis Ondo price has been maintaining a steep upswing for over 40 days, regardless of the volume, which has been draining. Meanwhile, the bulls continue to remain dominant as they can exert enough bullish pressure. This also flipped the death cross that occurred in the first few days of September, offering significant bullish momentum to the token that smashed a new ATH at $2.79. As the above chart suggests, the price remains within the bullish range of the FIB channels as the price surged above 1 FIB but is yet to reach the next target at 1.2 FIB. The on-balance volume (OBV) continues to rise, suggesting the continuity of a bullish trend. Besides, the +Di & -DI are departing from each other, indicating a rise in the bullish trend. Therefore, the ONDO price is believed to maintain an ascending consolidation and mark a new ATH at $2.33, probably before the end of the year. Fantom (FTM) Price Analysis The Fantom price has been trading in a strong ascending trend since the reversal of the August lows close to $0.26. The trading volume over the platform has risen since November, which appears to have declined to a large extent. However, the token could get a fresh bullish boost as the selling pressure seems to have faded over the token. Hence, the price is believed to secure some crucial levels that may help the token form a new ATH in 2025. The FTM price is trading within a rising parallel channel and has faced multiple rejections close to the resistance. Currently, the token is facing some bearish pressure, but the bulls are expected to revamp a strong rise. The MACD ( Moving Average Convergence Divergence ) shows a drop in the selling pressure, which could pave the way for the accumulation of fresh buying volume. Hence, with a rise in the buying pressure, the price is expected to break above the Bollinger bands , which are currently going parallel, and reach $1.68. However, sustaining above the range could push the price above $2, which may eventually help the token to head towards the new ATH. On the other hand, the Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) price continues to trade within a discovery phase, forming a new ATH around $2.79. With this move, the token is an inch close to entering the top 50 cryptos, surpassing the giants like BONK, WIF, INJ, & ONDO. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It went up, down, and up again in the past 12 hours or so, leaving over $300 million in liquidations, but one particular order stands out as the largest. Data from CoinGlass shows that the primary cryptocurrency’s rally has wrecked nearly 100,000 traders in the past 24 hours. However, the biggest single liquidated position took place on Binance and involved the BTC/USDT trading pair. The total value was a whopping $19.86 million, which the whale lost during the volatile ride. Although it sounds as if it was likely from a short position, BTC also retraced by about two grand immediately after the latest peak, which could cast some doubt on whether it could have been a trader expecting further gains. After all, just over 51% of the liquidations on Binance were for shorts. Nevertheless, these developments only go to show that traders should be wary when opening over-leveraged positions in the current volatile environment. Liquidation Heat Map.

These include ETH, SOL, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, and TON are up by around 2-3% each. SUI have jumped the most from the larger caps, having gained 9% and trading close to $4.8.

It is growing at a very fast pace with an intersection of AI and DeFi. Unlike conventional exchanges, it will integrate AI across all levels—the first true modern-gen exchange platform. As a trailblazer, experts anticipate massive adoption, primed for explosive growth. Experts suggest the INTL token will hit the $1 billion market cap milestone soon. IntelMarkets (INTL): A Novel AI-Powered Trading Platform IntelMarkets (INTL) might be this year’s most innovative crypto project. It adopts a novel strategy by fusing blockchain, DeFi, and AI technology. Industry analysts describe the resulting AI-driven trade system as revolutionary. It will differ from traditional platforms in a number of ways, including its sophisticated trading bots and ecosystem driven by an AI-based blockchain. Regardless of a user’s financial background, INTL’s trading bots will be built to provide them with access to top-notch trading methods. Furthermore, these bots may automatically enter profitable trading positions while processing large volumes of data from many sources at breakneck speed. Investors have started placing bets on the INTL cryptocurrency due to its imminent adoption. It is one of the greatest new cryptocurrencies to invest in because of its use cases, which include staking, governance, and administration. Huge Growth Prospects: On Track for a 9,500% Upswing As a new ICO and altcoin, INTL’s upside potential is staggering, outshining top crypto coins. With no bull market history, it has plenty of room to run, prompting traders to shift focus away from top altcoins to the new AI coin. In stage 7 of the ICO, a token costs only $0.064, heavily discounted and undervalued. Moreover, it is underpriced, allowing investors to position for substantial gains without breaking the bank—a retail favorite. Industry experts believe it is on track for a 9,500% upswing after its debut, making it arguably the best crypto to invest in. This significant upside potential is among the key reasons behind the presale selling out fast. Over $4.3 million has been raised, cementing its status as a top ICO and highlighting investor trust in its potential. Multichannel Analysis: A Key Feature Of IntelMarkets Multichannel analysis is a key feature of IntelMarkets. The Intelli-M trading system can perform technical calculations from multiple markets in seconds—the same can’t be said for other platforms. This is crucial as it would allow traders to maximize opportunities across different crypto pairs. Automatic and Self-Learning Trading Bots Sets INTL Apart INTL’s cutting-edge trading bots can identify profitable market opportunities, making it one of its kind. But that isn’t all; they can also take positions depending on users’ trading objectives. One only needs to adjust variables like leverage, risk, and position sizing to maximize this tech. Equally important, these trading robots can learn from their mistakes and real-time trading data, improving their performance. This ability to self-learn sets them apart. INTL’s Dual-Chain Functionality Makes It A Top Choice Lastly, IntelMarkets is a dual-chain functionality exchange that hopes to make the most of the Solana and Ethereum blockchains. It will be supported and can run on these mentioned chains, with traders able to choose their preferred blockchains based on specific requirements, such as preferences and strategies. For example, a trader might want to tap into Ethereum’s deep liquidity pools or robust ecosystem of dApps. Alternatively, Solana’s cost-effectiveness and scalability are also highly sought after. These features have catalyzed worldwide adoption and increased the popularity of the INTL tokens. Market analysts reveal that IntelMarkets is the most downloaded in this bull run. IntelMarkets (INTL): The First Quantum-Proof Trading Platform IntelMarkets ( INTL) will be the first of many things. It pioneered the world’s first quantum-proof custody solution, stirring up much buzz within the $264 billion global crypto trading market. Its recently launched QuantumX Wallet is a decentralized product developed after months of research aimed at preventing future security challenges arising from the de-encryption of data. The QuantumX Wallet will fend off cybersecurity attacks and the threat of quantum computing. It will provide the first retail solution to address this problem, and its outlook couldn’t be more bullish. Meanwhile, the Route X21 research initiative, seeded by a $1 million grant from partners in the MENA region, is dedicated to addressing the challenges posed by quantum computers. Given IntelMarkets’ real-world application, investors and retailers have been flocking to the ongoing INTL presale, tipped as the next big thing. Experts anticipate a $1 billion market cap for IntelMarkets soon.

According to reports, one bid on a Ripple ( XRP ) wallet called Xaman priced a portion of RLUSD at 511 XRP, which is more than $1,200. Schwartz explained that rather than reflecting actual market worth, such high bids probably reflect people looking for the novelty of holding the first RLUSD tokens.

Let’s dive in and see what sets these projects apart and why BTFD stands out as the best meme coin presale with 1000x potential.

Imagine diving into a gaming experience that combines entertainment with the thrill of earning crypto.

Special Agent David Paniwozik of the FBI’s Baltimore branch noted the growing trend, saying: “Criminals see cryptocurrencies as a quick and easy way to make money. Unfortunately, many investors are still unfamiliar with the technology, making them prime targets.” One of the key challenges, Paniwozik said, is the seamless and borderless nature of cryptocurrency transactions. “Whether it’s $1 or billions of dollars, money can be instantly transferred from a U.S.-controlled wallet to an offshore wallet,” he explained. Scammers often set up fake cryptocurrency exchanges, convincing victims that their investments are growing rapidly or demanding crypto payments to “unlock” lucrative job offers. The FBI warns that these scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, capitalizing on the public's excitement about cryptocurrencies and their potential for high returns. Related News: Watch Out: Very Important Week Ahead - Major Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up! Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List In addition to investment scams, the FBI is seeing an increase in employment scams involving cryptocurrency. Significant losses have been reported in Maryland alone, with reported losses rising from $32,033 in 2023 to a staggering $3.8 million between January and October 2024. The average person in Maryland loses between $15,000 and $20,000 in these types of scams, Paniwozik said. According to the FBI’s 2023 Cryptocurrency Fraud Report, cryptocurrency-related complaints account for just 10% of all financial fraud reports, but nearly 50% of total monetary losses. The FBI advises potential investors and job seekers to be careful when dealing with cryptocurrency-related opportunities. Key tips include verifying the legitimacy of exchanges, being skeptical of promises of guaranteed high returns, and avoiding cryptocurrency payments for job offers. *This is not investment advice.

The adoption of stablecoin in regions like Sub-Saharan African and Latin America has skyrocketed. Ripple President Monica Long stated that stablecoin for payments is the future. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies, have exploded in popularity. They’ve even beaten out Bitcoin (BTC) in transactions across the globe. Specifically, regions like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa have embraced these fiat-pegged assets, even as BTC hit $106,000 for the first time in history. This Chainalysis blog post explains how people in emerging markets use stablecoins to hedge against local monetary instability. They provide “a more reliable means of transacting and preserving value.” Furthermore, stablecoins have made a significant impact in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa due to their practicality for low-cost remittances, secure yield options, and access to DeFi services.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Cardano faces market struggles, Rexas Finance emerges as a promising alternative with smart asset tokenization and a projected $30 valuation by 2025. Table of Contents Cardano’s market challenges What makes Rexas Finance unique? Why $30 is realistic for RXS Challenges for Cardano vs. opportunities for Rexas Finance Conclusion Cardano, often described as one of the most original blockchain projects, has been one of the key actors in the cold crypto market. However, recent market activity has stalled; the altcoin lost 15.57% from $1.3 to $0.94 in one week. As Cardano suffers a bearish wave, a new alternative, Rexas Finance (RXS), is attracting investors’ attention. With analysts forecasting this rising cryptocurrency to reach $30 by 2025, it is positioned for exponential expansion at under $0.15. Cardano’s market challenges The current price behavior of Cardano shows a change in the market’s attitude. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) has declined from 79 to 53 points due to growing selling pressure, and active network addresses have dropped noticeably, indicating declining user involvement. Its Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio also supports this story by implying an increasing market value that is not matched by transaction volume, a conventional measure of overbought conditions. With an increase in short positions among traders, Cardano seems caught in a correction wave that might bring its price considerably lower, thereby challenging the $0.77 barrier. Although ADA has long-term promise, its present difficulties have caused investor attention to more exciting prospects like Rexas Finance. What makes Rexas Finance unique? With a novel approach to blockchain adoption via real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, Rexas Finance is fast becoming a noteworthy substitute for Cardano. The platform offers a creative link between conventional banking and distributed technology by allowing consumers to tokenize tangible items such as real estate, fine art, and commodities. Rexas Finance seeks a tiny but fast-expanding sector that addresses real-world financial inefficiencies, unlike Cardano, which primarily concentrates on smart contracts and distributed apps. This emphasis on tangible asset tokenization guarantees the platform provides valuable solutions with general appeal, enabling significant adoption. Rexas Finance is in the last phases of its very successful presale, which has already raised over $26,615,783 at its price of $0.15. The presale’s reaction shows great investor faith in the project’s long-term viability. Furthermore, Rexas Finance’s tokenomics reflects its growth-oriented approach. As demand rises, RXS tokens will value much more since their total quantity of 1 billion is meant to balance scarcity and usefulness. Further appealing to early investors with a chance for significant gains is the projected listing of RXS on top-tier exchanges in 2025 at an estimated launch price of $0.20. You might also like: Rexas Finance poised to be future of RWA tokenization: Fourth presale stage ends earlier than predicted Why $30 is realistic for RXS Rexas Finance’s strong foundations and strategic market orientation help to explain why it projects $30 by 2025. Rexas Finance is ready to take a sizable portion of the expanding asset tokenizing industry as demand for them keeps increasing. Moreover, the platform’s creative elements: the Rexas Token Builder, the Rexas GenAi, the Rexas Treasury, and the Rexas Launchpad, allow a broad spectrum of users, from institutional players to retail investors, accessibility. This adaptability guarantees consistent acceptance, which is essential for a continuous increase in token value. The cryptocurrency market also supports newly founded initiatives like Rexas Finance. Bull runs have historically witnessed a change in capital from recognized coins to attractive substitutes with more upward potential. Rexas Finance expects to gain, especially as its low entry price and unexplored market position appeal to consumers and institutional investors, even if analysts predict a market-wide surge in 2025. Challenges for Cardano vs. opportunities for Rexas Finance Although Cardano’s difficulties could be transient, they draw attention to projects’ established challenges in maintaining development and involvement. Cardano must pay attention to the declining active addresses and growing bearish attitude to regain momentum. On the other hand, Rexas Finance offers a new chance for those looking for high-growth potential in an emerging market sector. Rexas Finance has positioned itself as a leader in the upcoming wave of blockchain innovation by focusing on actual financial inefficiencies and providing a platform fit for general adoption. Conclusion The focus is moving toward interesting substitutes like Rexas Finance as Cardano negotiates its present bearish wave.

According to the AI model’s forecast, Stellar is poised to climb approximately 20% from its current value of $0.4164 to hit $0.50 by Christmas Day. This projection emerges despite XLM’s recent dip of 3.59% over the last 24 hours, suggesting the market may be primed for a short-term recovery. “Stellar’s consistent strides in fostering real-world blockchain adoption, combined with strategic partnerships and an optimistic market sentiment, make a 20% rally plausible as 2024 concludes,” ChatGPT stated. What’s Fueling the Optimism Around Stellar (XLM)? Several factors ChatGPT’s bullish forecast, including broader market sentiment and key developments in the Stellar ecosystem. Notably, cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG Crypto has also presented an ambitious outlook for XLM, predicting its value could surge to $2–$3 soon. EGRAG’s analysis, built upon his bullish stance over the last three years, continues to spotlight XLM’s potential as a transformative digital asset. Another thing that adds momentum to Stellar’s growth trajectory is the network’s recent announcement at the Meridian 2024 event in London. The event underscored Stellar’s commitment to expanding blockchain usability through innovative solutions and partnerships. Of particular note is the collaboration between Stellar and Mastercard , as revealed in a recent tweet from Stellar’s official X account. This partnership integrates Mastercard’s Crypto Credential solution with the Stellar network. This is a move to enhance security, trust, and usability for blockchain-based transactions. By ensuring verified and authenticated interactions on public blockchain networks, Stellar positions itself as a leader in the evolving digital payments space.

The $0.50 target would mark a significant milestone for XLM, reflecting renewed investor interest in the cryptocurrency. The prediction comes amidst broader market volatility but aligns with a growing consensus among analysts that blockchain assets with strong fundamentals, like Stellar, are well-positioned for growth. ChatGPT elaborated, “XLM has consistently demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a competitive market. Its partnerships with financial giants like Mastercard and focus on real-world applications make it a strong contender for price appreciation during seasonal bullish trends.” Historically, the cryptocurrency market experiences heightened activity during the final weeks of the year, often driven by increased trading volumes and optimistic market sentiment. If XLM capitalizes on these dynamics, a 20% rally to $0.50 is well within reach. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

If you’re looking to shake up your financial game and make some bold moves, the market this weekend offers some tantalising options. With the crypto market buzzing from price surges and exciting developments, these coins have positioned themselves as the ones to watch. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just testing the waters, you’ll want to join the bandwagon before it’s too late. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) , a groundbreaking project that’s turning heads with its presale momentum and real-world utility. Add Cardano (ADA) and Binance Coin (BNB) to the mix, and you’ve got a recipe for portfolio gold. Let’s break down why these are the best coins to invest this weekend and how they could boost your financial standing. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Innovation Redefined Let’s start with the breakout star of the moment: Qubetics ($TICS) . Forget what you know about presales—Qubetics is rewriting the playbook with its innovative QubeQode IDE , a game-changing platform that simplifies and streamlines blockchain development for everyone. Imagine you’re a freelance graphic designer in Portland looking to tokenise your digital assets for passive income. With QubeQode, all that’s as easy as pie. You don’t need a PhD in blockchain; this platform makes it as simple as dragging and dropping. Qubetics isn’t just about promises; it’s delivering results. The presale is in its 12th stage, with over 334 million tokens sold to 9,700 holders, raising a whopping $6.4 million. The current price of $TICS is $0.0311, but here’s the kicker—come the weekend, the price will spike by 10%. Don’t sleep on this one, because analysts are calling for insane ROI figures: 703% by presale end, 3,112% post-presale, and a jaw-dropping 48,092% after the mainnet launch. Yeah, you read that right—48,092%. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because it’s not just about hype. Qubetics solves real-world problems that traditional blockchains never could, all while delivering mind-blowing growth potential. Plus, the FOMO is real—missing out on $TICS now could be the financial regret of the decade. 2. Cardano (ADA): The Scalablity and Sustainability Champion Next up, we’ve got Cardano (ADA) , the OG of sustainability and scalability. Cardano has always been the cool, calculated sibling in the crypto family, focusing on getting the fundamentals right before chasing flashy trends. Its recent developments are proof that patience pays off. Just last week, the network rolled out a hydra-head scaling upgrade , making transactions faster and cheaper. If you’ve been annoyed by Ethereum’s gas fees, Cardano might just be your saving grace. Cardano’s versatility is what makes it stand out. Picture a startup in Austin looking to launch a decentralised app or a social enterprise in Denver aiming to bring blockchain to underserved communities—Cardano provides the tools, the network, and the reliability. No wonder it’s gaining traction with developers and big-name partnerships alike. Analysts predict ADA could hit $1.50 by Q1 2025 , driven by its steady adoption and robust ecosystem. Trading at just $0.29 right now, this weekend is a prime time to snag ADA before it makes its next move upward. Remember, in the crypto world, slow and steady often wins the race. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano combines solid tech with tangible use cases, making it one of the best coins to invest this weekend . Plus, its steady climb means you can invest without losing sleep over wild volatility. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Your Trusted Powerhouse Rounding out our list is Binance Coin (BNB) —the powerhouse that’s as reliable as your grandma’s apple pie recipe. As the native coin of Binance, the largest crypto exchange on the planet, BNB is a cornerstone of the digital finance world. But don’t think for a second that BNB’s story is boring—it’s been making waves with recent updates. Binance is expanding its ecosystem with BNB Greenfield , a decentralised storage network that’s set to rival Amazon AWS and Google Cloud. Imagine a world where your data isn’t controlled by tech giants but is instead secure, private, and decentralised. That’s where BNB is headed. For crypto investors, this means more utility and higher demand, translating into price growth. Currently trading at $232 , BNB has held its ground during market downturns and is primed for a rally as market sentiment improves. Analysts are bullish, forecasting BNB to hit $450 by mid-2025 . Its deflationary mechanism (regular coin burns) ensures a steady increase in value over time. BNB is the Swiss Army knife of cryptocurrencies—practical, dependable, and always in demand. If you’re serious about boosting your portfolio this weekend, this one’s a no-brainer. Conclusion: Time to Make Your Move There you have it—three powerhouses poised to supercharge your portfolio this weekend. Whether it’s the mind-blowing ROI potential of Qubetics ($TICS), the steady growth of Cardano (ADA), or the multifaceted strength of Binance Coin (BNB), these coins are your ticket to financial gains. The crypto market waits for no one, and neither should you. Don’t let this weekend pass you by while others are cashing in. Qubetics’ presale is closing fast, and with analysts calling for explosive growth, this could be your shot at life-changing profits. Head over to the presale page, secure your $TICS tokens, and set your portfolio on fire. So, what are you waiting for? The best coins to invest this weekend won’t stick around forever. Dive in and start building your financial future today.

Between December 10 and 12, Riot bought roughly $510 million in Bitcoin, bringing the total value of its BTC holdings to nearly $1.7 billion. Leading bitcoin mining company Riot Platform recently raised $525 million to fund a significant addition to its BTC holdings, which now totals nearly $1.7 billion. The purchase comes just days after activist investor Starboard Value announced it had taken a significant stake in the bitcoin-mining company. Starboard Value Takes “Significant Position” in Riot Platforms Riot Platforms, a leading bitcoin mining company, has purchased an additional $510 million in Bitcoin to add to its holdings. Riot Platform announced that with the proceeds from a recent fundraising that netted the company $525 million, $510 million would be used to purchase 5,117 BTC at an average rate of $99,669 per BTC. The purchase brings Riot’s total holdings to 16,728 BTC. With the net proceeds from Riot’s recent $525 million, 0.75% coupon convertible bond issue, the Company has acquired 5,117 BTC at an average price of $99,669 per BTC, inclusive of fees and expenses.

(@RiotPlatforms) December 13, 2024 The purchase comes after activist investor Starboard Value took a “significant position” in the company. According to the Wall Street Journal , no financial details were disclosed, but the news of Starboard’s stake boosted Riot’s shares significantly. The WSJ reported that Starboard urged Riot Platforms to repurpose some of its Bitcoin mining capacity to service artificial intelligence models, and Riot’s purchase may have been due to pressure from Starboard as buying BTC has shown itself to be a way for miners to win over their investors. Riot reportedly told the WSJ: “We are committed to creating value for all shareholders, and we look forward to constructive dialogue with Starboard on ways to achieve this shared goal.” Shifting Focus to Artificial Intelligence The burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) market has progressed and become more integrated into most business and technology aspects. As the sector continues to expand, the demand for computational power from AI is rising, and the Bitcoin mining industry is well-equipped to service this need. To service their own enterprise, Bitcoin and crypto miners are equipped with expansive data centres and captive power supplies, making them the ideal candidates for AI involvement. According to the reports from the WSJ, Starboard Value wants Riot to convert some of its bitcoin-mining facilities into space for big data centre users. According to a report from asset fund manager VanEck, Riot could gain an estimated $4.8 billion in market capitalization by pivoting to AI businesses, which would more than double the company’s current market cap. Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, explained the logic behind pivoting to AI, “The synergy is simple: AI companies need energy, and Bitcoin miners have it.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bithumb also announced that it has listed a memecoin called MOODENG on the KRW pair, in addition to MOCA. Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, commented on the support of South Korean exchanges to Mocaverse and MOCA, saying, “Thank you Upbit and Bithumb. You brought mass adoption to web3 by welcoming South Korea to Moca Network.” While the price of MOCA rose rapidly after the listing announcements, this rise did not continue at the same pace.

The ASU’s amendments improved the accounting for certain crypto assets by requiring entities to measure them at fair value and recognize fair value changes in net income each reporting period. Richard Jones, the FASB Chair, said the new standard responded to feedback from stakeholders of all backgrounds who indicated that the Board should prioritize improving crypto assets’ accounting and disclosure. The amendments also required entities to improve the information provided to investors about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes between reporting periods. FASB enhances corporate Bitcoin accounting rules HISTORY: FASB FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING RULES FOR #BITCOIN OFFICIALLY TAKE EFFECT TODAY Previously, companies could only value BTC at the price they bought, NOT the gains THE CORPORATE ADOPTION WAVE 🙌 pic.twitter.com/3NHmLsEauX — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 16, 2024 FASB’s fair value accounting standard, which will be officially implemented starting today, allows companies like MicroStrategy to use fair value measurement methods to more accurately reflect the real value of Bitcoin assets. Previously, companies had to use the impairment loss accounting method, which reflected the falling value of Bitcoin as a loss in their accounting books. It was also difficult to reflect the actual increase in Bitcoin’s market value in accounting. Applying fair value accounting standards would allow Bitcoin’s market value fluctuations to be reflected in real time. The regulatory shift improved investor confidence and aligned Bitcoin valuation with market conditions. Many analysts expected this clarity to further increase institutional interest in Bitcoin. “It will provide investors and other capital allocators with more relevant information that better reflects the underlying economics of certain crypto assets and an entity’s financial position while reducing cost and complexity associated with applying current accounting.” ~ Richard Jones Early adoption of the ASU amendments would also be permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that still need to be issued. The ASU’s amendments will apply to all assets that meet the definition of intangible assets under the FASB accounting standard codification. Bitcoin to gain appeal as treasury reserve asset According to the FASB, the fair value rule marked a critical point for the role of digital assets like Bitcoin in corporate finance. Under the new standard, companies would be able to hold Bitcoin without concerns over impairment-driven reporting issues. MicroStrategy’s founder and Chair, Michael Saylor, said that upgrading accounting standards would facilitate corporations adoption of BTC worldwide, as a treasury reserve asset. He expected MARA to be the next Bitcoin company to be added to the Nasdaq 100. Saylor identified the FASB fair value rule as one of the three factors pushing Bitcoin’s price towards $1 million. He also emphasized that traditional bank custody would drive Bitcoin’s bullish trend. The MicroStrategy Chair added that bank custody services increased mainstream confidence and Bitcoin adoption by providing secure investment channels. While the new guidance applied to assets that met the scope criteria under ASC 350-60, not all assets would meet these criteria. Deloitte reported that wrapped tokens such as WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) would not be included in the scope of the new rule since such tokens provided their holders with the right or claim to the underlying wrapped crypto assets. Entities would need to use ‘judgment’ in accounting for wrapped tokens even if the underlying token was within the scope of the amendments.

Notably, this comes as the Ethereum price flirted near the $4,000 mark, with a surge of nearly 2% in its last 24-hour value. Besides, it also comes just after Sun has made a significant ETH selloff recently, which has sparked concerns among investors over its potential impact on the asset’s price ahead. Tron Founder Justin Sun Plans To Bag 53K ETH Tron Founder Justin Sun plans to acquire nearly 53,000 ETH, sparking discussions in the market. Notably, this move came just after Sun dumped a massive amount of the crypto recently, which has fueled speculations over its potential impact on Ethereum price. Notably, top on-chain analytics and transaction tracking platform, Spot On Chain has reported the recent development. According to the report, Sun has recently applied to withdraw 52,905 ETH, worth around $209 million, from Lido. Notably, the report also noted that this move is part of his accumulation of 392,474 Ether, which he “allegedly bought” at around $1.19 billion through three wallets between February and August. Meanwhile, his current ETH holdings showed that he has an estimated profit of around $349 million, indicating a 29% RoI. Notably, Sun has dumped 29,920 Ethereum, worth around $119.7 million, to HTX exchange last week, after the crypto’s price has touched $4k. Will It Impact Ethereum Price? The latest ETH price noted a surge of over 2% in the last 24 hours and traded at $3,961, while its one-day trading volume soared 11% to $30.5 billion. The crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $4,020 while noting a monthly gain of 27%. On the other hand, CoinGlass data showed that ETH Futures Open Interest soared nearly 5%, suggesting strong market confidence towards the asset. However, the recent move by Justin Sun has fueled speculations over his next move with his ETH holdings. Precisely, a flurry of market experts are discussing if Sun would continue his Ether selling spree, which might impact Ethereum price ahead. Meanwhile, despite the concerns, other Ether market trends appear to be optimistic. For context, popular crypto market expert Ali Martinez has recently said that ETH whales are on a buying spree since the crypto has soared past the $3,300 mark. Besides, a recent analysis showed that ETH price could target the brief $15K mark next, which has further fueled market sentiments.

In a new interview with Bitcoin firebrand Robert Breedlove, Gromen says the country is facing a national security crisis after Russia crushed US and NATO forces in Ukraine. Gromen believes that the defeat has changed the rules of the game, forcing the Department of Defense and the national security apparatus to abandon the fiat currency system. According to the macro guru, the US dollar system drove the country to shutter its factories, crippling America’s ability to manufacture armaments for national defense. But Gromen says the national defense and intelligence establishment now sees an opportunity to revitalize its industries by debasing the dollar and using Bitcoin to back the Treasury market. “The game theory has changed around this: for national political stability, for bringing back the middle and working class for defense base re-establishment. All of these things are pointing to a neutral reserve asset… Bitcoin has gone from an eye-roll laugh in this sentence a year ago… but I don’t think there should be. Treasury [Department] is talking about how to use stablecoins to create a balance sheet basically for T-bills to finance deficits. Paul Ryan, former speaker of the House [and] VP candidate, [wrote an] op-ed about how stablecoins could be used to create demand for T-bills. Trump saying Bitcoin is the new oil, reportedly, [and] the strategic [Bitcoin] reserve.” Gromen says the statements of politicians and the Treasury Department tell him that the US is gearing up to massively boost the market cap of Bitcoin, similar to what happened to oil in 1973 when it surged 400%. “What that oil price did by moving up that way was it effectively made oil big enough to back the dollar, to back the US deficits.” According to Gromen, elevating Bitcoin as a neutral reserve asset will allow the US to finance the re-establishment of its industries for national defense without making Americans poor. “The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee report has a chart: here’s the market cap of crypto, here’s the market cap of stablecoins, here’s how many T-bills stablecoins have bought, and it’s linear. That’s how they’re looking at it… When you think about it that way in the context of political stability issues that you need to address, the national defense issues you need to address, the game theory is turned on its head… Bitcoin isn’t a threat that is rising. It needs to go up faster so that we have more balance sheet capacity and so that our people, as we reinflate to re-shore all of this stuff because it is going to be inflationary, that’s not a bad thing to compensate your people to keep them whole on a real basis while that happens.” Source: Treasury Department At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,063.

Token launches are not inexpensive. With costs ranging from $40,000 to $200,000 , a well-executed exchange listing is not just desirable but essential. As major exchanges continue to refine their requirements and regulations in 2024, navigating these complexities has become increasingly challenging.

Saylor’s proposal, outlined at a recent meeting, is based on the idea that Bitcoin has emerged as the ultimate global reserve capital network. “Bitcoin is better than real estate, better than stocks,” Saylor said, adding that no corporate or real estate asset can rival Bitcoin as a long-term investment. He suggested that the U.S. could catalyze Bitcoin’s growth by purchasing 20-25% of the network on behalf of the government. Saylor has viewed Bitcoin as a transformative financial instrument that could strengthen the U.S. economy while diminishing the value of rival countries’ gold reserves. He argued that by selling all of its gold holdings and buying Bitcoin, the U.S. could cash in on Bitcoin’s growth while weakening the finances of countries with significant gold reserves, such as China and Russia.

Here is the Day by Day, Hour by Hour List “Dump your gold,” Saylor urged, adding: “Sell all US gold, buy Bitcoin. This transaction is essentially free because you can buy 5 million Bitcoin for the price of gold.” Saylor also noted the broader implications of such a move, suggesting that demonetizing gold could reduce its value to near zero, which could significantly impact countries that rely on gold reserves, while Bitcoin’s value could skyrocket. “Our assets will reach $100 trillion, and we will control the world’s reserve currency network as well as the world’s reserve capital network,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Today’s BTC surge came following MicroStrategy’s addition to Nasdaq 100 index and bullish momentum amid Donald Trump’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve developments. Legendary trader Peter Brandt predicted Bitcoin could surge past $120K by the year-end. This Bitcoin price target looks reachable amid the Trump pro-crypto statements. Trump Rally For Bitcoin Price to Extend Further? With Donald Trump set to take charge of the White House next month, analysts are hopeful of a crypto-friendly regulatory landscape. Furthermore, the US is likely to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration. Last week while speaking at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Donald Trump announced plans for crypto without revealing much details about it. Last week, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy attained a significant milestone by joining the Nasdaq 100 Index. Over the last four years, business intelligence software firm MicroStrategy has transformed into a leveraged Bitcoin investment vehicle by raising billions of dollars through its MSTR stock sale and buying more Bitcoins from it. Speaking on the development, Sean McNulty, director of trading at liquidity provider Arbelos Markets said: “Now that MicroStrategy is in Nasdaq, index funds may buy its shares, and that will help the company to raise more equity to buy more Bitcoin”. On Sunday, Michael Saylor hinted that his company’s Bitcoin buying spree could continue even at new all-time highs. As per the Saylor Tracker data , MicroStrategy holds 423,650 BTC on its balance sheet worth $44.58 billion as of the current Bitcoin price.

Investors are looking forward to a sixth such announcement from MicroStrategy on December 16. Popular economist and Bitcoin critic Peter Brandt said: “Bitcoin is at a new all-time high again tonight. Most likely, we will find out tomorrow that Michael Saylor was the buyer. That seems to be the trend, as it’s happened the last five Mondays in a row”. Bitcoin extended its rally through Sunday, achieving a seven-week winning streak—its longest since 2021. The move was triggered by anticipation of having Bitcoin strategic reserve in January. Analysts Predict $120K Price Target for BTC Legendary trader Peter Brandt shared a chart showing a Bitcoin price breakout above the $101,435 level and suggesting that the next Bitcoin all-time high could be above $120K. The time frame that he expects for this milestone is between Christmas and New Year 2025.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez observed a sharp increase in the number of Bitcoin whales on the network following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential elections.

Moreover, traders must keep an eye on rate cut decisions by the Bank of Japan and Bank of England. As of press time, the BTC price is trading 6.2% up at $105,193.04 with its market cap surging past $2.08 trillion. Furthermore, the daily trading volume has also surged 64% to $63.2 billion. As per the Coinglass data, the 24-hour BTC liquidations have soared to $119 million of which $103 million is in short liquidations.
