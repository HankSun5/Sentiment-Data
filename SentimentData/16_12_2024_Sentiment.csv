While some, like AAVE, are showing signs of strength, others, like MANA, remain in consolidation mode, waiting their turn in the spotlight, according to the analyst. Martinez noted that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market due to a combination of strong rhetoric and fundamentals. The key factors include: The growing importance of the US Bitcoin Reserve. Anticipation surrounding Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock's 2% portfolio allocation recommendation to Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is included in the Nasdaq 100. Martinez noted that Ethereum (ETH) has historically outperformed Bitcoin every December, pointing to the importance of timing and positioning. “If you’re investing in altcoins, the important thing is to get into projects with strong fundamentals early on,” he said. Martinez warned investors not to chase memecoins and be tempted by the lure of quick riches, instead focusing on altcoins with real utility and strong fundamentals that have a better chance of generating sustainable gains. Related News: An Extraordinary Proposal for Bitcoin: ""Make 1 Satoshi Now 1 BTC"" According to Martinez, several altcoins stand out as potential winners in the next market cycle: Worldcoin (WLD): A new project that aims to revolutionize identity and global finance. Uniswap (UNI): Leading decentralized exchange with a proven track record. AAVE: A DeFi leader that is already showing its strength. Chainlink (LINK): The home of widely adopted decentralized oracles. Maker (MKR): A stablecoin and one of the cornerstones of DeFi. ONDO: Positioned to capitalize on the narrative of tokenized real-world assets. Solana (SOL): Known for its speed, scalability, and thriving ecosystem. BNB: Exchange token with wide usage and market relevance. “These are not just ‘hype coins,’” Martinez said. “These are projects with solid use cases that can weather market volatility.” “For sustainable gains, position yourself where the smart money is flowing,” he said, suggesting that the next altcoin season may be closer than expected. *This is not investment advice.

Qubetics Brings a Fresh Start for High-Growth Investments,https://thecoinrise.com/did-you-overlook-crypto-trends-qubetics-brings-a-fresh-start-for-high-growth-investments/,"Have you ever wondered what might have been if you’d acted on early crypto trends? AAVE is a prime example of a project that started small but exploded into a major force in decentralised finance. It began quietly, with many sceptical of its potential, but today, AAVE is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. If you missed the boat then, you’re not alone. Luckily, new opportunities are always around the corner. This time, Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping in with its groundbreaking innovations and a presale that’s catching the eye of investors.

It started as ETHLend in 2017, launching with an ICO that priced its tokens at just $0.0162. At the time, decentralised finance was still a niche concept, and many overlooked its potential. Fast forward to today, AAVE has grown into a powerhouse, enabling users to lend, borrow, and earn interest on their assets without traditional intermediaries.

Partnerships and integrations have only added to its credibility, making it a long-term success story. For those who missed out on AAVE’s early days, the regret is real. Its value has multiplied many times over, showing what’s possible when you invest early in a project with strong fundamentals.

BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now – Don’t Regret It Twice!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bonks-moonshot-btfd-coin-is-the-best-meme-coin-presale-to-join-now-dont-regret-it-twice/,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on meme coins, you’ve probably heard of BONK. It exploded onto the scene as Solana’s first dog-themed meme coin, driving a frenzy in the crypto world. Back when it launched, early adopters were laughing all the way to the bank, turning tiny investments into jaw-dropping gains. BONK wasn’t just another token; it was a movement, a viral sensation. But here’s the thing – if you weren’t there to grab BONK during its early days, you might’ve missed the chance to cash in big time. Fast forward to today, BONK still holds a solid spot in the meme coin landscape, but the astronomical gains are harder to catch now. As it stabilises, those dreams of turning a hundred bucks into a small fortune feel like a distant memory. If you’re wondering whether history will repeat itself, well, it kind of is—but not with BONK. Meet BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a meme coin rewriting the playbook and turning heads during its explosive presale phase. Why BTFD Coin Is the Best Meme Coin Presale to Join Now Launched with the mantra “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD Coin has become the hottest topic in crypto circles. With over $3.9 million raised in its presale and a price of $0.00013 per coin, BTFD is delivering on its promise to make sure you never miss a juicy dip again. This isn’t just a coin; it’s a full-blown movement, complete with its own P2E game, staking rewards, and an engaging community called the Bulls Squad. Here’s the kicker: when the presale ends, the listing price will jump to $0.0006. That means if you put in just $1,500 now, you’d snag a whopping 15 million BTFD coins. Once the coin hits the market at its projected price, your investment could skyrocket to $9,000 . Multiply that by the staking APY of up to 90%, and you’re looking at gains that most meme coins can only dream of. The presale has already sold over 55 billion coins to 5,400 holders, and with every passing stage, the price edges higher. Whether you’ve got 1 Ethereum (buying you 38,863,600 coins) or 1 Solana (grabbing 2,287,200 coins), the entry points are as diverse as they are lucrative. And if you’re into gaming, the BTFD P2E platform offers even more ways to earn. But what makes BTFD truly revolutionary is its community-driven ethos. With its Bulls Squad leading the charge, this token is built to withstand the wild swings of crypto markets and turn every dip into a launchpad for growth. Missed BONK? Don’t miss the lucrative BTFD presale . BONK vs. BTFD: A Tale of Two Meme Coins Comparing BONK to BTFD is like comparing yesterday’s news to tomorrow’s headline. BONK had its moment of glory, rallying meme coin enthusiasts around its quirky branding and strong community vibes. When it launched, its price surged astronomically, creating millionaires out of early believers. Even today, BONK remains a staple of Solana’s ecosystem, celebrated for its contribution to meme coin culture. But let’s not sugarcoat it: BONK’s peak growth is behind us. Its current price movements are more about consolidation than explosive growth. Analysts predict steady, albeit modest, increases in BONK’s value as it integrates deeper into Solana’s ecosystem. While that’s great news for existing holders, it leaves little room for the kind of exponential gains new investors crave. On the other hand, BTFD Coin is fresh out of the gates, riding a wave of excitement that shows no signs of slowing down. Its Ethereum-based foundation ensures scalability and security, while its built-in staking and gaming mechanisms make it far more than just a token – it’s an ecosystem. This combination of innovation and community engagement positions BTFD as the best meme coin presale to join now , eclipsing BONK’s fading spotlight. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Your Second Best Chance Crypto opportunities don’t come with guarantees, but they do come with patterns. BONK’s meteoric rise was a wake-up call for anyone sleeping on meme coins. If you missed that boat, don’t let BTFD Coin sail without you. With its presale already turning heads, this coin is set to redefine what it means to “buy the dip.” BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a movement, a rallying cry, and your ticket to being part of the next big thing. As the presale heats up and stages fly by, waiting could cost you dearly. So, what are you waiting for? Join the BTFD presale today and stake your claim in crypto history. Don’t let hindsight be 20/20 again. If BONK taught us anything, it’s that timing is everything. BTFD Coin is here to prove that lightning does strike twice – if you’re bold enough to catch it.

Musk Loves USA (MUSKUSA), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKUSA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk Loves USA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Loves USA could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Loves USA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Loves USA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Loves USA by entering its contract address – DdmquVnPoj7RrjCiZ1yAc8p3b6bmCagcRUedBH6c572h – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKUSA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 22:07:57

Justin Bons, Cyber Capital founder and CIO, argues in a recent tweet that AI-enabled wallets will be the death of ETH’s ambitions of streamlining its ecosystem. Bons wrote: AI agents embedded in user wallets will revolutionize the crypto User Experience! Hilariously it will also be the last nail in the coffin for ETH alignment. ~Justin Bons He added that the situation would arise from AI objectively choosing the blockchains with the best offerings in fees, security, and transaction speeds. Thus, it would do away with what he termed as “all the tribalistic BS!” Netizens pushback on Bons’ claims Those claims kicked a Twitter storm with several netizens pushing back on his suggestions. One X user tdubb led the assault terming Bons’ prediction the worst take on the subject that he had ever seen. He insisted that the intention of the AI is what will matter as these tools will work according to their creator’s instructions. “AI will objectively choose chains with the best fee/security/speed properties” is up there with one of the worst takes on AI i’ve ever seen icl — tdubb — ux/acc (@tdubbdoteth) December 15, 2024 He suggested that there were other factors other than speed, cost, and security that would determine the working of AI-embedded wallets. These include the chain’s liquidity, product, and interoperability. But ultimately the AI agent’s design would hold sway. Another user @calebini also took Bons to task on his assertion that the AI agents wouldn’t choose Base as it was slow, costly, and totally centralized. He made fun of Bons’ apparently forgetting that virtuals, a prominent AI-agent platform was running on the network. @calebini also slammed Bons for relegating his platform to attacking ETH or BTC at every chance he got. He wondered why he (Bons) wouldn’t use it to highlight the positive developments within the entire crypto ecosystem. To him, Bons’ hostility towards the two was tiresome and undermined his credibility. Vitalik Buterin pushes for Ethereum alignment to unite the ecosystem The Ethereum alignment concept grew from the complexities that emerged from the blockchain’s evolution. As the network grew it accommodated many projects with diverse views, goals, and operating principles. This divergence threatens the realization of ETH’s core principles. To bring back all the players to Ethereum’s founding philosophies, the network’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed the Ethereum alignment concept. Its key components are ecosystem unity and coordinated governance. Through it, the Ethereum Foundation hopes to build a stronger network with an enhanced ecosystem value. It also looks to improve the user experience by easing user navigation of the blockchain’s services and promoting the interoperability of applications.

In a Dec. 13 complaint, BiT Global accused Coinbase of delisting wBTC to promote its own product, cbBTC. The move allegedly caused significant financial losses and damaged consumer confidence in wBTC. The lawsuit claims attempted monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act, predatory practices to undermine wBTC, and false statements suggesting wBTC failed to meet listing standards. Coinbase announced the token delisting on Nov. 19, citing undisclosed failures to meet its listing standards. A Coinbase spokesperson defended the decision, stating: “Coinbase is committed to maintaining the high integrity of our listing standards, and we regularly evaluate assets listed on our platform. Should an asset fail to meet those standards, it is delisted.” BiT Global, a Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, has been a joint custodian of wBTC reserves with BitGo since August. The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California by law firm Kneupper & Covey, alleges Coinbase favored memecoins while challenging wBTC’s compliance with listing standards. Attorney Kevin Kneupper stated, “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space. If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next?” The lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $1 billion and demands injunctive relief to prevent further harm. BiT Global claims Coinbase aimed to eliminate competition, stating: “It’s clear that Coinbase’s decision is an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, pushing forward their own wrapped Bitcoin product, cbBTC, and removing the largest and most influential competitor in wBTC.” Coinbase previously announced: “Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC on Dec. 19, 2024, on or around 12 pm ET.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 22:55:00

He learned that the government planned to restrict AI development to a few large companies. This led him to endorse Donald Trump, who he believes supports less government control over tech. Marc Andreessen is the co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, an influential figure especially when it comes to the future of artificial intelligence (AI). Recently, he exposed his deep concerns over the Biden administration’s plan to regulate and control AI technology, after attending a series of meetings with government officials in May 2023. Andreessen criticizes Biden’s AI regulations Andreessen described the experience as “horrifying,” and it had a significant impact on his decision to endorse Donald Trump in the upcoming election. In the meeting, Andreessen learned that government officials were planning to take strong control over the AI sector, limiting its development and access to a few large companies that cooperate closely with the government. According to Andreessen, the officials clearly stated that AI startups would not be allowed to exist. He recalled the statement, “Don’t fund AI startups. That’s not something that we’re going to allow to happen.” The government’s plan was to establish a situation where only two or three major companies, tightly controlled and “wrapped in a government cocoon,” would be allowed to develop AI technology. These companies would receive government protection from competition and be fully directed by the administration on how to move forward with AI development. Government plans to limit AI Innovation What alarmed him was that the government would go even further by restricting access to the fundamental technology that powers AI. He explained that government officials suggested they could follow a similar path to the Cold War, where certain scientific areas, including physics, were classified and kept secret from the public and the research community. Andreessen was shocked when the officials suggested that AI could also be “classified” in a way that would limit or even prevent open research and development. This discussion raised serious concerns for Andreessen, especially since he had investments in AI startups. His firm has funded several cutting-edge AI companies, including Elon Musk’s xAI, Mistral AI, and Character.AI. The idea of controlling AI development would threaten his business interests and the tech innovation ecosystem. For Andreessen, this wasn’t just about his personal investments it was about the future of AI innovation in the United States. The Biden administration has taken an approach to AI, like issuing an executive order in October 2023 asking companies to voluntarily follow safety and transparency guidelines. The executive order called for companies to share safety test results with the government and for Congress to review data privacy practices. However, Andreessen claims that the government’s actual plan is much more controlling and stricter. He believes their anti-capitalist stance threatens innovation and the spirit of American business. His view is that the government’s approach to AI reflects a shift towards a more controlled economy. After the meetings, Andreessen decided to support Trump, who he saw as a leader promoting innovation. Trump’s approach of reducing government control over business and encouraging private companies in tech was the opposite of the Biden administration’s policies.

These sentiments from the crypto analyst mirror the dynamic nature of the market and the constant shift in investors interest. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Next Big Player In Crypto While PEPE, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE) are household names in cryptocurrency, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is making waves with its decentralized crypto wallet that gives investors absolute control over their digital assets without the interference of third parties. WallitIQ (WLTQ) is known for its adoption of AI solutions and machine learning algorithms that promote financial literacy, security and decentralization among its users. Touted as the SHIB of this cycle, the leading crypto analyst believes WallitIQ (WLTQ) is significantly positioned to benefit from the billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI market as the demand for efficient crypto wallets continues to rise. In addition to the leading crypto analyst predictions of WallitIQ to replicate SHIB’s previous success, WallitIQ’s projected $10 million monthly revenue has attracted both retail and institutional investors who missed out on SHIB in 2021, with its low token price and an opportunity to create generational wealth. Following the crypto analyst predictions, the ongoing WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale has seen massive interest from investors, selling millions of tokens in just a few weeks. Early investors have positioned themselves to enjoy several benefits, including governance participation, early gains from token price appreciation, premium features, etc. The crypto analyst has also mentioned that the best time to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens is now to enjoy the benefits that come with its rapid price growth. While Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained popularity through its meme status and community-driven support, WallitIQ (WLTQ) distinguishes itself by providing tangible benefits such as annual percentage yields (APY) of 180% as rewards for users who stake their tokens. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) provides its users with access to over 2,000 cryptocurrencies, giving them an efficient and secure platform to diversify their portfolios. As a platform that prioritizes security, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has won the heart of the crypto analyst with its combination of the advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic cryptographic curve (ECC) that protects user private keys and transactions from fraudulent individuals. In addition, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has undergone a smart contract audit conducted by a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm known as SolidProof . This firm specializes in protecting financial institutions and preventing hackers from penetrating blockchain projects. PEPE As Dogecoin (DOGE) Replacement Just recently, PEPE crossed the $11 billion market cap milestone for the first time. With the latest price rally stretching its year-to-date (YTD) to 2,570%, PEPE is positioned to outperform rival meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in the current bull cycle. As Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to experience fluctuations, many are turning to PEPE as a fresh opportunity. The crypto analysts believe that PEPE could capitalize on the momentum previously enjoyed by Dogecoin, especially with PEPE’s increasing demand increasing social media buzz. According to data from CoinGecko , PEPE’s market cap is at $10.3 billion with a daily trading volume of $5.5 billion. As of the time of this writing, PEPE is trading at a price of $0.00002459. On the other hand, Dogecoin’s market cap is $60.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $6.7 billion. As of writing time, Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at a price of $0.4121. Be Part Of The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale With PEPE positioning itself as a viable replacement for Dogecoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) aims to capture the spirit of SHIB, attracting all classes of investors with its discounted token price. With the presale moving faster than expected, smart investors are seizing this opportunity to buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens for a low price of $0.0243 each. Millions of tokens have been sold, reflecting the growing demand for innovative solutions that offer both utility and security.

Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve (TRUMPRES), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRES is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve by entering its contract address – 2GxwMgJnqbDuDec9gMVNfN2n8eVf7ks1EUv1RZSCLNm1 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRES. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-15 23:12:00

A new report from Electric Capital has revealed that Asia now commands 32% of the world’s crypto development. This is a sharp rise from just 12% in 2015. As North America’s influence declines, emerging markets, especially India, are becoming the main source of new talent in crypto. Asia’s Rapid Growth and the Emergence of India Asia’s growing dominance in crypto development is undeniable. The region’s 32% share of global developer activity marks a substantial shift in industry trends. What was once a Western-centric field is now expanding rapidly eastward, with India leading the charge. Since 2023, India has accounted for a larger share of new crypto developers than any other country. This underscores the country’s growing importance in the crypto ecosystem. India’s large talent pool and booming tech industry are driving its rise in blockchain development. The country is becoming a key player in the global crypto ecosystem. Its contributions are shaping the future of the industry. In a recent report, the country emerged as the global hub for Web3 innovations . A Decline in North America, But Veteran Developers Are Flourishing While Asia rises, North America’s dominance in the crypto field is dwindling. The region’s share of global developer activity has dropped from 43% in 2015 to just 24%. Still, the outlook remains positive. The crypto space has seen a 7% drop in active developers this year, but the picture is far from discouraging. Developers with over two years of experience have grown significantly, increasing by 27%. These seasoned experts now contribute over 70% of code commits in leading blockchain ecosystems, underscoring their importance to the industry. Their expertise drives innovation, sustains key projects, and stabilizes the fast-changing field. Despite fewer newcomers, the growing presence of experienced developers highlights the maturing nature of the crypto ecosystem. New Talent Flocks to Solana and Other Blockchain Ecosystems Ethereum remains the top platform for crypto developers, but its dominance is being challenged. Solana is rising quickly, attracting new developers , and becoming the preferred choice by mid-2024 in key markets like the U.S., U.K., China, and Canada. Alongside Ethereum and Solana, other blockchain ecosystems are also gaining traction. Platforms like Internet Computer, Aptos, Coinbase’s Base , Bitcoin, Sui, NEAR, Polkadot, and Polygon are seeing a significant influx of new developers, each adding at least 1,000 new contributors in the past year alone. This shift shows growing interest in diverse blockchain solutions and expanding innovation in previously overlooked markets. The surge of talent entering the crypto space, with over 39,000 new developers this year alone, signals the start of a new era for blockchain development.

This comes as optimism remains sky-high on the back of a crypto-friendly US presidential administration. As we reported just last night, President-elect Donald Trump confirmed his plans to back the national Bitcoin strategic reserve proposed by crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis. Since his election victory in November, Bitcoin has been on a tear, climbing by 50% in just over a month. Investors are betting big on the changes coming under his administration. Trump has made it clear he’s no fan of current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, whose regulatory crackdowns have been a thorn in the side of the crypto community. The decision to replace Gensler with Paul Atkins, a known crypto ally, has made the market even more bullish. Bitcoin-based ETFs have been a game changer this year, and 2024 has been all about capital flowing in at an insane pace. Just last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $676 million in inflows. The derivatives market is also on fire. Open interest in Bitcoin futures and options has hit record levels. Everyone is betting on where it’s headed next, and the sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish. Altcoins have been left in the dust, with Bitcoin’s market share growing as investors double down on the one crypto they trust the most. While enthusiasm is high, there are signs of caution. Liquidity clusters around $100,000 suggest some volatility ahead. If prices dip, it’s likely a temporary pullback as the market resets before making another run.

The report reveals that countries like Nigeria, South Africa, and the Philippines are driving significant growth in awareness, ownership, and participation in crypto-related activities. Emerging Markets at The Forefront The survey shows that 93% of people globally are aware of cryptocurrencies, with 51% claiming to understand them. Ownership levels stand at 42%, with the highest rates reported in Nigeria (73%), South Africa (68%), and the Philippines (54%). These countries also displayed a notable increase in Web3 activities, such as holding NFTs, using decentralized finance (DeFi), and staking. In Nigeria, 77% of respondents correctly defined blockchain, while 80% knew about decentralization. Similarly, South Africa reported 74% familiarity with the latter concept, while 61% of participants in the Philippines shared the same understanding. Per the report, crypto adoption in these areas is driven by various factors, with a large number of proponents perceiving it as a solution to local economic challenges. Additionally, many in these markets view digital assets as a lifeline, with 65% of Nigerians seeing them as a way to store value amid currency instability and another 58% considering them as the “future of money.” Individuals in these countries are also more likely to invest in crypto in the coming year. The Philippines has been capitalizing on the opportunities provided by such assets, with a 7% increase in ownership over the last 12 months. Entry Barriers and Blockchain Solutions Despite the growing enthusiasm for crypto in these regions, the survey also highlights persistent barriers to entry. Concerns about market volatility, scams, and the lack of understanding of its purpose remain widespread globally. However, these obstacles are less prevalent in emerging markets, where respondents demonstrated a willingness to embrace virtual currencies despite the challenges. The report also reveals that blockchain could be key in addressing concerns about artificial intelligence (AI), with 75% of those interviewed worried about its potential to generate fake news and perpetuate fraud. About 54% of participants globally believe blockchain could provide the transparency and accountability needed to combat AI-driven misinformation. Speaking on the increasing importance of data privacy as highlighted by the survey, Consensys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin said: “The critical role of blockchain and decentralization in enhancing privacy, trust, and transparency for how our data is managed cannot be overstated.” He added that the last few years have shown growing momentum for crypto, blockchain, and Web3 adoption, with 2024 marking a significant period. He explained that this is due to various factors, including the recent U.S. presidential election , which could lead to greater regulatory clarity for the industry.

RCO Finance: Which Can Turn $1k into $100k by January 1?,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu-vs-rco-finance-which-can-turn-1k/,"Among the numerous digital assets, Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and RCO Finance (RCOF) stand out as three distinct choices with significant potential in 2025. However, while each of these coins has its own narrative and market dynamics, the key question remains: which one holds the potential to turn a modest $1,000 investment into $100,000 by January 1? Dogecoin Could Hit $1.48 in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE), originally conceived as a meme coin, has grown to become one of the market’s most recognizable and widely traded cryptocurrencies. Known for its fun, community-driven nature, Dogecoin saw a significant price surge earlier this year, doubling in value within a month following Trump’s re-election, reflecting the strong bullish sentiments surrounding the coin. Despite its reputation as a meme coin, Dogecoin’s performance has shown potential for substantial gains, with an impressive 350% rise in a year to trade at $0.4055 at press time. Analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s future, with some bullish predictions putting its price at around $0.8392 by early 2025 and others hinting that it could soar to $1.48 after Trump assumes office on January 20, 2025. Nevertheless, while the projection of $1.48 is quite ambitious, it still can not convert a $1,000 investment in DOGE into $100,000. Buying DOGE at its current price could get you approximately 2,466 DOGE tokens, which at $1.48 would be worth a modest $3,649. Shiba Inu Price Could Hit $0.0000879 in 2025 Shiba Inu (SHIB), often called the “Dogecoin killer,” has carved out a unique space in the cryptocurrency market with its playful branding and vibrant community. Also launched as a meme coin, Shiba Inu quickly gained attention due to its low entry price and speculative appeal. It has seen notable activity, including several token burns to reduce supply and increase scarcity. Although these burns represent only a small fraction of Shiba Inu’s total supply, they contribute to the deflationary narrative that can be attractive to investors looking for assets with limited supply and potential for price appreciation. Over the past year, Shiba Inu has experienced a notable price increase, soaring by 196% despite witnessing wild price swings. And while it is still way down from the $0.00008616 all-time high achieved in October 2021, predictions are placing the meme coin at $0.0000879 in 2025. However, while $0.0000879 would represent quite a huge gain for SHIB, it still would not be enough to convert a $1,000 investment into $100,000. $1,000, at the current SHIB price of $0.000028 , can get you 35,714,285 SHIB tokens, which at $0.0000879 would only be worth $3,139.285. RCO Finance Emerges as a Compelling Alternative Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are both meme coins and RCO Finance is emerging with a more structured and professional approach to cryptocurrency investing. As an AI-powered financial platform, it aims to democratize access to sophisticated investment strategies. One of the standout features of RCO Finance is the AI-powered Robo Advisor , which analyzes market data and tailors investment strategies to individual user preferences, optimizing portfolio performance without requiring manual oversight. This level of automation is particularly beneficial for novice and experienced investors, allowing them to focus on their long-term financial goals without getting bogged down by day-to-day market fluctuations. Additionally, RCO Finance will provide access to over 120,000 assets across 12,500 asset classes, from traditional stocks and bonds to digital assets and real-world assets like real estate. This wide range of tradable assets allows investors to diversify their portfolios and balance risk across different markets. Another unique aspect of RCO Finance is its KYC-free ecosystem, which ensures user privacy and simplifies the onboarding process, making it more accessible to privacy-conscious investors. Furthermore, the platform also features an audited smart contract , enhancing security and trust among users. These features position RCO Finance as a viable option for investors seeking more than just short-term gains. Investors can invest in the project through the ongoing RCOF token presale. Taking Advantage of the Ongoing RCOF Token Presale The RCO Finance presale represents a compelling opportunity for investors looking to maximize their returns. In its fourth stage, the RCOF token has already experienced a 509% price surge, reaching $0.07770, and is expected to see further gains as it progresses through the presale stages. The next stage, the final presale stage, is set to see the price of RCOF reach $0.21420 before public listing at between $0.4 and $0.6. This price trajectory indicates substantial potential for profit as the RCOF token approaches its public listing, where it could see even more significant gains as investors take advantage of early access to the platform’s features and the ecosystem’s expected growth. For those looking to transform a $1,000 investment into $100,000, the ongoing presale of RCO Finance presents a promising opportunity to capitalize on the projected price increases. A $1,000 investment in RCOF at the current presale price could earn you 12,870 RCOF tokens and if the token soars to $10 as projected by most analysts due to the current hype around AI and DeFi, the investment could turn to a cool $128,700.

Don’t Let This Best Meme Coin Presale for Massive Return Potential Be Your Second Mistake!,https://thecoinrise.com/regret-missing-brett-dont-let-this-best-meme-coin-presale-for-massive-return-potential-be-your-second-mistake/,"Meme coins have been shaking up the crypto world for years, delivering wild profits and unforgettable stories. Remember Dogecoin’s meteoric rise or Brett creating overnight millionaires? One thing’s clear: early movers always win big. Now, there’s a fresh chance to jump in early, and it’s making waves— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . In just 14 days , this presale sensation has raised over $2.6 million, selling over 44 billion coins to more than 3,900 holders. BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s a movement redefining what meme coins can achieve with innovative staking rewards, a thrilling play-to-earn game, and a vibrant community called the Bulls Squad. This isn’t just another crypto; it’s your ticket to ride the next bull wave. BTFD Coin: The New Frontier for Meme Coin Enthusiasts Unlike the usual meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin brings substance to the table. Built on Ethereum’s rock-solid foundation, it flaunts unmatched security, scalability, and liquidity. The concept of “ Buy the Dip ” is more than a tagline—it’s a rallying cry for those ready to seize opportunities. With presale prices starting at just $0.000004, BTFD Coin offers prime entry points. The current stage 10 price of $0.0001 is still a steal. By the presale’s end, it’s set to launch at $0.0006 per coin. For context, a $2,500 investment at $0.0001 could fetch you 25 million BTFD coins. When the price hits $0.0006, that $2,500 could skyrocket to $15,000 . Presale Success and Features BTFD Coin’s presale journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Hitting $1 million in under ten days, it’s sold over 44 billion coins. The Bulls Squad—a charismatic community of dip-buying enthusiasts—embodies resilience and camaraderie. For investors, BTFD’s staking program offers an impressive 90% APY, making it a top choice for long-term holders. The play-to-earn game adds another layer of engagement, allowing users to earn while having fun. Connect your wallet, level up, and turn in-game rewards into real-world profits. Tokenomics for Growth BTFD’s tokenomics ensure stability and growth. With 48% allocated to presales, 18% for staking rewards, and 17% for game incentives, every aspect fuels its ecosystem. Unsold tokens will be burned, reducing supply and potentially increasing value. Brett Coin: The Opportunity You Missed Launched earlier this year, Brett Coin (BRETT) emerged as a memecoin powerhouse. Its 142% rally over the past 30 days captured the market’s attention, and it currently trades around $0.2053 with a market cap of $2.035 billion. This meme coin ranked #68 on CoinMarketCap and became a favourite among investors seeking high returns. However, not all has been smooth sailing. Brett faced a 47% drop in April 2024 due to insider holding concerns. Yet, it rebounded fiercely, proving its resilience. Investors who got in early reaped massive rewards, turning small bets into life-changing gains. What Makes Brett Unique Brett isn’t just another meme coin. Its community-driven ethos and market-savvy strategies have earned it a loyal following. Its success underscores one critical lesson: getting in early is everything. Those who sat on the sidelines when Brett was first gaining traction are now regretting it. Why BTFD Coin is Your Next Big Chance While Brett’s success is undeniable, BTFD Coin is positioned to be the next big thing. With its presale pricing, staking rewards, and innovative ecosystem, it offers a ground-floor opportunity for investors. Unlike Brett, which is now in its mature phase, BTFD Coin is just getting started, and its presale is the perfect time to dive in. Consider this: with 1 Ethereum, you can buy 38,863,600 BTFD coins. That’s a staggering amount compared to what you’d get with established meme coins like Brett. The same holds for 1 Bitcoin, which can fetch you 984,470,000 BTFD coins. The math is simple—early entry equals massive potential. Moreover, the BTFD play-to-earn game and community-driven initiatives ensure continuous engagement and value creation. The presale structure incentivises early investors, with prices escalating in each stage. As we approach the end of the presale, FOMO is building, and the buzz is palpable. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Dip—Ride the Wave Meme coins like Brett have shown us the power of early investments. But if you missed Brett’s meteoric rise, don’t let BTFD Coin slip through your fingers. With its presale gaining momentum, staking rewards offering high returns, and a play-to-earn game set to captivate, BTFD Coin stands out as the best meme coin presale for massive return potential. So, what are you waiting for? The presale won’t last forever, and neither will these prices. Join the BTFD movement today and secure your place in the next big crypto success story. Your future self will thank you! Find Out More: Website: https://www.btfd.io/ X/Twitter: https://x.com/BTFD_COIN Telegram: https://t.me/btfd_coin The post Regret Missing Brett?

37693393,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627921,1734308574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37693393.jpeg,Japan ‘far behind’ US in cyber attack preparedness — But that’s actually a good thing for crypto,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/japan-far-behind-us-in-cyber-attack-preparedness-but-thats-actually-a-good-thing-for-crypto/,"Japan’s government is currently pushing for an “active cyber defense” (ACD) policy, and major media in the country are falling all over themselves to aid in the effort with stories to alarm the public. However, copying the examples of the US and UK, as major outlet Nikkei implies ought to be done, is in the very worst interest of peaceful crypto and privacy advocates in Japan. Not long ago, Cryptopolitan reported on Masaaki Taira, Japan’s digital transformation (DX) minister, being commanded by self-described “defense geek” prime minister Ishiba to accelerate work on an “active cyber defense” (ACD) bill. The bill is controversial because it involves state-level spying via private telecom companies on the people of Japan, even in peacetime, and supplying the info to the United States. Some Japanese are also suspicious of scandal-embroiled Taira potentially having connections with anti-Japan interests in the Chinese Communist Party. Major news outlet Nikkei has now joined the push for the “active cyber defense” agenda, publishing a report (or propaganda piece, depending on who you ask) promoting greater cyber-attack preparedness. The December 16 report goes so far as to imply that centralized misinformation control and even state-level “debunking” need to be increased, and done in tandem with major nations like the US and UK. But mimicking Five Eyes intelligence giants in surveillance is a horrible idea for cryptocurrency adoption and privacy in Japan, especially with a digital yen now on the table. The combined effect of all this is to threaten the culturally self-reliant populace with even more influence from a global banking cabal, and pressure to align with cartoonish foreign figures like Musk and Trump , whose actions Taira wants to “closely follow.” Of course Nikkei knows this. And of course the new prime minister Shigeru Ishiba doesn’t actually care about the security or economic freedom of the people he supposedly governs. But nor does any politician, really. This should go without saying. Nikkei shills for surveillance, Japan falls further from crypto grace While the years of independent bitcoin ATMs in Tokyo (ca. 2015-2017) operating free and unfettered are far behind us, and popular trading sites like Local Bitcoins have long since been destroyed by the same restrictive red tape that took out the ATMs, things yet continue to spiral downward when it comes to the Japanese government’s approach to finance, cryptocurrency, and information control. And the media is right there behind them, fueling the fire. “Cyber ​​attacks are posing increasing threats to national security,” the new Nikkei report (translated by Google) reads. “Attacks on governments and military-related targets in various countries have increased by more than 70% compared to the same period last year.” The piece continues: “Japan is currently aiming to strengthen its cyber security system, including the introduction of ‘active cyber defense (ACD)’ that detects signs of cyber attacks and prevents damage before they occur.” As mentioned above, the ACD bill aims to spy on public communications via private companies ostensibly to stave off cyber attacks and the spread of misinformation before they happen. According to other reports from local media, the new legislation could even include shutting down people’s computers. The terms “thoughtcrime” and “pre-crime” might pop into the heads of readers and film buffs familiar with the horrific dystopias of 1984 and The Minority Report. Japan’s NISC, responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings, issued far less alerts than its foreign counterparts in England (middle) and the United States (top), according to Nikkei’s research. Source: Nikkei Combine all this with the looming CBDC , also shilled/predictively programmed by Nikkei interests, and a pretty clear picture of what is happening emerges: Japanese state officials are painting themselves as the victims, while clamping down even harder on the true victims — everyday folks just trying to get by. The report notes that Japan’s NISC (National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity), responsible for issuing cybersecurity warnings to the public, lags far behind its foreign counterparts in Britain and the US. But in Japan, perhaps worrying about the inflation problem , the rampant overtourism, and suicides from overwork might be good to put on the agenda, as opposed to Shigeru Ishiba’s plans for military spending on steroids and drafting of cyber-security bills that spy on everyone. Perhaps instead of lending military support and money to the United States/Israel genocide in the Middle East, politicians on the archipelago might start worrying about the aging population of retirees unable to survive on the national pension. But alas, that is wishful thinking. Which is why permissionless cryptocurrencies became so important in the first place. The report compares the number of “debunkings” Japanese embassies have issued on X, compared to other embassies. Source: Nikkei As if to insultingly answer these ponderings with a non-sequitur, however, the Nikkei report reads: “The Nikkei Shimbun compiled the number of debunkings from April 2011 to July this year for the X (formerly Twitter) accounts of the Japanese, US and UK embassies … the Japanese embassies in the US and UK only sent out one debunking each from their respective countries … that denied the danger of treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.” Nikkei’s report then lauds the intelligence giants overseas: “On the other hand, the US embassy in Japan sent out 13 debunkings, and the UK embassy sent out 10.” Is this really a litmus for social progress? Which government sends out the most “debunkings”? I don’t personally think so. A litmus for social progress is how much economic freedom an individual has, and the respect of others for that freedom. On that front, the Japanese government, and those of the whole world, are miserably and intentionally failing. So, if dystopian spying and “pre-crime” cybersecurity bills are what Japan is lagging behind in, perhaps that particular lack of ambition is for the best.

Chill Pepe (CHILPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because CHILPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Chill Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Chill Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Chill Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Chill Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Chill Pepe by entering its contract address – AfPftBmzfb2pan4Drt2ZKgT7VK5Rn7CLQHpp8DpLhXZj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like CHILPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-16 00:23:00
