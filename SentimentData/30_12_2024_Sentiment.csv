In 2025, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $7,769.79 and $9,361.58, with an average expected price of $9,199.91. In 2030, ETH could trade between $24,373.71 and $26,740.04, with an average price of $25,417.45. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2024 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,333 Market Cap $401.64B Trading Volume $18.58B Circulating Supply 120.46M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,419 24 Low $3,340 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.15% (High) 50-day SMA $ 3,483.34 200-day SMA $ 3,019.55 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (47%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-Day price chart On December 29, the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) shows bearish momentum, with the price at $3,355.4, below the 20-SMA at $3,754.4. Resistance is positioned at $4,205.7 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies at $3,303.2 (lower Bollinger Band). The RSI is at 43.06, approaching the oversold territory, signaling weak buying momentum. The declining price and volume suggest fading bullish sentiment as the price trends downward. A breakdown below $3,303.2 could push ETH toward the $3,000 psychological level. Conversely, a reversal above the $3,754.4 SMA may reignite bullish momentum, targeting the $4,205.7 resistance. Market caution is advised amid increasing volatility. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart xThe 4-hour chart for Ethereum (ETH) indicates bearish momentum, with the price at $3,344.3, trading below the 20-SMA at $3,360. Resistance is at $3,416.4 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies near $3,303.5 (lower Bollinger Band). The MACD shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line at -10.0 below the signal line at -11.9, signaling declining momentum. The Balance of Power (BoP) is at -1.00, highlighting strong selling pressure. If ETH drops below $3,303.5, it could lead to further declines, while a rebound above $3,360 may provide a chance for recovery. Momentum remains weak, favoring cautious trading.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour ETH/USD charts, Ethereum is exhibiting bearish momentum with limited buying strength. On the daily chart, ETH trades at $3,355.4, below the 20-SMA at $3,754.4, with resistance at $4,205.7 and support at $3,303.2. The RSI near 43 suggests weak momentum, with potential for further downside if $3,303.2 is breached. The 4-hour chart reflects a similar trend, with ETH below the 20-SMA at $3,360 and immediate resistance at $3,416.4. MACD and BoP indicate strong selling pressure. A drop below $3,303.2 could lead to further declines, while a recovery above $3,360 might signal stabilization. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 65,900 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to be in the fifth and final leg of its secular bull market that began about six years ago. The trader practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness five-wave rallies with wave five acting as the final leg up prior to a correction. According to Credible, Bitcoin could witness a parabolic surge in the coming months to complete its fifth and final wave. “So we’re in the final leg of the final leg, in my opinion, of the cycle that started back here in 2018 at $3,000 Bitcoin. Within this final fifth wave, again the idea is that if this final fifth leg up has started, which at this point it seems like it has, it should be rather aggressive… The idea is that this fifth wave should generally be a blow-off top.” Source: Credible Crypto/YouTube The trader is also unveiling his bull market price targets for Bitcoin, predicting that BTC could realistically surge by nearly 60% from current levels before transitioning to a new trend. “We could see this move up very aggressively. And the longer that we take down here to move up, that means the higher we’re going to go. So again, I previously said above $100,000… $150,000 is realistic based on what we’ve seen so far. But we could push up to $200,000. We could even push up to $250,000 with my absolute max for this cycle being $300,000. I don’t think we’ll get close to $300,000 but we could see $200,000 to $220,000. It all just depends on how aggressively we move up and the amount of time we take to move up. The longer that we take to finish off this move, the higher we’re going to go.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $95,075.

Optimistic investors now face the reality that Dogecoin’s $1 race will take much longer than expected. Conversely, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the presale altcoin currently shaking the market, is waxing stronger. Leading analysts now predict the altcoin will cross the $1 mark ahead of Dogecoin in the next three weeks. Dogecoin Price Declines, Pushes $1 Dream Further Away The Dogecoin price has headed south following the current market downtrend. A steady drop in on-chain activities and trading volumes reflects reduced investor interest and engagement, significantly weakening the Dogecoin price. Additionally, with less interest rate cuts than anticipated, a wave of selling-off surges across the crypto market. However, the FOMO created by the bull run following Trump’s election win has begun to die off, resulting in the Dogecoin price’s ongoing correction. Yet, amid this chaos, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin retains its promise of crossing the $1 mark in three weeks. Currently selling at $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surge 4,015%, bringing in gains for investors attentive enough to discern its potential. With a 42% gain recorded across its previous presale stage and an imminent 71% surge, the market is confident that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin will see unprecedented growth. In addition, investors who buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) can now compete for a share of its 20% tokenomics allocated for rewarding early adopters. With their eyes on a 180% APY, investors who buy the altcoin continue to stake it in WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) liquidity pools. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Disrupts The Market With Impressive Presale Run, Set To Cross $1 In 3 Weeks WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to outpace the Dogecoin price in the next three weeks as leading analysts compare the AI altcoin’s fundamentals to Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, which depends on its community sentiment and celebrity endorsements, its revolutionary DeFi wallet, record-breaking presale, and unlimited potential underpin WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) success and massive projections. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has raised over $5 million in its ongoing presale, priced at a mere $0.0243 . The presale is seeing overwhelming support, especially as crypto powerhouses fail to deliver their promise of massive profits. Hence, even Dogecoin price watchers and investors are diversifying massively, buying WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoins in huge tranches of $10,000 and more. WallitIQ (WLTQ), the homonymous DeFi wallet behind the altcoin, is a major factor in the altcoin’s success. Its artificial intelligence and machine learning integration are driving rapid adoption as traders and investors hope to gain the best experience using the DeFi wallet when it launches. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Scan & Pay QR feature , which simplifies DeFi transactions, is one of its most discussed features. Users can simply scan a receiver’s QR code, and the transaction will be completed in seconds, limiting the possibility of sending funds to the wrong wallet address. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also offers a Fully DeFi mode, which allows users to trade their cryptocurrencies in a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer environment. Unarguably, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the most promising altcoin in the market right now. This powerful altcoin is swiftly taking over the crypto wallet and AI market, enabling investors to trade more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies directly within their wallets. Its smart contract audit by SolidProof , a revered smart contract auditing firm, also strongly fuels the presale’s success. Investors who linger will struggle to keep pace with WallitIQ (WLTQ) as this presale altcoin delivers life-changing 4,015% gains to profit-takers. Conclusion The shifting dynamics of the crypto market underscore the volatility that investors must navigate as the Dogecoin price $1 milestone becomes increasingly elusive. However, the emerging WallitIQ (WLTQ) $0.0243 altcoin offers a compelling narrative of rapid growth. Seasoned and new investors are reconsidering their strategies, competing for the fortunes this altcoin will bring. So gear up; buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin now at $0.0243 and position for generational wealth in 2025 and beyond.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 21:03:00

Total funds from whales have topped a six-month high, spiking sell pressure this week. XRP price has plunged 3% today and 5% over the week, with traders flagging low sentiments. New CryptoQuant data shows over 2.6 billion XRP were deposited on Binance in the last 30 days. This change in dynamics continues as the asset records a sharp decline after soaring to levels not seen in months above a $140 billion market cap. The increased amount of XRP on centralized exchanges ignited major sell-offs, which became the highest whale value since April 2024. Cryptowhale movements to centralized exchanges tend to crash the prices of most assets due to the size of holdings. Exchange flows determine the strength and weakness of the bull cycle, showing trader sentiment. This becomes a bearish phase based on the ease of sale out of exchanges. “ This is the highest amount of XRP deposited by large holders since April 2024, showing a noticeable increase in activity among whales. The large inflows suggest that big XRP holders are actively transferring XRP over the network, and interact with Binance as an exchange. Whale deposits can often signal potential shifts in strategy, as these players have significant amounts of assets at their disposal.” What’s Next For XRP? XRP has lost a significant chunk of gains in the past few weeks after flipping Tether as the third-largest coin by market cap. This led to positive projections as bulls set sights on an all-time high. Recent headwinds have lowered traders’ expectations, although bulls set sights on gains amid institutional activities. Institutional traders are drawn to XRP because of its cross-border payment potential as global crypto adoption soars. Furthermore, Ripple has made significant strides to boost XRP and advance payments globally. This year, Ripple launched RLUSD, joining the stablecoin space with partnerships with multiple exchanges. The company also announced a collaboration to roll out the premier tokenized money fund on the XRP Ledger. Aside from global partnerships, XRP is expected to soar based on a surge in other top assets. Bitcoin’s latest drive above $100K and upward movement since the U.S. elections has sparked altcoins. According to commentators, altcoins are on the verge of a major rally, citing previous cycles.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-29 21:09:47

Under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules , set to take full effect tomorrow, the EU has made it crystal clear that Tether’s $102 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries aren’t good enough for their taste. Instead, they’re demanding that stablecoin issuers back their tokens with at least 60% reserves held in fiat within EU-regulated banks. If that isn’t a loud and flashy rejection of American financial dominance, what is? MiCA rules: Control disguised as compliance MiCA’s framework claims to be about safety, security, and trust. Stablecoin issuers need to jump through hoops like obtaining licenses, ensuring reserves match tokens, and complying with consumer protection measures. All fair enough, right? Except this isn’t about fair play—it’s about control. Let’s be real. By ignoring Tether’s U.S. Treasuries as valid collateral, the EU is effectively saying it doesn’t trust the backbone of the American financial system. Those Treasuries represent some of the most stable assets in the world. But no, the EU wants euros, and it wants them in its banks. It’s not hard to see the politics at play here. Tether hasn’t been officially labeled non-compliant—yet. But with no clear guidance, exchanges like Coinbase are already delisting USDT in anticipation. Binance and Crypto.com are holding out for now, but we all know now that the clock is ticking. If Tether can’t meet these requirements fast, its removal from European platforms could be devastating for crypto liquidity. The EU’s quiet rebellion By demanding a 60% reserve in EU fiat held within its borders, the bloc is effectively rejecting U.S. debt as a trustworthy backing. This is about moving the balance of power. The EU has been desperate to carve out a bigger slice of the global financial system for years, and stablecoins are their latest target. The implications are massive. If Tether decides the cost of compliance is too high and exits the EU market, other stablecoin issuers will likely face the same choice. USDC, for instance, might have gotten ahead of the curve by securing compliance, but it’s no secret that similar regulations could follow elsewhere. Without USDT, liquidity fragmentation becomes a real problem. Markets will slow down, fees will rise, and efficiency will take a hit. The irony? The EU’s power play would backfire spectacularly. By pushing USDT out, they’re also risking their own relevance in the global crypto market. The U.S., under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, is about to become a haven for innovation, pulling talent and capital away from Europe. If that happens, the EU might have won the battle but it’d have lost the war.",OP-ED|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-29 21:20:59

LINK currently hovers around $21 having failed to move past $26 despite recent uptrends. During this price fall, LINK whales have adopted an accumulation approach signaling confidence in the altcoin’s long-term profitability. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Could Crash 30% To $15 — Here’s How Chainlink Whales Acquire 3.58 Million LINK In 3 Days Following a strong bullish performance in early December, the crypto market has undergone a significant correction in the past two weeks attributed to several factors including a flash crash price and potential reductions of Fed rate cuts in 2025. As this corrective market persists, blockchain analytics company Santiment has reported an accumulation spree by LINK whales holding between 1 million-10 million LINK. In an X post on December 28, Santiment states that these large LINK holders have purchased 3.58 million LINK valued at $76.9 million over the past three days. Generally, significant levels of whale accumulation are indicated as bullish signals as these large token holders are confident of future gains. In the case of a price decline such as this, these massive accumulation levels reflect the belief that LINK is currently undervalued with a potential market rebound on the horizon. Related Reading: Chainlink And AAVE Surge After Trump’s Crypto Project Invests In Both Key Resistance Levels For LINK While high levels of whale accumulation are one sign of an impending price rally, analysis platform More Crypto Online has shared another positive insight on the LINK market. According to a recent X post, these market analysts state Chainlink still maintains an uptrend on larger time frames despite’s recent correction with its major support level set at $17.65. Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, If the LINK’s price holds above this level, the altcoin is predicted to rise to $69 in line with the expected third wave of the current market cycle. However, for confirmation of a price uptrend, Chainlink must break through resistance levels at $25.10 and $28.30. A decisive five-wave move above these levels would solidify the bullish case and suggest further price appreciation. In Elliott Wave theory, the five-wave structure is a reliable pattern indicating a strong trend continuation, making the breakthrough of these resistance levels pivotal for the ongoing rally. At the time of writing, Chainlink trades at $21.90 reflecting a 1.44% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 12.55% and valued at $726.44 million. With a market cap of $13.96 billion, LINK is ranked as the 13th largest cryptocurrency.

This follows a wider market correction that saw over $1.6 billion wiped out of the ecosystem. Sharp declines have lowered trader momentum against previous bullish projections after Bitcoin (BTC) moved past $90K. Cardano slipped the highest among the top 10 crypto assets by market cap over the past 48 hours. The community dubbed ETH killer trades at $0.86, falling 4.7%, with its market cap slightly above $30.4 billion. ADA has decreased 18% in the last seven days, extending losses after previous gains. Despite reduced retail and institutional upward movements, the asset has held on to monthly gains picked up after the United States Presidential elections. Crypto users share conflicting opinions about the wider market’s recovery pace going into the new year. Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hack Spiked Fears Cardano’s downtrend heightened after the hack of the foundation’s X (formerly Twitter) account. The account was compromised on Dec 8 with the bad actors promoting a fake token as well as other false claims. A major point was the fake ADAsol token, which claimed to have ceased support for ADA. The scam token generated $500,000 before it slumped 99%. Malicious actors also claimed to have been slammed by a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Users were advised not to interact with links from the page following the incident. “ The Cardano Foundation regrets to inform our community that we have been served with a lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 8, 2024. In light of this unexpected legal action, we have made the difficult decision to immediately cease all support toward the ADA token to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,” the hackers wrote. A Slow Ecosystem The last 48 hours shown multiple crypto assets losing gains recorded in previous weeks. A glance at decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers also shows a similar downward trajectory. The total value locked (TVL) on Cardano plunged 21% from an all-time high of $708 million. As platforms lost numbers, overall transactions plunged, leading to the status quo. The crypto ecosystem has seen about $1.6 billion in liquidations since the last dip. Daily trading volumes are also in the red zone, although slight institutional numbers were recorded.

The European regulators have not expressly stated if USDT meets the new compliance guidelines. MiCA Uncertainty Surrounds USDT However, Coinbase, the U.S. leading crypto exchange, delisted USDT from its European services earlier this month in an anticipatory move. Coinbase cited the MiCA regulatory compliance guidelines as the reason for the delisting. Other major exchanges, such as Binance and Crypto.com, have continued to offer USDT to its users in Europe. This has generated speculation about the true status of one of the world’s dominant stablecoins. With no clear policy statement from the regulators on MiCA and USDT, market participants have been left guessing. The statement from a MiCA Crypto Alliance’s Technical Committee member did little to provide any clear stance. Juan Ignacio Ibañez, while commenting on the situation, maintained that no regulator has proclaimed USDT non-compliant. Ibañez, however, stated that the absence of a clear proclamation does not imply that USDT is compliant. Tether’s Strategic Moves Amid Uncertainty Analysts have warned that Tether’s refusal to comply with the MiCA regulations might affect Europe’s market . Notably, users in the region could experience major disruptions and weaken Europe’s status as a hub for crypto innovation. Additionally, an official ban on USDT might result in soaring costs for traders and impact market liquidity. Interestingly, a financial analyst, Jacob King, observed that Tether had not minted new coins in over two weeks. King believes the impact of this and an official ban could cause significant disruptions. Amid the uncertainty, Tether has invested in European stablecoin company StablR. StablR, licensed in Malta, issues Euro and U.S. dollar stablecoins. The move by Tether suggests a strategic development to maintain a foothold in the EU market. What Lies Ahead for Tether? Meanwhile, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has justified the company’s operational practices, noting that they have not violated any known guidelines. Ardoino emphasized the company remains focused on network collaborations and USDT’s practical uses in the market. The next few hours might unfold new developments and clarify MiCA and the USDT episode.

Cardano’s $1 Dream Crushed? 4.3 Billion ADA Wall Blocks the Way Cardano is struggling to reach the $1 mark due to a large sell wall of 4.3 billion ADA, purchased at an average price of $1.03, according to IntoTheBlock data. Approximately 309,450 addresses holding ADA in the $0.947 to $1.09 range are currently at a loss, which could impede any potential price increases. Currently, Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.92, down 9.4% over the past week amid ongoing selling pressure in the crypto market. If the price drops further, support is anticipated between $0.659 and $0.834, as 238,860 addresses that bought within this range are likely to step in and buy again. XLM Plunges 16%: Can It Recover? Key Support Level at Risk Stellar (XLM) is currently trading at $0.38, reflecting a 7.9% drop in the past week. However, recent analysis indicates that it might be set for a price increase, according to market analysts. They spotted a potential buy signal on XLM’s daily chart. Nevertheless, there’s a key factor to watch. XLM needs to maintain the $0.33 support to attract more buyers and stabilize the market. A drop below this level could indicate a downward trend, complicating recovery. This uncertainty has led many XLM investors to explore other investment opportunities.

By publicly sharing seed phrases, scammers set up bait wallets that entangle opportunists in a deceptive scheme designed to exploit their attempts to steal funds. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky’s latest findings, scammers post crypto wallet seed phrases on YouTube comments using newly created accounts. Initial Bait The scheme begins with a comment under a finance-related video from someone claiming to need help transferring USDT, a stablecoin, to another wallet. They reveal their full seed phrase, essentially sharing the key to their wallet, which seems suspicious at first glance. This act of sharing a seed phrase is a red flag, as it is the gateway to accessing and controlling the funds in a wallet. Kaspersky revealed that the comment looks something like this: “I have a question. I have USDT stored in my wallet, and I have the seed phrase. How to transfer my funds to another wallet?” Upon further investigation, Kaspersky said that similar comments were posted from newly created accounts, each containing identical recovery phrases and requests for assistance. The scam assumes that an unscrupulous person, rather than offering help, might take advantage of the situation. With access to the seed phrase, they can open the wallet, which might contain a significant sum of cryptocurrency – in this case, the equivalent of $8,000 in USDT. However, the scammers have set a trap. The wallet is actually a multi-signature one, requiring multiple approvals to authorize transactions. When a thief attempts to transfer USDT, they discover that the wallet lacks enough TRX to cover the transaction fee. When the thief tries to send TRX from their own wallet, the tokens are rerouted to a completely different wallet. This clever setup ensures that even the most opportunistic thief cannot easily steal the funds. Trap For The Greedy Kaspersky’s investigation reveals that the scam primarily targets other criminals, tricking them into becoming the victims. By impersonating inexperienced crypto users, the scammers deceive thieves into attempting to steal funds that they ultimately cannot access. “So, the scammers are impersonating beginners who foolishly share access to their cryptowallets, tricking equally naive thieves – who end up becoming the victims. In this scenario, the scammers are something like digital Robin Hoods, as the scheme primarily targets other crooked individuals.” The post Crypto Scammers Bait Thieves with Public Seed Phrases in New Scheme: Kaspersky appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Crypto Scams,EN,0,0,TRX|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-29 22:10:03

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 22:11:00

That’s nearly one in three searches, showcasing their meteoric rise as the year’s top crypto narrative. While $DOGE and $SHIB continue to lead with a combined market cap of $113 billion, the ecosystem has expanded to include a wave of innovative projects like $WEPE, $SOLX, and $MEMEX. These coins aren’t just riding the trend – they’re shaping its future. By the Numbers: Meme Coins in 2024 The “main meme coin narrative” alone snagged almost 15% of all crypto interest, up more than six percentage points from 2023. Solana-based meme coins added another 8%, while other offshoot trends like AI-themed meme coins and Coinbase’s Base blockchain projects contributed further. Together, they made 2024 the year of the meme coin renaissance. $DOGE and $SHIB still dominate , but fresh entrants like $WEPE and $SOLX bring new flavors to the meme coin mix. $WEPE captures the wild, humorous spirit of the original meme coin era, creating viral engagement through clever campaigns. Think of $WEPE as that unpredictable friend who’s always the life of the party – and sometimes walks away with the prize. Meanwhile, $SOLX appeals to the tech-savvy and eco-conscious crowd. It’s more than memes. It’s about solving real problems , like decentralizing energy solutions. And $MEMEX? It’s carving out a niche where AI meets meme culture, proof that even memes can innovate. Why Meme Coins Work So why do meme coins attract so much attention ? First, they’re relatable. Unlike abstract DeFi platforms or niche blockchain projects, meme coins speak the language of the internet. They’re funny, creative, and accessible, making them perfect for drawing in first-time crypto enthusiasts. Second, they offer wild swings – something traders love. Meme coins are volatile, sure, but that volatility creates opportunity. Investors love the chance to turn a few dollars into life-changing sums, even if the odds are slim. Lastly, they’re fun. In a space that can sometimes feel dry and overly technical, meme coins bring a breath of fresh air. They’re the comic relief in crypto’s blockbuster drama. A Look at the Broader Trends CoinGecko’s report also highlighted other 2024 narratives, like the rise of AI tokens, which secured 12.58% of interest, and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, which climbed to 8.64%. Solana-related projects combined for 14.3%, with meme coins taking the lion’s share. These numbers reflect a diversified market, but meme coins remain the crowd favorite. What’s Next for Meme Coins? As we close out 2024, the meme coin ecosystem looks stronger than ever. Projects like $WEPE and $SOLX are expanding the narrative, proving that meme coins can be more than fleeting trends. Whether you’re here for the laughs, the community, or the potential profits, meme coins continue to offer something for everyone. It’s clear: Meme coins are no longer just a sideshow – they’re a main act. Keep an eye on this space and promising crypto projects , because the memes aren’t just surviving. They’re thriving.",Altcoin News|Altcoins|altcoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-29 22:17:48

What started as a meme in the crypto world has transformed into a multi-billion dollar phenomenon, drawing in investors from all walks of life. But let’s be real, some meme coins seem to be fading out, and others are absolutely blowing up. One of those “blowing up” coins right now is BTFD Coin . While SPX6900 may have had its moment, it’s clear that the ongoing viral meme coin presale of BTFD is making waves like no other. Now, why is BTFD Coin grabbing so much attention? Well, it’s not just your average meme coin. BTFD is bringing something new to the table, like its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, staking rewards, and a mind-blowing 90% APY on staking. All of these features are creating a perfect storm of hype and potential returns. As SPX6900 seems to have run out of steam, BTFD is clearly picking up the pace, and investors are already seeing gains. In this article, we’re going to take a deeper look at BTFD Coin and SPX6900, examining why the former is taking the meme coin world by storm and why the latter is starting to look like old news. BTFD Coin: Taking Meme Coins to the Next Level BTFD Coin is the meme coin everyone’s talking about, and if you haven’t been paying attention, now’s the time to start. The ongoing viral meme coin presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 60 billion coins to over 7000 holders. And guess what? The presale isn’t even close to being over yet. In fact, we’re only in Stage 13, and the price has already skyrocketed from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin. That’s a staggering increase, but analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 by the end of the presale. So, yeah, the hype is real. So what makes BTFD Coin so unique compared to other meme coins like SPX6900? It’s the complete ecosystem BTFD is building. First off, BTFD has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that went live in Stage 10 of the presale. Sure, the beta version of the game doesn’t offer rewards yet, but it’s already a glimpse of what’s coming. When the game is fully live, players will be able to earn rewards while having fun. It’s an innovative approach that’s bringing more utility to the meme coin space. But it doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin also offers a 90% APY on staking, which is a total game-changer. Staking went live on December 2, and now investors can put their BTFD coins to work and earn passive income. With staking offering a 90% APY, that means your BTFD holdings can grow significantly while you just sit back and watch it happen. No wonder the presale is so popular! Another attractive feature is the BTFD Coin referral program. This allows early investors to earn rewards for bringing new people into the community. It’s a win-win situation that’s helping to spread the word and bring even more attention to the project. And of course, there’s the Bulls Squad —a community of dedicated supporters who are given exclusive updates, rewards, and special access. This gives investors a sense of belonging and makes them feel like they’re part of something bigger. SPX6900: Is It Already Yesterday’s News? SPX6900 had its time in the spotlight, no doubt about it. But lately, it seems like the presale has lost steam. While meme coins like BTFD Coin are racing ahead with innovative features and an engaged community, SPX6900’s presale numbers just aren’t showing the same level of excitement. Sure, it still has some loyal followers, but it’s not drawing the kind of attention that BTFD is. Why is that? Well, the biggest issue here is that SPX6900 doesn’t seem to offer much in terms of long-term value or utility. While meme coins were originally created as jokes, BTFD Coin has taken things to the next level by building an ecosystem that goes beyond just being a meme. With features like the Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and referral programs, BTFD is creating a much more compelling reason for people to invest. SPX6900, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have the same kind of strategy for future growth. And without that, it’s starting to look like an old news story. When you compare the presale performance, it’s clear that SPX6900 is lagging behind. Investors are looking for projects with potential, and BTFD Coin is delivering on that front, while SPX6900 is left scrambling to keep up. In a world where investors are always searching for the next big thing, BTFD Coin has proven that it’s more than just hype—it’s a legitimate opportunity to make serious gains. While SPX6900 might have had its chance, it’s safe to say that its moment has passed. The Ongoing Viral Meme Coin Presale: Why BTFD Is the One to Watch So why is BTFD Coin’s ongoing viral meme coin presale such a big deal? It’s simple: the potential for massive gains. As mentioned, the presale price has already risen from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin, and analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 before the presale ends. With four stages still remaining, that’s a huge opportunity for anyone who’s looking to invest. Let’s break this down with an investment example. By investing $25,000 in BTFD coins during Stage 13 at the current price of $0.000142 per coin, you would receive approximately 176,056,338 coins. However, by applying the BIG50 bonus code, you’ll receive 50% more coins, bringing your total to 264,084,507 coins. When the presale concludes and the price increases to $0.0006 per coin, your investment without the BIG50 code would be worth around $105,633.80. With the BIG50 bonus, your investment would grow to a value of approximately $158,450.70, offering an additional $52,816.90 in potential earnings. This presents a great opportunity to enhance your investment as the presale progresses. But the real beauty of the BTFD Coin presale lies in its potential beyond the presale. With its Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY on staking , and referral program, the value of BTFD Coin is only going to increase as the project continues to grow. Analysts are predicting a bright future for BTFD, and early investors are already seeing the benefits. Now is the time to get in on this ongoing viral meme coin presale before it’s too late. BTFD Coin is moving fast, and with analysts predicting a surge in price, you’ll want to be on the winning side of this one. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the BTFD Coin Presale BTFD Coin is a meme coin with real potential, and the ongoing viral meme coin presale is the perfect opportunity to get in early. With features like a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and an engaging referral program, BTFD Coin is setting itself up for long-term success. Meanwhile, SPX6900 seems to be fading into the background, with its presale losing steam and investors looking elsewhere for the next big thing. If you want to be part of the next big wave in the meme coin space, now’s the time to act. With over $4.6 million raised in the presale and the price already on the rise, there’s no better time to jump in. Don’t let this opportunity slip away—join the BTFD Coin presale today and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity before it’s too late!

In recent years, we have seen huge attention from large corporations towards Bitcoin, the celebrated currency for years as decentralized and peer-to-peer. It was the currency’s ability to function outside of central banks, governments, and large financial institutions that attracted people toward Bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency owned and used by anyone anywhere in the world without the help of an intermediary. The increasing interest and participation of major corporations in the Bitcoin ecosystem raise concerns about its future in terms of decentralization and freedom. Rising corporate influence on Bitcoin Now, many giant corporations include Bitcoin on their balance sheets. According to CoinGecko companies like MicroStrategy hold over 444,262 Bitcoins, while Marathon Digital holds over 26,842. Marathon Digital is a Bitcoin mining company and owns 40,435 Bitcoins. Even Tesla holds 11,509 bitcoins. In addition, Galaxy Digital holding companies with over 15,449 Bitcoins, Coinbase holds over 9,183 Bitcoins, Bitcoin mining companies like CleanSpark hold around 6,154 Bitcoins, and Hut 8 also holds 9,102 Bitcoins and many more. This rising corporate involvement is an indicator of how Bitcoin is gaining importance in business strategies-whether as a store of value, hedge against inflation, or financial diversification tool. These companies can hold a big portion of the total supply since they acquire Bitcoin. For the simple fact that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, there’s the likelihood that a few companies own a large portion of Bitcoin that could significantly alter what the original intention of Bitcoin is-to be decentralized to everyone. Bitcoin becoming centralized This means that one of the most important concerns with this increase in corporate ownership is the potential centralization of Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Marathon Digital Holdings are buying ever more Bitcoin, and their reserves may eventually comprise a significant percentage of the overall supply. This may give these companies significant market power, which could lead to price manipulation and increased market volatility. If a few entities control large amounts of Bitcoin, they can buy or sell at will, which affects the price and causes fluctuations. Instead of Bitcoin as an open source currency that is free to be traded by any user and is almost a new tool for market control, it could be the means of giving power to a small group of corporate interests. Some corporations not only hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset but also engage actively in the mining process. Domination on Bitcoin mining It requires large quantities of cheap energy, the larger corporations can thus be able to invest heftily in mining, meaning they have the capacity of controlling a large proportion of the network’s mining power. This may have a result of centralization, which was initially what decentralization and accessibility aimed to achieve. The issue of mining centralization has been a long-term worry within the Bitcoin community. Early on, Bitcoin mining was an activity that someone with the right hardware could undertake. This, however, changed quite quickly as mining became challenging and its rewards attractive to professionalize the activity in question. Today, most mining is dominated by big companies that have the requisite resources to invest in more powerful, specialized equipment or secure cheap energy. Consequently, this centralization of power in mining leads to decisions that go into place on the Bitcoin network, as changes to protocol and even the general direction of future development. Staking may centralize Bitcoin control There are even more firms starting to participate in Bitcoin staking, even though Bitcoin does not use a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Some newer platforms support staking of users’ Bitcoin and reward the stakes held by users. If such services become more widespread and dominated by a few large corporate players, then centralization of control over the Bitcoin network will continue. This would allow these companies to decide how Bitcoin is used and to make money from the network, thereby having more control over the entire system. As more companies get involved, it becomes a serious concern for the future freedom of Bitcoin. Threat of Increased Regulatory Control This also increases the possibility of having greater regulatory pressure. Such enormous sums of Bitcoin held by corporations would mean an easy opportunity for governments to bring in strict regulations upon this asset. Such regulations could undermine the decentralized character of Bitcoin by forcing corporate holders to comply with state mandates in the form of KYC and AML requirements . This would make a scenario where Bitcoin is not an asset free from the governmental oversight but one with regulation, which may defeat the very core values for decentralization and freedom. The future of Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intertwined with the interests of large corporations. As the Bitcoin network keeps changing, so too will the community, regulators, and corporations realize that rising concentration of Bitcoin ownership means a lot to it. The potential for centralization, whether through corporate ownership or mining, could shift Bitcoin away from its original mission. If the power over Bitcoin remains in just a few people’s pockets, the dream of financial freedom might go down in flames. Therefore, continued decentralization must be addressed to maintain what Bitcoin was originally brought forth to become a resource for personal freedom and free access rather than corporative manipulation.

That’s a 50% increase from 2024, but still less than the roughly $30 billion “that was invested in 2021 and 2022,” he added. 2023 and 2024 recap Le described 2023 as a challenging year for crypto funding due to the collapse of FTX, erosion of trust, and higher interest rates. However, 2024 started strong with positive momentum driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs getting approved. Despite a slowdown mid-year, “we’re probably going to end [2024] at somewhere between $11 [billion] and $12 billion of invested capital, which is still 10 to 20% more than 2023,” he said. You might also like: Polymarket odds of Trump approving strategic Bitcoin reserves fall to 27% 2025 Funding Expectations Le’s projection of $18 billion or more in crypto VC funding is a 50% increase compared to 2024. Several factors bode well for the sector, he says. They include: Generalist investors are regaining interest, signaling potential large-scale investments. Crypto-native funds have significant dry powder but require generalist participation for substantial growth. Financial institutions will play a pivotal role by leveraging their trusted relationships with regulators. Shifting focus Le anticipates a shift in focus toward application-layer investments, moving beyond infrastructure projects. Examples include: Decentralized applications (dApps) targeting non-crypto users with better risk management. Use cases leveraging crypto infrastructure for non-crypto sectors such as mobility and energy data. The analogy of AWS serving as a base for companies like Uber and Airbnb highlights the need for robust applications atop crypto infrastructure to realize its full potential, Le argues. The benefit of ‘nothing’ Le emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry’s growth. He expressed cautious optimism about the U.S. regulatory environment in 2025, noting: A shift in SEC leadership under the incoming Trump administration could result in fewer enforcement actions. Legislative progress, such as stablecoin bills or crypto-specific rules, would be beneficial but is not guaranteed. Even a lack of new regulatory actions could be an improvement over the past two years of uncertainty. Le concluded that a stable regulatory environment, coupled with growing institutional involvement and application-focused investments, could set the stage for significant advancements in the crypto sector in 2025. But even if the next presidential administration and incoming lawmakers “do nothing,” Le says, “that is already an improvement.” For the full interview, see below.

In the midst of this evolving storyline, a disruptive entity, RCO Finance (RCOF), rises as a strong competitor, presenting a new take on decentralized finance (DeFi) through a combination of inventive features and progressive technology. Stellar Vs Ripple: Rivalry Intensifies As XLM Gears Up For Price Rally Recent examination by cryptocurrency specialist Ali Martinez reveals a positive signal for Stellar, suggesting a possible price turnaround after a significant correction driven by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The analyst recently pointed out that the Tom Demark (TD) sequential indicator has indicated a buy on XLM’s daily chart, implying that if the $0.33 support level remains intact, a price recovery could be forthcoming. At present, Stellar is priced at $0.37, slightly above this important level. Even with significant losses across different periods—4% in 24 hours, 8% in a week, and 23% in 14 days—Stellar continues to hold nearly 200% gains year-to-date. Conversely, Ripple’s XRP has shown greater strength, experiencing smaller declines of 2% and 4% during comparable times, while achieving an impressive monthly increase of roughly 60% that has brought one of the biggest altcoins in the market nearer to its all-time peaks. Although Stellar has lagged behind Ripple in recent months, the buy signal from the TD sequential indicator may create an opportunity for a comeback, enabling Stellar to narrow the gap with its rival. Moreover, market specialist CW has observed a bullish flag formation for Ripple’s competitor Stellar, predicting a possible target price of $0.82 after a breakout—close to its historical high of $0.87 achieved almost seven years prior. With the increasing positivity regarding Stellar and Ripple, RCO Finance is grabbing attention. Currently in its presale stage, RCO Finance has already secured close to $10 million, garnering interest for its unique strategy in DeFi. Now in the fourth phase of its presale, RCOF is set for considerable expansion, with estimates indicating a rise of almost 200%, anticipating the RCOF price to hit $0.214. So, what distinguishes RCO Finance from well-known entities such as Ripple and Stellar? AI Magic Unleashed To begin with, RCO Finance utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to offer an extensive range of financial products, making both traditional and decentralized finance accessible to all. The platform provides services like staking, yield farming, lending, and token swapping, all within a safe environment. A distinctive aspect of RCO Finance is its Robo Advisor powered by AI. This instrument functions as an automated investment manager, evaluating vast market information to provide customized investment strategies suited to each user’s financial objectives and risk preferences. Additionally, RCO Finance provides support for more than 120,000 digital assets spanning 12,500 asset classes, such as stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and derivatives. This wide access enables regular investors to diversify their portfolios, representing a major change from conventional models that frequently leave retail investors out of high-liquidity assets. RCO Finance’s Bullish Surge Post-Exchange Debut – Get Ready! RCO Finance also prioritizes user privacy by functioning on a Know-Your-Customer (KYC)-free platform, allowing for anonymous transactions. The governance framework promotes community involvement, enabling token holders to impact significant platform modifications and nurturing a feeling of ownership. As RCO Finance gets ready to debut on major exchanges, experts anticipate a spike in its price, possibly hitting between $0.40 and $0.50 soon after its launch. This offers a rare chance for initial investors to take advantage of the present positive market sentiment. Conclusion In summary, although Stellar and Ripple seek to strengthen their stance in the challenging blockchain payment landscape, RCO Finance is poised to challenge the existing norms with its groundbreaking solutions. With the market undergoing its bullish cycle led by Ripple and XRP’s performance, RCO Finance offers fascinating prospects for investors looking for expansion in the ever-changing realm of cryptocurrency.

According to the analyst, technical analysis of the XRP price on the weekly timeframe suggests that XRP is on track to reach a price target of $15 by May 5, 2025. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The analysis, which is rooted in Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave theory, offers a long-term bullish outlook for the altcoin despite its recent decline over the past week. This is because the XRP price has been on a decline since the past seven days alongside the rest of the crypto market. Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis For XRP According to Egrag Crypto, the Fibonacci 1.618 level indicates that May 5, 2025, could be a pivotal date for XRP’s price trajectory in the long term. His technical analysis uses auto-Fib time zones and trend-based Fibonacci on the weekly XRP timeframe price chart. Interestingly, this timeline aligns closely with the general sentiment surrounding XRP, as many crypto participants are currently looking forward to a surge in the first half of 2025. As such, the analyst also noted that it remains uncertain whether the predicted surge to $15 will occur before or after this predicted date. Speaking of price timeline, the $15 target is based on actual calculations and the Elliot Wave theory. According to the analyst, XRP is currently in Wave 4, which is the second corrective phase in the Elliot Wave theory. Once this phase is completed, Wave 5 is expected to be the next major move. Wave 5 is traditionally known for being the third impulse wave that pushes the asset’s price to new highs. To estimate the magnitude of Wave 5, the analyst examined the performance of the previous impulse waves 1 and 3. Notably, Waves 1 and 3 were highlighted by price increases of 63.39% and 570%, respectively. Using these figures, Egrag Crypto applied a common Elliott Wave principle that suggests Wave 5 often equals 61.8% of the combined gains of Waves 1 and 3. By applying this school of thought and punching in the numbers, Wave 5 is expected to result in an approximate price increase of around 391% for XRP. In terms of a price target, this translates to a price range around $15. Is A Long-Term Bullish Trajectory Still Valid For XRP? Despite XRP’s current decline over the past seven days, mirroring a broader market downturn, this technical analysis provides a counterpoint to the short-term bearish outlook. Particularly, XRP has been on a decline since it peaked at $2.82 on December 3. Related Reading: XRP Forms Bullish Flag Pattern: What’s Next For The Altcoin?

As of now, memecoins’ market capitalization stands at $98.72 billion, down 18% from its value at the start of December. Pepe and Exchange Listings Propel Early December Surge Pepe (PEPE), the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, mirrored the broader market’s fluctuations. According to Cointelegraph Markets Pro, Pepe’s price climbed to $0.000026 on Dec. 9 before dropping to $0.000017 by Dec. 20. On Dec. 4, Binance.US listed Pepe, driving the token to an all-time high and surpassing Uniswap’s token (UNI) in market capitalization by Dec. 7. Pepe’s market cap grew from $591 million at the start of 2024 to over $11 billion following the listing, representing an 18x increase. Coinbase also listed memecoins such as Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF) in December. Traders Profit Big from Pepe’s Rise Throughout 2024, savvy traders capitalized on Pepe’s meteoric rise. In April, a crypto trader who invested $3,000 in Pepe saw their holdings grow to $46 million within a month as the token surged over 15,000 times in value.

Classification of Crypto Set to Change in Japan? The FSA wrote that it wants to start considering cryptoassets as “financial assets” that “the general public can invest in.” Trading volumes on Japan’s bitFlyer crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Currently, Japanese law classifies cryptoassets as “payment instruments” under the terms of the Payment Services Act. The switch to a more “investment”-focused definition would represent something of a legitimization for crypto. But such a change would seemingly be dependant on the stability of the crypto industry. And while the document stops short of calling for crypto tax reform, CoinPost wrote that it suggests “a possibility” that Japan’s controversial crypto tax rules “will be reviewed.” Costly climate disasters created a crisis for Japan's insurance industry.

The move comes days after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) made similar claims in its own tax policy recommendations for FY2025. The LDP wants the crypto industry to incorporate “regulations on accountability and investor protection” that are “equivalent to those in place for stock investment in listed companies.” This would allow the law to start viewing “certain cryptoassets” as “financial products” commonly used in “the general public’s portfolios.” CoinPost wrote that the tone of the FSA’s document suggests that it is “endorsing [the LDP’s]” stance. The FSA, media outlets this year claimed, is readying a “fundamental review” of the way it regulates crypto. However, the FSA’s move appears to suggest it thinks the Payment Services Act offers insufficient protection to crypto investors. Inflation in Japan's capital accelerates, keeps rate hike prospects intact https://t.co/kPji7EHgz9 pic.twitter.com/cbDtZk2VdW — Reuters (@Reuters) December 27, 2024 Differing Views on Tax Reform There is another wrinkle for Japanese crypto traders. While the LDP appears keen to scrap Japan’s current crypto tax system, the FSA seems to have different ideas. Under the current system, crypto traders must declare their profits as “other income” on yearly tax declarations. That means high earners can pay up to 55% tax on their earnings. The LDP favors abolishing this system in favor of a capital gains tax on crypto earnings. The FSA, however, seems instead keen to place crypto “within a more comprehensive framework of income tax integration,” CoinPost explained. There does, though, appear to be a consensus about the need to change the legal classification of crypto in Japan. This is particularly relevant as Japanese companies like Metaplanet and Remixpoint begin to ramp up their Bitcoin-buying strategies.

It’s a massive financial revolution, flipping the script on traditional investments like stocks and real estate. Over the years, projects like Binance, Render, and now Qubetics presale have taken centre stage in the crypto world. These aren’t just coins; they’re powerful ecosystems reshaping how we think about wealth, investments, and financial freedom. Qubetics is the newest kid on the block, but don’t be fooled by its fresh face. With its staggering presale performance and jaw-dropping price predictions, it’s clear $TICS is here to disrupt the scene. Ready to deep-dive into why Qubetics, Binance, and Render are leading the charge as the best cryptos for exponential returns? Buckle up. Qubetics: Where Innovation Meets Investment Powerhouse Qubetics is more than just another coin in the crowded crypto market. It’s a future-forward blockchain project shaking up how people interact with digital assets. Since its launch, Qubetics has smashed milestone after milestone. In its 14th presale stage, over 385 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to 12,400+ holders, raising a whopping $8.1 million. The price of $TICS currently sits at $0.037, and it’s set to jump 10% this weekend—so you better act fast. But what really sets Qubetics apart? Its Multi-Chain Wallet. Imagine managing all your crypto assets—whether Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana—from a single, seamless interface. This is a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and anyone tired of juggling countless apps and wallets. For instance, a digital artist could accept payments on Ethereum for their NFTs, pay vendors using Binance Smart Chain, and stake Solana—all without switching platforms. It’s a dream come true for anyone navigating the fragmented crypto universe. Now, let’s talk about those wild predictions. Analysts are buzzing about $TICS hitting $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, it’s expected to jump to $1 (that’s 2820% ROI) and could skyrocket to $15 after the mainnet launch—an eye-popping 43711% ROI. To put this into perspective, a $1000 investment today could turn into $43,711. Mind-blowing, right? If you’re wondering what makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos for exponential returns, this is it. Binance: The Veteran Giant Still Making Waves Binance isn’t just a cryptocurrency exchange; it’s the backbone of the industry. Since its inception in 2017, Binance has become the largest and most trusted exchange worldwide, offering everything from spot trading to staking, NFTs, and even loans. What makes Binance so appealing to investors? It’s all about reliability and utility. BNB, Binance’s native token, has grown from a simple utility coin to one of the top-performing crypto assets. Take a step back and think about the last bull run. BNB started as a mere $0.10 token and surged past $600 at its peak. That’s a staggering 600,000% ROI. Binance’s continuous innovation, such as its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) and low trading fees, has kept its loyal user base hooked. And with its DeFi projects and growing influence in blockchain gaming, Binance continues to serve the appetite for crypto investments among newcomers and veterans alike. Investing in Binance is like investing in the backbone of the crypto market. It’s not just about buying into a token; it’s about owning a piece of a thriving ecosystem. And while Qubetics and Render are rising stars, Binance remains a go-to for anyone looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Render: Powering the Future of Digital Creation Render might not have the global fame of Binance, but among creators and tech enthusiasts, it’s a heavyweight. Render token (RNDR) serves a very niche but rapidly growing market: decentralised GPU rendering. In plain English? It’s about enabling creators to render their 3D content—think movies, games, and VR experiences—in a faster, cheaper, and decentralised way. Imagine a small indie game studio accessing the same rendering power as a billion-dollar company. That’s Render’s mission. Since its launch, Render has attracted a strong following among digital artists, studios, and developers. Its use case is crystal clear, and its growth potential is massive. Think about it: as metaverses and VR tech explode, the demand for rendering will hit the stratosphere. By holding RNDR tokens, investors are betting on the future of creative tech. Render’s tokenomics are another reason why it’s one of the best cryptos for exponential returns. RNDR’s capped supply and growing demand from its expanding user base create a perfect storm for price appreciation. Plus, it’s aligned with the shift toward eco-friendly blockchain solutions, making it even more appealing in a world focused on sustainability. Why Qubetics Is Stealing the Spotlight While Binance and Render are rock-solid projects, Qubetics is the rising star with unmatched potential. Its Multi-Chain Wallet is a standout feature, solving real-world problems for crypto users. Imagine a freelance graphic designer getting paid in Ethereum but needing to convert some funds to Solana for staking rewards. With Qubetics, that’s no hassle. Or picture a small business accepting payments in various cryptocurrencies without needing multiple wallets. That’s the kind of utility that’ll keep $TICS relevant for years to come. And then there’s the presale. With $8.1 million raised and over 12,400 holders already on board, the momentum is undeniable. At $0.037 per token, the entry point is still ridiculously attractive. But don’t sleep on it because prices will surge by 10% this weekend. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Cryptocurrency is all about timing. Whether you’re drawn to Binance’s legacy, Render’s innovative use case, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking features and potential for exponential returns, the key is to get in early. Analysts’ predictions for $TICS are nothing short of extraordinary. Investing $1000 today could change your financial future forever. Don’t wait. The Qubetics presale won’t last forever, and with each passing day, the price goes up. Secure your $TICS tokens now and be part of the next big thing in crypto. Visit the Qubetics website and join the revolution. It’s your move.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 23:33:00

BlockDAG Network launches its innovative $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, while Ethereum gears up for a potential surge to $12,000. Ethereum’s appeal grows with its scalability improvements and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), while BlockDAG captures the spotlight by mixing crypto bonuses with enticing raffle wins. BlockDAG’s strong presale performance coupled with solid buyer trust provides immediate opportunities and hints at long-term growth. Meanwhile, excitement builds around XRP, forecasting a promising 2025 as BlockDAG’s expanding influence makes it a standout choice for crypto explorers. Usher in 2025 with a Million-Dollar Celebration What better way to greet 2025 than with BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle? This isn’t just a lottery—it’s a festive toast to the new year, offering participants a shot at a life-altering $1 million USDT. BlockDAG makes participation a breeze with three ticket tiers suited to different budgets. The Bronze Ticket, at an accessible 125 USDT, could net you as much as $250,000 USDT. To boost your chances, consider the Silver Ticket at 250 USDT, balancing cost with potential returns. For those dreaming big, the Gold Ticket at 500 USDT offers the best shot at the $1M USDT jackpot, plus a 200% bonus in BDAG coins.

BlockDAG’s journey in the crypto market has been noteworthy, with presale batch 26 amassing $173.5 million and selling over 17.5 billion BDAG coins—a stunning 2240% growth since its inception. Ethereum’s Price Ascent: Analysts Eye $12,000 Target Ethereum is on the cusp of a significant rise, with predictions aiming for $12,000 in the coming market cycle. This optimism is fueled by Ethereum’s continued tech advancements, especially sharding, which aims to boost network efficiency and speed by splitting the blockchain into smaller segments. Additionally, Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are reducing network congestion and lowering costs, enhancing Ethereum’s allure. As Ethereum solidifies its lead with growing DeFi and NFT adoption, it must navigate challenges like emerging competitors and potential regulatory changes. XRP’s Price Forecast for 2025: Valuing 1,000 Tokens Anticipation for XRP’s 2025 price is high, spurred by Ripple’s growing adoption and impressive market performance last year. With its price around $3, XRP’s value has nearly quintupled in 2024. Analysts are optimistic, predicting a rise to $5–$7 by mid-2025, potentially boosting the value of 1,000 XRP tokens to $5,000–$7,000. However, the volatile nature of the crypto market calls for cautious optimism. Factors like global regulatory changes and Ripple’s strategies will heavily influence XRP’s trajectory, though its role in cross-border payments and possible integration with central bank digital currencies strengthen its long-term viability. Final Thoughts As 2025 dawns, the crypto sector brims with both potential profits and exciting prospects. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle offers both immediate gratification and the potential for crypto growth, making it one of the best crypto projects for all participants. With Ethereum’s technological strides and XRP’s promising price outlook, the diverse paths of cryptocurrencies are poised to influence the future financial landscape.

In 2025, Nvidia will face increased competition from AMD, Intel, and tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, who are developing their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia’s products. Nvidia has had a great year in 2024. The ranking has placed the company, without a doubt, at the top of the artificial intelligence market. Innovative AI technologies and strategic investments in cutting-edge hardware have fast-tracked this event’s share price and revenue. Nvidia’s 2024 Dominance NVIDIA became the most valuable publicly traded company worldwide by breaking past Apple and crossing $3 trillion. Jensen Huang, CEO took over this company and steered its growth to the maximum that has ever happened. Nvidia products underpin most AI innovation across industries. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, designed explicitly for AI applications, will drive the market in 2025, however, this success does not predict an easy future for the company. Nvidia’s fortune can be traced primarily to its early investments in AI software and hardware. Its CUDA software helps developers build applications for chips made by Nvidia. Hyperscalers—which include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta in the massive cloud computing providers crowd rely on Nvidia for the powerful GPUs that are used for AI model training. The company’s business with data centres generated 87% of revenues during the most recent quarter, one major area driving the firm financially. Currently, Nvidia remains at the head of the AI band, and chips from Blackwell are in very high demand. This is further attested to by customers such as Amazon, who already have the data centres readied in preparation for the immense amount of power and heat expected from the new processors being developed. This signifies how Nvidia is crucial in this AI revolution. 2025 Challenges But, by 2025, challenges are coming up rapidly against Nvidia’s leadership position. AMD and Intel, in particular, continue developing their AI-centric chips; AMD seems better suited than any competitor to cut into Nvidia’s lead in a big way. MI300X from AMD can be directly positioned as the H100 Hopper Nvidia develops. At this time, Intel is still unable to regain its ground, and AMD’s products are much more competitive. Further advanced software development could make its chips more appealing to developers and cloud providers. But now, another emerging risk is the danger of its customers starting to build AI chips themselves. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have started designing their semiconductors, reducing dependence on those semiconductors that would be required from Nvidia. While these companies still have to purchase chips from Nvidia, this would progressively reduce Nvidia’s share of the market in the future. Further, the shift to inferencing by AI models, which involves putting AI models into actual operating environments, may help lower the need for powerhouse chips like the one for which Nvidia is famous because inferencing requires very little computation to perform what’s needed compared to training. Despite all these potential risks, Nvidia is well positioned to remain the AI powerhouse in 2025, having caught the imagination and interest of innovators. Nvidia remains the default choice of chips in training large-scale AI models Traditional chipmakers like AMD and Intel, as well as the customers interested in their own AI solutions, will begin to throw corporate weight behind Nvidia, demanding serious intervention from the company’s management. 2025 is going to be difficult for them.

TRX fell from a high of $0.4506 on December 4 to a low of $0.2600, a 42% decline. So, what’s next for Tron as it flips Ethereum in terms of the fee collected? Tron network is making more money than Ethereum Ethereum has been the most profitable blockchain network in the past few years, thanks to its higher fees and activity on the platform. It remains the most popular blockchain network today, with a substantial market share against most chains. For example, Ethereum’s blockchain has a total value locked (TVL) of over $68 billion and bridged volume of near $200 billion It also has over $111 billion in stablecoins in its ecosystem. In contrast, Justin Sun’s Tron has a TVL of $7.4 billion, bridged value od $68 billion, and $60 billion in stablecoins. It has just 34 DeFi apps in its ecosystem, while Ethereum has over 1,263 of them. Still, Tron is now making more money than Ethereum. According to TokenTerminal, Tron has made over $1.3 billion in fees in the last 180 days, higher than Ethereum’s $800 million. The same trend happened in the last 30 days as the two made $333 million and $217 million, respectively. These numbers mean that the Tron network is seeing more transactions and collecting more money. If the trend continues, its annual fees in 2025 could be higher than Ethereum’s. Ethereum has made over $2.46 billion in the last 365 days compared to Tron’s $2.12 billion. Tron’s rising fees is likely because of the SunPump ecosystem that led to more activity in the network. SunPump is a rival to Solana’s Pump.fun in that it helps users create meme coins within minutes. SunPump’s ecosystem started well and gained thousands of meme coins within days. Recently, however, there are signs that the network has lost steam as the market cap of all of its tokens has dropped from over $700 million a few months ago to $144 million today. The biggest of these tokens are Sundog, Tron Bull, Tron Bull Coin, Suncat, and SunWukong. The rising Tron fees mean that its stakers are making substantial returns. Tron has a staking market cap of over $10 billion , giving it a staking ratio of 46%. Its staking yield has moved to 4.65%, higher than Ethereum’s 3.03%. Tron price analysis TRX price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the TRX price has moved into a deep bear market after falling by over 42% from its highest level this year. Still, TRX remains above the 50-day moving average, a sign that it has the potential to rebound. It is also a sign that it is doing mean reversion, where an asset returns to its normal average after soaring hard. Tron has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects its lowest swings since June this year. It has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular reversal sign. Therefore, the TRX price will likely bounce back, and hit its all-time high of $0.4506, its highest level this year, which is about 73% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.2232 will invalidate the bullish view.

CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-as-a-strategic-asset-cryptoquant-ceo-questions-uss-next-move/,"Since President-elect Donald Trump raised the possibility of establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, many advocates have pushed for the creation of the crypto stockpile, saying that it would make the country as the leader in the global cryptocurrency landscape. However, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced of the feasibility of the crypto reserve. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju is pessimistic that the prospect of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would get an approval from the incoming administration. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350K? Kiyosaki Stands Firm Amid BlackRock ETF Drama BTC Reserve Doubtful Young Ju is not convinced that the proposed Bitcoin reserve would push through, saying it is unlikely that Trump would embrace the crypto strategy to protect US dollar dominance because the greenback remains a safe haven currency. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction. In the late 1990s, Peter Schiff championed gold as the true form of money, much like today’s… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 28, 2024 The executive of CryptoQuant thinks that the policies of the new government would be much influenced by the apparent strength of the US economy and the predominance of the American currency in international trade. Young Ju said that if there is a perceived threat to the US economic hegemony, gold, Bitcoin or any other store-of-value assets would experience a surge in its price. US Economy Still Dominates Young Ju argued that there is no perceived threat to American dominance since many investors still have great confidence in the US economy or the US dollar. “I personally support the idea of #Bitcoin Standard. However, I question whether the US, while continuing to grow as other economies stagnate, would adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset,” he said in a post. The crypto executive believes the debate on the Bitcoin reserve would only gain serious momentum if the country’s global economic dominance is “genuinely threatened,” adding, “At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the US’ continued supremacy.” The US processed 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin in 2022, making it the leader in crypto mining, according to government data. Crypto Stance Could Shift Young Ju said that it is possible that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may take an unexpected turn depending on the broader political landscape. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing US economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he explained in a post. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The CryptoQuant CEO suggested that more likely, Trump would “step back from his Bitcoin advocacy,” pointing out that he might cite that there has been a change in priorities, “without alienating his voter base.” “At the BTC Conference, was his mention of Bitcoin as a strategic asset a genuine step toward preparing for a Bitcoin Standard, or merely a calculated move to secure votes?” he said. For the crypto executive, it is still unsure which of Trump’s “campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin” will be fulfilled.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains.

This Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which has largely paid off, has continued up until now. According to recent data, El Salvador has now crossed the 6,000 BTC threshold. This makes El Salvador the sixth country behind the likes of the US, the UK, and Bhutan to hold 6,000 BTC or more. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy Reaches New Milestone Unlike countries like the US and the UK, whose Bitcoin holdings are from seized assets from criminals, El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have been through consistent purchases. Notably, El Salvador’s deliberate and consistent approach to building a Bitcoin reserve has been a cornerstone of President Bukele’s vision to establish the small Central American country as a leader in the crypto industry. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ending 2024 On A High Note? Analysts Say This Level Is Key According to data from the official website of El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio tracker, the country added another BTC to its reserve in the past 24 hours. This BTC was acquired at $94,702 and essentially pushed the total holdings to 6,000.77 BTC. Interestingly, a detailed look at the data shows that El Salvador has purchased around 50 more BTC since the beginning of December. This growth has mostly been consistent with 1 BTC purchased each day, except for December 20 and December 22, which were highlighted by purchases of 11 BTC. At the time of writing, El Salvador’s Bitcoin stash is worth a little over $570 million. This value has grown massively in the past three months and could grow more in 2025. Particularly, El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio reached a peak value of $643 million on December 17 when the Bitcoin price peaked at $108,135. Image from bitcoin.gob.sv Outlook For El Salvador’s Bitcoin Stash Despite initial skepticism from international organizations and financial experts, this strategy appears to have yielded positive results over time, largely due to Bitcoin’s price surge this year. According to data from nayibtracker.com, El Salvador is currently sitting on $157 million in profit from its Bitcoin purchases, having bought its 6,000 BTC at an average price of $45,465. El Salvador’s first Bitcoin purchase was made in September 2021 and is currently showing no signs of stopping soon. However, the country did reach an agreement recently with the IMF to scale back its Bitcoin purchase trends in order to be able to secure funding. Although this agreement was made on December 18, El Salvador doubled down and bought 11 more BTC just days later.

Simultaneously, SUI has notched a new all-time high (ATH) of $2.37, underpinned by a surge in trading volume that signals robust investor enthusiasm. Parallel to these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is pioneering a shift in online shopping by deploying Web3 technologies within a decentralized marketplace powered by its 3BAY token. With an introductory presale price of just $0.003, Web3Bay offers an inviting 6430% ROI potential, crafting a not-to-be-missed chance for early adopters keen on championing this trailblazing project. ETC Price Prediction: Analyst Foresees Growth Leading analyst Alan Santana has projected a robust outlook for Ethereum Classic (ETC), emphasizing its longest accumulation period since January 2022, which could mirror the phenomenal 5,700% value surge seen during the 2018–2021 bull cycle. While current predictions suggest gains between 1,300% to 2,150% from its June 2022 lows, such a prolonged buildup sets the stage for potentially explosive growth under the right market conditions. SUI Achieves a Milestone with Unprecedented Trading Volumes SUI has reached an exhilarating new high at $2.37, propelled by a groundbreaking $2 billion trading volume that indicates intense market interest. Recorded on November 6, this spike in activity, with a slight preference for long positions as per Coinglass data (Long/Short ratio of 1.09), points to strong investor confidence. Although there’s potential for further ascent, possibly touching $3, the market also braces for possible pullbacks that could recalibrate the price closer to $1.93. This ATH underscores SUI’s dynamic market trajectory and investor optimism. 3BAY Token: Fueling the First Decentralized Marketplace At the core of Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace, the 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also embeds governance rights for its holders, empowering them to directly influence the platform’s future. This token is a testament to Web3Bay’s commitment to user empowerment and transparency, turning every transaction into a step towards democratizing e-commerce. Web3Bay redefines online shopping with its decentralized platform, where users retain complete data ownership and enjoy lower transaction fees. Enhanced with IPFS technology for decentralized storage and cross-chain compatibility, Web3Bay addresses prevalent e-commerce challenges such as data security and transparency, while offering a worldwide, open transactional environment. The 3BAY token presale offers an unparalleled starting point at just $0.003. Early investors not only secure a cost advantage but also join an innovative endeavor set to redefine e-commerce by prioritizing user control. With its distinct features and promising growth trajectory, the presale phase of Web3Bay provides a rare opportunity to support a pioneering platform set to transform the online shopping landscape. This chance for early involvement invites those eager to engage in a groundbreaking venture with substantial return potential. In Summary As the market watches Ethereum Classic (ETC) for signs of its anticipated bull run and SUI continues to build momentum following its ATH, Web3Bay stands out with a unique proposition. Integrating Web3 into e-commerce, Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace offers users unprecedented control over their data and transactions. With the 3BAY token priced attractively during the presale, early backers are well-positioned to be part of a venture that’s set to revolutionize online shopping, offering an impressive potential ROI of 6430%.

Dogecoin price remains in the spotlight due to its market buzz, while Shiba Inu faces crucial backing issues. On the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a well-organized and beneficial setup for its users. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle not only offers significant cash prizes but also bolsters participants’ crypto holdings with substantial BDAG bonuses, providing real value apart from the raffle itself. In contrast to the unstable conditions of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BlockDAG demonstrates steady expansion and growing confidence, making a strong argument for its sustainable approach. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle Offers Cash Prizes + Crypto Bonuses! BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle is more than an opportunity to win a considerable cash prize—it also rewards participants with valuable crypto bonuses. This dual benefit ensures that each participant gains more than their initial involvement, no matter the raffle’s result. Specifically, each ticket purchased comes with a 200% bonus in BDAG coins, BlockDAG’s native coin. For example, a Bronze Ticket at 125 USDT not only qualifies buyers for a drawing with a top prize of $250,000 USDT but also triples their BDAG coin balance. Moreover, Silver and Gold tickets, costing 250 USDT and 500 USDT respectively, escalate not only buyer’s prize chances but also their BDAG coin quantity, with the Gold Ticket offering the highest likelihood of winning the $1M USDT top prize. Thus, this raffle extends beyond mere luck; it’s a chance to boost participant’s crypto collection. Furthermore, the BDAG bonuses empower participants to deepen their involvement in the BlockDAG network, making the tickets a wise decision for those aiming to increase their holdings. The additional crypto incentives also introduce a thrilling element of strategy, enhancing the overall raffle experience. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to impress in the crypto market. Now in its 26th presale batch, the initiative has secured $173 million from over 17.5 billion sold BDAG coins. Notably, with the coin price currently at $0.0234, marking a 2240% rise since the initial batch, the growing demand and strong confidence are evident. Surge in Dogecoin Price: 90M DOGE Swapped in Two Days Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently seen a notable increase in activity, with its price soaring as 90 million DOGE changed hands over a span of just 48 hours. This significant trading volume highlights Dogecoin’s escalating appeal and the growing enthusiasm around it from both casual and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Additionally, this surge in trading activity has led to a notable rise in Dogecoin’s market value, further cementing its status in the crypto arena. Analysts believe this uptrend results from wider acceptance, high-profile endorsements, and an overall positive outlook in the crypto environment. Shiba Inu Encounters Key Price Support Test Shiba Inu (SHIB), the well-known meme-based cryptocurrency, finds itself in a delicate position as it attempts to hold onto a critical price threshold. Market data shows that around 16 trillion SHIB tokens are under threat, which could have serious repercussions for the market. This scenario has led to a marked decrease in SHIB’s value, penetrating key price floors that once provided stability. This downturn has sparked worry within the SHIB community and among market analysts, as the absence of solid support could lead to further declines in value. Market sentiment is crucial in these situations. While current negative trends might provoke quick sell-offs, exacerbating the price drop, positive changes within the Shiba Inu framework might rebuild trust and help stabilize its market position. Final Verdict In a market rapidly swinging with unpredictable patterns, BlockDAG introduces a refreshing strategy by blending real rewards with prospects for sustained growth. While Dogecoin Price surges and Shiba Inu’s support issues underscore the crypto market’s instability, BlockDAG’s planned initiatives, like the $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, demonstrate a more stable approach.

For seasoned investors and first-timers alike, figuring out which digital assets to add to your portfolio can feel like a guessing game. But with December 2024 upon us, it’s time to narrow down the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. If you’re hunting for high-growth potential and reliable market positions, Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Avalanche have become go-to names for investors worldwide. While Bitcoin has long been the king of crypto and Avalanche has built a reputation for its high-speed blockchain network, Qubetics is making headlines with its presale success and cutting-edge innovation. This article breaks down what makes these projects shine, focusing on their milestones, market position, and unique value propositions for investors today. Let’s dive in. Qubetics: The Rising Star of 2024 Qubetics is the latest crypto buzz, and for good reason. This up-and-coming project is in its 14th presale stage, already raking in over $8.1 million. Over 12,400 token holders have snapped up more than 385 million $TICS tokens, showing the undeniable appetite for what this project brings to the table. Currently priced at just $0.037 per token, $TICS is positioned for an imminent 10% price jump by the weekend—an enticing opportunity for investors who know timing is everything. So, what’s driving all this excitement? At its core, Qubetics offers QUBEQODE IDE, an intuitive ecosystem that’s revolutionising workflows for businesses, professionals, and even freelancers. Picture this: A small business uses QUBEQODE IDE to automate inventory tracking, saving hours of manual labour. Or think of a freelance designer seamlessly integrating client feedback into their workflow using this dynamic tool. Whether you’re an entrepreneur or a digital nomad, QUBEQODE IDE makes life easier—and that’s not just a buzzword. Analysts are buzzing with optimistic predictions for $TICS. By the presale’s end, the token is expected to hit $0.25, offering a staggering 630% ROI. The real fireworks, however, come after the presale, with projections of $1 per token for a 2,820% ROI and even $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 43,711% ROI. Think about this: investing $100 in $TICS today could potentially grow to $43,711 in just a few years. With its innovative tech and proven presale momentum, Qubetics isn’t just a rising star; it’s poised to be a game-changer. But don’t wait too long—the 13th stage price won’t last forever. Bitcoin: The Resilient Titan Bitcoin—the OG of cryptocurrency. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has solidified its position as the market’s gold standard. Over the years, it’s served as a hedge against inflation, a decentralised alternative to traditional banking, and a digital asset with sky-high growth potential. Despite market fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to hold its crown as the top crypto by market capitalisation, and it remains one of the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Why is Bitcoin still a go-to for investors? Its simplicity and scarcity are part of its charm. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to exist, this digital asset is the definition of “digital gold.” When economic uncertainty looms, institutional and retail investors alike flock to Bitcoin, driving its price up. Just look at the past decade: Bitcoin’s price climbed from a mere few cents to its current value in the tens of thousands. Even now, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market makes it a reliable store of value. Imagine holding Bitcoin during a bearish market; while altcoins dip, Bitcoin’s resilience often provides a buffer. Many North Americans see Bitcoin as the ultimate crypto starter pack—it’s safe, it’s predictable, and it’s still packed with upside potential. Whether you’re a first-time investor or a seasoned trader, Bitcoin has proven time and again why it deserves a spot in your portfolio. Avalanche: Speed Meets Scalability Then there’s Avalanche, the speedster of the crypto world. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and ultra-low fees, Avalanche has carved out a unique niche in the blockchain landscape. In 2024, this project has cemented its reputation as a powerhouse for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. It’s no wonder Avalanche has become one of the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Avalanche’s claim to fame lies in its ability to process up to 4,500 transactions per second (TPS). Compare that to Ethereum’s 15-30 TPS, and it’s clear why developers and users are flocking to this platform. Avalanche’s subnets allow developers to create custom blockchains tailored to specific needs, making it a favourite among businesses and institutions looking to leverage blockchain tech without the bottlenecks. Picture this: A gaming company uses Avalanche to power its in-game economy, ensuring players can trade assets seamlessly without delays. Or consider a DeFi project that launches on Avalanche, taking advantage of its low fees to attract users fed up with Ethereum’s gas prices. These real-world use cases highlight why Avalanche is more than just a fast blockchain; it’s a practical solution for today’s blockchain challenges. As Avalanche’s ecosystem grows, so does its market value. Analysts predict steady price appreciation for AVAX, making it a smart play for both short-term gains and long-term holds. If you’re looking for a crypto project with cutting-edge technology and real-world utility, Avalanche delivers on both fronts. Conclusion: Make Your Move Before It’s Too Late The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities, but timing is everything. Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Avalanche each offer unique value propositions that cater to different types of investors. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ presale buzz, Bitcoin’s time-tested resilience, or Avalanche’s high-speed innovation, these projects are undoubtedly the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Don’t miss your chance to get in on the Qubetics presale while $TICS is still priced at $0.037. With price predictions reaching $15 post-mainnet launch, the potential returns are too good to ignore. Head over to Qubetics’ presale page today and grab your $TICS tokens before the weekend price hike. In the world of crypto, fortune favours the bold. So, what’s it gonna be?

The presale has already raised over $8.1 million, with 385 million tokens sold to more than 12,400 holders. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.0377, and this will increase by 10% come the 15th stage. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this groundbreaking project before it takes off. 2. Monero (XMR): The Ultimate Privacy Coin Monero (XMR) is one of the most recognised privacy-focused cryptocurrencies in the market. Since its launch, Monero has been committed to providing users with untraceable transactions, making it a standout choice for those seeking privacy in a world where digital surveillance is becoming more common. Its unique ring signature and stealth address technologies make it the best coin to buy this weekend for privacy-conscious investors. Latest Developments Around Monero Recently, Monero’s network has seen several improvements, including enhanced privacy features and increased scalability. The Monero community continues to innovate, with regular updates to its protocol to ensure that privacy remains its top priority. In a time when many other cryptocurrencies are struggling with privacy concerns, Monero’s commitment to keeping transactions private is resonating with users worldwide. Furthermore, as regulators continue to crack down on cryptocurrencies, Monero remains one of the few truly decentralised, privacy-oriented coins that can bypass government interference, making it a valuable asset in regions where financial privacy is under threat. Why Did This Coin Make it to This List? Monero makes it to the list because it offers a level of privacy that few other coins can match. As privacy becomes a bigger concern in the crypto world, Monero’s reputation as the go-to privacy coin ensures it remains a strong investment choice. 3. Kaspa (KAS): Speed and Efficiency on a Whole New Level Kaspa (KAS) has been making a name for itself with its incredibly fast and scalable blockchain. Built on a blockDAG structure, Kaspa is designed to process thousands of transactions per second (TPS), solving the scalability issue that many blockchains face. This speed and efficiency make Kaspa one of the best coins to buy this weekend, especially for those looking to diversify their portfolio with a project that focuses on high performance.

Latest Developments Around Polkadot Polkadot’s parachain auctions have continued to drive growth, bringing more projects into the Polkadot ecosystem. These parachains allow various projects to run their own blockchains while still benefiting from Polkadot’s security and interoperability. Recently, Polkadot has also seen growth in its Substrate framework, which allows developers to create their own blockchains with ease, further bolstering its position in the blockchain space.

BTC is back below $94,500 and might revisit the $91,200 support zone. Bitcoin started a fresh decline from the $96,500 zone. The price is trading below $95,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $94,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $92,500 support zone. Bitcoin Price Dips Again Bitcoin price started a decent upward move above the $93,500 resistance zone . BTC was able to climb above the $94,200 and $94,500 resistance levels. The pair cleared the $95,000 resistance level but upsides were limited. The price started another decline and traded below the $93,500 level. A low was formed at $92,950 and the price is now consolidating losses. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $94,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $97,308 swing high to the $92,950 low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $95,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $94,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $95,000 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $97,308 swing high to the $92,950 low. A clear move above the $95,000 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $95,500. A close above the $95,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $96,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $98,000 level. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $94,500 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $93,500 level. The first major support is near the $92,800 level. The next support is now near the $92,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $91,200 support in the near term.

Among the top contenders, Lightchain AI is generating buzz not only for its decentralized AI ecosystem but also for its highly anticipated Lightchain AI Presale , a major opportunity for early investors. Alongside Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), Lightchain AI is leading discussions in the industry. From cutting-edge AI integration to high-speed blockchain innovations, these projects are poised to transform the market. In this article, we explore the unique strengths of these altcoins and evaluate their potential to dominate the blockchain space in the coming year. We also take a deep dive into the Lightchain AI Presale and what it could mean for its future success. 3 Top Contenders for the Next Blockchain Titan The Rise of Solana (SOL) Starting off as an Ethereum competitor, SOL quickly carved its own path with blazing-fast transaction speeds. Its unique Proof-of-History consensus algorithm enables confirmation times of less than a second, making it one of the fastest blockchain networks in existence. This, coupled with low fees and high scalability, has attracted major partnerships like Chainlink and Serum to build on the platform. Looking ahead, SOL is poised to further expand its ecosystem by launching its cross-chain bridge Wormhole and integrating Layer 2 solution Matic Network. As more projects flock to SOL for its speedy and efficient network, it could easily cement itself as a top player in the industry. Avalanche (AVAX) and Its Multi-Chain Approach Avalanche takes a different approach to scalability with its multi-chain architecture. By using subnets, AVAX has the potential to process 4,500 transactions per second, making it one of the most scalable blockchain networks. Additionally, its unique governance structure allows for quick decision-making and implementation of upgrades.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 03:04:00

BTC Price Faces Key Resistance at $97,300 Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed Bitcoin stuck in a tight range over the weekend after experiencing volatility during the final Wall Street trading session of the week. With BTC/USD providing little bullish momentum, order book analysis left market observers cautious. Material Indicators highlighted red flags on its trading tools, stating: “FireCharts shows a new $86M bid ladder is pushing BTC price up from the lows, but a new (red) signal from the Trend Precognition A1 algo on the D chart… indicates that price isn’t likely to climb higher than yesterday’s high, at least not before today’s D candle close.” It added, “A push above $97.3k would invalidate the new signal.” Meanwhile, trader Skew noted shifting buy liquidity on Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, potentially signaling upside if the bids remain. “I have been watching these limit bids throughout today, which have conveniently just moved higher towards price,” Skew commented, adding, “Often a signal for what’s to come as large market entities attempt to influence/control price.” Q4 Performance Holds Strong for Bitcoin Bitcoin remained down just 1.25% for December at $95,000 but retained a Q4 upside of over 50%, nearly matching its performance in 2023, according to CoinGlass data.

At present, there’s no indication of a strong trend or reversal, leaving the market in a state of indecision. XRP is moving within a possible triangle pattern , but it’s still uncertain if this will resolve in an upward or downward breakout. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.10. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP Bitcoin’s recent decline suggests further downside could be in store for altcoins, including XRP. However, XRP is currently sitting at a micro support zone between $2.04 and $2.21. This level is providing some support, but it’s not strong enough to confirm a reversal or significant price action. Price Targets and Key Levels If XRP continues to consolidate, the price may aim for a higher level within the range, potentially reaching around $2.50. However, there’s no clear hint yet that a price surge is coming. If the price breaks below the $2.04 support level, this could signal a deeper decline, with the next potential support area lying around $1.8. Blue Scenario: Deeper Decline If XRP drops below $2.04, the likelihood of a more significant price correction increases. In this case, the next support levels to watch would be $1.8, $1.63, and $1.53. A further drop could see price levels approaching $1.36–$1.39, where a stronger buying response might be seen. Coinpedia Analysis (Short Term): XRP’s price is currently facing resistance at key levels, $2.2857 and $2.2821, suggesting strong overhead pressure. Additional resistance is found at $2.2442 and $2.2131, with a potential retracement seen at the 38.2% level from the 4-week low, which is near $2.1807. The Pivot Point is set at $2.1648, while the previous close stands at $2.1441, and the last price is at $2.1037, indicating bearish sentiment in the market. At this point, the outlook for XRP is cautiously neutral. If the price holds above $2.0958, it may attempt a move towards higher resistance levels. However, if the price breaks below $2.0707, it could face further declines, with the next key support area near $2.0475.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 03:56:36

In his regular style, the Bitcoin ambassador always posts the same chart on Sunday before making a Bitcoin purchase on Monday. The tech entrepreneur has made a pattern on his X account where he makes a post to nearly his 4 million followers on Sundays. The post normally elicits reactions from market participants anticipating a move from MicroStrategy the following day. Disconcerting blue lines on https://t.co/Bx3917zMqi . pic.twitter.com/xPl4GTKU3E — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 29, 2024 The company’s recent Bitcoin purchase occurred on December 22. MicroStrategy bought 5,200 Bitcoins at an average cost of $106,000 per coin. Though significant, this latest acquisition is MicroStrategy’s smallest since July 2024. Saylor has always said they will continue purchasing Bitcoin regardless of the price. Currently, it appears like a leveraged BTC bet that is also closely tied to the overall health of the digital asset. MicroStrategy increases efforts on Bitcoin acquisition MicroStrategy is not planning to slow down on its Bitcoin acquisition plan. The company called a strategic meeting with Shareholders in December to acquire extra resources for Bitcoin purchases as part of its 21/21 plan by increasing the number of shares to shareholders. The 21/21 strategic plan directs the firm to raise $42 billion in the next three years, $21 billion in equity offerings, and $21 billion in fixed-income corporate securities to help purchase more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Bitcoin reserves hold a total of 444,262 BTC , with a market value of about $41.64 Billion. The company has the largest ownership of Bitcoin by a single entity. Saylor proposed a digital asset framework for the United States Recently, the crypto ambassador proposed a digital asset framework for the world’s most powerful economy. The framework included the Bitcoin strategic reserve, which has the potential to offset the US national debt due to its ability to offer up to $81 trillion in asset wealth. According to the MicroStrategy co-founder’s plan, the US dollar can maintain its position as the global reserve currency by growing the market capitalization of the digital asset sector to $10 trillion. He believes that growth in the digital market will propel the demand for the US dollar and the securities that back overcollateralized stablecoins like Tether’s USDt.

Altcoins also continued to face declines, reflecting a bearish trend across the crypto market. Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, may face removal from European exchanges due to non-compliance with new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations. The compliance deadline of December 30, 2024, has raised uncertainty among market participants. FTX Token (FTT) emerged as a top gainer today, with a 7% surge in its price. This development follows FTX’s announcement that claims processing will begin on January 3 next year, with $16 billion in cash expected to be repaid. The global crypto market has declined by approximately 1.5% over the last 24 hours, standing at $3.29 trillion. However, trading volume saw a 12% rise, reaching $90 billion. Here’s a brief overview of some leading cryptocurrencies by market cap and their crypto prices today, December 30. Crypto Prices Today: BTC Falls Below $94K, XRP, and SOL Drop Amid Market Pressure Crypto prices today saw Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $94,000, marking a sharp decline.

ETH ETFs saw a weekly inflow of $349 million, second only to BTC ETFs. However, concerns loom as Coingape analysts warn of a potential $2,600 crash. This follows a massive inflow of 110K ETH into exchanges, signaling possible sell pressure. XRP Price Today XRP price was trading at $2.12, marking an approximate 3% drop in the last 24 hours.

Recent data from DeFiLlama revealed that its total value locked (TVL) now stands at an all-time high of $8.217 billion, with a $1 billion spike coming within the last seven days alone. Major Players Fueling Growth Market leaders such as stablecoin issuer Usual and decentralized finance (DeFi) investment management platform Hashnote are at the forefront of this explosive growth. Numbers from DeFiLlama indicate that Hashnote saw a weekly increase of 65.58%, while Usual recorded a slightly higher growth of 65.65%. The former boasts a TVL of $1.497 billion, while the latter’s rose to $1.445 billion. Over 30 days, the metric skyrocketed 230% for Usual, while Hashnote’s kept pace at 217%. Together, the two contributed to more than 35% of the value of assets locked in the RWA sector. Usual’s strong performance comes on the back of raising $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Binance Labs and Kraken Ventures. It also recently saw the price of its governance token hit a new all-time high following claims that hackers compromised the X account of Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy and used it to publicize a fake partnership between the U.S. government and the stablecoin project. Away from the top two, green candles were also witnessed on platforms such as Nest Staking, MatrixDock, Franklin Templeton, and Ethena. Nest Staking saw a weekly increase of more than 58%, bringing its total value locked to $66.24 million. On the other hand, MatrixDock, operating on two chains, went up 48.18%, while Ethena amore modest upticks of 12.38%. Others Incur Losses Not all protocols experienced uniform growth, with DeFiLlama’s data showing that Solv Protocol, DigiFT, Danogo, KlimaDAO, and Fortunafi faced varying degrees of decline. The most significant loss across seven days was incurred by Danogo, whose $4 million TVL is over 15% lower than a week ago. Among the higher-capped projects, Solv shed the most locked value, losing more than 10% to settle at $712.81 million. However, over 30 days, Maker RWA suffered the biggest dip, with a negative change of 65%, lowering the value of assets in its custody to $290.7 million. The jump in RWA tokenization could signal a shift in how traditional assets are managed, traded, and accessed. Recently, several players in the Argentine lithium mining sector announced plans to tokenize the potentially trillion-dollar industry with the help of Cardano. Financial giants, including BlackRock, have also helped legitimize the space through its BUIDL initiative.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 04:30:00

BTC has now reversed and is trading above the $93k level. “After the post-Christmas market-wide dip, crypto markets are seeing an encouraging trend of whales moving stablecoins to exchanges,” Santiment reported. Historically, Q4 has been a strong period for Bitcoin and altcoins, which aligns with market cycles. We’re currently experiencing a cooldown, which is common after a halving event, like the one that happened in 2024. Following the halvings of previous years (2012, 2016, and 2020), Bitcoin experienced significant rallies in the subsequent year. External factors, such as global liquidity and government actions, will also influence the market. With Janet Yellen’s recent announcement that the U.S. will hit the debt ceiling in mid-January, more money printing and quantitative easing are likely. This creates favorable conditions for assets like Bitcoin. Looking ahead, January is expected to be a fairly quiet month, with the real action starting in February. Historically, March tends to be a strong month, followed by a potential consolidation in April and May due to tax season. After that, the market could pick up again in the summer, continuing into Q4. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Right now, Bitcoin is in a range, not yet fully breaking down, but it’s reacting to support and resistance levels. If Bitcoin stays below the resistance of $94,270, we could see more downside, with targets around $91,400. However, if Bitcoin breaks above the resistance at $94,270, it could signal a change in direction. But for now, the price is still showing signs of weakness, and we’re watching for any moves below support to confirm further declines.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 05:14:01

However, most currencies were steady due to low year-end liquidity. According to a recent report by Reuters, the yen slid to 157.71, and speculation of Japanese intervention could prevent another test of the 160 level seen in July But the US dollar index, which tracks the currency against major rivals, was flat at 107.98. The euro stayed at $1.0429, not far from recent lows, as holiday trading dampened movements. The euro is on course to close the year around 5.5 percent lower versus the dollar. Rising U.S. Treasury yields have supported the US dollar, marking the 10-year benchmark yield to a seven-month high. On Monday, it was close at 4.625 percent. Australian broker Pepper Stone’s research head, Chris Weston, said, “Despite paid forecasters almost universally calling for a weaker U.S. dollar in 2024, the greenback looks set to close the year higher against all major currencies with the buck reigning supreme.” The US dollar index rose 2.3% this month, bringing its total year gain to 6.6%. That’s the third consecutive month of growth and comes ahead of expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, including less regulation, lower taxes, higher tariffs, and tighter immigration rules, will spur economic growth and inflation, keeping U.S. yields elevated. The US dollar has gained 10 yen since December 3, following the majority of the yen’s drop following the Federal Reserve’s cautious tone on future rate cuts on December 18. The yen has tumbled to 158.09 per dollar, less than 10.6% down from the year-to-date after dropping to its weakest since July 17.

But savvy investors? They’re rubbing their hands in excitement. Why? Because downturns are the golden opportunities to snag investments that can skyrocket. The meme coin market, long considered a playground for laughs, has evolved into a lucrative investment hub. Recent developments have shown just how powerful these coins can be, with communities rallying behind their favourites and massive returns becoming a real possibility for early adopters. One coin turning heads is BTFD Coin ($BTFD). At just $0.000142 per coin and over $4.6 million already raised and more than 7,000 holders backing it, $BTFD is cementing its position as the frontrunner in meme coins this year. But it’s not alone—other contenders like Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT), Neiro ($NEIRO), and Book of Meme ($BOME) are also making waves. Let’s dive in and explore why these coins are the best new meme coins with 100x potential. 1. BTFD Coin ($BTFD): The Ultimate Dip-Buying Play When life gives you dips, you buy them—or at least that’s what $BTFD is all about. This innovative meme coin has made a splash in the crypto world with its presale, offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy low and potentially sell high. With 16 presale stages representing key global economic events, $BTFD has woven a compelling narrative. $BTFD isn’t just a story—it’s packed with substance. Its P2E (play-to-earn) game, whose beta version launched in Stage 10, is already gathering attention as a fun, community-driven way to engage with crypto. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards, it hints at massive potential for post-launch earnings. On top of that, staking rewards with a juicy 90% APY make $BTFD a favourite among investors who want their holdings to work for them. Add a referral programme with 10% bonuses for top-performing referrers, and you’ve got a coin that rewards loyalty and community participation. With over 60 billion coins sold and predictions that the presale will end at $0.0006, there’s no better time to hop aboard the $BTFD train. To make your investment even more rewarding, BTFD Coin offers a bonus code! By using the code BIG50, you can unlock an additional 50% in $BTFD coins. Simply enter BIG50 at checkout and watch your purchase go further, maximizing the value of your investment. With a $4,000 investment in Stage 13 of the BTFD Coin presale, priced at $0.000142 per coin, you would normally receive 28,253,126.76 BTFD Coins. However, by applying the BIG50 code, which adds 50% more coins, your total increases to 42,379,690.14 BTFD Coins. If the price of the coin reaches $0.0006 by the end of the presale, your investment could grow to an impressive $25,427.81. This illustrates the substantial earning potential of BTFD Coin and the advantages of maximising your purchase with the BIG50 code. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because $BTFD is reshaping how we see meme coins, blending humour, history, and serious earning potential into a project no one should miss. 2. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT): A God Among Meme Coins What happens when you combine meme-worthy fun with Greek mythology? You get Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT). This coin has carved its niche as a community-driven powerhouse that brings more than just laughs to the table. $GOAT capitalises on the meme coin frenzy by creating a space where fans of mythical goats and crypto converge. Its creators have built a loyal following, making it one of the most-talked-about projects in the meme coin space. While $GOAT isn’t in its presale, it’s already made a name for itself as a reliable alternative to traditional investments. Its tokenomics ensure stability and long-term growth, while its community events and collaborations keep investors engaged. $GOAT isn’t just a coin; it’s a lifestyle that taps into the quirky side of crypto culture. Why did this coin make it to this list? $GOAT exemplifies the power of a strong community and creative branding, making it a top contender for investors looking to ride the meme coin wave. 3. Neiro ($NEIRO): Where Tech Meets Fun $NEIRO is more than just a meme coin—it’s a glimpse into the future. Built on cutting-edge AI technology, $NEIRO combines humour with utility, offering investors a chance to dive into the world of artificial intelligence without the complexities. The coin’s appeal lies in its simplicity and promise of innovation, making it a standout in a crowded market. One of $NEIRO’s strengths is its adaptability.

Australia’s Bitcoin ATM Boom: Nearing European Totals in Global Crypto Expansion Australia’s Bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) network has been growing at an impressive pace, positioning the country as a global leader in cryptocurrency accessibility. Over the past 29 months, the number of Bitcoin ATMs in Australia has consistently increased, bringing the total to 1,359 as of December 2024. According to data from Coin ATM Radar , this accounts for 3.5% of all Bitcoin ATMs globally, cementing Australia's position as the third-largest Bitcoin ATM network in the world. This consistent growth brings Australia close to surpassing Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, with Europe hosting 1,660 machines. Should the trend continue, Australia is on track to solidify itself as a global hotspot for cryptocurrency adoption, trailing only the United States and Canada. Australia’s net positive addition of Bitcoin ATMs over the last 29 months is indicative of the country’s commitment to advancing cryptocurrency adoption. The steady increase suggests growing public interest in digital currencies and a supportive ecosystem for crypto transactions. Despite Australia’s achievements, North America remains the uncontested leader in Bitcoin ATM installations. The United States is home to an astonishing 31,516 Bitcoin ATMs, representing a staggering 81.3% of the global total. Canada follows with 3,027 machines, contributing an additional 7.8%. Together, these two countries account for over 90% of all Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. In comparison, Europe and Oceania each contribute approximately 4% to the global Bitcoin ATM network. Asia, despite its vast population and growing interest in digital currencies, lags significantly, with only 0.9% of Bitcoin ATMs globally. As of December 2024, there are 38,753 Bitcoin ATMs operational worldwide. The continued expansion of these machines comes amid the growing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions. Bitcoin ATMs play a crucial role in enhancing accessibility, allowing users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with ease. The Rising Threat of Bitcoin ATM Scams While Bitcoin ATMs symbolize progress in cryptocurrency adoption, they also bring challenges, particularly in combating fraud. In 2023, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported a surge in scams involving Bitcoin ATMs, with fraudsters exploiting the anonymity and speed of crypto transactions to target unsuspecting victims. Losses from these scams exceeded $110 million, highlighting the need for enhanced security measures. To address these concerns, lawmakers in the US have urged major Bitcoin ATM operators to implement stricter anti-fraud measures. A particular focus has been placed on protecting vulnerable demographics, such as the elderly, who are often targeted by scammers. Australia’s Bitcoin ATM growth signals the country’s rising prominence in the global cryptocurrency market. With continued expansion, Australia is poised to strengthen its position as a leader in crypto accessibility, potentially surpassing Europe in the near future. As the global crypto ecosystem evolves, challenges such as fraud must be addressed to ensure that Bitcoin ATMs remain a trusted and secure gateway for cryptocurrency adoption. For now, Australia’s steady progress signals a bright future for digital currency infrastructure in the region. The rise of Bitcoin ATMs in Australia suggests there is a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a mainstream financial instrument. As Australia approaches Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, it showcases the country's dedication to building a robust crypto ecosystem. However, as this expansion continues, addressing the accompanying risks, such as fraud, will be critical to sustaining the momentum and trust in the industry. MicroStrategy’s Strategy and Vision for Digital Asset Growth In other Bitcoin news, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, a prominent BTC advocate, has once again stirred speculation within the cryptocurrency market. On Dec. 29, 2024, Saylor posted the Bitcoin chart from SaylorTracker.com on X, captioned with a cryptic message: “Disconcerting blue lines on SaylorTracker.com.” His posts have become a Sunday ritual that often precedes MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases on Monday, creating anticipation among market participants. MicroStrategy completed its latest Bitcoin acquisition on Dec. 22, 2024, buying 5,200 BTC at an average price of $106,000 per coin. This purchase, while significant, marked the company’s smallest acquisition since July 2024. Despite the lower volume, the move reaffirmed MicroStrategy’s mission to accumulate Bitcoin regardless of market conditions—a strategy Saylor has vocalized in the past. Saylor’s unwavering confidence in the leading crypto has positioned MicroStrategy as a leveraged bet on BTC. The company’s market performance is now closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, with traders viewing MicroStrategy as a proxy for Bitcoin’s health and trajectory. In December 2024, MicroStrategy called for a special shareholders meeting to discuss its ambitious 21/21 Plan, which aims to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. The plan outlines raising $42 billion over the next three years through a combination of equity offerings and fixed-income corporate securities—$21 billion from each avenue. This aggressive strategy is part of Saylor’s long-term vision of making Bitcoin a cornerstone asset for the company. The funds raised will bolster MicroStrategy’s holdings, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Beyond his corporate endeavors, Saylor has also proposed a comprehensive framework for digital assets in the United States. His ambitious plan includes the establishment of a Bitcoin strategic reserve that could offset the US national debt by providing the Treasury with $16 trillion to $81 trillion in asset wealth. The proposal is centered on growing the digital asset market capitalization to $10 trillion, which Saylor argues would enhance the demand for the US dollar and government securities. This, in turn, could cement the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency in an increasingly digital economy. A Taxonomy for Digital Assets As part of his framework, Saylor has outlined a detailed taxonomy for digital assets, categorizing them into six distinct classes: Digital Commodities – Assets like Bitcoin that function as a store of value. Digital Securities – Blockchain-based representations of traditional securities. Digital Currencies – Cryptocurrencies designed for transactions. Digital Tokens – Utility tokens with specific functionalities in ecosystems. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) – Unique assets representing ownership or rights. Digital ABTs This classification aims to provide clarity and structure to the digital asset market, fostering a regulatory environment conducive to growth and innovation. Saylor’s vision extends beyond MicroStrategy’s balance sheet, aiming to redefine the role of digital assets in the global financial system. His proposals for integrating Bitcoin into the US economic framework shed light on the growing influence of digital currencies on macroeconomic policy. While MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have drawn both praise and skepticism, the company’s strategy has undeniably shaped perceptions of corporate crypto adoption. As Saylor continues to champion Bitcoin as the premier digital commodity, MicroStrategy’s moves remain a barometer for institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy have become synonymous with Bitcoin’s corporate adoption, pushing the boundaries of how traditional businesses engage with digital assets. From bold acquisition strategies to visionary frameworks for national economic integration, Saylor’s leadership reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s transformative potential. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, MicroStrategy’s actions and Saylor’s proposals will likely serve as a litmus test for the scalability and legitimacy of Bitcoin in the global economy. Whether through strategic acquisitions or ambitious policy frameworks, Saylor’s enduring belief in Bitcoin continues to shape the narrative of cryptocurrency adoption worldwide.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-30 05:30:00
38293907,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53412,1735536624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Sui TVL Crosses $2 Billion. Rollblock May Top That Post Presale,https://timestabloid.com/sui-tvl-crosses-2-billion-rollblock-may-top-that-post-presale/,"SUI ’s TVL recently surpassed $2 billion after a 16% growth in the last 30 days. This milestone puts the blockchain in the spotlight for its growing market cap and user activity. Meanwhile, Rollblock is on the verge of its post-presale launch, with some speculating it could challenge SUI ’s figures. With Rollblock pioneering multiple web3 innovations, investors are closely watching its potential to outperform established cryptos. Unlock Gaming Rewards With Rollblock At The Helm The online gambling industry has evolved, integrating blockchain technology to address traditional challenges. Rollblock operates in this space, using RBLK as its native token. This token fuels transactions and connects the gaming platform to decentralized finance models, creating a seamless user experience. Currently, Rollblock features over 7000 games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, poker, and live casino options. It also offers sports betting on football, basketball, tennis, and more. The iGaming platform plans to add 100 more games by year end to expand its selection further. Rollblock is clearly taking committed steps to provide a diverse and engaging gaming experience for its users. Players will be able to secure income from Rollblock ’s lineup by holding or staking RBLK tokens. Staking offers direct financial benefits, as a share of the platform’s weekly revenue is distributed to participants. This revenue-sharing model ensures active players and investors can benefit from Rollblock ‘s growth. However, rewards are proportional to the amount staked. Deflationary measures play a key role in Rollblock ‘s tokenomics. Periodic token buybacks and burns reduce the circulating supply of RBLK. This strategy increases scarcity, helping stabilize and potentially boost the token’s market value. Additionally, cashback incentives and bonus programs encourage continuous participation while supporting the health of Rollblock ‘s ecosystem. SUI Performance Opposes General Market Trend Despite the bearish appearance of the crypto market, SUI demonstrated growth, with its TVL crossing $2 billion—a 16% increase over the past 30 days. The surge in TVL speaks to the growing confidence in SUI ‘s ecosystem. It’s metrics like these that have led SUI to a 25% price increase in the past month, with over $12 billion in market cap . SUI ’s early partnerships with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets and Google Cloud enhance its technological capabilities and market reach. From a technical perspective, SUI has been consolidating below a descending resistance line after reaching an all-time high of $4.93. Its RSI suggests the potential for a bullish reversal if it breaks above this resistance. Analysts predict that SUI could reach approximately $14.94 by early January, representing a potential 227% price increase. This optimistic outlook is based on SUI ‘s recent performance and strategic developments. On CoinMarketCap, community sentiments are largely positive, as 85% of SUI enthusiasts vote bullish. Conclusion Over the past month, both SUI and RBLK have outperformed the market average. However, unlike SUI, Rollblock is not constrained by a growth cap. Currently in its ninth stage of presale, RBLK tokens are priced at $0.044 each. Investors in the presale can benefit from daily, weekly, and monthly rakebacks from casino games, along with tiered bonuses based on their RBLK holdings.

According to a recent analysis by CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) on X, XRP is poised to exit a falling wedge pattern on December 29, 2024. The chart that the analyst presented suggests a rapid rise to $5.6 by January 19, 2025, echoing its price movement in March 2017. If we follow the March 2017 pattern #XRP will break out of this falling wedge tomorrow and reach $5.60 on January 19. pic.twitter.com/tcX0nUNBII — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 28, 2024 XRP trades above $2 for the first time since 2018, reflecting renewed investor interest. Additionally, XRP recently touched $2.86, its highest price since 2018, suggesting robust buying pressure. While the digital asset has faced significant resistance, its ability to hold above $2 shows its underlying strength. If the bullish momentum continues, the chance of a new all-time high cannot be ruled out. CryptoBull’s chart analysis highlights a falling wedge, a bullish continuation pattern indicating a possible upward breakout. The daily chart shows XRP consolidating within this wedge, with decreasing price volatility and narrowing trendlines. The analyst recently shared a similar analysis , and this breakout, anticipated to occur soon, aligns with historical patterns that suggest significant upward momentum following such formations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Mirror Its 2017 Performance? The importance of this potential breakout lies in the projected trajectory. If CryptoBull’s analysis holds, XRP’s move to $5.60 would represent a substantial gain of 154.5% from its current price of $2.2. Such growth would send the asset to a new all-time high, eclipsing its current peak of $3.84 which it achieved in January 2018. However, it is important to note, that while chart patterns like the falling wedge are reliable indicators, they are not guarantees. Market sentiment, external news, and broader economic factors all play a role in determining price movements. However, investors seem to be overwhelmingly bullish on XRP. The broader macroeconomic and regulatory landscape contributes to the positive sentiment around the digital asset. The recent resignation announcement by Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, effective January 20, 2025, is a pivotal development for crypto. President-elect Donald Trump has already nominated a pro-crypto successor to Gensler, and January 20 will be a pivotal day for XRP. Notably, CryptoBull expects XRP to hit $5.6 by January 19. Trump’s inauguration and Gensler’s resignation the following day could give XRP a much larger boost, potentially sending it to double or triple digits.

Why Rollblock’s $7.74 Million Presale Success is Only the Beginning Rollblock (RBLK) has achieved groundbreaking success during its presale, raising over $7.74 million in record time. More than 35,000 early investors are already backing Rollblock’s GameFi project, confident it will dominate the market in 2025. Rollblock’s unique approach of integrating blockchain technology into iGaming has analysts predicting a massive 100x rally for $RBLK on launch day. For a limited time, $RBLK tokens are available at just $0.044 in stage 9 of the presale. Since its ICO debut, RBLK has surged by 330% , with analysts expecting an additional 550% increase. Once the token officially launches, a jaw-dropping 50x explosion is predicted. Rollblock’s buy-back program and revenue-sharing model have significantly boosted its appeal, attracting a growing number of investors. The presale continues to raise millions, with rumors of an upcoming major exchange listing further enhancing Rollblock’s standing as one of the leading platforms in the crypto gaming space.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 05:56:00

However, the offering faces a unique hurdle, as no Solana futures products are currently available on any Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)-regulated exchange. According to the fund’s prospectus, the proposed ETFs would invest only in futures contracts traded on CFTC-registered exchanges. This is questionable since Solana futures contracts do not yet exist and there is no approved spot Solana ETF. “This is crazy,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Balchunas added that the filing could signal that Solana futures could soon become a reality, which “probably bodes well” for future approval of spot ETFs. Offering a broader regulatory perspective, Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, suggested that the filing could reflect a shift in the ongoing power struggle between the SEC and CFTC over digital asset oversight. “The CFTC may be winning its power struggle with the SEC over digital asset regulation,” Geraci commented. Related News: Whales Clash Over This Altcoin - Two Buy Huge Wallets, One Sells Big The move also reignites speculation about which digital asset could be next in line to receive ETF approval, with some experts believing Solana could lead the way, while others have expressed optimism that XRP or other cryptocurrencies could be considered. Volatility Shares is no stranger to disrupting the ETF space. It launched its first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in June 2023, followed by a 2x Ether ETF a year later. These products have since paved the way for other asset managers to explore leveraged funds targeting cryptocurrency futures. *This is not investment advice.

With over $200,000 raised in its presale and RACE tokens at $0.00825, the platform shows how gaming can combine entertainment with real value. The numbers speak clearly: over 14 million RACE tokens staked and rewards approaching 3,000% reveal how blockchain technology transforms traditional gaming into an experience where players truly own and grow their gaming assets. From Traditional Gaming to Blockchain: A New Way to Play Think of traditional gaming like a closed theme park – you buy tickets to enjoy the rides, but those tickets have no value outside the park. Race To A Billion changes this model by making your gaming tokens valuable assets that grow with the platform’s success. When you hold RACE tokens at today’s price of $0.00825, you’re not just buying entry tickets – you’re becoming part of the gaming ecosystem. Blockchain technology changes how we think about in-game value. Every RACE token you own is recorded on an unalterable digital ledger. Your predictions, rewards, and tokens are protected by smart contracts – automated systems that enforce fair play without human intervention. This creates transparency that traditional gaming can’t match: you can see exactly how many tokens exist, how many are staked, and watch the reward system work in real time. Understanding Token Value and Growth The value system of Race To A Billion starts with its carefully planned token supply of 2.5 billion RACE . Like a well-designed economy, each token serves specific purposes within the platform. Currently, millions of RACE tokens are staked by early supporters, showing strong belief in the platform’s future. These staked tokens earn decent rewards, creating a steady flow of benefits for participants. The current price per token reflects the project’s early stage, similar to getting in on the ground floor of a growing business. The staking program rewards this early support generously – when you stake your tokens, you’re not just holding them, but actively participating in the platform’s growth. The distribution system releases rewards steadily through blockchain mechanics, ensuring a fair and transparent process for all participants. The Path from Presale to Gaming Platform Race To A Billion follows a carefully structured path from presale to full gaming platform. The current presale stage has already raised over $200,000, showing how blockchain gaming attracts both players and investors. At the current price per RACE token, early supporters can join before gaming features go live, much like getting exclusive access to a game before its official launch. The development journey happens in clear phases. Right now, we’re in the foundation-building stage where early supporters can stake their tokens and earn rewards. The next phase brings the actual gaming platform to life, where predictions turn tokens into active gaming tools. This step-by-step approach ensures each part of the platform works perfectly before moving forward, creating a stable environment for both gaming and token value growth. Making Blockchain Gaming Work for You Participating in Race To A Billion requires understanding the different ways you can engage with the platform. Let’s explore your options and how to make the most of each one at this early stage. The entry process starts with purchasing RACE tokens, currently priced at $0.00825. The platform makes this step accessible to everyone by accepting multiple payment methods. If you’re new to blockchain, you can use your credit card through the secure Web3Payments system – it works just like any online purchase you’re familiar with. For those experienced with cryptocurrency, the platform accepts ETH, USDT, and BNB, allowing you to connect your crypto wallet and make a direct purchase. After acquiring tokens, you face an important decision. The staking program , which has attracted over 14 million RACE tokens, offers substantial rewards. Think of staking as putting your tokens to work – they generate passive earnings while supporting the platform’s growth. The rewards get distributed automatically through smart contracts, ensuring fair and transparent payment to all participants. Your strategy might depend on your gaming and investment goals. Long-term participants often choose staking for steady rewards, while those excited about prediction gaming might hold tokens for immediate use when features launch. The current presale price of $0.00825 offers both options – you can stake for rewards now and still have tokens ready for gaming later. Remember, starting small lets you learn the system while participating in the platform’s early growth.

Besides, the volume of the token has been slashed heavily, due to which cryptos like Avalanche have become less volatile. In times when more squeeze is expected, the AVAX price is expected to trigger a strong breakout that could elevate the levels beyond the current consolidation. Avalanche is among the tokens, which are believed to outperform the top 2 tokens in the upcoming price action as they are considered to be heavily undervalued at the current price. Mainly because no major change in the price was recorded even after the launch of Avalanche 9000, which is considered the largest-ever upgrade of the platform. However, the price was heading towards the yearly highs ahead of the launch but the token followed the market trend and plunged by over 30%. The token’s inefficiency to rise above $40 over the past week could have raised some concerns over the next price action. However, in the wider perspective, the AVAX price remains primed for a 50% upswing, but if the bulls manage to revive a 12% rise before the end of 2024,. The daily chart of the AVAX price may suggest the token could be heading towards the immediate lower support as it is on the verge of losing the 0.5 FIB at $36.26. The MACD indicates a drop in the selling pressure but it is yet to be flipped to a buying range. On the other hand, the bears continue to hold a major dominance as seen in the bull-bear power, indicating another pullback of around 10% could be in place, probably reaching the interim support at 0.382 FIB at $32.2. These levels have been offering strong support previously and hence a strong rebound could be expected at these levels. However, the market sentiments have not yet turned bullish as the traders continue to remain neutral. Therefore, the Avalanche price is expected to maintain a sluggish trend until the platform receives enough volume favouring the bulls. AVAX is usually referred to as the sleeping giant, as it is believed to have huge potential and is defending the support to a large extent. However, the market volatility has slashed hard and until the BTC dominance reaches highs, altcoins like Avalanche are expected to maintain a sluggish trend. However, the AVAX price still has the potential to rise above $50 and head towards a higher target, but rising and sustaining above $42 by the end of the year in the first few days if 2025 is very important.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 06:15:12

This milestone represents not only a strategic accumulation effort but also a bold economic experiment under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership. With a 105% unrealised return on its Bitcoin holdings, the country’s foray into cryptocurrency seems profitable on paper. Questions remain about the sustainability of this strategy, particularly as global economic conditions and crypto market volatility pose ongoing challenges. El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey El Salvador became a global crypto pioneer on 6 September 2021, adopting Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar. Its initial investment of 200 BTC has since grown through consistent purchases, including a $1 million buy after securing a $1.4 billion agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These investments have elevated El Salvador to the sixth-largest Bitcoin-holding nation, alongside powerhouses such as the United States and China. Despite facing criticism from institutions like the IMF, Bukele’s administration doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy, implementing a daily BTC purchase program. This unwavering commitment has paid off during the recent cryptocurrency market recovery, with the nation’s portfolio experiencing a significant unrealised gain of $152 million. The National Bitcoin Office has spearheaded this initiative, tracking and publicising data through Nayib Tracker. Over the past month alone, the country added 53 BTC, valued at $4.95 million, highlighting its systematic approach to accumulation. These purchases have not only bolstered the treasury but also validated Bukele’s economic gamble—at least for now. Can Bitcoin growth be maintained? While El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment has seen a financial turnaround, its long-term success hinges on several factors. The nation’s average acquisition cost of $45,465 per BTC raises questions about the sustainability of profits if market prices falter. The cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility could undermine the government’s ability to leverage its holdings during economic downturns. The $1.4 billion IMF deal provides temporary fiscal breathing room but also places pressure on the administration to demonstrate the viability of Bitcoin as an economic pillar. Critics argue that relying heavily on a speculative asset may expose the country to risks, particularly in the absence of diversified revenue streams. Furthermore, global macroeconomic conditions remain a critical factor. With central banks tightening monetary policies and economic growth slowing in key markets, cryptocurrency adoption and valuations could face headwinds. El Salvador’s crypto-centric strategy may also complicate relationships with international lenders, potentially limiting access to future funding. What’s next for El Salvador’s Bitcoin ambitions? As the country surpasses 6,000 BTC, valued at over half a billion dollars, its achievements are undeniably remarkable. Sustaining these gains requires careful navigation of market dynamics and economic policies. The administration’s success in using Bitcoin to stimulate growth, attract investment, and maintain financial stability will determine whether El Salvador’s gamble sets a global precedent or becomes a cautionary tale. By focusing on expanding initiatives through the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has an opportunity to solidify its position as a leader in crypto adoption. However, balancing this ambition with fiscal prudence will be crucial as the world watches this unprecedented experiment unfold.

These events raise a token’s circulating supply, which can impact its price in a scenario where market demand cannot absorb the newly issued tokens. Because they affect market dynamics, transparency, and investor sentiment, unlock is essential. Big unlocks can indicate selling pressure and affect near-term prices, while the others might drive ecosystem growth by funding development or incentivizing participation.

Will It Be Implemented?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/another-critical-bitcoin-btc-move-comes-from-hong-kong-will-it-be-implemented/,"As Donald Trump is expected to take office as US President, his promise of a national Bitcoin reserve continues to set an example for the entire world. At this point, while the BTC reserve discussion has come to the fore in many countries, Hong Kong, which is on its way to becoming a cryptocurrency center, has also joined these discussions. A Hong Kong lawmaker has proposed including Bitcoin in Hong Kong's financial reserves, local news agency Wenweipo reported. Accordingly, Hong Kong Legislative Council member Johnny Ng put forward a proposal that included utilizing the “one country, two systems” framework to include Bitcoin in Hong Kong's reserves. Stating that holding a significant amount of Bitcoin is now mandatory to have a significant economy, the lawmaker suggested that the Exchange Fund buy Bitcoin and hold it for a long time in order to encourage the development of the cryptocurrency sector in Hong Kong, attract more funds and generate more transaction stamp duty revenue. Noting that the current fiscal deficit in Hong Kong has exceeded 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion), MP Ng said that holding small amounts of Bitcoin will not be a solution to the fiscal deficit, but if a significant amount of BTC is purchased, it can be useful to reduce the fiscal deficit. “Hong Kong should explore ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its foreign exchange reserves by taking advantage of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle. Buying Bitcoin can help stabilize the financial system. At this point, the Hong Kong government can use Bitcoin as a way to strengthen the financial system. Considering that the current fiscal deficit exceeds 100 billion yuan (about 20 trillion won), holding only a small amount of Bitcoin will not significantly help reduce the deficit.” *This is not investment advice.

Details show Decentraland boasted 116.27 GitHUB events within the previous 30 days. Source – Santiment That reflects massive developer participation within the non-fungible token ecosystem. Decentraland team stirs confidence Santiment’s GitHub data analyzes significant developments within a project. The crypto analytics firm highlights that magnified developer participation indicates confidence in the platform’s future. Projects with more active creators promise improvements and enhanced futures for the community. Thus, platforms with increased GitHub events have a higher success rate and lessened scam risks. Decentraland’s success in the previous few months further cements this confidence. The blockchain has regularly ranked high since November, underscoring developer dedication to the project’s success. The substantial developer activity has cemented Decentraland’s status within the NFT world. It will dominate with enhanced developer participation, signaling sustainability and success in the future. Santiment adds that stakeholders often prefer such projects. MANA price action The native coin traded at $0.4918 during this publication, with a daily low and high of $0.4787 and $0.5150. Chart by Coinmarketcap . Despite the 3.20% weekly surge, MANA has struggled lately, losing nearly 25% of its value within the past month. Prolonged winter in the NFT sector contributed to MANA’s underperformance. The non-fungible token space has struggled with dried activities since the 2020/2021 bull run. NFT market overview Non-fungible tokens exhibit bearishness as Bitcoin struggles to surpass $100K again. CryptoSlam stats show the NFT space witnessed slow performances in the past week. NFT sales volume dipped by 48% within the last seven days to $142.96 million. Despite the substantial trading volume slump, market participation indicators confirmed unwavering interest from existing and new players. For instance, NFT buyers and sellers increased by 42% and 41% in the past seven days. The Ethereum NFT marketplace saw its sales down to $75 million, a 60% 7-day decline. Amidst declined volumes, the blockchain saw a 43% surge in buyers to 63,000, while wash trading plunged significantly by 80% to $21.56 million. Bitcoin’s NFT space revealed similar trends, with sales down 30% to $28 million. Nonetheless, a 52% buyer increase to 59,310 signals notable user growth. Also, Solana, ImmutableX, and Mythos Chain demonstrated resilience, while Pudgy Penguins led the downside with significant dips. Pudgy Penguins has seen plunges across all indicators, with sales, transactions, and buyer participation down 77%, 72%, and 70%. However, the latest developments suggest possible resurgences, with improved performance for associated projects in the coming months. Decentraland’s impressive developer activity forms a massive groundwork for renewing trust, making the platform lucrative for investors. Developer participation is among the top indicators of the project’s future outlook. Such sentiments could wake MANA price from its bearish slumber.

XRP sunk more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with dogecoin (DOGE), Solana’s SOL, ether (ETH) and BNB falling as much as 2%. Overall market capitalization fell 3%, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the largest tokens, minus stablecoins, shed 3.5%. US equities declined on Friday and as investors trimmed positions amid uncertainty heading into year-end. An Asia Pacific index reversed 5-day gains, while futures contracts on U.S. indexes S&P 500 and Nasdaq pointed to losses in the U.S. session as of Asian afternoon hours. BTC has historically moved in the opposite direction of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro. Strength in the dollar largely comes ahead of President-elect Donald Trump stepping into office in late January, where he has promised several policies to help the economy in the coming years. When the dollar strengthens, dollar-denominated assets become more attractive compared to cryptocurrencies. Investors prefer traditional investments like U.S. Treasuries or stocks, which yield returns in a strong dollar environment. That, however, has dampened hopes of a continual crypto rally amid lower liquidity and year-end profit-taking among investors. A “Santa rally,” a colloquial term for bullish seasonality seen in December, has failed with a nearly 4% drop in BTC prices this month (it is still up 47% in the final quarter, data shows ). Elsewhere, scaled back expectations for continual interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have contributed to a fall in bitcoin and crypto prices in the past month. Some, however, remain optimistic about long-term crypto policies helping bump the market despite the lack of rate cuts or a strong dollar. “Unlike what many believe, Bitcoin and altcoins have not hit their price tops despite the ongoing consolidation fueled by the interest rate cut last week,” Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “The selloffs recorded stem from the knee-jerk reaction by the market to uncertainties associated with macroeconomic policies. The Fed is preparing for higher figures next year despite inflation close to the 2% annual benchmark. This might shift the direction of monetary policy and impact the market. “But when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in the coming year, more corporate firms will enter the Bitcoin ecosystem as the regulations become favorable. If these projections play out, the price of Bitcoin may also decouple from macroeconomic factors that generally trigger its intense volatility,” Sakharov added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-30 07:18:47

The ADA’s bullish upswing since November 4, which coincided with the re-election of Donald Trump, has confined macro bullish outlook via a weekly higher high and higher low. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $39 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $871 million, has experienced a significant resistance above $1.24. From a technical analysis standpoint, ADA’s price faces midterm bearish sentiment before enough buyers enforce a bullish outlook, potentially in the first half of 2025. Midterm Targets for ADA In the daily timeframe, Cardano price has been forming a potential head and shoulder pattern after hitting the upper border of the multi-month megaphone consolidation. With the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) having formed a bearish divergence, ADA’s price is well positioned to drop in the coming days before rebounding in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, ADA price has consistently closed below the 50-day Moving Average (MA) signaling a notable decline in the previously bullish momentum. In case of further crypto selloff, ADA price should find a solid support range between 77 cents and 68 cents. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH About to Explode-May Form A New ATH in Q1 2025 , Fundamentals to Consider The Cardano network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem, with over $433 million in total value locked (TVL) and over $22 million in stablecoins market cap.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 07:22:00

However, analysts expect an explosive 2025 for the second-largest cryptocurrency as accumulation continues. Meanwhile, Pepe (PEPE) and Rollblock (RBLK) continue to gain significant traction , as the latter could prove to be one of the best sleeper plays of 2025. With a revolutionary GambleFi platform, and an intriguing reward system, Rollblock is ready to make waves and redefine crypto gambling. Rollblock Is Set To Disrupt The $450 Billion Gambling Industry How Rollblock Builds A Bulletproof Track Record Rollblock’s community-backed Web3 casino has been in business for over 8 months and is already generating substantial revenue. In such a short amount of time, tens of thousands of players worldwide have made it their go-to platform. In December alone, registration and deposits tripled , and over $1.3 million in bets has been wagered. This indicates exponential growth in popularity and activity, making Rollblock the hottest emerging GambleFi project. GambleFi Explained At the intersection between online gambling and DeFi, is GambleFi. Users are not just players, they effectively become stakeholders through the casino’s native token — RBLK. Holding the token will allow them to reap incredible rewards and play a crucial role in Rollblock’s success. Let’s discover how the RBLK token changes the game and sets Rollblock miles ahead of other competitors in the online gambling space. Discover Rollblock’s Tokenomics The RBLK token powers various functions within the ecosystem and is designed with long-term growth and stability in mind. Here’s a breakdown of its main features: Revenue-Sharing Mechanisms: Every week, Rollblock reinvests up to 30% of its profits in open-market buybacks of the RBLK token. Constant Supply Reduction: 60% of these tokens are burned and removed from circulation, allowing for sustainable growth, while ensuring price stability in times of increased volatility. Staking Rewards: The remaining 40% of RBLK is redistributed to holders for staking their tokens on the platform. This will allow them to enjoy a passive income stream with market-beating APY . This model not only rewards long-term engagement, but investors will also benefit from scarcity-driven appreciation, elevating RBLK as one of the most attractive investments of 2025. What Can Newcomers Expect From Rollblock Rollblock boasts a well-rounded platform that appeals to every type of player. Over 7,000 games await on arrival, ranging from casino classics like roulette and blackjack, to live games and exclusive AI-powered games. A sports betting option has been recently added allowing participants to bet on their favorite sports and leagues, including NFL, UFC, NBA, and many more. Over one hundred new games will be released next year, further expanding Rollblock’s already vast offering. A Commitment To Safety And Trust The online casino space has been facing issues of lack of transparency and security for years, which have eroded trust and driven users away en masse. Rollblock’s blockchain-based framework solves this, as all transactions are immutably recorded, easily traceable, and immune to tampering. SolidProof has audited Rollblock’s smart contract and recently, the casino has also secured a license from Anjouan Gaming, ensuring compliance with the latest regulatory standards. Ethereum’s Price Stalls, But Blackrock Is Ecstatic After multiple failed attempts at overcoming the critical $4,000 resistance, Ethereum (ETH) entered a descending channel as market turbulence intensified. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,355 with minimal fluctuations in either direction. In the last month alone, Ethereum has shed over 16% in value after forming a local peak of around $4,000. Meanwhile, institutional investors are taking advantage of this dip, as Ethereum’s ETFs are seeing record inflows. Since November, Blackrock’s Ethereum ETF has recorded over $1.5 billion in net inflows. Pepe Ready For A Breakout? Pepe has emerged as one of the leading memecoins despite experiencing significant volatility. In the past month, Pepe’s value dropped by nearly 13% which led to a breakdown below the key $0.000020 support. On higher timeframes, Pepe’s performance also appears bearish, however, analysts believe that a price reversal is imminent, as the bottom seems to be in. Experts point out that a bullish megaphone pattern is forming on the Pepe chart, which is foreshadowing an upward surge. If a breakout is confirmed, Pepe’s price could soar to new heights, with the next major target being $0.000032 in Q1 2025. Join The Rollblock Presale Before The 50x Moonshot! While both Ethereum and Pepe will likely see impressive rallies as the cycle progresses, Rollblock could become next year’s crypto dark horse. Its low market cap and cutting-edge GambleFi platform reveal a perfect growth formula that could see the price of RBLK skyrocket by 50x when the bull run is in full swing. Stage 9 of the RBLK presale is now live and tokens are selling at a discount for just $0.044. The best time to get involved? Now!

Why Lightchain AI is a 2025 power play Here’s why it’s a must-have in every forward-thinking portfolio. Memecoin launchpad where creativity gets paid Think of it as Shark Tank, but for meme coins. Lightchain AI’s meme coin launchpad is where developers and creators let their imaginations run wild and actually get rewarded for it. With AI-powered tools, it’s a playground for creativity and a goldmine for innovation. Who knew memes could be this lucrative? Tech that’s basically from the future This isn’t your average blockchain. Lightchain AI has a few tricks up its sleeve. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) It’s like a gym for AI, where models get trained and flex their muscles, all built right into the blockchain. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Forget proof of work. This genius mechanism secures the network while rewarding nodes for doing actual AI-heavy lifting. Transparent AI framework This framework ensures all AI decision-making on the platform is fully open and auditable, building trust with users and developers. Decentralized governance integration Lightchain AI combines decentralized governance with AI, enabling smarter, community-driven decisions. Privacy and security that’s locked tight In a world where everyone’s after data, Lightchain AI is the bodyguard we need. With Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), secrets are completely safe, even during computations, sensitive data remains locked up like Fort Knox. Using Homomorphic Encryption, Lightchain AI allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without ever revealing it, like solving puzzles blindfolded but with unmatched precision.

Lunex Mania Takes Over,https://timestabloid.com/crypto-whales-play-big-xrp-pumps-brewing-lunex-mania-takes-over/,"After four stormy years of legal tussle, XRP is finally getting the deserved recognition on the price charts. Recent XRP news has highlighted crypto whales ‘ big play unfolding. In fact, a massive $132M transfer has sparked rumors of an impending rally after the RLUSD launch. But another token igniting the same bullish rave has been the new DeFi underdog, Lunex Network . Its ambitious cross-chain solution and user-driven income-generating program have attracted close to a $6M presale raise. Could this be the start of a crypto revolution? Let’s find out. XRP news : Bitstamp predicts historic achievement for Ripple and XRP For weeks, Ripple has been quite the spectacle after the US’s monumental political shift. Since then, XRP hasn’t fallen short of analysts’ optimistic predictions. In fact, Bitstamp recently announced that XRP could reach a historic milestone by 2025. Nothing could be truer as far as the data shows so far. Ripple’s legal breakthrough with the SEC has fueled a massive comeback. The positive XRP news saw the price surge above $2.5 for the first time since 2018. The potential approval of spot XRP ETFs has also bolstered institutional interest. Historical parallels suggest this scenario is plausible; Bitcoin’s price surged 127% in 2024 following the launch of BTC-spot ETFs, reaching $96,324. If XRP follows suit, the crypto world could witness a groundbreaking rally. User and investor confidence has reached ATH, too. Crypto whale activity has also intensified. Over 60M XRP tokens—worth $132 million—recently moved, sparking speculation of a pre-2025 rally. Conservative projections for XRP ’s 2025 price range from $5 to $8. More bullish forecasts even envision a surge between $10 and $20. If realized, this growth would signal a dramatic turnaround for XRP . New crypto-mania: Lunex Network’s success attracts crypto whales Lunex Network is capturing the attention of crypto whales with its DeFi innovation and innovation and cutting-edge decentralized trading platform. Designed to tackle the inefficiencies that have long hindered crypto trading, Lunex sets a new standard for speed, affordability, and user autonomy. What truly sets Lunex apart is its innovative approach to common crypto challenges. High slippage and limited multi-chain operability have plagued traders for years, but Lunex addresses these issues head-on, creating a scalable and reliable solution for modern investors. With a decentralized structure and unparalleled functionality, it offers an ecosystem with obvious appeal to retail traders and crypto whales .

Although PEPE’s viral appeal and whale accumulation point to millionaire-making potential, the emergence of Rexas Finance (RXS) as a utility-driven tokenization platform presents even more possibilities. Now is the ideal time to explore their options since a $900 investment in each may make you a crypto millionaire before the bull run ends. Pepe Coin and Rexas Finance (RXS) Could Transform Investors from $900 To Crypto Millionaires Let’s dive deeper into the potential of PEPE and RXS to transform your crypto portfolio from $900 to millions. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Meme Coin Turning Heads Pepe Coin has demonstrated its ability to remain in the forefront as one of the best meme coins to buy , with its outstanding performance this year. Currently, PEPE is trading at $0.0000182, a 2.39% drop in the past 24-hours, an opportunity for savvy investors to buy dip. Despite the recent drop, the frog-themed meme coin has gained nearly 1251.61% year-to-date, especially as whales keep piling it in enormous quantities. Notably, Lookonchain’s research showed that nine wallets, recently invested nearly $14 million in total, to acquire 555 billion PEPE coins. This represents increased confidence in the crypto coin by big players. Though volatile, PEPE is just 33% off its all-time high of $0.00002803, attained on December 9, 2024. This pattern suggests a bullish breakout, paving the way for a $900 investment to potentially transform you into a crypto millionaire before the bull run ends. While PEPE’s price surge has undeniable appeal, the emergence of a new crypto rival has sparked even greater buzz in the market. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Contender with Massive Potential Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a transforming tool that is ready to change the crypto scene. While Pepe Coin has gained significant attention for its viral appeal and impressive growth, Rexas Finance offers substantial value by allowing the flawless development and maintenance of digital tokens that reflect real-world assets (RWAs). This invention is a game-changer because it enables people to tokenize and exchange assets such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property. Texas Finance is democratizing access to tokenization and fueling the next big wave of adoption in blockchain technology. The team’s decision to prioritize public presale funding over venture money allows regular investors to participate in a project that has already generated over $33.38 million from the first public presale stage. Priced at $0.175, the RWA token is currently in Stage 11 and has gained a startling 500% from its initial presale price. Its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, similar to Pepe Coin’s listing strategies, further support its performance, demonstrating increasing investor trust. Rexas Finance (RXS) Tokenomics Market Confidence and Potential Return Rexas Finance (RXS) has reached vital benchmarks, establishing a reputation and trust among investors. The project’s successful Certik audit, the gold standard in blockchain security, guarantees the platform’s credibility and safety. Plans to list RXS on three elite exchanges further highlight the team’s dedication to enabling a global audience to adopt the token. These elements have positioned Rexas Finance (RXS) as a project with great potential to dominate the fast-expanding niche of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. As the presale is approaching close, market analysts are projecting a possible price spike of over 200,000%, which could raise RXS to $350 per token. Buyers preferring early-stage cryptocurrencies like RXS, could transform a $900 investment at the current presale price generating a multimillion-dollar portfolio before the bull run ends. Maximizing gains in the crypto market depends on spreading investments among attractive assets as it prepares for a possible spectacular bull run. Driven by actual use and acceptance, Rexas Finance (RXS) marks the next stage of crypto growth, while Pepe Coin rides on its meme currency momentum. Final Thoughts Pepe Coin has proven to be a force to be reckoned with, thanks to its staggering price surge and whale interest. For individuals trying to create life-changing wealth during this bull run, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a convincing alternative, nonetheless. Its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, presale success, and optimistic forecasts distinguishes it as a candidate. With a $900 investment in either PEPE or RXS, the idea of becoming a crypto millionaire before the bull run ends is no longer unrealizable. Whether it’s PEPE’s viral appeal or Rexas Finance’s (RXS) transforming power, investors who deliberately invest in both initiatives stand a better chance of maximizing each other’s unique qualities.

Now , Hong Kong remains one of the more crypto-friendly cities, even as 51 nations have already banned cryptocurrencies. Hong Kong strengthens crypto regulations despite restrictions According to the People’s Bank of China, Hong Kong has made significant advancements in its regulation and licensing procedures. This progress comes despite mainland China’s continued restrictions on crypto trading and recent regulatory changes to the international framework for crypto assets introduced by the Financial Stability Board. In its annual China Financial Stability Report , the bank highlighted Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) role in regulating and licensing. According to the bank’s report, the commission has virtual assets under two categories for supervision, securitized financial assets and non-securitized financial assets, while it enforces a unique “dual license” system for digital asset exchanges. Major financial institutions, including HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, are also mandated to incorporate virtual asset platforms into their routine customer monitoring processes, and crypto asset businesses must seek licenses from the commission. So far, the Securities and Futures Commission has licensed four new crypto exchanges in December: Accumulus GBA Technology (Hong Kong), DFX Labs, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology (BVI). Eric Yip, the SFC’s executive director of intermediaries, even commented: We have been proactively engaging with VATPs’ senior management and ultimate controllers, which helps drive home our expected regulatory standards and expedite our licensing process for VATPs. We aim to strike a balance between safeguarding the interests of investors and facilitating continuous development for the virtual asset ecosystem in Hong Kong. – Eric Yip Some Hong Kong’s crypto institutions disapprove of the regulatory requirements The Financial Stability Board established an International Regulatory Framework for Crypto Assets, outlining high-level guidelines for crypto asset oversight. Hong Kong has been striving to follow the framework; however, some crypto institutions are pushing back against its SFC’s regulatory requirements. The four licenses granted this December were just among nearly 30 applications this year. Of the nearly 30 companies that sought licenses, only around a dozen are still waiting for their licenses from the commission, as several major platforms, including OKX and HTX, withdrew their applications due to strict regulatory requirements.

This repayment marks a major milestone in rebuilding trust in the crypto industry after FTX’s shocking downfall in 2022. MASSIVE NEWS FTX begins repaying $16 BILLION to creditors on Jan 3, 2025! Payments expected within 60 days… and guess what? A big chunk of that $$$ might flow BACK INTO CRYPTO. The bull run just got its fuel. Buckle up. #Bitcoin #crypto pic.twitter.com/TwqeXknvYR — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 29, 2024 FTX’s repayment plan was approved in October, and customers with claims under $50,000 will be the first to receive their money. Notably as per the plan the first they will clear the smaller repayments followed by the larger repayments later in 2025. The company plans to return 98% of what customers lost, with many returning 119% of their claimed account value. FTX CEO John J. Ray III expressed confidence in the plan, saying, “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors.” Boosting the Crypto Market This massive $16 billion repayment could boost the crypto market . Many of the creditors are experienced crypto investors who might reinvest their money into digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driving up demand and pushing prices even higher. Historically crypto market recovers only after massive corrections or liquidity inflow in the current scenario this is a perfect moment for a bully rally. The timing is perfect for the market, as Bitcoin has already crossed $100,000 this year , fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin halving . While customers will get back more than they lost, the repayments are based on November 2022, when Bitcoin was trading at just $17,000. With Bitcoin trading at $93K, many recipients might reinvest their funds to catch up on the gains they missed. Moreover, FTX has teamed up with well-known crypto firms Kraken and BitGo to handle the repayments. Their involvement shows how far the crypto industry has come in terms of reliability and infrastructure, which is a positive sign for investors looking for stability in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Today? , A Fresh Start for Crypto FTX’s repayments are more than just numbers it is also a move to regain the investor faith in the company.

Of the 740 ETFs launched this year, crypto ETFs dominate the top eight spots in terms of inflows. Following Donald Trump’s victory in 2024 US elections, inflows into BTC and Ether ETF have surged significantly in the hope of crypto-friendly policies and the plans of building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin ETF Dominate ETF Launches in 2024 Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the growing dominance of crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. According to Geraci, the top eight ETF launches this year have all been tied to digital assets. These include four spot Bitcoin ETFs, two spot Ethereum ETFs, and two ETFs tracking MicroStrategy (MSTR). This surge in crypto-related ETFs stands out against the backdrop of nearly 740 total ETF launches in 2024. Thus, it highlights a major shift in the investing landscape as BTC and crypto become more mainstream. Source: Nate Geraci As per the above image, BlackRock’s IBIT and ETHA products continue to garner heavy demand among investors. Nate Geraci also noted that there’s a very high demand for crypto ETFs tracking the MSTR stock, which has delivered massive returns in 2024, while recently entering the Nasdaq 100 index . Strong Inflows Continue for BTC and Ethereum ETFs Last week, between December 23 and December 27, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a net outflow of $388 million, reflecting some profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. However, the Fidelity ETF (FBTC) saw a weekly net inflow of $183 million, signaling sustained interest from certain investor segments. The total net asset value (NAV) of Bitcoin spot ETFs now stands at $106.683 billion, per data from SoSo Value .

Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a potential bullish setup for Bitcoin (BTC) signaling a possible price rebound. However, the analyst emphasized that the recovery is contingent upon BTC maintaining its critical support level at $93,000. Unlike Bitcoin ETF outflows last week, Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reported a significant bullish sentiment among Ethereum (ETH) traders on BitMEX. According to Martinez, 78.30% of traders with open futures positions on the platform are betting on an upward price movement for Ethereum. during the same period, with a net addition of $349 million.

Meanwhile, Russia is using Bitcoin to conduct commerce outside the traditional finance channels in the face of international sanctions. While these developments certainly bear strategic adversarial overtones, the way Bitcoin changes the equation shows great promise. Cryptocurrency provides the world powers with a peaceful competition over technology. It turns out that with Bitcoin , even atomic-era sovereign partners/rivals can settle differences by using money, like civilized people. Russians Gain Ground in Bitcoin Race The United States and Russia have long shared common interests, especially since allying against the Axis powers in World War II. They include a common interest in atomic safety, nuclear non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, and space colonization. They are also both secular states with constitutions that guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Meanwhile, both are majority Christian nations, with about two-thirds of each country identifying as a person of faith in a traditional belief system. While 20th-century disputes involving the US and Russia involved armed conflict, the Obama-Trump era has focused on de-escalation, demilitarization, and win-win outcomes. That includes strategic offensive arms reductions, economic tariffs on Russian imports, and trade sanctions against Russian financial institutions. Bitcoin adds another domain that deescalates conflict and harnesses it to technological advancement and commercial rivalry. Trump Promises US Will Take The Lead A month after his landmark election victory in November, Trump reiterated his promise that under the new administration, the US “will do something great with crypto.” “Because we don’t want China or anybody else— others are embracing it, and we want to be the head,” the incoming president told CNBC’s Jim Cramer. “We want to be the head of AI. We’re gonna be ahead of AI.” “And we’ve got to produce a tremendous amount of electricity. And you know that,” he explained. “It’s unbelievable when you think that we need more than twice what we already have. But we’ll be able to do it.” The way Trump sees it , in an ideal world, all the remaining Bitcoin would be mined in the United States. Bottom Line for Investors If you thought Redditors racing for Bitcoin drove its price up to incredible proportions, imagine what will happen as sovereign world powers join the fray. Institutional adoption on Wall Street with custody products and ETFs supported Bitcoin’s price growth over the last four-year cycle. Sovereign adoption is here to support its price growth next.

On Dec. 28, on-chain investigator Taylor Monahan flagged a new scheme being leveraged by bad actors who claim to be recruiters for prominent crypto firms to approach targets with lucrative job offers on platforms like LinkedIn, freelancing platforms, Telegram, etc. Once the victim is interested, they are redirected to a video interviewing platform dubbed “Willo | Video Interviewing,” which isn’t malicious in itself but is designed to make the entire scheme look convincing to the victims. As part of the process, victims are initially asked standard industry-related questions, such as their views on significant crypto trends over the next 12 months. These questions help build trust and make the interaction seem legitimate. However, the real attack unfolds during the final question, which requires recording it on video. When trying to set up the video recording process, victims encounter a technical issue with their microphone or camera. This is when the real attack plays out, as the website presents malicious troubleshooting steps masked as a solution to the issue.

A troubleshooting guide presented to victims to fix a supposed technical glitch | Source: Taylor Monahan on X “It allows them to do anything on your device. It’s not really general purpose stealer, it’s general purpose access. Ultimately they’ll rekt you via whatever means are required,” Monahan wrote. This access could potentially allow malicious actors to bypass security measures, install malware, monitor activities, steal sensitive data, or drain cryptocurrency wallets without the victim’s knowledge, based on typical outcomes observed in similar attacks. Monahan advised crypto users to avoid running unfamiliar code and recommended those who may have been exposed to such attacks wipe their devices entirely to prevent further compromise. The attack deviates from the usual tactics seen in similar job recruitment scams. For instance, cybersecurity firm Cado Security Labs, earlier this month, uncovered a scheme involving a fake meeting application that injected malware, enabling attackers to drain cryptocurrency wallets and steal browser-stored credentials. Similarly, last year, crypto.news reported an incident where scam recruiters targeted blockchain developers on Upwork, instructing them to download and debug malicious npm packages hosted on a GitHub repository. Once executed, these packages deployed scripts granting attackers remote access to victims’ devices.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/last-months-rising-star-xrp-loses-momentum-due-to-stronger-us-dollar-here-are-the-details/,"The cryptocurrency market experienced a broad-based decline as a stronger US dollar put pressure on digital assets, with XRP leading the losses on Monday. XRP Leads Crypto Drop Amid Strong Dollar, Year-End Uncertainty The token has fallen by 5% in the past 24 hours, outpacing declines of up to 2% in other major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB. The strength of the dollar, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), has historically led to lower demand for dollar-denominated assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Asian stocks also fell, with the Asia-Pacific index reversing a five-day gain. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures pointed to further losses in the U.S. trading session. The decline came as investors adjusted their positions amid year-end uncertainty. Despite a 47% increase in bitcoin prices in the last quarter, the expected “Santa Claus rally” failed to materialize, with BTC prices falling by around 4% in December. The stronger dollar is linked to reduced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates and cautious optimism about macroeconomic policies. In the current environment, investors prefer traditional investments such as U.S. Treasury bonds and stocks that provide returns in a strong dollar scenario. While the market is facing short-term challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term direction of crypto markets. WeFi co-founder Maksym Sakharov expressed confidence in the resilience of bitcoin and altcoins despite the current consolidation. “The recorded sell-off is due to the market’s knee-jerk reaction to uncertainties regarding macroeconomic policies,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts are speculating about the asset’s potential during this cycle and have outlined an important support level that needs hold; otherwise, XRP could plummet toward $1. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP rode the Trump-induced rally like very few altcoins did, going from $0.6 to a multi-year peak of almost $3 within a month or so. However, its run was halted at the beginning of December, and the asset failed to break above $3 and head toward a new all-time high. Although the launch of its long-anticipated stablecoin in mid-December led to immediate and impressive gains , its momentum is gone once again now. In fact, XRP is down by 25% since that local peak on December 17. The past 24 hours have also been painful for Ripple’s cross-border token, which has slumped by 6% and is struggling to remain above $2. Many industry analysts have now outlined the $1.96 support as a crucial level that needs to be maintained in order for XRP to continue its impressive performance. If it falls, though, the cryptocurrency could drop to as low as $1, according to Andrew Griffiths. #XRP Xrp has been trading in what appears to be a bullish pennant. But if this bullish pattern where to fail it would fastly fall into the low $1 range. Being that Bitcoin has topped for the year, we may see lower prices for Xrp.

If that bull flag fails and price drops below the 1.98 level, XRP could fall rapidly. 1.98 is critical support and 3.53 is the primary upside resistance. pic.twitter.com/hpyXHQXsqk — MAGIC (@MagicPoopCannon) December 29, 2024 The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Down Today Again? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-30 07:58:16

Both companies hired Kroll, an international restructuring firm that fuels speculations regarding mismanagement, opacity, and the consequences for creditors in the long term. The Vauld Experience: A Warning for Wazirx Due to the restructuring plan done by Vauld and spearheaded by Darshan Bathija and with the help of Kroll, creditors were not pleased. The scheme was to lock token values during a low market and that gave Kroll and Vauld high recovery rates when the market recovered. As for Vauld, although they have managed to refund about $100 million to creditors, they inflated it to $200 million during the market pump, so as to conceal their actual losses. Furthermore, the creditors of Vauld also had other issues. Writing off could only be filed in terms of frozen USD values to discourage claims for real token value decrease. More fuel was added to resentment over mismanaged funds, no audits, and the inability to recover $6-$8 million lost through hacks prior to insolvency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Wazirx Acquiring Peek for Its Restructuring WazirX creditors did not quickly forget this as CEO Nischal Shetty recently proposed a restructuring , again with Kroll. It remains questionable whether Kroll will highlight the scale of the problem and reduce users ‘claims or whether WazirX will continue to refer to minuscule gains as big wins. It is important when comparing Vauld and WazirX, the exposures to creditors, particularly when WazirX undergoes restructuring. Victims aka creditors have called for more attention, disclosure, passion for regaining lost funds and less of the cycle that was futile, disappointed Vauld users. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Galaxy Research’s Alex Thorn says he sees Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging by nearly 100% from current levels before 2025 expires amid increasing adoption of the largest digital asset by market cap. “Bitcoin will cross $150,000 in H1 and test or best $185,000 in Q4 2025. A combination of institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption will propel Bitcoin to new heights in 2025. Throughout its existence, Bitcoin has appreciated faster than all other asset classes, particularly the S&P 500 and gold, and that trend will continue in 2025. Bitcoin will also reach 20% of gold’s market cap.” Source: Galaxy Research/X Thorn also believes that Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) will witness tens of billions of dollars in inflows next year. “The US spot Bitcoin ETPs will collectively cross $250 billion in AUM (assets under management) in 2025. In 2024, the Bitcoin ETPs collectively took in more than $36 billion in net inflows, making them the best ETP launch as a cohort in history. Many of the world’s major hedge funds bought the Bitcoin ETPs, including Millennium, Tudor, and D.E. Shaw, while the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) bought a position, according to 13F filings. After just 1 year, the Bitcoin ETPs are only 19% away ($24 billion) from flipping the AUM of all the US physical gold ETPs.” Data from crypto analytics firm Coinglass shows that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively have nearly $110 billion in AUM. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $93,687. Looking at Ethereum ( ETH ), Thorn predicts that the leading layer-1 protocol will see fresh all-time highs next year. “Ether will trade above $5,500 in 2025. A relaxation of regulatory headwinds for DeFi (decentralized finance) and staking will propel Ether to new all-time highs in 2025. New partnerships between DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance), perhaps conducted inside new regulatory sandbox environments, will finally allow traditional capital markets to experiment with public blockchains in earnest, with Ethereum and its ecosystem seeing the lion’s share of use. Corporations will increasingly experiment with their own layer-2 networks, mostly based on Ethereum technology. Some games utilizing public blockchains will find product-market fit, and NFT (non-fungible token) trading volumes will meaningfully rebound.” At time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,420.

Lindner has called on the European Central Bank (ECB) and the German Bundesbank to follow the U.S. by adding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to their reserves. German To Add Bitcoin To Their Reserves The FDP’s latest election manifesto shows a clear focus on digital assets. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are mentioned five times, showing how important they are becoming to the party’s plans. Lindner pointed to the United States, where crypto-friendly policies are being introduced under the Trump administration. He criticized Germany’s political leaders for neglecting the global shift toward digital currencies, stating, “I don’t hear anything about this in the central debates of the German Bundestag.” Strengthening Reserves with Bitcoin Lindner believes Bitcoin could make Germany’s financial reserves stronger. He highlighted how cryptocurrencies are now a big part of global wealth and warned that Europe needs to act quickly to avoid falling behind countries like the U.S. This idea is similar to ongoing discussions in the U.S., where Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed a bill to allow the Treasury to buy 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. While experts, like Jeff Park from Bitwise Invest, think this plan has only a small chance of succeeding, it shows how Bitcoin is being viewed as a valuable asset. Germany’s Bitcoin History Earlier this year, Germany sold nearly 50,000 Bitcoins seized by Saxony’s public prosecutor’s office. Valued at around $53,000 per coin at the time, the sale resulted in a significant loss compared to today’s price of over $107,000, costing Saxony an estimated $2.7 billion. Bitcoin’s Market Outlook As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $93,370 , a decline from its all-time high of $108,000 on December 17, 2024. Analysts predict a possible correction in the near term, with Bitcoin hovering between $92,000 and $97,000. Meanwhile, key indicators, such as the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), suggest that the market is consolidating after a historic bull rally. With Lindner’s push for Bitcoin adoption and Germany’s evolving crypto narrative, the country could position itself as a leader in digital finance.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 08:06:51

The TGE and airdrop events were planned this year, but things got delayed. However, the enthusiasm is persistent as the listing date approaches, most importantly regarding the PAWS token price and airdrop distribution. So let’s discuss that. What Will be PAWS Token Price With Listing & PAWS Airdrop? PAWS coin is in the process of listing, but the team has not officially commented on the listing price, leaving the investors with random guesses. However, a few platforms have made some price estimates based on the similarity between PAWS and other dog-themed meme coins like DOGS. As per that, the PAWS token price could range between $0.0072 and $0.0078 per Binance. However, the PAWS token price can vary greatly depending on user acquisitions, the total supply of tokens, and other factors. This is why only further updates and the TGE could clarify the situation. PAWS Airdrop Listing Date, Snapshot, and Other Key Details The PAWS coin launch and airdrop have been in discussion for months, but finally, the investors are getting more clarity. Regarding the updates, the most awaited PAWS snapshot event will occur today, December 30, 2024, revealing how many tokens a user will receive with the airdrop. The eligibility for that has been cleared already, as the users need to be active users of the PAWS mini-app on Telegram and complete various simple tasks to earn the PAWS points. More importantly, the users need to connect their TON wallets before the snapshot to ensure they receive the airdrop. However, users are becoming uneasy as the team has not cleared crucial information like the PAWS airdrop listing date, total supply, percentage of token distribution, and many other key details. Regardless, things will become more evident with time. Meanwhile, the team has advised the users to stay connected with the mini-app for further updates. What’s In There For You? Crypto airdrops are a way to join the token’s community. More importantly, they allow users to earn free tokens with simple tasks, which is why investors have been eyeing the PAWS airdrop listing date to make some profits. With the token allocation revelation done, investors will find out how much they will receive and how much they could profit when the expected PAWS token price is around $0.007. However, things can change drastically, as many similar Telegram mini-games token launch teams have made last-minute changes in the airdrops, including Hamster Kombat, which is getting its season 2 soon. With that, the investors are hoping to see the HMSTR price rally to $1 after its collapse with last-minute changes in airdrop allocation. Now, we have to see what the PAWS listing will bring to users.

Besides, with pro-crypto Paul Atkins gearing up to replace the current US SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, the optimism further soars indicating a potential surge in Ripple price ahead. Besides, it also fueled speculations over a potential drop of the Ripple Vs SEC case, with the January 15 deadline approaching for the SEC to file an opening brief in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. What Happens if US SEC Drops The XRP Lawsuit? The XRP lawsuit is one of the long-running cases in the crypto space and has gained notable traction from investors lately. However, with Donald Trump’s election win in November, the market sentiment remained high over a potential pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US. In addition, it also fueled speculations about whether the incoming US SEC chair Paul Atkins would dismiss the Ripple vs SEC case ahead. Notably, the current US SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, whom many deem an anti-crypto regulatory, will leave his position in January. In addition, Trump’s inauguration on January 20 has further bolstered market sentiment. Now, as the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins is set to replace Gensler, the market sentiment remained positive over a potential drop in the Ripple case. Notably, pro-XRP lawyers like Bill Morgan, Jeremy Hogan, Fred Rispoli, and others, have also indicated a potential dismissal of the legal case under the incoming US SEC chair. On the other hand, the January 15 deadline for the US SEC to file its opening brief in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is also approaching. Simultaneously, Ripple CTO Stuart Alderoty also called for an end to the ongoing XRP lawsuit, which has further fueled speculations in the market. This has also sparked discussions over its potential impact on Ripple price, with many anticipating a robust rally ahead. Will Ripple’s Native Crypto Price Rally? The market sentiment towards Ripple’s native crypto remained high, as evidenced by its robust rally recently. However, the rally has recently faded with the investors taking a pause amid the holiday mood. XRP price today was down nearly 6% and exchanged hands at $2.06, with its trading volume soaring 78% to $4.43 billion. However, CoinGlass data showed that XRP Futures Open Interest rose about 2%, indicating a bullish sentiment ahead for the crypto. Despite the recent dip, a flurry of experts expect a potential rebound ahead for Ripple price, especially with optimism soaring over a potential dismissal of the XRP lawsuit. For context, popular market expert EGRAG CRYPTO recently predicted the crypto to hit $6 by March 2025. On the other hand, he further said that the crypto is likely to hit between $13 and $27 in this bull cycle, reflecting his growing confidence in the crypto. However, the investors are keeping close track of the Ripple price, with the recent market volatility in focus. A recent XRP price analysis also hinted that the crypto could crash to $1 ahead before continuing its another run towards the north. Besides, if the US SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, files its opening brief before the January 15 deadline, it could further weigh on the traders’ sentiment, which in turn could impact its price.

Data reveals that 75.1% of Ether holders have retained their tokens for over a year, a major leap from 59% at the start of the year. In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s long-term holder proportion has declined steadily, dropping from 70% in January to 62.3% by year-end. This divergence highlights a shift in sentiment within the cryptocurrency space, as ETH continues to strengthen its foothold among investors. Analysts suggest that this growing confidence in ETH stems from its versatility and evolving use cases, bolstered by consistent ecosystem developments and the integration of staking into Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Bitcoin Holders Cash Out Amid Price Volatility Bitcoin’s struggles in retaining long-term holders were further accentuated by its turbulent price movement in December. BTC’s value tumbled from its all-time high of $106,000 on December 16 to $93,000 by December 30. According to technical analyst Ger Van Lagen, this sharp decline was fueled by long-term holders capitalizing on the euphoric price spike. While Van Lagen remains optimistic, forecasting Bitcoin to surpass $200,000 in the coming months, the current metrics paint a picture of waning patience among BTC loyalists. This change in behavior raises questions about Bitcoin’s resilience amid growing competition from Ethereum and other blockchain ecosystems. Spotlight on Ether ETFs The rise in Ether’s long-term holder base isn’t occurring in isolation. December alone saw inflows into spot Ether ETFs more than double, with net investments climbing from $1 billion in November to $2.1 billion by month-end. These inflows signal robust institutional interest in ETH, especially with developments such as staking integration and increased regulatory clarity under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). With the cryptocurrency market entering 2025, Ethereum’s steady growth and adoption position it as a compelling asset for long-term investors. Meanwhile, Bitcoin faces the challenge of retaining its dominance as confidence appears to shift, albeit temporarily, toward its closest competitor.

Data from IntoTheBlock revealed that the proportion of Ethereum holders who kept their tokens for over a year increased from 59% in January to 75.1% by the end of December. IntoTheBlock @intotheblock · Follow This chart shows the percentage of long-term Bitcoin and Ether holders over the past year. While the share of long-term Bitcoin decreased, the percentage of long-term ETH holders climbed, surpassing that of Bitcoin early in the year. 7:30 PM · Dec 29, 2024 106 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies In contrast, Bitcoin’s long-term holders saw a steady decline, falling from 70% to 62.3% over the same period. This divergence in long-term holding patterns highlights a broader shift in market sentiment, with Ethereum appearing to attract more confidence amid growing adoption and regulatory clarity. Ethereum long-term holders soar Throughout 2024, Ethereum consistently gained ground as a preferred asset for long-term investors. IntoTheBlock categorizes long-term holders as those retaining their tokens for more than a year. By the end of December, three-quarters of Ethereum holders fell into this category, compared to 59% at the beginning of the year. This upward trend has been driven by factors such as the addition of staking options in Ether ETFs and increased regulatory clarity from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Bitcoin, on the other hand, experienced a noticeable decrease in its long-term holder base. Starting the year with approximately 70% of holders in the long-term bracket, the figure dropped to 62.3% by December. Analysts have linked this decline to profit-taking during BTC’s record-breaking rally in mid-December, which saw the asset hit an all-time high of $106,000 before settling at $93,711 by month’s end. Spot Ether ETFs see $2.1B inflows in December Ethereum’s rise in long-term holdings was complemented by a significant uptick in spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. December saw cumulative net inflows into these ETFs reach $2.1 billion, doubling the $1 billion recorded in November. This robust demand reflects a growing institutional interest in Ethereum as an asset with long-term potential, bolstered by its transition to a proof-of-stake model and growing utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, attributed to large-scale sell-offs by long-term holders, have not dampened optimism entirely. Technical analyst Ger Van Lagen projected Bitcoin could surpass $200,000 shortly, despite its recent volatility. The contrasting trends in long-term holding patterns suggest Ethereum may be viewed as a safer and more sustainable investment going forward. Why this optimism for Ethereum The optimism surrounding Ethereum heading into 2025 is also underpinned by broader market developments. Experts anticipate a Trump administration could favor cryptocurrencies like Ethereum through regulatory reforms, including overhauls of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This environment, coupled with the growing adoption of staking in Ether ETFs, positions Ethereum as a leader in the crypto space. By contrast, Bitcoin faces challenges in retaining long-term investor confidence, as seen in its declining holder percentage. While its role as a digital store of value remains unchallenged, the dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum illustrate a shifting landscape in crypto investment preferences.

The asset began its painful decline on December 17 when its price stood above $108,000. In just a matter of three days, it had lost around $16,000 and dumped to $92,000. The bulls intercepted the move and helped prevent a further drop below $90,000. In fact, BTC started recovering some ground and spiked toward $100,000 on a couple of occasions, but to no avail. The last such example was on December 26 when BTC touched that line but was quickly rejected once again. The subsequent decline pushed it south hard, and the asset fell to $95,000 over the weekend. However, the landscape worsened in the past 24 hours and dropped further to $93,000. Despite bouncing off that level, for now, BTC is still over 1% down on the day.

BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, TRX, AVAX, LINK, TON, SUI, and many others are also in the red, albeit in a less painful manner.

According to Lookonchain, the tokens were transferred to a non-centralized exchange wallet labeled “76yGJ,” making the wallet the sixth-largest holder of PNUT. The withdrawal occurred at an average price of $1.641 per token. Over the past two days, another whale reportedly sold PNUT tokens to acquire 60.03 million MIRA tokens at $0.031 each, spending $1.87 million. However, the value of the MIRA tokens has since dropped to $1.2 million, resulting in an estimated loss of $600,000 for the investor, per recent data from Coingecko’s terminal. This move follows a similar trend from December 12, when another whale created a new wallet and withdrew 8.41 million PNUT tokens, worth $10.68 million at the time, from Binance.

PNUT in long-term decline, short-term gain The crypto coin’s market performance has faced considerable pressure in recent days. Its market cap stands at $687 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $303 million, an increase of 123%. Short-term indicators show a 0.09% decline in the last hour, while long-term data reveal a 44.79% drop over the past 30 days. PNUT market performance: Source – CoinMarketCap Despite garnering an extraordinary 1200% increase in value over the past 90 days, the token’s current price trajectory is showcasing some bearish signs in the long term. PNUT’s origin story as a memecoin is tied to the viral fame of Peanut, the squirrel. Peanut, who gained over 500,000 Instagram followers, became an internet sensation through Mark Longo’s viral videos. The tragic euthanization of Peanut and another rescued animal, Fred, sparked public outrage, inspiring the creation of PNUT and other Peanut-themed tokens. The token gained massive attention after Binance listed the token on November 11. The listing propelled the token to a peak market cap of $2.27 billion and an all-time high price of $1.80. The token’s popularity was further fueled by social media buzz, including mentions from Elon Musk, which helped create the wave to push its price upwards. After experiencing a price and market cap rally, legal controversies and market corrections took a toll on PNUT, and the price uptick that saw investors make millions decelerated exponentially. Mark Longo, popularly known as “the squirrel dad,” issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance, alleging unauthorized use of his pet squirrel’s image to promote the crypto coin. Longo himself has faced accusations of running scams in the memecoin space, including alleged “rug pulls” in previous projects. Longo’s story is dangerously similar to the infamous Hailey Welch, who is currently facing a heap of lawsuits for the HAWK coin incident. After the news of Longo’s cease-and-desist letter broke, the token dropped 10.2% within 24 hours, falling from $1.17 to $1.05. As of now, PNUT is trading at $0.68, marking a 10.21% drop within a day. The token is currently changing hands almost at its lowest price point in over a month, leaving investors uncertain about its future prospects. PNUT’s upward momentum could continue in 2025 PNUT’s struggles come amid a broader downturn in the altcoin market, which has fueled Bitcoin’s rising dominance, now exceeding 58%. While the crypto market has seen speculative surges, including PNUT’s own 1000% rally earlier this year, maintaining momentum has proven difficult for many memecoins. That said, PNUT has managed to attract the attention of speculative traders. The token boasts over 80,000 on-chain holders and more than $12 million in locked liquidity. Its listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase may keep up a steady flow of interest, though its long-term stability, just like most memecoins, remains uncertain.

However, the start of a new year could end Bitcoin’s bearish outlook and kickstart a bullish outlook based on these top reasons. Top Reasons Why January 2025 Will See Bitcoin Price Skyrocket President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration on January 20. Capital inflows as FTX will start paying claims from January 3. MicroStrategy continuing its BTC buying spree. How Will BTC Price React to Donald Trump’s Inauguration? Many investors believe Bitcoin will crash during President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. This is because investors who opened trades before the elections would consider closing them, leading to a short-term correction. However, this is unlikely due to January being a historically strong month with positive returns. Furthermore, the FTX claims set to be paid out in January will serve as a capital influx and propel BTC and the broader crypto markets higher. FTX’s Claims Payout in January 2025 May Propel BTC Higher Sunil, an FTX creditor activist, recently quashed a fake report that FTX claims would pay out $16 billion by January 3. According to Sunil, the “distribution does not that start on January 3.” He adds that “the $16 billion” would not be distributed within 60 days. Based on his approximation, $13 billion in cash will be distributed now, and the remaining $14 billion will be paid out in March 2025. He adds that 50% of FTX claims reserve worth $7 billion will not be distributed initially. Regardless, this payout will be a huge capital inflow for crypto markets and could serve as the necessary tailwind to drive BTC’s price higher to a new ATH. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Buying Spree Michael Saylor, the CEO and co-founder of MicroStrategy, has been a huge proponent of Bitcoin. His company holds 444,262 BTC worth $41.41 billion, of which 5,262 BTCs were acquired on December 23. Additionally, MicroStrategy announced its plan to dilute its Class A Common Stock and Preferred Stock. The proposal aims to convert 330 million Class A shares to 10.33 billion shares and 5 million preferred shares to 1.005 billion shares. Investors can assume Saylor’s plan to dilute shares is to add more BTC to their holdings. To conclude, the three reasons mentioned above suggest that 2025 will be a good year for cryptocurrencies, especially BTC. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Expert Predictions Let’s explore key Bitcoin price forecasts by some popular analysts and what they believe BTC will do next. According to popular crypto analyst CryptoBirb, Bitcoin is in the optimism phase and will trigger a “vertical” rally as it anticipates an entry into the belief phase. Based on the MVRV (market value to realized value) valuations, Birb notes that “We’re stepping into 2025 with vertical post-election rallies (+977% avg gain)” and projects an all-time high of BTC beyond $250K. BTC/USD 1-week chart Quinten, another popular analyst, compares the ongoing Bitcoin bull run with the past three cycles and hints that there is more upside before BTC forms a top. BTC Price After Halvings On the other hand, veteran trader Peter Brandt notes that Bitcoin forms a head-and-shoulders setup with $78,000 as its next target. This is a head and shoulders top pattern. It might complete and take price to $78,000; it might fail with a thrust hire: or, it might morph into something else. But as it stands right now, it is a head and shoulders top and must be chartist dealt with for what it is. pic.twitter.com/b9AUUO7ddL — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 29, 2024 The post Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Will Skyrocket In January 2025 appeared first on CoinGape .",Price Analysis|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Price Analysis|BTC price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-30 09:23:06

The People's Bank of China also touched on the events taking place in the cryptocurrency sector in its 2024 Financial Stability Report. This report noted that while China was closely following many global developments, Hong Kong was making progress in its compliance with cryptocurrencies. While the report referenced Hong Kong’s progress at many points, it was stated that Hong Kong was actively exploring the management of crypto asset licenses. It was stated that although 51 countries and regions around the world, excluding Hong Kong, imposed bans on crypto assets, some countries softened or lifted their bans in 2024. The Rise and SEC's Bitcoin Approval! In the report, where it was stated that the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins attracted attention, it was stated that the rise started in 2023. The report stated that although there are official bans, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will be closely monitored by many countries around the world in 2024. The report, which specifically examines developments in the US, stated that in 2024, the US SEC took action against crypto asset issuers that violated the Securities Act. “Accordingly, the SEC rejected more than 20 spot Bitcoin ETF applications from 2018 to 2023. However, it approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. While the SEC made a big splash with its Bitcoin ETF approval, the SEC Chairman later said that this does not mean that the SEC approves or recognizes Bitcoin products and investors should still be careful about the risks associated with Bitcoin and value-related products. In addition to developments in the United States and Hong Kong, the report also included the European Union's MiCA regulation and the regulatory efforts of the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. As you may recall, China banned all activities related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2021. However, it is claimed that China may lift the bans in the coming years. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: The People's Bank of China Published Its 2024 Report!

As a result, the volume has dropped to a large extent, indicating the sluggish behaviour of the market participants due to uncertainty circulating around major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, etc., and many more. While Ripple is expanding its network, the XRP price is believed to have a positive impact. Meanwhile, the current trade setup and the market sentiments raise serious concerns over the upcoming price action. The broader market sentiments are neutral at the moment, as the lack of bullish strength has paved the way for the bears to mount some upward pressure. The drop in the price has been supported by the rise in the volume, suggesting the market participants could be panic selling as the token reaches beyond the 2021 highs after remaining sluggish for a long time. Therefore, the lower targets have been activated, as the price is expected to reach $1.88 if the token fails to defend the crucial support at $2. The short-term price action of XRP suggests the token is primed for a major bearish action ahead of the yearly close. The stochastic RSI has been displaying a consistent trend, suggesting a drop in the token’s volatility. Besides, the MACD remains within the negative range without a rise in either bullish or bearish pressure. As the volume remains lower, there could be a fewer possibility of a breakout. Therefore, the XRP price may eventually reach the ascending support line at $2 after undergoing a small rise to $2.1. Additionally, the long-term price action also remains bearish, as the MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure in the weekly chart. However, the rally appears to be reaching the lower support of the bull flag pennant, indicating a huge possibility of a rebound. Secondly, the RSI remains within the overbought range suggesting the bullish trend to prevail for a long time ahead. Therefore, if the XRP price sustains within the bullish pennant, a rebound may be initiated with the beginning of the fresh yearly trade. This could further pave the way for the token to march towards the higher targets in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 09:26:48

Among them, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is already making waves with its new approach, and its Lightchain AI Presale is now open to early adopters. Unlike traditional memecoins like PEPE, which gained massive popularity during the last cycle, LCAI offers far more than just hype. PEPE’s legacy meme coin phenomenon PEPE shows the perfect tale of meme coin fast fame helped by group joy, fun, and quick spread. With its ease and connection, PEPE caught buyers notice, pushing huge price jumps. But like many meme coins, PEPE has no real use, leaning mostly on mood in the market for its worth While its effect on the meme coin world is clear, PEPE’s lasting power is not sure. Its price often links with short-lived fads, making it very weak to market changes and less trust from buyers when the buzz fades. Why LCAI could surpass PEPE Real utility Unlike PEPE, which thrives on cultural relevance, LCAI provides tangible value by solving real-world challenges. Its deflationary tokenomics, with a portion of transaction fees burned, enhances its appeal as a long-term investment. Market growth potential LCAI taps into the rapidly expanding markets of AI and blockchain, industries projected to grow exponentially in the coming years. By bridging these sectors, LCAI captures a broader audience than meme coins, whose appeal remains limited to niche communities. Sustainability and scalability With energy-efficient systems and scalable architecture, LCAI addresses key criticisms of traditional blockchain platforms. Its eco-friendly model positions it as a future-proof investment in a market increasingly conscious of sustainability.

As the market gears up for the next bull run, investors seeking a balance between speculative excitement and long-term value may find LCAI to be the ultimate contender.

Drawing from historical trends, current market data, and strategic predictions, Rietveld shared why he believes XRP has significant potential in the coming years. He also emphasized the importance of acting now to capitalize on future gains. XRP’s Recent Growth and Market Trends Rietveld highlighted XRP’s recent performance, noting how it exceeded earlier expectations. In November 2024, XRP’s price surged approximately fivefold to nearly $3, showcasing remarkable growth within a short period. This development has led Rietveld to feel optimistic about XRP’s trajectory as the new year approaches. “Now that we have more updated information on what XRP has done today, I have a pretty good idea of what we can expect going into the new year,” Rietveld remarked. Using this foundation, he analyzed the potential value of a portfolio containing 1,000 XRP tokens by 2025. Why 1,000 XRP is a Key Benchmark Addressing his focus on 1,000 XRP, Rietveld explained that this figure offers a practical benchmark for his predictions. The number simplifies calculations and aligns with the portfolios of many XRP holders, most of whom own fewer than 1,000 tokens. However, Rietveld encouraged investors to aim for larger holdings—such as 10,000 or even 25,000 XRP—if they are looking to maximize returns in the future. Exploring XRP’s Path to $70 A critical part of Rietveld’s analysis focused on XRP’s historical market dominance and how it might influence future prices. He observed that between September and November 2024, XRP’s market share tripled, rising from 1.25% to 3.91% of the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization. Based on this momentum, Rietveld projected that XRP could achieve a market dominance of 20% by 2025. Under this scenario, XRP’s price could increase sixfold from its current value of $2.14, reaching $20 per token. At this price, 1,000 XRP would be worth $20,000. For an extremely bullish case, Rietveld suggested the possibility of XRP climbing to $70 per coin. Such a scenario would elevate the value of a 1,000 XRP portfolio to $70,000. He noted that XRP achieved significant dominance during its peak years in 2014 and 2017, with respective market shares of 16.9% and 18.1%. These historical benchmarks underpin his belief in XRP’s capacity to capture a substantial portion of the crypto market once again. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Conservative Outlook for XRP Despite his bullish predictions, Rietveld offered a more measured estimate for XRP’s value in 2025. He posited that even if XRP captures 10-15% of the total crypto market—which he estimates could grow to $12 trillion—XRP’s price could still land between $20 and $23 per coin. “This price is very reasonable, considering how much the market capitalization has grown in past bull cycles,” Rietveld explained, underscoring the steady growth potential of the cryptocurrency market. Rietveld’s analysis highlights the potential for XRP to deliver significant returns over the next year, particularly for those holding sizable portfolios. While his predictions span conservative and highly optimistic scenarios, he emphasized the importance of paying close attention to market trends and preparing for future opportunities. As 2025 approaches, XRP investors have several possible trajectories to consider, making it an asset worth watching in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

This phase is crucial for investors as it often precedes significant price movements, setting the stage for the next bull run. Why Michael Saylor thinks BTC price could hit $130k Adding fuel to the fire of speculation, Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach a value of $130,000 by the first quarter of 2025. Michael Saylor ⚡ Founder of MicroStrategy (Parody) @Saylorsatsire · Follow $BTC has re-entered the accumulation zone.In my view, a few weeks of consolidation could set the stage for a massive breakout.$130K+ by Q1 2025 feels inevitable. See you there. 1:47 PM · Dec 29, 2024 7.3K Reply Copy link Read 251 replies The recent record-breaking $18 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options that expired on December 27, 2024, contributed to a temporary dip below $93,000, but Bitcoin has since rebounded to around $93,411, signaling resilience and potential for upward movement. The accumulation phase of Bitcoin, as noted in recent market analysis, suggests that the digital currency is gearing up for another cycle of growth. This phase is identified by stabilization in price action, where large investors, or “whales,” accumulate Bitcoin at relatively lower prices, preparing for the anticipated surge in value. Michael Saylor’s prediction comes at a time when his company, MicroStrategy, continues to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, now representing a significant portion of the total supply. This strategy has been consistent since August 2020, when MicroStrategy began treating Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, aiming to maximize long-term value for its shareholders. Interestingly, Michael Saylor’s bullish outlook aligns with historical patterns of Bitcoin’s price cycles, as indicated by a chart shared by Vivek on X, which maps out Bitcoin’s journey through various market phases since 2011. The chart highlights that Bitcoin is currently in its “2nd Bull” phase, a period historically associated with substantial price increases.

But according to crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), DOGE has one of “the better looking” charts at the moment. In a new Broadcast on X, he offered an in-depth look at Dogecoin, the broader market environment, and key technical indicators. Dogecoin: Price Discovery Or Catastrophe? Despite the current retracement, Kevin believes Dogecoin’s chart “looks really nice at the moment” and appears stronger than many other cryptocurrencies: “This is a stronger coin compared to a lot of the market. I mean, Doge really does look good here. Can it not look good in a week from now? Of course it can, but it looks really good at the moment.” However, he emphasized the possibility of short-term pullbacks—something that could bring Dogecoin down to the $.026 region: “In the short term, could we come back down and test 26 cents? Which I’m gonna throw that out there […] I see no real reason to be uber bearish […] but is it possible that we come back down here? Sure.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Soar To $23 Based On These Bullish Fractals The $0.26 to $0.28 range emerged as the critical juncture for Dogecoin’s near-term outlook: “As long as we remain above this 28 to 26 cent level […] I see no reason to be super fearful. If we pierce that level […] A loss of $0.26 cents on weekly closes would be catastrophic.” Kevin traced this specific target back to November, when he first suggested Dogecoin would revisit the golden pocket near $0.26. According to him, many were skeptical, but that level eventually got hit: “I took a lot of heat for making that call back in early November when we were at 45 cents […] We ended up coming back down and testing that.” Looking to the upside, Kevin pinpoints a substantial resistance area between $0.30 and $0.35, calling it “big, big resistance.” Following that, he labels $0.94 to $1.00 as his “next big zone,” though he cautioned traders against assuming a guaranteed climb. For Dogecoin to breach previous all-time highs and truly enter “full-blown price discovery,” Kevin wants to see a break above the 0.703 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracements—roughly $0.53 and $0.59 cents, respectively: “I don’t see anything holding Dogecoin back from full-blown price discovery […] We want to break 53 cents […] and then the 0.786 at 59 cents. If we’re durably breaking past that 60 cent area, I don’t see anything holding Dogecoin back.” Drawing parallels to past market cycles, Kevin highlighted how Dogecoin historically checks in with its “bull market support band” and macro support levels before rallying: “We came back, we tested structure support […] bull market support band in this cycle. This is very similar to [the previous cycle]. You can’t deny the similarities.” He described how Dogecoin’s present chart mirrors its cycle patterns “almost insanely,” referring to a breakout followed by a falling wedge, an initial climb, and a retest of macro support: “Crypto has this insane innate ability to follow its cyclical nature of performance […] it’s truly amazing, really.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details Despite Dogecoin’s cyclical consistency, Kevin reminded viewers that external market factors and Bitcoin’s performance (which he called “the leader of the market”) could always derail patterns: “We obviously need Bitcoin to cooperate. We can’t have any crazy situations happen globally.” Kevin also examined the DOGE/BTC pair, noting a macro trend line and a golden pocket test: “We have this macro trend line […] we broke through that and we came back in. We’re currently at the bull market support band […] We came back and tested the macro golden pocket again.” He stressed that if Dogecoin remains above this zone on the DOGE/BTC chart, it should head higher. A breakdown, however, could spell trouble: “Kind of like that 26 cent level […] if we come down and break […] it will coincide with a break of the bull market support band and this macro golden pocket, in which case we can be in some pretty deep s**t.” Kevin also delved into macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that could influence Dogecoin and the wider crypto sphere. He posited that the President Donald Trump returning to the White House in January is “very bullish” if it leads to improved regulations, reduced conflict, and pro-growth policies: “We have Trump coming in the office in January, meaning we’re going to have a crypto-friendly administration […] If we can get the Ukraine and Russia war ended, that’s going to be bullish for markets […] We can get inflation back down to 2% and then start lowering interest rates faster.” When And How High Will DOGE Rise Again? From December dumps to Q1 optimism, Kevin noted how market participants often front-run expectations by about a month. He suggested that if January ends up choppy, February might be the point when markets begin their true climb: “Everyone thought October was going to be bullish. October was not bullish. November was bullish. Now everyone thinks January is going to be bullish […] Maybe February is bullish.” When pressed for specific price targets, Kevin pointed to several Fibonacci extensions and the Pi Cycle Top indicator on the Dogecoin chart: “If we break through previous all-time highs, the next resistance zone is going to be $0.94 up to $1.32 […] If we break through $1.32, the next big resistance zone that I’m eyeing is $2.19 up to $2.78.” However, he made it clear that any long-term price predictions depend heavily on technical indicators and confirmations. He highlighted multiple monthly indicators—MACD, RSI, Stoch RSI, and the Pi Cycle Top—as potential signals to exit positions: “I don’t care what the price is at that point […] once we get up into that zone, I’m taking profits off the board. If the monthly indicators start flashing, I’m getting out.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.32.

While many digital assets are facing a market-wide downturn, XRP’s price has taken a more significant hit, losing almost 30% of its recent gains and struggling to hold above the $2 mark. Key Factors Behind XRP’s Decline One of the major reasons for the ongoing price drop is the anticipation of XRP’s monthly token unlock. On January 1, 2025, 1 billion XRP tokens will be unlocked as part of Ripple’s operational funding strategy. Historically, such events often increase selling pressure, making traders cautious about price stability. Additionally, macroeconomic factors are playing a role. The Federal Reserve recently announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut . While this was expected, the Fed also issued a cautious forecast for 2025, reducing the expected number of rate cuts from four to just two. However, Coinglass data shows a slight drop in XRP’s open interest, suggesting that some traders are closing their positions due to increased market volatility. This has added to the downward pressure on XRP’s price. What’s Next for XRP? In the face of a bearish market, XRP has failed to hold its key support level at $2.20 and has been stuck in a tight range for the past month. This is similar to a three-month consolidation phase earlier this year, which ended with a price rally in November. If this pattern continues, XRP might not break above $3.00 until late February 2025. During this time, any large-scale selling could push the price down to $1.58, increasing losses for investors. On the brighter side, a positive shift in the crypto market could change things quickly. If XRP breaks past the $2.73 resistance, it could rise to $3.00 and even aim for a new all-time high above $3.31.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 09:39:34

Тhe successful month also wraps up one of the best years for the DeFi lending protocol since its 2021 peak. Sky Protocol locked in $22.18M in earnings for December, the highest level for the past six months, based on TokenTerminal data. Its performance reflects several trends in the past year, including DeFi’s overall recovery. Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO) achieved peak earnings in December, reflecting the market rally in Q4. | Source: DeFi Llama Most of the protocol fees also reflect the usage of DAI/USDS, the native stablecoin used for loans. In the past year, the supply of DAI rose to $6.2B, the highest level since the 2022 peak of $7.24B DAI. The creation and circulation of DAI are no longer tied to the MKR asset but rely on a wider selection of collaterals. Sky Protocol shifted its collateral balance in the past year The supply growth in the past year was achieved through a more diverse mix of collaterals, including tokenized T-bills. With this move, Sky Protocol became one of the drivers of RWA adoption, as the crypto sector put some of its earnings into T-Bills and then used them to secure additional growth. The third trend is the successful swap from MakerDAO to Sky Protocol. Over the past 12 months, the DeFi protocol had to go through rebranding in addition to overhauling its collaterals. As a result, MakerDAO stepped back, leaving Aave (AAVE) to become the top lending protocol. Some of the sub-DAO projects also relied on Aave for their passive yield, creating special vaults. Despite the slowdown against Aave, the treasury of Sky Protocol is also at a peak. The project holds $2.1B in its treasury as an additional security for the dollar peg of DAI/USDS. DAI/USDS is now supported by three main types of collateral. Crypto vaults hold more than $3.43B in value locked. The Peg Stability Module (PSM) holds special vaults with $1.56B in assets. Tokenized securities make up $296M after a recent removal of liquidity. RWA vaults shifted down from their peak valuation of $3.2B in 2023. The collaterals of Sky Protocol are not fixed and may reflect market conditions and potential risks. During bull market periods, DAI/USDS is more widely used for loans. The market rally in the last quarter of 2024 was immediately reflected in Sky Protocol’s revenues, which reached a peak of $1.3M in daily fees on December 7. Sky Protocol to push more for USDS adoption next year Sky Protocol continues with its calls to switch from DAI to USDS next year. The protocols also plan to grow more aggressively in the coming months, regaining a higher position as DeFi lending expands. At the end of 2024, more than $49B were locked in lending protocols, which exist on almost all leading chains. While Maker and Sky are not directly competing, the sub-DAO Spark Protocol rose to the second-highest spot, with $4.37B in value locked. However, the Sky ecosystem still lags behind Aave, which holds between $18B and $20B in loans and collaterals. Sky Protocol will aim to boost its position on Solana after starting the inflows of USDS into the new chain. In 2025, the protocol aims to offer full lending services, potentially competing with established lenders like Kamino Finance. Toward the end of 2024, the supply of USDS on Solana increased to over 100M tokens based on bridging data. The milestone was achieved just a week after the launch of USDS on Solana. The main use case for USDS is its passive income, with a savings rate of 12.5%. The supply of USDS grew above 1B tokens in the past year after spreading to multiple lending protocols. USDS can be staked for savings income through Sky, Spark Protocol, as well as Kamino Protocol and Drift on Solana. USDS has also spread to Base, which carries a version of Spark Protocol. Sky Protocol hopes to expand on expectations for a more crypto-friendly climate in 2025. In the coming year, both SKY and MKR tokens will remain deflationary , with no new mints except in extraordinary circumstances to protect the peg of DAI.

The SC published in its media release that it has begun enforcement proceedings against Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange, and its business chief, Ben Zhou , for providing a crypto-selling platform without adequate registration on Dec. 27. The platform had been ordered to cease all digital platforms operating in Malaysia from Dec. 11 onwards, within 14 business days. This also includes Bybit’s website and mobile applications. The company must also cease advertising to Malaysian investors and deactivate its local Telegram support group.

Both Bybit and Zhou have already been included in the SC’s Investor Alert List for similar regulatory offenses since July 2021. Bybit has complied with the enforcement directions, reiterated SC. However, it also cautioned Malaysian investors that trading with unregistered platforms means they are unprotected under the securities laws of Malaysia, making them more susceptible to financial crimes.

Recent market statistics underscored a highly volatile trading session for the meme token, primarily attributable to a declining burn rate and broader trends. Here’s a brief report on why SHIB price cracked over 3% intraday, spreading apprehensiveness among traders and investors globally. Here’s Why Shiba Inu Price Is Falling The Shiba Inu token statistics indicate that the dog-themed meme crypto is facing the heat due to a broader volatile market trend post-U.S. Fed’s hawkish stance with rate cuts and a holiday sentiment brewing. It appears that the investors are keeping distant from the crypto sector amid the holiday mood, reflecting a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. This has weighed on the top meme coins , as evidenced by the recent performance of DOGE, PEPE, and others. Further, even the Shiba Inu burn rate witnessed a 90% decline at the time of reporting, with only 606K tokens burnt. The decline in the burn rate, indicating no substantial reduction in the circulating supply, further aligns with the coin’s waning price action amid a turbulent market. Simultaneously, Coinglass data showed that the meme coin witnessed a substantial drop in futures OI amid the recent market turbulence. SHIB futures OI dropped to $51.84 million as of December 30, indicating a considerable drop in market interest for the asset. This OI drop, coming in tandem with the Shiba Inu price dip, further rationalizes the current momentum. What’s Next For SHIB? At the time of reporting, SHIB price cracked 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00002154. Its intraday low and high were recorded as $0.00002124 and $0.00002239, respectively. Notably, the waning price trajectory falls in line with the aforementioned statistics. However, the token’s intraday trading volume soared 25% to $398.15 million, indicating traders still remain optimistic about the asset despite the market volatility. Simultaneously, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape reveals that a $0.0001 price target might be possible by January 2025, given Bitcoin and the broader market recovery. Further, recent ecosystem developments, such as SHIB: The Metaverse launch and a looming TREAT token launch , have added to a bullish perspective for the token’s long-term prospects.

In a Dec. 29 X post , CryptoBullet, who has over 152k followers, noted that Ethereum is in the process of forming a bull pennant pattern on the 1-day ETH/USDT chart. He expects this pattern to be completed in the coming months, potentially leading to a massive surge to as high as $6,000 within Q1 2025. In technical analysis, a bull pennant pattern forms after an asset experiences an uptrend and typically indicates a potential continuation of the rally. The analyst recalled price action seen in May 2021 when ETH rallied past $4,000 for the first time after breaking out of a similar pattern in Q1 that year. Analyst James CryptoGuru predicted a similar price target for Ethereum based on a technical indicator. He noted that ETH has formed a multi-month bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern throughout 2024, which is expected to be completed by early 2025. If ETH breaks out of this pattern, it could potentially rally to as high as $8,100. Meanwhile, fellow analyst Jelle also anticipates a major breakout for ETH, pointing that Bitcoin dominance has broken down from a multi-year trend. They highlighted that the last time this occurred, ETH’s price quadrupled within approximately five months. You might also like: Ethereum price falls as spot ETF, staking inflows rise The optimistic predictions from these experts align with a surge in the number of ETH long-term holders—those holding the asset for over a year—rising from 59% in January to 75% by the end of 2024. In contrast, BTC long-term holders dropped from 70% to 62% during the same period, according to a Dec. 30 X post from IntoTheBlock, citing its platform’s data . The continued growth in long-term holders could help sustain ETH’s price rally as the asset heads into 2025. Another potential catalyst for an Ethereum rally in Q1 lies in its historical performance patterns following the first quarters of years marked by a U.S. election and a Bitcoin halving cycle. According to CoinGlass data, the first quarter of 2017 and 2021 were among Ether’s best-performing quarters, with recorded gains of 518% and 161%, respectively. Additionally, spot Ether exchange-traded funds have emerged as a major growth driver, witnessing inflows on 22 of the past 24 trading days and accumulating over $2.5 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. The consistent momentum has fueled optimism, with one enthusiastic ETH advocate predicting that Ether ETFs could attract more than $50 billion in net inflows by 2025. Despite the bullish catalysts, the second-largest cryptocurrency could face some downward pressure due to selling activity among large holders. According to data from ITB, whale holder net inflow has dropped significantly, dropping from 220.88k ETH, valued at nearly $737 million on Dec. 23 to just 14.45k ETH valued at nearly $48 million on Dec. 28. The sharp drop in whale investments indicates a potential loss of confidence in the asset’s future gains among large holders. Such a trend could influence retail investors , who often follow the moves of these experienced market participants. At press time, Ether ( ETH ) was up 1%, exchanging hands at $3,413 per coin.

Ether ( ETH ), the second-largest crypto, is predicted to rise above $5,500 in the next 12 months, the report said. ""A combination of institutional, corporate and nation state adoption will propel bitcoin to new heights in 2025,"" wrote Alex Thorn, Galaxy's head of research. Galaxy said it expects five Nasdaq-100 companies and five nation states to say they have added bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds next year, and competition among these countries will drive the next wave of adoption, the report said. The total assets under management (AUM) of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is expected to surpass $250 billion in 2025, Galaxy forecast, and at least one leading wealth management platform will announce a bitcoin allocation of 2% or higher next year. Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) is also expected to boom, Galaxy said. The total amount of BTC locked in DeFi is forecast to double next year from the current $11 billion. The trend of miners pivoting to high-performance computing (HPC) is expected to continue, and more than half of the 20 largest listed bitcoin mining firms will announce deals with artificial intelligence firms (AI) or hyperscalers in 2025, the report added. Bitcoin will reach 20% of gold's market cap next year, the report predicted.

In accordance with the global release of Squid Game Season 2 on Dec. 26, SEND Arcade has decided to release the second installment of Squad Game. According to Magic Eden, Squad Game is a fully online “interactive survival game” where more than 450 players participate in a series of challenges spanning three weeks starting on January 2025. Similar to how Netflix’s Squid Game works, the prize pool will keep increasing as more and more players get eliminated. In the first round of Squad Game, players must choose one out of four symbols: a circle, a triangle, a star or an umbrella. The symbol with the smallest number of choosers will become the Death Symbol and the players who chose it will be eliminated. The second round is called Red Light, Red Light, echoing one of the iconic Squid Game rounds where a giant doll shoots down players who make a move in a twisted version of freeze tag. This round and the ones that follow are still closed from the last Squad Game in September, with a list of winners still shown on a leaderboard. It is still unknown whether the sequel will feature the same games or if new ones will be introduced. It is known that Squid Game Season 2 features old and new games, so it is possible that Squad Games might once again follow in its footsteps.

However, crypto analyst Axel Bitblaze believes this might not lead to a market crash but instead could be another buying opportunity, similar to past Tether FUD events. While the majority of exchanges have stopped operating in the EU this will not create a major impact on crypto despite a short-term correction. 12/ ➔ Conclusion: Tether FUD means buying opportunity, and the same goes for China ban FUD too. Interestingly, you'll either hear these FUDs at the pico bottom or during the full-blown bull run. Do one thing, take screenshots of crypto prices today and then wait till… — Axel Bitblaze (@Axel_bitblaze69) December 29, 2024 What does it mean for crypto? The delisting of USDT is a result of the European Union’s new MiCA regulations , which require stablecoins to follow strict rules on reserves. Tether has failed to meet these requirements, which is why exchanges in the EU are forced to remove it from their platforms. However, this does not mean that USDT will become illegal in the EU. According to the analyst EU crypto investors can still hold USDT in their non-custodial wallets and freely trade them on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The restrictions apply to trading USDT on MiCA-compliant exchanges. Despite the panic, Bitblaze points out that the stablecoin market performance is strong. Hence, if you bought crypto with USDT, there’s no need to worry. USDT continues to maintain its $138.5 billion market cap and $44 billion in daily trading volume, with 80% of its volume originating from Asia. The value of your crypto depends on the coins or tokens you own, not how you bought them. So, whether you use USDT, BTC, or fiat money, your assets are safe in your wallet or on the platform you’re using. The event is more bullish than bearish. Historically it’s Bullish! Bitblaze points out that Tether has faced similar FUD in the past, and each time, the market has bounced back. Going back to the past events, in October 2024, when the U.S. government launched an investigation on Tether, following the news Bitcoin dropped by $2,000 in minutes. However, after Tether’s CEO denied the claims, Bitcoin quickly recovered, rising by 43%. Other FUD events, such as accusations from the UN and attempts to depeg USDT, also caused temporary drops in the market, but these were followed by strong bull runs. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tether Invests $775M in Rumble and Targets AI Domination by 2025 , Is it a Buying Opportunity? Moreover, it is also believed that Tether FUD has historically been a signal for buying opportunities. The analyst concludes that these events typically occur either at the market’s bottom or during a full-blown bull run. He advises crypto investors to take screenshots of current prices and revisit them in February or March 2025, predicting that most assets will be trading much higher by then. Looking at the scenario, USDT is expected to dominate the stablecoin market while its market cap and its demand rise. Even though EU delisting is a setback, it’s unlikely to derail USDT’s long-term success. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Several key fundamentals suggest that this momentum could continue into the new year. While XRP is influenced by general market sentiment, the regulatory landscape will be crucial. Specifically, the upcoming leadership changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the ongoing case between the regulator and Ripple will be pivotal in determining whether XRP can make another attempt at reaching record highs. Currently, XRP is holding above the $2 support level, though market volatility has weighed it down. As of press time, the token was trading at $2.24, down over 5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, XRP is also in the red, down 6%. Despite these recent setbacks, XRP’s post-election breakout has propelled the asset to a remarkable 260% increase year-to-date. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price prediction for 2025 As for the token’s price prediction for 2025, OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o , shared insights regarding what to expect. ChatGPT’s analysis suggested that Ripple’s growth and potential victories in ongoing SEC cases could drive XRP to between $5 and $7, particularly if adoption in cross-border payments accelerates, this being the base case scenario. In a more optimistic case, the AI platform noted that a broad cryptocurrency market bull run and Ripple’s expanded integration with banks might push XRP past $10. There is even a possibility, albeit less likely, that mass adoption and favorable regulations could propel the token to over $20 by 2025. Conversely, lingering regulatory challenges or a downturn in the broader crypto market could see XRP drop to between $1 and $2. While $5 seems to be the most reasonable estimate, according to ChatGPT, such a price target would push XRP’s market cap to nearly $300 billion. XRP’s technical outlook Regarding the technical aspect, cryptocurrency trading expert Armando Pantoja’s analysis in an X post on December 30 suggested that the token will likely hit a target of $3. The analyst noted that while some XRP holders express frustration over the current consolidation, the charts paint a different picture of strength and potential. He pointed out that XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle, a bullish continuation pattern often preceding upward price movement. XRP has stabilized just above the $2 mark, coiling tightly within the triangle. Pantoja indicated a possible breakout could send XRP between $3.20 and $4. XRP price analysis chart.

It is trading well above its 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) of $1.81 and its 200-day SMA of $0.85, pointing to bullish momentum over the medium and long term. However, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 46.95, placing it in a neutral zone—not overbought or oversold—which could suggest a period of consolidation before the next move. In summary, it will be important to watch for a break above the $2.10 level or retest the $1.81 support to determine the next direction in price movement.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 10:10:00
