In 2025, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $7,769.79 and $9,361.58, with an average expected price of $9,199.91. In 2030, ETH could trade between $24,373.71 and $26,740.04, with an average price of $25,417.45. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2024 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,333 Market Cap $401.64B Trading Volume $18.58B Circulating Supply 120.46M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,419 24 Low $3,340 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.15% (High) 50-day SMA $ 3,483.34 200-day SMA $ 3,019.55 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (47%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-Day price chart On December 29, the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) shows bearish momentum, with the price at $3,355.4, below the 20-SMA at $3,754.4. Resistance is positioned at $4,205.7 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies at $3,303.2 (lower Bollinger Band). The RSI is at 43.06, approaching the oversold territory, signaling weak buying momentum. The declining price and volume suggest fading bullish sentiment as the price trends downward. A breakdown below $3,303.2 could push ETH toward the $3,000 psychological level. Conversely, a reversal above the $3,754.4 SMA may reignite bullish momentum, targeting the $4,205.7 resistance. Market caution is advised amid increasing volatility. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart xThe 4-hour chart for Ethereum (ETH) indicates bearish momentum, with the price at $3,344.3, trading below the 20-SMA at $3,360. Resistance is at $3,416.4 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies near $3,303.5 (lower Bollinger Band). The MACD shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line at -10.0 below the signal line at -11.9, signaling declining momentum. The Balance of Power (BoP) is at -1.00, highlighting strong selling pressure. If ETH drops below $3,303.5, it could lead to further declines, while a rebound above $3,360 may provide a chance for recovery. Momentum remains weak, favoring cautious trading.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour ETH/USD charts, Ethereum is exhibiting bearish momentum with limited buying strength. On the daily chart, ETH trades at $3,355.4, below the 20-SMA at $3,754.4, with resistance at $4,205.7 and support at $3,303.2. The RSI near 43 suggests weak momentum, with potential for further downside if $3,303.2 is breached. The 4-hour chart reflects a similar trend, with ETH below the 20-SMA at $3,360 and immediate resistance at $3,416.4. MACD and BoP indicate strong selling pressure. A drop below $3,303.2 could lead to further declines, while a recovery above $3,360 might signal stabilization. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 65,900 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to be in the fifth and final leg of its secular bull market that began about six years ago. The trader practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness five-wave rallies with wave five acting as the final leg up prior to a correction. According to Credible, Bitcoin could witness a parabolic surge in the coming months to complete its fifth and final wave. “So we’re in the final leg of the final leg, in my opinion, of the cycle that started back here in 2018 at $3,000 Bitcoin. Within this final fifth wave, again the idea is that if this final fifth leg up has started, which at this point it seems like it has, it should be rather aggressive… The idea is that this fifth wave should generally be a blow-off top.” Source: Credible Crypto/YouTube The trader is also unveiling his bull market price targets for Bitcoin, predicting that BTC could realistically surge by nearly 60% from current levels before transitioning to a new trend. “We could see this move up very aggressively. And the longer that we take down here to move up, that means the higher we’re going to go. So again, I previously said above $100,000… $150,000 is realistic based on what we’ve seen so far. But we could push up to $200,000. We could even push up to $250,000 with my absolute max for this cycle being $300,000. I don’t think we’ll get close to $300,000 but we could see $200,000 to $220,000. It all just depends on how aggressively we move up and the amount of time we take to move up. The longer that we take to finish off this move, the higher we’re going to go.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $95,075.

Optimistic investors now face the reality that Dogecoin’s $1 race will take much longer than expected. Conversely, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the presale altcoin currently shaking the market, is waxing stronger. Leading analysts now predict the altcoin will cross the $1 mark ahead of Dogecoin in the next three weeks. Dogecoin Price Declines, Pushes $1 Dream Further Away The Dogecoin price has headed south following the current market downtrend. A steady drop in on-chain activities and trading volumes reflects reduced investor interest and engagement, significantly weakening the Dogecoin price. Additionally, with less interest rate cuts than anticipated, a wave of selling-off surges across the crypto market. However, the FOMO created by the bull run following Trump’s election win has begun to die off, resulting in the Dogecoin price’s ongoing correction. Yet, amid this chaos, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin retains its promise of crossing the $1 mark in three weeks. Currently selling at $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surge 4,015%, bringing in gains for investors attentive enough to discern its potential. With a 42% gain recorded across its previous presale stage and an imminent 71% surge, the market is confident that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin will see unprecedented growth. In addition, investors who buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) can now compete for a share of its 20% tokenomics allocated for rewarding early adopters. With their eyes on a 180% APY, investors who buy the altcoin continue to stake it in WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) liquidity pools. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Disrupts The Market With Impressive Presale Run, Set To Cross $1 In 3 Weeks WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to outpace the Dogecoin price in the next three weeks as leading analysts compare the AI altcoin’s fundamentals to Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, which depends on its community sentiment and celebrity endorsements, its revolutionary DeFi wallet, record-breaking presale, and unlimited potential underpin WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) success and massive projections. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has raised over $5 million in its ongoing presale, priced at a mere $0.0243 . The presale is seeing overwhelming support, especially as crypto powerhouses fail to deliver their promise of massive profits. Hence, even Dogecoin price watchers and investors are diversifying massively, buying WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoins in huge tranches of $10,000 and more. WallitIQ (WLTQ), the homonymous DeFi wallet behind the altcoin, is a major factor in the altcoin’s success. Its artificial intelligence and machine learning integration are driving rapid adoption as traders and investors hope to gain the best experience using the DeFi wallet when it launches. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Scan & Pay QR feature , which simplifies DeFi transactions, is one of its most discussed features. Users can simply scan a receiver’s QR code, and the transaction will be completed in seconds, limiting the possibility of sending funds to the wrong wallet address. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also offers a Fully DeFi mode, which allows users to trade their cryptocurrencies in a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer environment. Unarguably, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the most promising altcoin in the market right now. This powerful altcoin is swiftly taking over the crypto wallet and AI market, enabling investors to trade more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies directly within their wallets. Its smart contract audit by SolidProof , a revered smart contract auditing firm, also strongly fuels the presale’s success. Investors who linger will struggle to keep pace with WallitIQ (WLTQ) as this presale altcoin delivers life-changing 4,015% gains to profit-takers. Conclusion The shifting dynamics of the crypto market underscore the volatility that investors must navigate as the Dogecoin price $1 milestone becomes increasingly elusive. However, the emerging WallitIQ (WLTQ) $0.0243 altcoin offers a compelling narrative of rapid growth. Seasoned and new investors are reconsidering their strategies, competing for the fortunes this altcoin will bring. So gear up; buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin now at $0.0243 and position for generational wealth in 2025 and beyond.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 21:03:00

Total funds from whales have topped a six-month high, spiking sell pressure this week. XRP price has plunged 3% today and 5% over the week, with traders flagging low sentiments. New CryptoQuant data shows over 2.6 billion XRP were deposited on Binance in the last 30 days. This change in dynamics continues as the asset records a sharp decline after soaring to levels not seen in months above a $140 billion market cap. The increased amount of XRP on centralized exchanges ignited major sell-offs, which became the highest whale value since April 2024. Cryptowhale movements to centralized exchanges tend to crash the prices of most assets due to the size of holdings. Exchange flows determine the strength and weakness of the bull cycle, showing trader sentiment. This becomes a bearish phase based on the ease of sale out of exchanges. “ This is the highest amount of XRP deposited by large holders since April 2024, showing a noticeable increase in activity among whales. The large inflows suggest that big XRP holders are actively transferring XRP over the network, and interact with Binance as an exchange. Whale deposits can often signal potential shifts in strategy, as these players have significant amounts of assets at their disposal.” What’s Next For XRP? XRP has lost a significant chunk of gains in the past few weeks after flipping Tether as the third-largest coin by market cap. This led to positive projections as bulls set sights on an all-time high. Recent headwinds have lowered traders’ expectations, although bulls set sights on gains amid institutional activities. Institutional traders are drawn to XRP because of its cross-border payment potential as global crypto adoption soars. Furthermore, Ripple has made significant strides to boost XRP and advance payments globally. This year, Ripple launched RLUSD, joining the stablecoin space with partnerships with multiple exchanges. The company also announced a collaboration to roll out the premier tokenized money fund on the XRP Ledger. Aside from global partnerships, XRP is expected to soar based on a surge in other top assets. Bitcoin’s latest drive above $100K and upward movement since the U.S. elections has sparked altcoins. According to commentators, altcoins are on the verge of a major rally, citing previous cycles.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-29 21:09:47

Under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules , set to take full effect tomorrow, the EU has made it crystal clear that Tether’s $102 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries aren’t good enough for their taste. Instead, they’re demanding that stablecoin issuers back their tokens with at least 60% reserves held in fiat within EU-regulated banks. If that isn’t a loud and flashy rejection of American financial dominance, what is? MiCA rules: Control disguised as compliance MiCA’s framework claims to be about safety, security, and trust. Stablecoin issuers need to jump through hoops like obtaining licenses, ensuring reserves match tokens, and complying with consumer protection measures. All fair enough, right? Except this isn’t about fair play—it’s about control. Let’s be real. By ignoring Tether’s U.S. Treasuries as valid collateral, the EU is effectively saying it doesn’t trust the backbone of the American financial system. Those Treasuries represent some of the most stable assets in the world. But no, the EU wants euros, and it wants them in its banks. It’s not hard to see the politics at play here. Tether hasn’t been officially labeled non-compliant—yet. But with no clear guidance, exchanges like Coinbase are already delisting USDT in anticipation. Binance and Crypto.com are holding out for now, but we all know now that the clock is ticking. If Tether can’t meet these requirements fast, its removal from European platforms could be devastating for crypto liquidity. The EU’s quiet rebellion By demanding a 60% reserve in EU fiat held within its borders, the bloc is effectively rejecting U.S. debt as a trustworthy backing. This is about moving the balance of power. The EU has been desperate to carve out a bigger slice of the global financial system for years, and stablecoins are their latest target. The implications are massive. If Tether decides the cost of compliance is too high and exits the EU market, other stablecoin issuers will likely face the same choice. USDC, for instance, might have gotten ahead of the curve by securing compliance, but it’s no secret that similar regulations could follow elsewhere. Without USDT, liquidity fragmentation becomes a real problem. Markets will slow down, fees will rise, and efficiency will take a hit. The irony? The EU’s power play would backfire spectacularly. By pushing USDT out, they’re also risking their own relevance in the global crypto market. The U.S., under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, is about to become a haven for innovation, pulling talent and capital away from Europe. If that happens, the EU might have won the battle but it’d have lost the war.",OP-ED|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-29 21:20:59

LINK currently hovers around $21 having failed to move past $26 despite recent uptrends. During this price fall, LINK whales have adopted an accumulation approach signaling confidence in the altcoin’s long-term profitability. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Could Crash 30% To $15 — Here’s How Chainlink Whales Acquire 3.58 Million LINK In 3 Days Following a strong bullish performance in early December, the crypto market has undergone a significant correction in the past two weeks attributed to several factors including a flash crash price and potential reductions of Fed rate cuts in 2025. As this corrective market persists, blockchain analytics company Santiment has reported an accumulation spree by LINK whales holding between 1 million-10 million LINK. In an X post on December 28, Santiment states that these large LINK holders have purchased 3.58 million LINK valued at $76.9 million over the past three days. Generally, significant levels of whale accumulation are indicated as bullish signals as these large token holders are confident of future gains. In the case of a price decline such as this, these massive accumulation levels reflect the belief that LINK is currently undervalued with a potential market rebound on the horizon. Related Reading: Chainlink And AAVE Surge After Trump’s Crypto Project Invests In Both Key Resistance Levels For LINK While high levels of whale accumulation are one sign of an impending price rally, analysis platform More Crypto Online has shared another positive insight on the LINK market. According to a recent X post, these market analysts state Chainlink still maintains an uptrend on larger time frames despite’s recent correction with its major support level set at $17.65. Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, If the LINK’s price holds above this level, the altcoin is predicted to rise to $69 in line with the expected third wave of the current market cycle. However, for confirmation of a price uptrend, Chainlink must break through resistance levels at $25.10 and $28.30. A decisive five-wave move above these levels would solidify the bullish case and suggest further price appreciation. In Elliott Wave theory, the five-wave structure is a reliable pattern indicating a strong trend continuation, making the breakthrough of these resistance levels pivotal for the ongoing rally. At the time of writing, Chainlink trades at $21.90 reflecting a 1.44% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 12.55% and valued at $726.44 million. With a market cap of $13.96 billion, LINK is ranked as the 13th largest cryptocurrency.

This follows a wider market correction that saw over $1.6 billion wiped out of the ecosystem. Sharp declines have lowered trader momentum against previous bullish projections after Bitcoin (BTC) moved past $90K. Cardano slipped the highest among the top 10 crypto assets by market cap over the past 48 hours. The community dubbed ETH killer trades at $0.86, falling 4.7%, with its market cap slightly above $30.4 billion. ADA has decreased 18% in the last seven days, extending losses after previous gains. Despite reduced retail and institutional upward movements, the asset has held on to monthly gains picked up after the United States Presidential elections. Crypto users share conflicting opinions about the wider market’s recovery pace going into the new year. Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hack Spiked Fears Cardano’s downtrend heightened after the hack of the foundation’s X (formerly Twitter) account. The account was compromised on Dec 8 with the bad actors promoting a fake token as well as other false claims. A major point was the fake ADAsol token, which claimed to have ceased support for ADA. The scam token generated $500,000 before it slumped 99%. Malicious actors also claimed to have been slammed by a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Users were advised not to interact with links from the page following the incident. “ The Cardano Foundation regrets to inform our community that we have been served with a lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 8, 2024. In light of this unexpected legal action, we have made the difficult decision to immediately cease all support toward the ADA token to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,” the hackers wrote. A Slow Ecosystem The last 48 hours shown multiple crypto assets losing gains recorded in previous weeks. A glance at decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers also shows a similar downward trajectory. The total value locked (TVL) on Cardano plunged 21% from an all-time high of $708 million. As platforms lost numbers, overall transactions plunged, leading to the status quo. The crypto ecosystem has seen about $1.6 billion in liquidations since the last dip. Daily trading volumes are also in the red zone, although slight institutional numbers were recorded.

The European regulators have not expressly stated if USDT meets the new compliance guidelines. MiCA Uncertainty Surrounds USDT However, Coinbase, the U.S. leading crypto exchange, delisted USDT from its European services earlier this month in an anticipatory move. Coinbase cited the MiCA regulatory compliance guidelines as the reason for the delisting. Other major exchanges, such as Binance and Crypto.com, have continued to offer USDT to its users in Europe. This has generated speculation about the true status of one of the world’s dominant stablecoins. With no clear policy statement from the regulators on MiCA and USDT, market participants have been left guessing. The statement from a MiCA Crypto Alliance’s Technical Committee member did little to provide any clear stance. Juan Ignacio Ibañez, while commenting on the situation, maintained that no regulator has proclaimed USDT non-compliant. Ibañez, however, stated that the absence of a clear proclamation does not imply that USDT is compliant. Tether’s Strategic Moves Amid Uncertainty Analysts have warned that Tether’s refusal to comply with the MiCA regulations might affect Europe’s market . Notably, users in the region could experience major disruptions and weaken Europe’s status as a hub for crypto innovation. Additionally, an official ban on USDT might result in soaring costs for traders and impact market liquidity. Interestingly, a financial analyst, Jacob King, observed that Tether had not minted new coins in over two weeks. King believes the impact of this and an official ban could cause significant disruptions. Amid the uncertainty, Tether has invested in European stablecoin company StablR. StablR, licensed in Malta, issues Euro and U.S. dollar stablecoins. The move by Tether suggests a strategic development to maintain a foothold in the EU market. What Lies Ahead for Tether? Meanwhile, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has justified the company’s operational practices, noting that they have not violated any known guidelines. Ardoino emphasized the company remains focused on network collaborations and USDT’s practical uses in the market. The next few hours might unfold new developments and clarify MiCA and the USDT episode.

Cardano’s $1 Dream Crushed? 4.3 Billion ADA Wall Blocks the Way Cardano is struggling to reach the $1 mark due to a large sell wall of 4.3 billion ADA, purchased at an average price of $1.03, according to IntoTheBlock data. Approximately 309,450 addresses holding ADA in the $0.947 to $1.09 range are currently at a loss, which could impede any potential price increases. Currently, Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.92, down 9.4% over the past week amid ongoing selling pressure in the crypto market. If the price drops further, support is anticipated between $0.659 and $0.834, as 238,860 addresses that bought within this range are likely to step in and buy again. XLM Plunges 16%: Can It Recover? Key Support Level at Risk Stellar (XLM) is currently trading at $0.38, reflecting a 7.9% drop in the past week. However, recent analysis indicates that it might be set for a price increase, according to market analysts. They spotted a potential buy signal on XLM’s daily chart. Nevertheless, there’s a key factor to watch. XLM needs to maintain the $0.33 support to attract more buyers and stabilize the market. A drop below this level could indicate a downward trend, complicating recovery. This uncertainty has led many XLM investors to explore other investment opportunities.

By publicly sharing seed phrases, scammers set up bait wallets that entangle opportunists in a deceptive scheme designed to exploit their attempts to steal funds. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky’s latest findings, scammers post crypto wallet seed phrases on YouTube comments using newly created accounts. Initial Bait The scheme begins with a comment under a finance-related video from someone claiming to need help transferring USDT, a stablecoin, to another wallet. They reveal their full seed phrase, essentially sharing the key to their wallet, which seems suspicious at first glance. This act of sharing a seed phrase is a red flag, as it is the gateway to accessing and controlling the funds in a wallet. Kaspersky revealed that the comment looks something like this: “I have a question. I have USDT stored in my wallet, and I have the seed phrase. How to transfer my funds to another wallet?” Upon further investigation, Kaspersky said that similar comments were posted from newly created accounts, each containing identical recovery phrases and requests for assistance. The scam assumes that an unscrupulous person, rather than offering help, might take advantage of the situation. With access to the seed phrase, they can open the wallet, which might contain a significant sum of cryptocurrency – in this case, the equivalent of $8,000 in USDT. However, the scammers have set a trap. The wallet is actually a multi-signature one, requiring multiple approvals to authorize transactions. When a thief attempts to transfer USDT, they discover that the wallet lacks enough TRX to cover the transaction fee. When the thief tries to send TRX from their own wallet, the tokens are rerouted to a completely different wallet. This clever setup ensures that even the most opportunistic thief cannot easily steal the funds. Trap For The Greedy Kaspersky’s investigation reveals that the scam primarily targets other criminals, tricking them into becoming the victims. By impersonating inexperienced crypto users, the scammers deceive thieves into attempting to steal funds that they ultimately cannot access. “So, the scammers are impersonating beginners who foolishly share access to their cryptowallets, tricking equally naive thieves – who end up becoming the victims. In this scenario, the scammers are something like digital Robin Hoods, as the scheme primarily targets other crooked individuals.” The post Crypto Scammers Bait Thieves with Public Seed Phrases in New Scheme: Kaspersky appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Crypto Scams,EN,0,0,TRX|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-29 22:10:03

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE.

What started as a meme in the crypto world has transformed into a multi-billion dollar phenomenon, drawing in investors from all walks of life. But let’s be real, some meme coins seem to be fading out, and others are absolutely blowing up. One of those “blowing up” coins right now is BTFD Coin . While SPX6900 may have had its moment, it’s clear that the ongoing viral meme coin presale of BTFD is making waves like no other. Now, why is BTFD Coin grabbing so much attention? Well, it’s not just your average meme coin. BTFD is bringing something new to the table, like its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, staking rewards, and a mind-blowing 90% APY on staking. All of these features are creating a perfect storm of hype and potential returns. As SPX6900 seems to have run out of steam, BTFD is clearly picking up the pace, and investors are already seeing gains. In this article, we’re going to take a deeper look at BTFD Coin and SPX6900, examining why the former is taking the meme coin world by storm and why the latter is starting to look like old news. BTFD Coin: Taking Meme Coins to the Next Level BTFD Coin is the meme coin everyone’s talking about, and if you haven’t been paying attention, now’s the time to start. The ongoing viral meme coin presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 60 billion coins to over 7000 holders. And guess what? The presale isn’t even close to being over yet. In fact, we’re only in Stage 13, and the price has already skyrocketed from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin. That’s a staggering increase, but analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 by the end of the presale. So, yeah, the hype is real. So what makes BTFD Coin so unique compared to other meme coins like SPX6900? It’s the complete ecosystem BTFD is building. First off, BTFD has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that went live in Stage 10 of the presale. Sure, the beta version of the game doesn’t offer rewards yet, but it’s already a glimpse of what’s coming. When the game is fully live, players will be able to earn rewards while having fun. It’s an innovative approach that’s bringing more utility to the meme coin space. But it doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin also offers a 90% APY on staking, which is a total game-changer. Staking went live on December 2, and now investors can put their BTFD coins to work and earn passive income. With staking offering a 90% APY, that means your BTFD holdings can grow significantly while you just sit back and watch it happen. No wonder the presale is so popular! Another attractive feature is the BTFD Coin referral program. This allows early investors to earn rewards for bringing new people into the community. It’s a win-win situation that’s helping to spread the word and bring even more attention to the project. And of course, there’s the Bulls Squad —a community of dedicated supporters who are given exclusive updates, rewards, and special access. This gives investors a sense of belonging and makes them feel like they’re part of something bigger. SPX6900: Is It Already Yesterday’s News? SPX6900 had its time in the spotlight, no doubt about it. But lately, it seems like the presale has lost steam. While meme coins like BTFD Coin are racing ahead with innovative features and an engaged community, SPX6900’s presale numbers just aren’t showing the same level of excitement. Sure, it still has some loyal followers, but it’s not drawing the kind of attention that BTFD is. Why is that? Well, the biggest issue here is that SPX6900 doesn’t seem to offer much in terms of long-term value or utility. While meme coins were originally created as jokes, BTFD Coin has taken things to the next level by building an ecosystem that goes beyond just being a meme. With features like the Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and referral programs, BTFD is creating a much more compelling reason for people to invest. SPX6900, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have the same kind of strategy for future growth. And without that, it’s starting to look like an old news story. When you compare the presale performance, it’s clear that SPX6900 is lagging behind. Investors are looking for projects with potential, and BTFD Coin is delivering on that front, while SPX6900 is left scrambling to keep up. In a world where investors are always searching for the next big thing, BTFD Coin has proven that it’s more than just hype—it’s a legitimate opportunity to make serious gains. While SPX6900 might have had its chance, it’s safe to say that its moment has passed. The Ongoing Viral Meme Coin Presale: Why BTFD Is the One to Watch So why is BTFD Coin’s ongoing viral meme coin presale such a big deal? It’s simple: the potential for massive gains. As mentioned, the presale price has already risen from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin, and analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 before the presale ends. With four stages still remaining, that’s a huge opportunity for anyone who’s looking to invest. Let’s break this down with an investment example. By investing $25,000 in BTFD coins during Stage 13 at the current price of $0.000142 per coin, you would receive approximately 176,056,338 coins. However, by applying the BIG50 bonus code, you’ll receive 50% more coins, bringing your total to 264,084,507 coins. When the presale concludes and the price increases to $0.0006 per coin, your investment without the BIG50 code would be worth around $105,633.80. With the BIG50 bonus, your investment would grow to a value of approximately $158,450.70, offering an additional $52,816.90 in potential earnings. This presents a great opportunity to enhance your investment as the presale progresses. But the real beauty of the BTFD Coin presale lies in its potential beyond the presale. With its Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY on staking , and referral program, the value of BTFD Coin is only going to increase as the project continues to grow. Analysts are predicting a bright future for BTFD, and early investors are already seeing the benefits. Now is the time to get in on this ongoing viral meme coin presale before it’s too late. BTFD Coin is moving fast, and with analysts predicting a surge in price, you’ll want to be on the winning side of this one. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the BTFD Coin Presale BTFD Coin is a meme coin with real potential, and the ongoing viral meme coin presale is the perfect opportunity to get in early. With features like a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and an engaging referral program, BTFD Coin is setting itself up for long-term success. Meanwhile, SPX6900 seems to be fading into the background, with its presale losing steam and investors looking elsewhere for the next big thing. If you want to be part of the next big wave in the meme coin space, now’s the time to act. With over $4.6 million raised in the presale and the price already on the rise, there’s no better time to jump in. Don’t let this opportunity slip away—join the BTFD Coin presale today and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity before it’s too late!

In recent years, we have seen huge attention from large corporations towards Bitcoin, the celebrated currency for years as decentralized and peer-to-peer. It was the currency’s ability to function outside of central banks, governments, and large financial institutions that attracted people toward Bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency owned and used by anyone anywhere in the world without the help of an intermediary. The increasing interest and participation of major corporations in the Bitcoin ecosystem raise concerns about its future in terms of decentralization and freedom. Rising corporate influence on Bitcoin Now, many giant corporations include Bitcoin on their balance sheets. According to CoinGecko companies like MicroStrategy hold over 444,262 Bitcoins, while Marathon Digital holds over 26,842. Marathon Digital is a Bitcoin mining company and owns 40,435 Bitcoins. Even Tesla holds 11,509 bitcoins. In addition, Galaxy Digital holding companies with over 15,449 Bitcoins, Coinbase holds over 9,183 Bitcoins, Bitcoin mining companies like CleanSpark hold around 6,154 Bitcoins, and Hut 8 also holds 9,102 Bitcoins and many more. This rising corporate involvement is an indicator of how Bitcoin is gaining importance in business strategies-whether as a store of value, hedge against inflation, or financial diversification tool. These companies can hold a big portion of the total supply since they acquire Bitcoin. For the simple fact that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, there’s the likelihood that a few companies own a large portion of Bitcoin that could significantly alter what the original intention of Bitcoin is-to be decentralized to everyone. Bitcoin becoming centralized This means that one of the most important concerns with this increase in corporate ownership is the potential centralization of Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Marathon Digital Holdings are buying ever more Bitcoin, and their reserves may eventually comprise a significant percentage of the overall supply. This may give these companies significant market power, which could lead to price manipulation and increased market volatility. If a few entities control large amounts of Bitcoin, they can buy or sell at will, which affects the price and causes fluctuations. Instead of Bitcoin as an open source currency that is free to be traded by any user and is almost a new tool for market control, it could be the means of giving power to a small group of corporate interests. Some corporations not only hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset but also engage actively in the mining process. Domination on Bitcoin mining It requires large quantities of cheap energy, the larger corporations can thus be able to invest heftily in mining, meaning they have the capacity of controlling a large proportion of the network’s mining power. This may have a result of centralization, which was initially what decentralization and accessibility aimed to achieve. The issue of mining centralization has been a long-term worry within the Bitcoin community. Early on, Bitcoin mining was an activity that someone with the right hardware could undertake. This, however, changed quite quickly as mining became challenging and its rewards attractive to professionalize the activity in question. Today, most mining is dominated by big companies that have the requisite resources to invest in more powerful, specialized equipment or secure cheap energy. Consequently, this centralization of power in mining leads to decisions that go into place on the Bitcoin network, as changes to protocol and even the general direction of future development. Staking may centralize Bitcoin control There are even more firms starting to participate in Bitcoin staking, even though Bitcoin does not use a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Some newer platforms support staking of users’ Bitcoin and reward the stakes held by users. If such services become more widespread and dominated by a few large corporate players, then centralization of control over the Bitcoin network will continue. This would allow these companies to decide how Bitcoin is used and to make money from the network, thereby having more control over the entire system. As more companies get involved, it becomes a serious concern for the future freedom of Bitcoin. Threat of Increased Regulatory Control This also increases the possibility of having greater regulatory pressure. Such enormous sums of Bitcoin held by corporations would mean an easy opportunity for governments to bring in strict regulations upon this asset. Such regulations could undermine the decentralized character of Bitcoin by forcing corporate holders to comply with state mandates in the form of KYC and AML requirements . This would make a scenario where Bitcoin is not an asset free from the governmental oversight but one with regulation, which may defeat the very core values for decentralization and freedom. The future of Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intertwined with the interests of large corporations. As the Bitcoin network keeps changing, so too will the community, regulators, and corporations realize that rising concentration of Bitcoin ownership means a lot to it. The potential for centralization, whether through corporate ownership or mining, could shift Bitcoin away from its original mission. If the power over Bitcoin remains in just a few people’s pockets, the dream of financial freedom might go down in flames. Therefore, continued decentralization must be addressed to maintain what Bitcoin was originally brought forth to become a resource for personal freedom and free access rather than corporative manipulation.

That’s a 50% increase from 2024, but still less than the roughly $30 billion “that was invested in 2021 and 2022,” he added. 2023 and 2024 recap Le described 2023 as a challenging year for crypto funding due to the collapse of FTX, erosion of trust, and higher interest rates. However, 2024 started strong with positive momentum driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs getting approved. Despite a slowdown mid-year, “we’re probably going to end [2024] at somewhere between $11 [billion] and $12 billion of invested capital, which is still 10 to 20% more than 2023,” he said. You might also like: Polymarket odds of Trump approving strategic Bitcoin reserves fall to 27% 2025 Funding Expectations Le’s projection of $18 billion or more in crypto VC funding is a 50% increase compared to 2024. Several factors bode well for the sector, he says. They include: Generalist investors are regaining interest, signaling potential large-scale investments. Crypto-native funds have significant dry powder but require generalist participation for substantial growth. Financial institutions will play a pivotal role by leveraging their trusted relationships with regulators. Shifting focus Le anticipates a shift in focus toward application-layer investments, moving beyond infrastructure projects. Examples include: Decentralized applications (dApps) targeting non-crypto users with better risk management. Use cases leveraging crypto infrastructure for non-crypto sectors such as mobility and energy data. The analogy of AWS serving as a base for companies like Uber and Airbnb highlights the need for robust applications atop crypto infrastructure to realize its full potential, Le argues. The benefit of ‘nothing’ Le emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry’s growth. He expressed cautious optimism about the U.S. regulatory environment in 2025, noting: A shift in SEC leadership under the incoming Trump administration could result in fewer enforcement actions. Legislative progress, such as stablecoin bills or crypto-specific rules, would be beneficial but is not guaranteed. Even a lack of new regulatory actions could be an improvement over the past two years of uncertainty. Le concluded that a stable regulatory environment, coupled with growing institutional involvement and application-focused investments, could set the stage for significant advancements in the crypto sector in 2025. But even if the next presidential administration and incoming lawmakers “do nothing,” Le says, “that is already an improvement.” For the full interview, see below.

In the midst of this evolving storyline, a disruptive entity, RCO Finance (RCOF), rises as a strong competitor, presenting a new take on decentralized finance (DeFi) through a combination of inventive features and progressive technology. Stellar Vs Ripple: Rivalry Intensifies As XLM Gears Up For Price Rally Recent examination by cryptocurrency specialist Ali Martinez reveals a positive signal for Stellar, suggesting a possible price turnaround after a significant correction driven by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The analyst recently pointed out that the Tom Demark (TD) sequential indicator has indicated a buy on XLM’s daily chart, implying that if the $0.33 support level remains intact, a price recovery could be forthcoming. At present, Stellar is priced at $0.37, slightly above this important level. Even with significant losses across different periods—4% in 24 hours, 8% in a week, and 23% in 14 days—Stellar continues to hold nearly 200% gains year-to-date. Conversely, Ripple’s XRP has shown greater strength, experiencing smaller declines of 2% and 4% during comparable times, while achieving an impressive monthly increase of roughly 60% that has brought one of the biggest altcoins in the market nearer to its all-time peaks. Although Stellar has lagged behind Ripple in recent months, the buy signal from the TD sequential indicator may create an opportunity for a comeback, enabling Stellar to narrow the gap with its rival. Moreover, market specialist CW has observed a bullish flag formation for Ripple’s competitor Stellar, predicting a possible target price of $0.82 after a breakout—close to its historical high of $0.87 achieved almost seven years prior. With the increasing positivity regarding Stellar and Ripple, RCO Finance is grabbing attention. Currently in its presale stage, RCO Finance has already secured close to $10 million, garnering interest for its unique strategy in DeFi. Now in the fourth phase of its presale, RCOF is set for considerable expansion, with estimates indicating a rise of almost 200%, anticipating the RCOF price to hit $0.214. So, what distinguishes RCO Finance from well-known entities such as Ripple and Stellar? AI Magic Unleashed To begin with, RCO Finance utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to offer an extensive range of financial products, making both traditional and decentralized finance accessible to all. The platform provides services like staking, yield farming, lending, and token swapping, all within a safe environment. A distinctive aspect of RCO Finance is its Robo Advisor powered by AI. This instrument functions as an automated investment manager, evaluating vast market information to provide customized investment strategies suited to each user’s financial objectives and risk preferences. Additionally, RCO Finance provides support for more than 120,000 digital assets spanning 12,500 asset classes, such as stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and derivatives. This wide access enables regular investors to diversify their portfolios, representing a major change from conventional models that frequently leave retail investors out of high-liquidity assets. RCO Finance’s Bullish Surge Post-Exchange Debut – Get Ready! RCO Finance also prioritizes user privacy by functioning on a Know-Your-Customer (KYC)-free platform, allowing for anonymous transactions. The governance framework promotes community involvement, enabling token holders to impact significant platform modifications and nurturing a feeling of ownership. As RCO Finance gets ready to debut on major exchanges, experts anticipate a spike in its price, possibly hitting between $0.40 and $0.50 soon after its launch. This offers a rare chance for initial investors to take advantage of the present positive market sentiment. Conclusion In summary, although Stellar and Ripple seek to strengthen their stance in the challenging blockchain payment landscape, RCO Finance is poised to challenge the existing norms with its groundbreaking solutions. With the market undergoing its bullish cycle led by Ripple and XRP’s performance, RCO Finance offers fascinating prospects for investors looking for expansion in the ever-changing realm of cryptocurrency.

Amidst this chaos, some stellar projects like Web3Bay, SUI, and Solana are not just playing the game; they’re changing the rules.

Why Sui Is One Of The Best Crypto Gems To Invest In Right Now SUI is making waves, surging 12.8% from recent lows, fueled by game-changing partnerships with Phantom Wallet and Babylon Labs. Its price spike to about $4.60—just shy of its $5.00 peak—is driven by a bustling chain activity, with TVL in Sui’s contracts nearing a whopping $1.8 billion and daily transactions maintaining a robust $400 to $600 million. Solana: Mirroring Bitcoin’s Rally with Potential for New Highs Solana is stealing the spotlight, echoing Bitcoin’s rally with an upward trajectory that hints at explosive gains ahead. Market watchers whisper of new peaks by early 2025, propelled by rising adoption and spirited trading volumes in a bullish altcoin environment.

According to the analyst, technical analysis of the XRP price on the weekly timeframe suggests that XRP is on track to reach a price target of $15 by May 5, 2025. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The analysis, which is rooted in Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave theory, offers a long-term bullish outlook for the altcoin despite its recent decline over the past week. This is because the XRP price has been on a decline since the past seven days alongside the rest of the crypto market. Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis For XRP According to Egrag Crypto, the Fibonacci 1.618 level indicates that May 5, 2025, could be a pivotal date for XRP’s price trajectory in the long term. His technical analysis uses auto-Fib time zones and trend-based Fibonacci on the weekly XRP timeframe price chart. Interestingly, this timeline aligns closely with the general sentiment surrounding XRP, as many crypto participants are currently looking forward to a surge in the first half of 2025. As such, the analyst also noted that it remains uncertain whether the predicted surge to $15 will occur before or after this predicted date. Speaking of price timeline, the $15 target is based on actual calculations and the Elliot Wave theory. According to the analyst, XRP is currently in Wave 4, which is the second corrective phase in the Elliot Wave theory. Once this phase is completed, Wave 5 is expected to be the next major move. Wave 5 is traditionally known for being the third impulse wave that pushes the asset’s price to new highs. To estimate the magnitude of Wave 5, the analyst examined the performance of the previous impulse waves 1 and 3. Notably, Waves 1 and 3 were highlighted by price increases of 63.39% and 570%, respectively. Using these figures, Egrag Crypto applied a common Elliott Wave principle that suggests Wave 5 often equals 61.8% of the combined gains of Waves 1 and 3. By applying this school of thought and punching in the numbers, Wave 5 is expected to result in an approximate price increase of around 391% for XRP. In terms of a price target, this translates to a price range around $15. Is A Long-Term Bullish Trajectory Still Valid For XRP? Despite XRP’s current decline over the past seven days, mirroring a broader market downturn, this technical analysis provides a counterpoint to the short-term bearish outlook. Particularly, XRP has been on a decline since it peaked at $2.82 on December 3. Related Reading: XRP Forms Bullish Flag Pattern: What’s Next For The Altcoin?

CoinMarketCap data reveals that the total market cap for memecoins was $120.14 billion on Dec. 1. It peaked at $137.06 billion on Dec. 9 before plunging to a low of $92.67 billion on Dec. 23, marking a 32.38% decline within the month. As of now, memecoins’ market capitalization stands at $98.72 billion, down 18% from its value at the start of December. Pepe and Exchange Listings Propel Early December Surge Pepe (PEPE), the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, mirrored the broader market’s fluctuations. According to Cointelegraph Markets Pro, Pepe’s price climbed to $0.000026 on Dec. 9 before dropping to $0.000017 by Dec. 20. On Dec. 4, Binance.US listed Pepe, driving the token to an all-time high and surpassing Uniswap’s token (UNI) in market capitalization by Dec. 7. Pepe’s market cap grew from $591 million at the start of 2024 to over $11 billion following the listing, representing an 18x increase. Coinbase also listed memecoins such as Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF) in December. Traders Profit Big from Pepe’s Rise Throughout 2024, savvy traders capitalized on Pepe’s meteoric rise. In April, a crypto trader who invested $3,000 in Pepe saw their holdings grow to $46 million within a month as the token surged over 15,000 times in value. In December, another trader who purchased $27 worth of Pepe and went dormant for 600 days transferred $52 million worth of tokens to a new wallet.

It’s a massive financial revolution, flipping the script on traditional investments like stocks and real estate. Over the years, projects like Binance, Render, and now Qubetics presale have taken centre stage in the crypto world. These aren’t just coins; they’re powerful ecosystems reshaping how we think about wealth, investments, and financial freedom. Qubetics is the newest kid on the block, but don’t be fooled by its fresh face. With its staggering presale performance and jaw-dropping price predictions, it’s clear $TICS is here to disrupt the scene. Ready to deep-dive into why Qubetics, Binance, and Render are leading the charge as the best cryptos for exponential returns? Buckle up. Qubetics: Where Innovation Meets Investment Powerhouse Qubetics is more than just another coin in the crowded crypto market. It’s a future-forward blockchain project shaking up how people interact with digital assets. Since its launch, Qubetics has smashed milestone after milestone. In its 14th presale stage, over 385 million $TICS tokens have already been sold to 12,400+ holders, raising a whopping $8.1 million. The price of $TICS currently sits at $0.037, and it’s set to jump 10% this weekend—so you better act fast. But what really sets Qubetics apart? Its Multi-Chain Wallet. Imagine managing all your crypto assets—whether Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana—from a single, seamless interface. This is a game-changer for businesses, professionals, and anyone tired of juggling countless apps and wallets. For instance, a digital artist could accept payments on Ethereum for their NFTs, pay vendors using Binance Smart Chain, and stake Solana—all without switching platforms. It’s a dream come true for anyone navigating the fragmented crypto universe. Now, let’s talk about those wild predictions. Analysts are buzzing about $TICS hitting $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a 630% ROI. Post-presale, it’s expected to jump to $1 (that’s 2820% ROI) and could skyrocket to $15 after the mainnet launch—an eye-popping 43711% ROI. To put this into perspective, a $1000 investment today could turn into $43,711. Mind-blowing, right? If you’re wondering what makes Qubetics one of the best cryptos for exponential returns, this is it. Binance: The Veteran Giant Still Making Waves Binance isn’t just a cryptocurrency exchange; it’s the backbone of the industry. Since its inception in 2017, Binance has become the largest and most trusted exchange worldwide, offering everything from spot trading to staking, NFTs, and even loans. What makes Binance so appealing to investors? It’s all about reliability and utility. BNB, Binance’s native token, has grown from a simple utility coin to one of the top-performing crypto assets. Take a step back and think about the last bull run. BNB started as a mere $0.10 token and surged past $600 at its peak. That’s a staggering 600,000% ROI. Binance’s continuous innovation, such as its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) and low trading fees, has kept its loyal user base hooked. And with its DeFi projects and growing influence in blockchain gaming, Binance continues to serve the appetite for crypto investments among newcomers and veterans alike. Investing in Binance is like investing in the backbone of the crypto market. It’s not just about buying into a token; it’s about owning a piece of a thriving ecosystem. And while Qubetics and Render are rising stars, Binance remains a go-to for anyone looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Render: Powering the Future of Digital Creation Render might not have the global fame of Binance, but among creators and tech enthusiasts, it’s a heavyweight. Render token (RNDR) serves a very niche but rapidly growing market: decentralised GPU rendering. In plain English? It’s about enabling creators to render their 3D content—think movies, games, and VR experiences—in a faster, cheaper, and decentralised way. Imagine a small indie game studio accessing the same rendering power as a billion-dollar company. That’s Render’s mission. Since its launch, Render has attracted a strong following among digital artists, studios, and developers. Its use case is crystal clear, and its growth potential is massive. Think about it: as metaverses and VR tech explode, the demand for rendering will hit the stratosphere. By holding RNDR tokens, investors are betting on the future of creative tech. Render’s tokenomics are another reason why it’s one of the best cryptos for exponential returns. RNDR’s capped supply and growing demand from its expanding user base create a perfect storm for price appreciation. Plus, it’s aligned with the shift toward eco-friendly blockchain solutions, making it even more appealing in a world focused on sustainability. Why Qubetics Is Stealing the Spotlight While Binance and Render are rock-solid projects, Qubetics is the rising star with unmatched potential. Its Multi-Chain Wallet is a standout feature, solving real-world problems for crypto users. Imagine a freelance graphic designer getting paid in Ethereum but needing to convert some funds to Solana for staking rewards. With Qubetics, that’s no hassle. Or picture a small business accepting payments in various cryptocurrencies without needing multiple wallets. That’s the kind of utility that’ll keep $TICS relevant for years to come. And then there’s the presale. With $8.1 million raised and over 12,400 holders already on board, the momentum is undeniable. At $0.037 per token, the entry point is still ridiculously attractive. But don’t sleep on it because prices will surge by 10% this weekend. Conclusion: The Time to Act Is Now Cryptocurrency is all about timing. Whether you’re drawn to Binance’s legacy, Render’s innovative use case, or Qubetics’ groundbreaking features and potential for exponential returns, the key is to get in early. Analysts’ predictions for $TICS are nothing short of extraordinary. Investing $1000 today could change your financial future forever. Don’t wait. The Qubetics presale won’t last forever, and with each passing day, the price goes up. Secure your $TICS tokens now and be part of the next big thing in crypto.

Classification of Crypto Set to Change in Japan? The FSA wrote that it wants to start considering cryptoassets as “financial assets” that “the general public can invest in.” Trading volumes on Japan’s bitFlyer crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Currently, Japanese law classifies cryptoassets as “payment instruments” under the terms of the Payment Services Act. The switch to a more “investment”-focused definition would represent something of a legitimization for crypto. But such a change would seemingly be dependant on the stability of the crypto industry. And while the document stops short of calling for crypto tax reform, CoinPost wrote that it suggests “a possibility” that Japan’s controversial crypto tax rules “will be reviewed.” Costly climate disasters created a crisis for Japan's insurance industry.

The move comes days after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) made similar claims in its own tax policy recommendations for FY2025. The LDP wants the crypto industry to incorporate “regulations on accountability and investor protection” that are “equivalent to those in place for stock investment in listed companies.” This would allow the law to start viewing “certain cryptoassets” as “financial products” commonly used in “the general public’s portfolios.” CoinPost wrote that the tone of the FSA’s document suggests that it is “endorsing [the LDP’s]” stance. The FSA, media outlets this year claimed, is readying a “fundamental review” of the way it regulates crypto. However, the FSA’s move appears to suggest it thinks the Payment Services Act offers insufficient protection to crypto investors. Inflation in Japan's capital accelerates, keeps rate hike prospects intact https://t.co/kPji7EHgz9 pic.twitter.com/cbDtZk2VdW — Reuters (@Reuters) December 27, 2024 Differing Views on Tax Reform There is another wrinkle for Japanese crypto traders. While the LDP appears keen to scrap Japan’s current crypto tax system, the FSA seems to have different ideas. Under the current system, crypto traders must declare their profits as “other income” on yearly tax declarations. That means high earners can pay up to 55% tax on their earnings. The LDP favors abolishing this system in favor of a capital gains tax on crypto earnings. The FSA, however, seems instead keen to place crypto “within a more comprehensive framework of income tax integration,” CoinPost explained. There does, though, appear to be a consensus about the need to change the legal classification of crypto in Japan. This is particularly relevant as Japanese companies like Metaplanet and Remixpoint begin to ramp up their Bitcoin-buying strategies.

Ogura said that cryptoassets were now not only “a means of payment,” but also “an investment vehicle and a source of innovation.” The post Japanese Regulator Wants to Change Its Classification of Crypto appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Japan|Regulation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-29 23:30:00

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

BlockDAG Network launches its innovative $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, while Ethereum gears up for a potential surge to $12,000. Ethereum’s appeal grows with its scalability improvements and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), while BlockDAG captures the spotlight by mixing crypto bonuses with enticing raffle wins. BlockDAG’s strong presale performance coupled with solid buyer trust provides immediate opportunities and hints at long-term growth. Meanwhile, excitement builds around XRP, forecasting a promising 2025 as BlockDAG’s expanding influence makes it a standout choice for crypto explorers. Usher in 2025 with a Million-Dollar Celebration What better way to greet 2025 than with BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle? This isn’t just a lottery—it’s a festive toast to the new year, offering participants a shot at a life-altering $1 million USDT. BlockDAG makes participation a breeze with three ticket tiers suited to different budgets. The Bronze Ticket, at an accessible 125 USDT, could net you as much as $250,000 USDT. To boost your chances, consider the Silver Ticket at 250 USDT, balancing cost with potential returns. For those dreaming big, the Gold Ticket at 500 USDT offers the best shot at the $1M USDT jackpot, plus a 200% bonus in BDAG coins.

BlockDAG’s journey in the crypto market has been noteworthy, with presale batch 26 amassing $173.5 million and selling over 17.5 billion BDAG coins—a stunning 2240% growth since its inception. Ethereum’s Price Ascent: Analysts Eye $12,000 Target Ethereum is on the cusp of a significant rise, with predictions aiming for $12,000 in the coming market cycle. This optimism is fueled by Ethereum’s continued tech advancements, especially sharding, which aims to boost network efficiency and speed by splitting the blockchain into smaller segments. Additionally, Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are reducing network congestion and lowering costs, enhancing Ethereum’s allure. As Ethereum solidifies its lead with growing DeFi and NFT adoption, it must navigate challenges like emerging competitors and potential regulatory changes. XRP’s Price Forecast for 2025: Valuing 1,000 Tokens Anticipation for XRP’s 2025 price is high, spurred by Ripple’s growing adoption and impressive market performance last year. With its price around $3, XRP’s value has nearly quintupled in 2024. Analysts are optimistic, predicting a rise to $5–$7 by mid-2025, potentially boosting the value of 1,000 XRP tokens to $5,000–$7,000. However, the volatile nature of the crypto market calls for cautious optimism. Factors like global regulatory changes and Ripple’s strategies will heavily influence XRP’s trajectory, though its role in cross-border payments and possible integration with central bank digital currencies strengthen its long-term viability. Final Thoughts As 2025 dawns, the crypto sector brims with both potential profits and exciting prospects. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle offers both immediate gratification and the potential for crypto growth, making it one of the best crypto projects for all participants. With Ethereum’s technological strides and XRP’s promising price outlook, the diverse paths of cryptocurrencies are poised to influence the future financial landscape.

In 2025, Nvidia will face increased competition from AMD, Intel, and tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, who are developing their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia’s products. Nvidia has had a great year in 2024. The ranking has placed the company, without a doubt, at the top of the artificial intelligence market. Innovative AI technologies and strategic investments in cutting-edge hardware have fast-tracked this event’s share price and revenue. Nvidia’s 2024 Dominance NVIDIA became the most valuable publicly traded company worldwide by breaking past Apple and crossing $3 trillion. Jensen Huang, CEO took over this company and steered its growth to the maximum that has ever happened. Nvidia products underpin most AI innovation across industries. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, designed explicitly for AI applications, will drive the market in 2025, however, this success does not predict an easy future for the company. Nvidia’s fortune can be traced primarily to its early investments in AI software and hardware. Its CUDA software helps developers build applications for chips made by Nvidia. Hyperscalers—which include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta in the massive cloud computing providers crowd rely on Nvidia for the powerful GPUs that are used for AI model training. The company’s business with data centres generated 87% of revenues during the most recent quarter, one major area driving the firm financially. Currently, Nvidia remains at the head of the AI band, and chips from Blackwell are in very high demand. This is further attested to by customers such as Amazon, who already have the data centres readied in preparation for the immense amount of power and heat expected from the new processors being developed. This signifies how Nvidia is crucial in this AI revolution. 2025 Challenges But, by 2025, challenges are coming up rapidly against Nvidia’s leadership position. AMD and Intel, in particular, continue developing their AI-centric chips; AMD seems better suited than any competitor to cut into Nvidia’s lead in a big way. MI300X from AMD can be directly positioned as the H100 Hopper Nvidia develops. At this time, Intel is still unable to regain its ground, and AMD’s products are much more competitive. Further advanced software development could make its chips more appealing to developers and cloud providers. But now, another emerging risk is the danger of its customers starting to build AI chips themselves. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have started designing their semiconductors, reducing dependence on those semiconductors that would be required from Nvidia. While these companies still have to purchase chips from Nvidia, this would progressively reduce Nvidia’s share of the market in the future. Further, the shift to inferencing by AI models, which involves putting AI models into actual operating environments, may help lower the need for powerhouse chips like the one for which Nvidia is famous because inferencing requires very little computation to perform what’s needed compared to training. Despite all these potential risks, Nvidia is well positioned to remain the AI powerhouse in 2025, having caught the imagination and interest of innovators. Nvidia remains the default choice of chips in training large-scale AI models Traditional chipmakers like AMD and Intel, as well as the customers interested in their own AI solutions, will begin to throw corporate weight behind Nvidia, demanding serious intervention from the company’s management. 2025 is going to be difficult for them.

TRX fell from a high of $0.4506 on December 4 to a low of $0.2600, a 42% decline. So, what’s next for Tron as it flips Ethereum in terms of the fee collected? Tron network is making more money than Ethereum Ethereum has been the most profitable blockchain network in the past few years, thanks to its higher fees and activity on the platform. It remains the most popular blockchain network today, with a substantial market share against most chains. For example, Ethereum’s blockchain has a total value locked (TVL) of over $68 billion and bridged volume of near $200 billion It also has over $111 billion in stablecoins in its ecosystem. In contrast, Justin Sun’s Tron has a TVL of $7.4 billion, bridged value od $68 billion, and $60 billion in stablecoins. It has just 34 DeFi apps in its ecosystem, while Ethereum has over 1,263 of them. Still, Tron is now making more money than Ethereum. According to TokenTerminal, Tron has made over $1.3 billion in fees in the last 180 days, higher than Ethereum’s $800 million. The same trend happened in the last 30 days as the two made $333 million and $217 million, respectively. These numbers mean that the Tron network is seeing more transactions and collecting more money. If the trend continues, its annual fees in 2025 could be higher than Ethereum’s. Ethereum has made over $2.46 billion in the last 365 days compared to Tron’s $2.12 billion. Tron’s rising fees is likely because of the SunPump ecosystem that led to more activity in the network. SunPump is a rival to Solana’s Pump.fun in that it helps users create meme coins within minutes. SunPump’s ecosystem started well and gained thousands of meme coins within days. Recently, however, there are signs that the network has lost steam as the market cap of all of its tokens has dropped from over $700 million a few months ago to $144 million today. The biggest of these tokens are Sundog, Tron Bull, Tron Bull Coin, Suncat, and SunWukong. The rising Tron fees mean that its stakers are making substantial returns. Tron has a staking market cap of over $10 billion , giving it a staking ratio of 46%. Its staking yield has moved to 4.65%, higher than Ethereum’s 3.03%. Tron price analysis TRX price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the TRX price has moved into a deep bear market after falling by over 42% from its highest level this year. Still, TRX remains above the 50-day moving average, a sign that it has the potential to rebound. It is also a sign that it is doing mean reversion, where an asset returns to its normal average after soaring hard. Tron has also moved above the ascending trendline that connects its lowest swings since June this year. It has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular reversal sign. Therefore, the TRX price will likely bounce back, and hit its all-time high of $0.4506, its highest level this year, which is about 73% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.2232 will invalidate the bullish view.

CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-as-a-strategic-asset-cryptoquant-ceo-questions-uss-next-move/,"Since President-elect Donald Trump raised the possibility of establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, many advocates have pushed for the creation of the crypto stockpile, saying that it would make the country as the leader in the global cryptocurrency landscape. However, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced of the feasibility of the crypto reserve.

Young Ju said that if there is a perceived threat to the US economic hegemony, gold, Bitcoin or any other store-of-value assets would experience a surge in its price. US Economy Still Dominates Young Ju argued that there is no perceived threat to American dominance since many investors still have great confidence in the US economy or the US dollar. “I personally support the idea of #Bitcoin Standard. However, I question whether the US, while continuing to grow as other economies stagnate, would adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset,” he said in a post. The crypto executive believes the debate on the Bitcoin reserve would only gain serious momentum if the country’s global economic dominance is “genuinely threatened,” adding, “At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the US’ continued supremacy.” The US processed 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin in 2022, making it the leader in crypto mining, according to government data. Crypto Stance Could Shift Young Ju said that it is possible that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may take an unexpected turn depending on the broader political landscape. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing US economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he explained in a post. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The CryptoQuant CEO suggested that more likely, Trump would “step back from his Bitcoin advocacy,” pointing out that he might cite that there has been a change in priorities, “without alienating his voter base.” “At the BTC Conference, was his mention of Bitcoin as a strategic asset a genuine step toward preparing for a Bitcoin Standard, or merely a calculated move to secure votes?” he said. For the crypto executive, it is still unsure which of Trump’s “campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin” will be fulfilled.

Turning to a crypto project dubbed a Solana killer, Altcoin Sherpa says that traders should not underestimate layer-1 protocol Sui ( SUI ) despite its bearish-looking daily chart. “SUI I’d never want to short this chart where it’s currently at but it doesn’t look great.

This Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which has largely paid off, has continued up until now. According to recent data, El Salvador has now crossed the 6,000 BTC threshold. This makes El Salvador the sixth country behind the likes of the US, the UK, and Bhutan to hold 6,000 BTC or more. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy Reaches New Milestone Unlike countries like the US and the UK, whose Bitcoin holdings are from seized assets from criminals, El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have been through consistent purchases. Notably, El Salvador’s deliberate and consistent approach to building a Bitcoin reserve has been a cornerstone of President Bukele’s vision to establish the small Central American country as a leader in the crypto industry. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ending 2024 On A High Note? Analysts Say This Level Is Key According to data from the official website of El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio tracker, the country added another BTC to its reserve in the past 24 hours. This BTC was acquired at $94,702 and essentially pushed the total holdings to 6,000.77 BTC. Interestingly, a detailed look at the data shows that El Salvador has purchased around 50 more BTC since the beginning of December. This growth has mostly been consistent with 1 BTC purchased each day, except for December 20 and December 22, which were highlighted by purchases of 11 BTC. At the time of writing, El Salvador’s Bitcoin stash is worth a little over $570 million. This value has grown massively in the past three months and could grow more in 2025. Particularly, El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio reached a peak value of $643 million on December 17 when the Bitcoin price peaked at $108,135. Image from bitcoin.gob.sv Outlook For El Salvador’s Bitcoin Stash Despite initial skepticism from international organizations and financial experts, this strategy appears to have yielded positive results over time, largely due to Bitcoin’s price surge this year. According to data from nayibtracker.com, El Salvador is currently sitting on $157 million in profit from its Bitcoin purchases, having bought its 6,000 BTC at an average price of $45,465. El Salvador’s first Bitcoin purchase was made in September 2021 and is currently showing no signs of stopping soon. However, the country did reach an agreement recently with the IMF to scale back its Bitcoin purchase trends in order to be able to secure funding. Although this agreement was made on December 18, El Salvador doubled down and bought 11 more BTC just days later.

This, in turn, is going to allow the value of El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio to keep growing.

Simultaneously, SUI has notched a new all-time high (ATH) of $2.37, underpinned by a surge in trading volume that signals robust investor enthusiasm. Parallel to these developments, Web3Bay (3BAY) is pioneering a shift in online shopping by deploying Web3 technologies within a decentralized marketplace powered by its 3BAY token. With an introductory presale price of just $0.003, Web3Bay offers an inviting 6430% ROI potential, crafting a not-to-be-missed chance for early adopters keen on championing this trailblazing project. ETC Price Prediction: Analyst Foresees Growth Leading analyst Alan Santana has projected a robust outlook for Ethereum Classic (ETC), emphasizing its longest accumulation period since January 2022, which could mirror the phenomenal 5,700% value surge seen during the 2018–2021 bull cycle. While current predictions suggest gains between 1,300% to 2,150% from its June 2022 lows, such a prolonged buildup sets the stage for potentially explosive growth under the right market conditions. SUI Achieves a Milestone with Unprecedented Trading Volumes SUI has reached an exhilarating new high at $2.37, propelled by a groundbreaking $2 billion trading volume that indicates intense market interest. Recorded on November 6, this spike in activity, with a slight preference for long positions as per Coinglass data (Long/Short ratio of 1.09), points to strong investor confidence. Although there’s potential for further ascent, possibly touching $3, the market also braces for possible pullbacks that could recalibrate the price closer to $1.93. This ATH underscores SUI’s dynamic market trajectory and investor optimism. 3BAY Token: Fueling the First Decentralized Marketplace At the core of Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace, the 3BAY token not only facilitates transactions but also embeds governance rights for its holders, empowering them to directly influence the platform’s future. This token is a testament to Web3Bay’s commitment to user empowerment and transparency, turning every transaction into a step towards democratizing e-commerce. Web3Bay redefines online shopping with its decentralized platform, where users retain complete data ownership and enjoy lower transaction fees. Enhanced with IPFS technology for decentralized storage and cross-chain compatibility, Web3Bay addresses prevalent e-commerce challenges such as data security and transparency, while offering a worldwide, open transactional environment. The 3BAY token presale offers an unparalleled starting point at just $0.003. Early investors not only secure a cost advantage but also join an innovative endeavor set to redefine e-commerce by prioritizing user control. With its distinct features and promising growth trajectory, the presale phase of Web3Bay provides a rare opportunity to support a pioneering platform set to transform the online shopping landscape. This chance for early involvement invites those eager to engage in a groundbreaking venture with substantial return potential. In Summary As the market watches Ethereum Classic (ETC) for signs of its anticipated bull run and SUI continues to build momentum following its ATH, Web3Bay stands out with a unique proposition. Integrating Web3 into e-commerce, Web3Bay’s decentralized marketplace offers users unprecedented control over their data and transactions. With the 3BAY token priced attractively during the presale, early backers are well-positioned to be part of a venture that’s set to revolutionize online shopping, offering an impressive potential ROI of 6430%.

Dogecoin price remains in the spotlight due to its market buzz, while Shiba Inu faces crucial backing issues. On the other side, BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a well-organized and beneficial setup for its users. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle not only offers significant cash prizes but also bolsters participants’ crypto holdings with substantial BDAG bonuses, providing real value apart from the raffle itself. In contrast to the unstable conditions of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, BlockDAG demonstrates steady expansion and growing confidence, making a strong argument for its sustainable approach. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle Offers Cash Prizes + Crypto Bonuses! BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle is more than an opportunity to win a considerable cash prize—it also rewards participants with valuable crypto bonuses. This dual benefit ensures that each participant gains more than their initial involvement, no matter the raffle’s result. Specifically, each ticket purchased comes with a 200% bonus in BDAG coins, BlockDAG’s native coin. For example, a Bronze Ticket at 125 USDT not only qualifies buyers for a drawing with a top prize of $250,000 USDT but also triples their BDAG coin balance. Moreover, Silver and Gold tickets, costing 250 USDT and 500 USDT respectively, escalate not only buyer’s prize chances but also their BDAG coin quantity, with the Gold Ticket offering the highest likelihood of winning the $1M USDT top prize. Thus, this raffle extends beyond mere luck; it’s a chance to boost participant’s crypto collection. Furthermore, the BDAG bonuses empower participants to deepen their involvement in the BlockDAG network, making the tickets a wise decision for those aiming to increase their holdings. The additional crypto incentives also introduce a thrilling element of strategy, enhancing the overall raffle experience. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues to impress in the crypto market. Now in its 26th presale batch, the initiative has secured $173 million from over 17.5 billion sold BDAG coins. Notably, with the coin price currently at $0.0234, marking a 2240% rise since the initial batch, the growing demand and strong confidence are evident. Surge in Dogecoin Price: 90M DOGE Swapped in Two Days Dogecoin (DOGE) has recently seen a notable increase in activity, with its price soaring as 90 million DOGE changed hands over a span of just 48 hours. This significant trading volume highlights Dogecoin’s escalating appeal and the growing enthusiasm around it from both casual and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. Additionally, this surge in trading activity has led to a notable rise in Dogecoin’s market value, further cementing its status in the crypto arena. Analysts believe this uptrend results from wider acceptance, high-profile endorsements, and an overall positive outlook in the crypto environment. Shiba Inu Encounters Key Price Support Test Shiba Inu (SHIB), the well-known meme-based cryptocurrency, finds itself in a delicate position as it attempts to hold onto a critical price threshold. Market data shows that around 16 trillion SHIB tokens are under threat, which could have serious repercussions for the market. This scenario has led to a marked decrease in SHIB’s value, penetrating key price floors that once provided stability. This downturn has sparked worry within the SHIB community and among market analysts, as the absence of solid support could lead to further declines in value. Market sentiment is crucial in these situations. While current negative trends might provoke quick sell-offs, exacerbating the price drop, positive changes within the Shiba Inu framework might rebuild trust and help stabilize its market position. Final Verdict In a market rapidly swinging with unpredictable patterns, BlockDAG introduces a refreshing strategy by blending real rewards with prospects for sustained growth. While Dogecoin Price surges and Shiba Inu’s support issues underscore the crypto market’s instability, BlockDAG’s planned initiatives, like the $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, demonstrate a more stable approach. Through significant BDAG rewards and steady progression, BlockDAG distinguishes itself as a focus on both user involvement and long-term viability. For those looking beyond quick profits, this highlights the benefits of deliberate engagement in a well-crafted crypto ecosystem.

For seasoned investors and first-timers alike, figuring out which digital assets to add to your portfolio can feel like a guessing game. But with December 2024 upon us, it’s time to narrow down the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. If you’re hunting for high-growth potential and reliable market positions, Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Avalanche have become go-to names for investors worldwide. While Bitcoin has long been the king of crypto and Avalanche has built a reputation for its high-speed blockchain network, Qubetics is making headlines with its presale success and cutting-edge innovation. This article breaks down what makes these projects shine, focusing on their milestones, market position, and unique value propositions for investors today. Let’s dive in. Qubetics: The Rising Star of 2024 Qubetics is the latest crypto buzz, and for good reason. This up-and-coming project is in its 14th presale stage, already raking in over $8.1 million. Over 12,400 token holders have snapped up more than 385 million $TICS tokens, showing the undeniable appetite for what this project brings to the table. Currently priced at just $0.037 per token, $TICS is positioned for an imminent 10% price jump by the weekend—an enticing opportunity for investors who know timing is everything. So, what’s driving all this excitement? At its core, Qubetics offers QUBEQODE IDE, an intuitive ecosystem that’s revolutionising workflows for businesses, professionals, and even freelancers. Picture this: A small business uses QUBEQODE IDE to automate inventory tracking, saving hours of manual labour. Or think of a freelance designer seamlessly integrating client feedback into their workflow using this dynamic tool. Whether you’re an entrepreneur or a digital nomad, QUBEQODE IDE makes life easier—and that’s not just a buzzword. Analysts are buzzing with optimistic predictions for $TICS. By the presale’s end, the token is expected to hit $0.25, offering a staggering 630% ROI. The real fireworks, however, come after the presale, with projections of $1 per token for a 2,820% ROI and even $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 43,711% ROI. Think about this: investing $100 in $TICS today could potentially grow to $43,711 in just a few years. With its innovative tech and proven presale momentum, Qubetics isn’t just a rising star; it’s poised to be a game-changer. But don’t wait too long—the 13th stage price won’t last forever. Bitcoin: The Resilient Titan Bitcoin—the OG of cryptocurrency. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has solidified its position as the market’s gold standard. Over the years, it’s served as a hedge against inflation, a decentralised alternative to traditional banking, and a digital asset with sky-high growth potential. Despite market fluctuations, Bitcoin continues to hold its crown as the top crypto by market capitalisation, and it remains one of the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Why is Bitcoin still a go-to for investors? Its simplicity and scarcity are part of its charm. With only 21 million bitcoins ever to exist, this digital asset is the definition of “digital gold.” When economic uncertainty looms, institutional and retail investors alike flock to Bitcoin, driving its price up. Just look at the past decade: Bitcoin’s price climbed from a mere few cents to its current value in the tens of thousands. Even now, Bitcoin’s dominance in the market makes it a reliable store of value. Imagine holding Bitcoin during a bearish market; while altcoins dip, Bitcoin’s resilience often provides a buffer. Many North Americans see Bitcoin as the ultimate crypto starter pack—it’s safe, it’s predictable, and it’s still packed with upside potential. Whether you’re a first-time investor or a seasoned trader, Bitcoin has proven time and again why it deserves a spot in your portfolio. Avalanche: Speed Meets Scalability Then there’s Avalanche, the speedster of the crypto world. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and ultra-low fees, Avalanche has carved out a unique niche in the blockchain landscape. In 2024, this project has cemented its reputation as a powerhouse for decentralised applications (dApps) and DeFi protocols. It’s no wonder Avalanche has become one of the best cryptos to invest in December 2024. Avalanche’s claim to fame lies in its ability to process up to 4,500 transactions per second (TPS). Compare that to Ethereum’s 15-30 TPS, and it’s clear why developers and users are flocking to this platform. Avalanche’s subnets allow developers to create custom blockchains tailored to specific needs, making it a favourite among businesses and institutions looking to leverage blockchain tech without the bottlenecks. Picture this: A gaming company uses Avalanche to power its in-game economy, ensuring players can trade assets seamlessly without delays. Or consider a DeFi project that launches on Avalanche, taking advantage of its low fees to attract users fed up with Ethereum’s gas prices. These real-world use cases highlight why Avalanche is more than just a fast blockchain; it’s a practical solution for today’s blockchain challenges. As Avalanche’s ecosystem grows, so does its market value. Analysts predict steady price appreciation for AVAX, making it a smart play for both short-term gains and long-term holds. If you’re looking for a crypto project with cutting-edge technology and real-world utility, Avalanche delivers on both fronts. Conclusion: Make Your Move Before It’s Too Late The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities, but timing is everything. Qubetics, Bitcoin, and Avalanche each offer unique value propositions that cater to different types of investors. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ presale buzz, Bitcoin’s time-tested resilience, or Avalanche’s high-speed innovation, these projects are undoubtedly the best cryptos to invest in December 2024.

Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 03:04:00

BTC Price Faces Key Resistance at $97,300 Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed Bitcoin stuck in a tight range over the weekend after experiencing volatility during the final Wall Street trading session of the week. With BTC/USD providing little bullish momentum, order book analysis left market observers cautious. Material Indicators highlighted red flags on its trading tools, stating: “FireCharts shows a new $86M bid ladder is pushing BTC price up from the lows, but a new (red) signal from the Trend Precognition A1 algo on the D chart… indicates that price isn’t likely to climb higher than yesterday’s high, at least not before today’s D candle close.” It added, “A push above $97.3k would invalidate the new signal.” Meanwhile, trader Skew noted shifting buy liquidity on Binance’s BTC/USDT pair, potentially signaling upside if the bids remain. “I have been watching these limit bids throughout today, which have conveniently just moved higher towards price,” Skew commented, adding, “Often a signal for what’s to come as large market entities attempt to influence/control price.” Q4 Performance Holds Strong for Bitcoin Bitcoin remained down just 1.25% for December at $95,000 but retained a Q4 upside of over 50%, nearly matching its performance in 2023, according to CoinGlass data.

At present, there’s no indication of a strong trend or reversal, leaving the market in a state of indecision. XRP is moving within a possible triangle pattern , but it’s still uncertain if this will resolve in an upward or downward breakout. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.10. Bitcoin’s Influence on XRP Bitcoin’s recent decline suggests further downside could be in store for altcoins, including XRP. However, XRP is currently sitting at a micro support zone between $2.04 and $2.21. This level is providing some support, but it’s not strong enough to confirm a reversal or significant price action. Price Targets and Key Levels If XRP continues to consolidate, the price may aim for a higher level within the range, potentially reaching around $2.50. However, there’s no clear hint yet that a price surge is coming. If the price breaks below the $2.04 support level, this could signal a deeper decline, with the next potential support area lying around $1.8. Blue Scenario: Deeper Decline If XRP drops below $2.04, the likelihood of a more significant price correction increases. In this case, the next support levels to watch would be $1.8, $1.63, and $1.53. A further drop could see price levels approaching $1.36–$1.39, where a stronger buying response might be seen. Coinpedia Analysis (Short Term): XRP’s price is currently facing resistance at key levels, $2.2857 and $2.2821, suggesting strong overhead pressure. Additional resistance is found at $2.2442 and $2.2131, with a potential retracement seen at the 38.2% level from the 4-week low, which is near $2.1807. The Pivot Point is set at $2.1648, while the previous close stands at $2.1441, and the last price is at $2.1037, indicating bearish sentiment in the market. At this point, the outlook for XRP is cautiously neutral. If the price holds above $2.0958, it may attempt a move towards higher resistance levels. However, if the price breaks below $2.0707, it could face further declines, with the next key support area near $2.0475.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 03:56:36

MicroStrategy bought 5,200 Bitcoins at an average cost of $106,000 per coin. Though significant, this latest acquisition is MicroStrategy’s smallest since July 2024. Saylor has always said they will continue purchasing Bitcoin regardless of the price. Currently, it appears like a leveraged BTC bet that is also closely tied to the overall health of the digital asset. MicroStrategy increases efforts on Bitcoin acquisition MicroStrategy is not planning to slow down on its Bitcoin acquisition plan. The company called a strategic meeting with Shareholders in December to acquire extra resources for Bitcoin purchases as part of its 21/21 plan by increasing the number of shares to shareholders. The 21/21 strategic plan directs the firm to raise $42 billion in the next three years, $21 billion in equity offerings, and $21 billion in fixed-income corporate securities to help purchase more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy Bitcoin reserves hold a total of 444,262 BTC , with a market value of about $41.64 Billion. The company has the largest ownership of Bitcoin by a single entity. Saylor proposed a digital asset framework for the United States Recently, the crypto ambassador proposed a digital asset framework for the world’s most powerful economy. The framework included the Bitcoin strategic reserve, which has the potential to offset the US national debt due to its ability to offer up to $81 trillion in asset wealth. According to the MicroStrategy co-founder’s plan, the US dollar can maintain its position as the global reserve currency by growing the market capitalization of the digital asset sector to $10 trillion. He believes that growth in the digital market will propel the demand for the US dollar and the securities that back overcollateralized stablecoins like Tether’s USDt. Michael Saylor has also suggested a tax on digital assets, including what to tax. Among the taxable items include digital tokens, digital commodities, digital securities, and digital ABTs securing real-world commodities.

Recent data from DeFiLlama revealed that its total value locked (TVL) now stands at an all-time high of $8.217 billion, with a $1 billion spike coming within the last seven days alone. Major Players Fueling Growth Market leaders such as stablecoin issuer Usual and decentralized finance (DeFi) investment management platform Hashnote are at the forefront of this explosive growth. Numbers from DeFiLlama indicate that Hashnote saw a weekly increase of 65.58%, while Usual recorded a slightly higher growth of 65.65%. The former boasts a TVL of $1.497 billion, while the latter’s rose to $1.445 billion. Over 30 days, the metric skyrocketed 230% for Usual, while Hashnote’s kept pace at 217%. Together, the two contributed to more than 35% of the value of assets locked in the RWA sector. Usual’s strong performance comes on the back of raising $10 million in a Series A funding round led by Binance Labs and Kraken Ventures. It also recently saw the price of its governance token hit a new all-time high following claims that hackers compromised the X account of Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy and used it to publicize a fake partnership between the U.S. government and the stablecoin project. Away from the top two, green candles were also witnessed on platforms such as Nest Staking, MatrixDock, Franklin Templeton, and Ethena. Nest Staking saw a weekly increase of more than 58%, bringing its total value locked to $66.24 million. On the other hand, MatrixDock, operating on two chains, went up 48.18%, while Ethena amore modest upticks of 12.38%. Others Incur Losses Not all protocols experienced uniform growth, with DeFiLlama’s data showing that Solv Protocol, DigiFT, Danogo, KlimaDAO, and Fortunafi faced varying degrees of decline. The most significant loss across seven days was incurred by Danogo, whose $4 million TVL is over 15% lower than a week ago. Among the higher-capped projects, Solv shed the most locked value, losing more than 10% to settle at $712.81 million. However, over 30 days, Maker RWA suffered the biggest dip, with a negative change of 65%, lowering the value of assets in its custody to $290.7 million. The jump in RWA tokenization could signal a shift in how traditional assets are managed, traded, and accessed. Recently, several players in the Argentine lithium mining sector announced plans to tokenize the potentially trillion-dollar industry with the help of Cardano. Financial giants, including BlackRock, have also helped legitimize the space through its BUIDL initiative.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 04:30:00

BTC has now reversed and is trading above the $93k level. “After the post-Christmas market-wide dip, crypto markets are seeing an encouraging trend of whales moving stablecoins to exchanges,” Santiment reported. Historically, Q4 has been a strong period for Bitcoin and altcoins, which aligns with market cycles. We’re currently experiencing a cooldown, which is common after a halving event, like the one that happened in 2024. Following the halvings of previous years (2012, 2016, and 2020), Bitcoin experienced significant rallies in the subsequent year. External factors, such as global liquidity and government actions, will also influence the market. With Janet Yellen’s recent announcement that the U.S. will hit the debt ceiling in mid-January, more money printing and quantitative easing are likely. This creates favorable conditions for assets like Bitcoin. Looking ahead, January is expected to be a fairly quiet month, with the real action starting in February. Historically, March tends to be a strong month, followed by a potential consolidation in April and May due to tax season. After that, the market could pick up again in the summer, continuing into Q4. What’s Next For Bitcoin? Right now, Bitcoin is in a range, not yet fully breaking down, but it’s reacting to support and resistance levels. If Bitcoin stays below the resistance of $94,270, we could see more downside, with targets around $91,400. However, if Bitcoin breaks above the resistance at $94,270, it could signal a change in direction. But for now, the price is still showing signs of weakness, and we’re watching for any moves below support to confirm further declines.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 05:14:01

However, most currencies were steady due to low year-end liquidity. According to a recent report by Reuters, the yen slid to 157.71, and speculation of Japanese intervention could prevent another test of the 160 level seen in July But the US dollar index, which tracks the currency against major rivals, was flat at 107.98. The euro stayed at $1.0429, not far from recent lows, as holiday trading dampened movements. The euro is on course to close the year around 5.5 percent lower versus the dollar. Rising U.S. Treasury yields have supported the US dollar, marking the 10-year benchmark yield to a seven-month high. On Monday, it was close at 4.625 percent. Australian broker Pepper Stone’s research head, Chris Weston, said, “Despite paid forecasters almost universally calling for a weaker U.S. dollar in 2024, the greenback looks set to close the year higher against all major currencies with the buck reigning supreme.” The US dollar index rose 2.3% this month, bringing its total year gain to 6.6%. That’s the third consecutive month of growth and comes ahead of expectations that President-elect Donald Trump’s policies, including less regulation, lower taxes, higher tariffs, and tighter immigration rules, will spur economic growth and inflation, keeping U.S. yields elevated. The US dollar has gained 10 yen since December 3, following the majority of the yen’s drop following the Federal Reserve’s cautious tone on future rate cuts on December 18. The yen has tumbled to 158.09 per dollar, less than 10.6% down from the year-to-date after dropping to its weakest since July 17.

But savvy investors? They’re rubbing their hands in excitement. Why? Because downturns are the golden opportunities to snag investments that can skyrocket. The meme coin market, long considered a playground for laughs, has evolved into a lucrative investment hub. Recent developments have shown just how powerful these coins can be, with communities rallying behind their favourites and massive returns becoming a real possibility for early adopters. One coin turning heads is BTFD Coin ($BTFD). At just $0.000142 per coin and over $4.6 million already raised and more than 7,000 holders backing it, $BTFD is cementing its position as the frontrunner in meme coins this year. But it’s not alone—other contenders like Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT), Neiro ($NEIRO), and Book of Meme ($BOME) are also making waves. Let’s dive in and explore why these coins are the best new meme coins with 100x potential. 1. BTFD Coin ($BTFD): The Ultimate Dip-Buying Play When life gives you dips, you buy them—or at least that’s what $BTFD is all about. This innovative meme coin has made a splash in the crypto world with its presale, offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy low and potentially sell high. With 16 presale stages representing key global economic events, $BTFD has woven a compelling narrative. $BTFD isn’t just a story—it’s packed with substance. Its P2E (play-to-earn) game, whose beta version launched in Stage 10, is already gathering attention as a fun, community-driven way to engage with crypto. While the beta doesn’t offer rewards, it hints at massive potential for post-launch earnings. On top of that, staking rewards with a juicy 90% APY make $BTFD a favourite among investors who want their holdings to work for them. Add a referral programme with 10% bonuses for top-performing referrers, and you’ve got a coin that rewards loyalty and community participation. With over 60 billion coins sold and predictions that the presale will end at $0.0006, there’s no better time to hop aboard the $BTFD train. To make your investment even more rewarding, BTFD Coin offers a bonus code! By using the code BIG50, you can unlock an additional 50% in $BTFD coins. Simply enter BIG50 at checkout and watch your purchase go further, maximizing the value of your investment. With a $4,000 investment in Stage 13 of the BTFD Coin presale, priced at $0.000142 per coin, you would normally receive 28,253,126.76 BTFD Coins. However, by applying the BIG50 code, which adds 50% more coins, your total increases to 42,379,690.14 BTFD Coins. If the price of the coin reaches $0.0006 by the end of the presale, your investment could grow to an impressive $25,427.81. This illustrates the substantial earning potential of BTFD Coin and the advantages of maximising your purchase with the BIG50 code. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because $BTFD is reshaping how we see meme coins, blending humour, history, and serious earning potential into a project no one should miss. 2. Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT): A God Among Meme Coins What happens when you combine meme-worthy fun with Greek mythology? You get Goatseus Maximus ($GOAT). This coin has carved its niche as a community-driven powerhouse that brings more than just laughs to the table. $GOAT capitalises on the meme coin frenzy by creating a space where fans of mythical goats and crypto converge. Its creators have built a loyal following, making it one of the most-talked-about projects in the meme coin space. While $GOAT isn’t in its presale, it’s already made a name for itself as a reliable alternative to traditional investments. Its tokenomics ensure stability and long-term growth, while its community events and collaborations keep investors engaged. $GOAT isn’t just a coin; it’s a lifestyle that taps into the quirky side of crypto culture. Why did this coin make it to this list? $GOAT exemplifies the power of a strong community and creative branding, making it a top contender for investors looking to ride the meme coin wave. 3. Neiro ($NEIRO): Where Tech Meets Fun $NEIRO is more than just a meme coin—it’s a glimpse into the future. Built on cutting-edge AI technology, $NEIRO combines humour with utility, offering investors a chance to dive into the world of artificial intelligence without the complexities. The coin’s appeal lies in its simplicity and promise of innovation, making it a standout in a crowded market. One of $NEIRO’s strengths is its adaptability. While most meme coins rely solely on hype, $NEIRO integrates its AI-driven ecosystem into the crypto world, setting itself apart as a forward-thinking project. Its community-driven initiatives ensure that every holder feels like a part of the journey, further solidifying its reputation as a go-to investment. Why did this coin make it to this list? $NEIRO is leading the charge for tech-focused meme coins, blending fun and functionality into an investment opportunity like no other. 4. Book of Meme ($BOME): A Crypto Story Worth Reading Every meme coin has a story, but $BOME takes storytelling to the next level. Inspired by the ancient mystique of legendary tomes, $BOME weaves a narrative that resonates with crypto enthusiasts who crave both entertainment and financial gains. Its creators have leveraged the nostalgia of myths and combined it with the modern-day meme culture to create a coin that feels both timeless and trendy. $BOME’s strength lies in its market positioning. As a meme coin with a unique theme, it has managed to stand out in a sea of imitators. Its developers are focused on community engagement, ensuring that investors stay excited about the project’s future. Whether it’s through social media campaigns or exclusive perks for holders, $BOME knows how to keep its audience hooked. Why did this coin make it to this list? $BOME is proof that great storytelling and strategic marketing can transform a meme coin into a cultural phenomenon. The Final Thoughts The world of meme coins is more exciting than ever, and these four projects are leading the charge this year. From the presale success of $BTFD to the mythical appeal of $GOAT, the tech-savvy charm of $NEIRO, and the narrative brilliance of $BOME, there’s no shortage of options for investors seeking the best new meme coins with 100x potential.

38293825,https://coinpaper.com/6737/bitcoin-atm-network-in-australia-nears-european-totals,1735536600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Bitcoin ATM Network in Australia Nears European Totals,https://coinpaper.com/6737/bitcoin-atm-network-in-australia-nears-european-totals,"While MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor continues to push boundaries with bold acquisition plans and proposals for integrating Bitcoin into the US economy, Australia is nearing Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, reflecting the increasing accessibility of digital currencies worldwide. Australia’s Bitcoin ATM Boom: Nearing European Totals in Global Crypto Expansion Australia’s Bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) network has been growing at an impressive pace, positioning the country as a global leader in cryptocurrency accessibility. Over the past 29 months, the number of Bitcoin ATMs in Australia has consistently increased, bringing the total to 1,359 as of December 2024. According to data from Coin ATM Radar , this accounts for 3.5% of all Bitcoin ATMs globally, cementing Australia's position as the third-largest Bitcoin ATM network in the world. This consistent growth brings Australia close to surpassing Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, with Europe hosting 1,660 machines. Should the trend continue, Australia is on track to solidify itself as a global hotspot for cryptocurrency adoption, trailing only the United States and Canada. Australia’s net positive addition of Bitcoin ATMs over the last 29 months is indicative of the country’s commitment to advancing cryptocurrency adoption. The steady increase suggests growing public interest in digital currencies and a supportive ecosystem for crypto transactions. Despite Australia’s achievements, North America remains the uncontested leader in Bitcoin ATM installations. The United States is home to an astonishing 31,516 Bitcoin ATMs, representing a staggering 81.3% of the global total. Canada follows with 3,027 machines, contributing an additional 7.8%. Together, these two countries account for over 90% of all Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. In comparison, Europe and Oceania each contribute approximately 4% to the global Bitcoin ATM network. Asia, despite its vast population and growing interest in digital currencies, lags significantly, with only 0.9% of Bitcoin ATMs globally. As of December 2024, there are 38,753 Bitcoin ATMs operational worldwide. The continued expansion of these machines comes amid the growing demand for convenient cryptocurrency transactions. Bitcoin ATMs play a crucial role in enhancing accessibility, allowing users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies with ease. The Rising Threat of Bitcoin ATM Scams While Bitcoin ATMs symbolize progress in cryptocurrency adoption, they also bring challenges, particularly in combating fraud. In 2023, the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported a surge in scams involving Bitcoin ATMs, with fraudsters exploiting the anonymity and speed of crypto transactions to target unsuspecting victims. Losses from these scams exceeded $110 million, highlighting the need for enhanced security measures. To address these concerns, lawmakers in the US have urged major Bitcoin ATM operators to implement stricter anti-fraud measures. A particular focus has been placed on protecting vulnerable demographics, such as the elderly, who are often targeted by scammers. Australia’s Bitcoin ATM growth signals the country’s rising prominence in the global cryptocurrency market. With continued expansion, Australia is poised to strengthen its position as a leader in crypto accessibility, potentially surpassing Europe in the near future. As the global crypto ecosystem evolves, challenges such as fraud must be addressed to ensure that Bitcoin ATMs remain a trusted and secure gateway for cryptocurrency adoption. For now, Australia’s steady progress signals a bright future for digital currency infrastructure in the region. The rise of Bitcoin ATMs in Australia suggests there is a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a mainstream financial instrument. As Australia approaches Europe in the number of Bitcoin ATMs, it showcases the country's dedication to building a robust crypto ecosystem. However, as this expansion continues, addressing the accompanying risks, such as fraud, will be critical to sustaining the momentum and trust in the industry. MicroStrategy’s Strategy and Vision for Digital Asset Growth In other Bitcoin news, MicroStrategy co-founder Michael Saylor, a prominent BTC advocate, has once again stirred speculation within the cryptocurrency market. On Dec. 29, 2024, Saylor posted the Bitcoin chart from SaylorTracker.com on X, captioned with a cryptic message: “Disconcerting blue lines on SaylorTracker.com.” His posts have become a Sunday ritual that often precedes MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases on Monday, creating anticipation among market participants. MicroStrategy completed its latest Bitcoin acquisition on Dec. 22, 2024, buying 5,200 BTC at an average price of $106,000 per coin. This purchase, while significant, marked the company’s smallest acquisition since July 2024. Despite the lower volume, the move reaffirmed MicroStrategy’s mission to accumulate Bitcoin regardless of market conditions—a strategy Saylor has vocalized in the past. Saylor’s unwavering confidence in the leading crypto has positioned MicroStrategy as a leveraged bet on BTC. The company’s market performance is now closely tied to Bitcoin’s price movements, with traders viewing MicroStrategy as a proxy for Bitcoin’s health and trajectory. In December 2024, MicroStrategy called for a special shareholders meeting to discuss its ambitious 21/21 Plan, which aims to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. The plan outlines raising $42 billion over the next three years through a combination of equity offerings and fixed-income corporate securities—$21 billion from each avenue. This aggressive strategy is part of Saylor’s long-term vision of making Bitcoin a cornerstone asset for the company. The funds raised will bolster MicroStrategy’s holdings, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Beyond his corporate endeavors, Saylor has also proposed a comprehensive framework for digital assets in the United States. His ambitious plan includes the establishment of a Bitcoin strategic reserve that could offset the US national debt by providing the Treasury with $16 trillion to $81 trillion in asset wealth. The proposal is centered on growing the digital asset market capitalization to $10 trillion, which Saylor argues would enhance the demand for the US dollar and government securities. This, in turn, could cement the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency in an increasingly digital economy. A Taxonomy for Digital Assets As part of his framework, Saylor has outlined a detailed taxonomy for digital assets, categorizing them into six distinct classes: Digital Commodities – Assets like Bitcoin that function as a store of value. Digital Securities – Blockchain-based representations of traditional securities. Digital Currencies – Cryptocurrencies designed for transactions. Digital Tokens – Utility tokens with specific functionalities in ecosystems. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) – Unique assets representing ownership or rights. Digital ABTs This classification aims to provide clarity and structure to the digital asset market, fostering a regulatory environment conducive to growth and innovation. Saylor’s vision extends beyond MicroStrategy’s balance sheet, aiming to redefine the role of digital assets in the global financial system. His proposals for integrating Bitcoin into the US economic framework shed light on the growing influence of digital currencies on macroeconomic policy. While MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have drawn both praise and skepticism, the company’s strategy has undeniably shaped perceptions of corporate crypto adoption. As Saylor continues to champion Bitcoin as the premier digital commodity, MicroStrategy’s moves remain a barometer for institutional interest in the cryptocurrency space. Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy have become synonymous with Bitcoin’s corporate adoption, pushing the boundaries of how traditional businesses engage with digital assets. From bold acquisition strategies to visionary frameworks for national economic integration, Saylor’s leadership reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s transformative potential. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, MicroStrategy’s actions and Saylor’s proposals will likely serve as a litmus test for the scalability and legitimacy of Bitcoin in the global economy. Whether through strategic acquisitions or ambitious policy frameworks, Saylor’s enduring belief in Bitcoin continues to shape the narrative of cryptocurrency adoption worldwide.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-30 05:30:00

Rollblock May Top That Post Presale,https://timestabloid.com/sui-tvl-crosses-2-billion-rollblock-may-top-that-post-presale/,"SUI ’s TVL recently surpassed $2 billion after a 16% growth in the last 30 days. This milestone puts the blockchain in the spotlight for its growing market cap and user activity. Meanwhile, Rollblock is on the verge of its post-presale launch, with some speculating it could challenge SUI ’s figures. With Rollblock pioneering multiple web3 innovations, investors are closely watching its potential to outperform established cryptos. Unlock Gaming Rewards With Rollblock At The Helm The online gambling industry has evolved, integrating blockchain technology to address traditional challenges. Rollblock operates in this space, using RBLK as its native token. This token fuels transactions and connects the gaming platform to decentralized finance models, creating a seamless user experience. Currently, Rollblock features over 7000 games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, poker, and live casino options. It also offers sports betting on football, basketball, tennis, and more. The iGaming platform plans to add 100 more games by year end to expand its selection further. Rollblock is clearly taking committed steps to provide a diverse and engaging gaming experience for its users. Players will be able to secure income from Rollblock ’s lineup by holding or staking RBLK tokens. Staking offers direct financial benefits, as a share of the platform’s weekly revenue is distributed to participants. This revenue-sharing model ensures active players and investors can benefit from Rollblock ‘s growth. However, rewards are proportional to the amount staked. Deflationary measures play a key role in Rollblock ‘s tokenomics. Periodic token buybacks and burns reduce the circulating supply of RBLK. This strategy increases scarcity, helping stabilize and potentially boost the token’s market value. Additionally, cashback incentives and bonus programs encourage continuous participation while supporting the health of Rollblock ‘s ecosystem. SUI Performance Opposes General Market Trend Despite the bearish appearance of the crypto market, SUI demonstrated growth, with its TVL crossing $2 billion—a 16% increase over the past 30 days. The surge in TVL speaks to the growing confidence in SUI ‘s ecosystem. It’s metrics like these that have led SUI to a 25% price increase in the past month, with over $12 billion in market cap . SUI ’s early partnerships with Franklin Templeton Digital Assets and Google Cloud enhance its technological capabilities and market reach. From a technical perspective, SUI has been consolidating below a descending resistance line after reaching an all-time high of $4.93. Its RSI suggests the potential for a bullish reversal if it breaks above this resistance. Analysts predict that SUI could reach approximately $14.94 by early January, representing a potential 227% price increase. This optimistic outlook is based on SUI ‘s recent performance and strategic developments. On CoinMarketCap, community sentiments are largely positive, as 85% of SUI enthusiasts vote bullish. Conclusion Over the past month, both SUI and RBLK have outperformed the market average. However, unlike SUI, Rollblock is not constrained by a growth cap. Currently in its ninth stage of presale, RBLK tokens are priced at $0.044 each. Investors in the presale can benefit from daily, weekly, and monthly rakebacks from casino games, along with tiered bonuses based on their RBLK holdings.

According to a recent analysis by CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) on X, XRP is poised to exit a falling wedge pattern on December 29, 2024. The chart that the analyst presented suggests a rapid rise to $5.6 by January 19, 2025, echoing its price movement in March 2017. If we follow the March 2017 pattern #XRP will break out of this falling wedge tomorrow and reach $5.60 on January 19. pic.twitter.com/tcX0nUNBII — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) December 28, 2024 XRP trades above $2 for the first time since 2018, reflecting renewed investor interest. Additionally, XRP recently touched $2.86, its highest price since 2018, suggesting robust buying pressure. While the digital asset has faced significant resistance, its ability to hold above $2 shows its underlying strength. If the bullish momentum continues, the chance of a new all-time high cannot be ruled out. CryptoBull’s chart analysis highlights a falling wedge, a bullish continuation pattern indicating a possible upward breakout. The daily chart shows XRP consolidating within this wedge, with decreasing price volatility and narrowing trendlines. The analyst recently shared a similar analysis , and this breakout, anticipated to occur soon, aligns with historical patterns that suggest significant upward momentum following such formations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Mirror Its 2017 Performance? The importance of this potential breakout lies in the projected trajectory. If CryptoBull’s analysis holds, XRP’s move to $5.60 would represent a substantial gain of 154.5% from its current price of $2.2. Such growth would send the asset to a new all-time high, eclipsing its current peak of $3.84 which it achieved in January 2018. However, it is important to note, that while chart patterns like the falling wedge are reliable indicators, they are not guarantees. Market sentiment, external news, and broader economic factors all play a role in determining price movements. However, investors seem to be overwhelmingly bullish on XRP. The broader macroeconomic and regulatory landscape contributes to the positive sentiment around the digital asset. The recent resignation announcement by Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair, effective January 20, 2025, is a pivotal development for crypto. President-elect Donald Trump has already nominated a pro-crypto successor to Gensler, and January 20 will be a pivotal day for XRP. Notably, CryptoBull expects XRP to hit $5.6 by January 19. Trump’s inauguration and Gensler’s resignation the following day could give XRP a much larger boost, potentially sending it to double or triple digits.

Here’s Why It Is Expected To Outperform XRP In 2025,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/rollblock-price-prediction-how-quickly-can-rblk-hit-1-heres-why-it-is-expected-to-outperform-xrp-in-2025/,"Rollblock (RBLK) is among the most talked about altcoins in cryptocurrency with its approach to decentralized gaming and the expanding GameFi market. With substantial presale success and a unique value proposition, Rollblock is setting the stage for massive growth.

The platform’s innovative tokenomics, high staking rewards, and expanding ecosystem make Rollblock a strong contender for impressive returns.

Rollblock (RBLK) is a web-based gambling platform on the Ethereum blockchain that promises to change the GameFi business.

RBLK holders will get up to 30% of weekly profits to purchase back RBLK tokens from the open market. This buyback mechanism will help increase the token’s price. Additionally, 60% of the repurchased RBLK will be burned, creating scarcity. The remaining 40% is allocated as staking rewards to stakers on the platform, offering some of the highest annual percentage yields (APYs) in the space. With more than 7,000 AI-powered casino games available, Rollblock provides a secure and profitable platform for players and investors. Why Rollblock’s $7.74 Million Presale Success is Only the Beginning Rollblock (RBLK) has achieved groundbreaking success during its presale, raising over $7.74 million in record time. More than 35,000 early investors are already backing Rollblock’s GameFi project, confident it will dominate the market in 2025. Rollblock’s unique approach of integrating blockchain technology into iGaming has analysts predicting a massive 100x rally for $RBLK on launch day. For a limited time, $RBLK tokens are available at just $0.044 in stage 9 of the presale. Since its ICO debut, RBLK has surged by 330% , with analysts expecting an additional 550% increase. Once the token officially launches, a jaw-dropping 50x explosion is predicted. Rollblock’s buy-back program and revenue-sharing model have significantly boosted its appeal, attracting a growing number of investors. The presale continues to raise millions, with rumors of an upcoming major exchange listing further enhancing Rollblock’s standing as one of the leading platforms in the crypto gaming space.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 05:56:00

This is questionable since Solana futures contracts do not yet exist and there is no approved spot Solana ETF. “This is crazy,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Balchunas added that the filing could signal that Solana futures could soon become a reality, which “probably bodes well” for future approval of spot ETFs. Offering a broader regulatory perspective, Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, suggested that the filing could reflect a shift in the ongoing power struggle between the SEC and CFTC over digital asset oversight. “The CFTC may be winning its power struggle with the SEC over digital asset regulation,” Geraci commented.

Volatility Shares is no stranger to disrupting the ETF space. It launched its first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF in June 2023, followed by a 2x Ether ETF a year later. These products have since paved the way for other asset managers to explore leveraged funds targeting cryptocurrency futures. *This is not investment advice.

With over $200,000 raised in its presale and RACE tokens at $0.00825, the platform shows how gaming can combine entertainment with real value. The numbers speak clearly: over 14 million RACE tokens staked and rewards approaching 3,000% reveal how blockchain technology transforms traditional gaming into an experience where players truly own and grow their gaming assets. From Traditional Gaming to Blockchain: A New Way to Play Think of traditional gaming like a closed theme park – you buy tickets to enjoy the rides, but those tickets have no value outside the park. Race To A Billion changes this model by making your gaming tokens valuable assets that grow with the platform’s success. When you hold RACE tokens at today’s price of $0.00825, you’re not just buying entry tickets – you’re becoming part of the gaming ecosystem. Blockchain technology changes how we think about in-game value. Every RACE token you own is recorded on an unalterable digital ledger. Your predictions, rewards, and tokens are protected by smart contracts – automated systems that enforce fair play without human intervention. This creates transparency that traditional gaming can’t match: you can see exactly how many tokens exist, how many are staked, and watch the reward system work in real time. Understanding Token Value and Growth The value system of Race To A Billion starts with its carefully planned token supply of 2.5 billion RACE . Like a well-designed economy, each token serves specific purposes within the platform. Currently, millions of RACE tokens are staked by early supporters, showing strong belief in the platform’s future. These staked tokens earn decent rewards, creating a steady flow of benefits for participants. The current price per token reflects the project’s early stage, similar to getting in on the ground floor of a growing business. The staking program rewards this early support generously – when you stake your tokens, you’re not just holding them, but actively participating in the platform’s growth. The distribution system releases rewards steadily through blockchain mechanics, ensuring a fair and transparent process for all participants. The Path from Presale to Gaming Platform Race To A Billion follows a carefully structured path from presale to full gaming platform. The current presale stage has already raised over $200,000, showing how blockchain gaming attracts both players and investors. At the current price per RACE token, early supporters can join before gaming features go live, much like getting exclusive access to a game before its official launch. The development journey happens in clear phases. Right now, we’re in the foundation-building stage where early supporters can stake their tokens and earn rewards. The next phase brings the actual gaming platform to life, where predictions turn tokens into active gaming tools. This step-by-step approach ensures each part of the platform works perfectly before moving forward, creating a stable environment for both gaming and token value growth. Making Blockchain Gaming Work for You Participating in Race To A Billion requires understanding the different ways you can engage with the platform. Let’s explore your options and how to make the most of each one at this early stage. The entry process starts with purchasing RACE tokens, currently priced at $0.00825. The platform makes this step accessible to everyone by accepting multiple payment methods. If you’re new to blockchain, you can use your credit card through the secure Web3Payments system – it works just like any online purchase you’re familiar with. For those experienced with cryptocurrency, the platform accepts ETH, USDT, and BNB, allowing you to connect your crypto wallet and make a direct purchase. After acquiring tokens, you face an important decision. The staking program , which has attracted over 14 million RACE tokens, offers substantial rewards. Think of staking as putting your tokens to work – they generate passive earnings while supporting the platform’s growth. The rewards get distributed automatically through smart contracts, ensuring fair and transparent payment to all participants. Your strategy might depend on your gaming and investment goals. Long-term participants often choose staking for steady rewards, while those excited about prediction gaming might hold tokens for immediate use when features launch. The current presale price of $0.00825 offers both options – you can stake for rewards now and still have tokens ready for gaming later. Remember, starting small lets you learn the system while participating in the platform’s early growth.

Besides, the volume of the token has been slashed heavily, due to which cryptos like Avalanche have become less volatile. In times when more squeeze is expected, the AVAX price is expected to trigger a strong breakout that could elevate the levels beyond the current consolidation. Avalanche is among the tokens, which are believed to outperform the top 2 tokens in the upcoming price action as they are considered to be heavily undervalued at the current price. Mainly because no major change in the price was recorded even after the launch of Avalanche 9000, which is considered the largest-ever upgrade of the platform. However, the price was heading towards the yearly highs ahead of the launch but the token followed the market trend and plunged by over 30%. The token’s inefficiency to rise above $40 over the past week could have raised some concerns over the next price action. However, in the wider perspective, the AVAX price remains primed for a 50% upswing, but if the bulls manage to revive a 12% rise before the end of 2024,. The daily chart of the AVAX price may suggest the token could be heading towards the immediate lower support as it is on the verge of losing the 0.5 FIB at $36.26. The MACD indicates a drop in the selling pressure but it is yet to be flipped to a buying range. On the other hand, the bears continue to hold a major dominance as seen in the bull-bear power, indicating another pullback of around 10% could be in place, probably reaching the interim support at 0.382 FIB at $32.2. These levels have been offering strong support previously and hence a strong rebound could be expected at these levels. However, the market sentiments have not yet turned bullish as the traders continue to remain neutral. Therefore, the Avalanche price is expected to maintain a sluggish trend until the platform receives enough volume favouring the bulls. AVAX is usually referred to as the sleeping giant, as it is believed to have huge potential and is defending the support to a large extent. However, the market volatility has slashed hard and until the BTC dominance reaches highs, altcoins like Avalanche are expected to maintain a sluggish trend. However, the AVAX price still has the potential to rise above $50 and head towards a higher target, but rising and sustaining above $42 by the end of the year in the first few days if 2025 is very important.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 06:15:12

This milestone represents not only a strategic accumulation effort but also a bold economic experiment under President Nayib Bukele’s leadership. With a 105% unrealised return on its Bitcoin holdings, the country’s foray into cryptocurrency seems profitable on paper. Questions remain about the sustainability of this strategy, particularly as global economic conditions and crypto market volatility pose ongoing challenges. El Salvador’s Bitcoin journey El Salvador became a global crypto pioneer on 6 September 2021, adopting Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the US dollar. Its initial investment of 200 BTC has since grown through consistent purchases, including a $1 million buy after securing a $1.4 billion agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These investments have elevated El Salvador to the sixth-largest Bitcoin-holding nation, alongside powerhouses such as the United States and China. Despite facing criticism from institutions like the IMF, Bukele’s administration doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy, implementing a daily BTC purchase program. This unwavering commitment has paid off during the recent cryptocurrency market recovery, with the nation’s portfolio experiencing a significant unrealised gain of $152 million. The National Bitcoin Office has spearheaded this initiative, tracking and publicising data through Nayib Tracker. Over the past month alone, the country added 53 BTC, valued at $4.95 million, highlighting its systematic approach to accumulation. These purchases have not only bolstered the treasury but also validated Bukele’s economic gamble—at least for now. Can Bitcoin growth be maintained? While El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment has seen a financial turnaround, its long-term success hinges on several factors. The nation’s average acquisition cost of $45,465 per BTC raises questions about the sustainability of profits if market prices falter. The cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility could undermine the government’s ability to leverage its holdings during economic downturns. The $1.4 billion IMF deal provides temporary fiscal breathing room but also places pressure on the administration to demonstrate the viability of Bitcoin as an economic pillar. Critics argue that relying heavily on a speculative asset may expose the country to risks, particularly in the absence of diversified revenue streams. Furthermore, global macroeconomic conditions remain a critical factor. With central banks tightening monetary policies and economic growth slowing in key markets, cryptocurrency adoption and valuations could face headwinds. El Salvador’s crypto-centric strategy may also complicate relationships with international lenders, potentially limiting access to future funding. What’s next for El Salvador’s Bitcoin ambitions? As the country surpasses 6,000 BTC, valued at over half a billion dollars, its achievements are undeniably remarkable. Sustaining these gains requires careful navigation of market dynamics and economic policies. The administration’s success in using Bitcoin to stimulate growth, attract investment, and maintain financial stability will determine whether El Salvador’s gamble sets a global precedent or becomes a cautionary tale. By focusing on expanding initiatives through the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador has an opportunity to solidify its position as a leader in crypto adoption. However, balancing this ambition with fiscal prudence will be crucial as the world watches this unprecedented experiment unfold.

These releases crowd circulating supply and can push up prices, trading volumes, and liquidity through the market.

Unmatched by the current 1 block/s and the plan to achieve 10 or even 100 block/s, KAS is built for high-throughput financial applications, with speed, scalability, and security as its pillars, and features like directed acyclic graph (DAG) topology querying, data pruning, and SPV proofs and layer 2 subnetworks.

Because they affect market dynamics, transparency, and investor sentiment, unlock is essential. Big unlocks can indicate selling pressure and affect near-term prices, while the others might drive ecosystem growth by funding development or incentivizing participation.

Enter BTFD Coin—a meme coin making waves with its explosive presale success, already surpassing $4.6 million . But this isn’t just another crypto story; it’s a chance for investors to rewrite their financial futures.

Will It Be Implemented?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/another-critical-bitcoin-btc-move-comes-from-hong-kong-will-it-be-implemented/,"As Donald Trump is expected to take office as US President, his promise of a national Bitcoin reserve continues to set an example for the entire world. At this point, while the BTC reserve discussion has come to the fore in many countries, Hong Kong, which is on its way to becoming a cryptocurrency center, has also joined these discussions. A Hong Kong lawmaker has proposed including Bitcoin in Hong Kong's financial reserves, local news agency Wenweipo reported. Accordingly, Hong Kong Legislative Council member Johnny Ng put forward a proposal that included utilizing the “one country, two systems” framework to include Bitcoin in Hong Kong's reserves. Stating that holding a significant amount of Bitcoin is now mandatory to have a significant economy, the lawmaker suggested that the Exchange Fund buy Bitcoin and hold it for a long time in order to encourage the development of the cryptocurrency sector in Hong Kong, attract more funds and generate more transaction stamp duty revenue. Noting that the current fiscal deficit in Hong Kong has exceeded 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion), MP Ng said that holding small amounts of Bitcoin will not be a solution to the fiscal deficit, but if a significant amount of BTC is purchased, it can be useful to reduce the fiscal deficit. “Hong Kong should explore ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its foreign exchange reserves by taking advantage of the ‘one country, two systems’ principle. Buying Bitcoin can help stabilize the financial system. At this point, the Hong Kong government can use Bitcoin as a way to strengthen the financial system. Considering that the current fiscal deficit exceeds 100 billion yuan (about 20 trillion won), holding only a small amount of Bitcoin will not significantly help reduce the deficit.” *This is not investment advice.

Details show Decentraland boasted 116.27 GitHUB events within the previous 30 days. Source – Santiment That reflects massive developer participation within the non-fungible token ecosystem. Decentraland team stirs confidence Santiment’s GitHub data analyzes significant developments within a project. The crypto analytics firm highlights that magnified developer participation indicates confidence in the platform’s future. Projects with more active creators promise improvements and enhanced futures for the community. Thus, platforms with increased GitHub events have a higher success rate and lessened scam risks. Decentraland’s success in the previous few months further cements this confidence. The blockchain has regularly ranked high since November, underscoring developer dedication to the project’s success. The substantial developer activity has cemented Decentraland’s status within the NFT world. It will dominate with enhanced developer participation, signaling sustainability and success in the future. Santiment adds that stakeholders often prefer such projects. MANA price action The native coin traded at $0.4918 during this publication, with a daily low and high of $0.4787 and $0.5150. Chart by Coinmarketcap . Despite the 3.20% weekly surge, MANA has struggled lately, losing nearly 25% of its value within the past month. Prolonged winter in the NFT sector contributed to MANA’s underperformance. The non-fungible token space has struggled with dried activities since the 2020/2021 bull run. NFT market overview Non-fungible tokens exhibit bearishness as Bitcoin struggles to surpass $100K again. CryptoSlam stats show the NFT space witnessed slow performances in the past week. NFT sales volume dipped by 48% within the last seven days to $142.96 million. Despite the substantial trading volume slump, market participation indicators confirmed unwavering interest from existing and new players. For instance, NFT buyers and sellers increased by 42% and 41% in the past seven days. The Ethereum NFT marketplace saw its sales down to $75 million, a 60% 7-day decline. Amidst declined volumes, the blockchain saw a 43% surge in buyers to 63,000, while wash trading plunged significantly by 80% to $21.56 million. Bitcoin’s NFT space revealed similar trends, with sales down 30% to $28 million. Nonetheless, a 52% buyer increase to 59,310 signals notable user growth. Also, Solana, ImmutableX, and Mythos Chain demonstrated resilience, while Pudgy Penguins led the downside with significant dips. Pudgy Penguins has seen plunges across all indicators, with sales, transactions, and buyer participation down 77%, 72%, and 70%. However, the latest developments suggest possible resurgences, with improved performance for associated projects in the coming months. Decentraland’s impressive developer activity forms a massive groundwork for renewing trust, making the platform lucrative for investors. Developer participation is among the top indicators of the project’s future outlook. Such sentiments could wake MANA price from its bearish slumber.

XRP sunk more than 5% in the past 24 hours, with dogecoin (DOGE), Solana’s SOL, ether (ETH) and BNB falling as much as 2%. Overall market capitalization fell 3%, while the broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), an index tracking the largest tokens, minus stablecoins, shed 3.5%. US equities declined on Friday and as investors trimmed positions amid uncertainty heading into year-end. An Asia Pacific index reversed 5-day gains, while futures contracts on U.S. indexes S&P 500 and Nasdaq pointed to losses in the U.S. session as of Asian afternoon hours. BTC has historically moved in the opposite direction of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, including the euro. Strength in the dollar largely comes ahead of President-elect Donald Trump stepping into office in late January, where he has promised several policies to help the economy in the coming years. When the dollar strengthens, dollar-denominated assets become more attractive compared to cryptocurrencies. Investors prefer traditional investments like U.S. Treasuries or stocks, which yield returns in a strong dollar environment. That, however, has dampened hopes of a continual crypto rally amid lower liquidity and year-end profit-taking among investors. A “Santa rally,” a colloquial term for bullish seasonality seen in December, has failed with a nearly 4% drop in BTC prices this month (it is still up 47% in the final quarter, data shows ). Elsewhere, scaled back expectations for continual interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have contributed to a fall in bitcoin and crypto prices in the past month. Some, however, remain optimistic about long-term crypto policies helping bump the market despite the lack of rate cuts or a strong dollar. “Unlike what many believe, Bitcoin and altcoins have not hit their price tops despite the ongoing consolidation fueled by the interest rate cut last week,” Maksym Sakharov, co-founder of WeFi, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “The selloffs recorded stem from the knee-jerk reaction by the market to uncertainties associated with macroeconomic policies. The Fed is preparing for higher figures next year despite inflation close to the 2% annual benchmark. This might shift the direction of monetary policy and impact the market. “But when US President-elect Donald Trump takes office in the coming year, more corporate firms will enter the Bitcoin ecosystem as the regulations become favorable. If these projections play out, the price of Bitcoin may also decouple from macroeconomic factors that generally trigger its intense volatility,” Sakharov added.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-30 07:18:47

The ADA’s bullish upswing since November 4, which coincided with the re-election of Donald Trump, has confined macro bullish outlook via a weekly higher high and higher low. The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $39 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of around $871 million, has experienced a significant resistance above $1.24. From a technical analysis standpoint, ADA’s price faces midterm bearish sentiment before enough buyers enforce a bullish outlook, potentially in the first half of 2025. Midterm Targets for ADA In the daily timeframe, Cardano price has been forming a potential head and shoulder pattern after hitting the upper border of the multi-month megaphone consolidation. With the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) having formed a bearish divergence, ADA’s price is well positioned to drop in the coming days before rebounding in the first quarter of 2025. Furthermore, ADA price has consistently closed below the 50-day Moving Average (MA) signaling a notable decline in the previously bullish momentum. In case of further crypto selloff, ADA price should find a solid support range between 77 cents and 68 cents. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH About to Explode-May Form A New ATH in Q1 2025 , Fundamentals to Consider The Cardano network has grown to a vibrant web3 ecosystem, with over $433 million in total value locked (TVL) and over $22 million in stablecoins market cap.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 07:22:00

However, analysts expect an explosive 2025 for the second-largest cryptocurrency as accumulation continues. Meanwhile, Pepe (PEPE) and Rollblock (RBLK) continue to gain significant traction , as the latter could prove to be one of the best sleeper plays of 2025. With a revolutionary GambleFi platform, and an intriguing reward system, Rollblock is ready to make waves and redefine crypto gambling. Rollblock Is Set To Disrupt The $450 Billion Gambling Industry How Rollblock Builds A Bulletproof Track Record Rollblock’s community-backed Web3 casino has been in business for over 8 months and is already generating substantial revenue. In such a short amount of time, tens of thousands of players worldwide have made it their go-to platform. In December alone, registration and deposits tripled , and over $1.3 million in bets has been wagered. This indicates exponential growth in popularity and activity, making Rollblock the hottest emerging GambleFi project. GambleFi Explained At the intersection between online gambling and DeFi, is GambleFi. Users are not just players, they effectively become stakeholders through the casino’s native token — RBLK. Holding the token will allow them to reap incredible rewards and play a crucial role in Rollblock’s success. Let’s discover how the RBLK token changes the game and sets Rollblock miles ahead of other competitors in the online gambling space. Discover Rollblock’s Tokenomics The RBLK token powers various functions within the ecosystem and is designed with long-term growth and stability in mind. Here’s a breakdown of its main features: Revenue-Sharing Mechanisms: Every week, Rollblock reinvests up to 30% of its profits in open-market buybacks of the RBLK token. Constant Supply Reduction: 60% of these tokens are burned and removed from circulation, allowing for sustainable growth, while ensuring price stability in times of increased volatility. Staking Rewards: The remaining 40% of RBLK is redistributed to holders for staking their tokens on the platform. This will allow them to enjoy a passive income stream with market-beating APY . This model not only rewards long-term engagement, but investors will also benefit from scarcity-driven appreciation, elevating RBLK as one of the most attractive investments of 2025. What Can Newcomers Expect From Rollblock Rollblock boasts a well-rounded platform that appeals to every type of player. Over 7,000 games await on arrival, ranging from casino classics like roulette and blackjack, to live games and exclusive AI-powered games. A sports betting option has been recently added allowing participants to bet on their favorite sports and leagues, including NFL, UFC, NBA, and many more. Over one hundred new games will be released next year, further expanding Rollblock’s already vast offering. A Commitment To Safety And Trust The online casino space has been facing issues of lack of transparency and security for years, which have eroded trust and driven users away en masse. Rollblock’s blockchain-based framework solves this, as all transactions are immutably recorded, easily traceable, and immune to tampering. SolidProof has audited Rollblock’s smart contract and recently, the casino has also secured a license from Anjouan Gaming, ensuring compliance with the latest regulatory standards. Ethereum’s Price Stalls, But Blackrock Is Ecstatic After multiple failed attempts at overcoming the critical $4,000 resistance, Ethereum (ETH) entered a descending channel as market turbulence intensified. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,355 with minimal fluctuations in either direction. In the last month alone, Ethereum has shed over 16% in value after forming a local peak of around $4,000. Meanwhile, institutional investors are taking advantage of this dip, as Ethereum’s ETFs are seeing record inflows. Since November, Blackrock’s Ethereum ETF has recorded over $1.5 billion in net inflows. Pepe Ready For A Breakout? Pepe has emerged as one of the leading memecoins despite experiencing significant volatility. In the past month, Pepe’s value dropped by nearly 13% which led to a breakdown below the key $0.000020 support. On higher timeframes, Pepe’s performance also appears bearish, however, analysts believe that a price reversal is imminent, as the bottom seems to be in. Experts point out that a bullish megaphone pattern is forming on the Pepe chart, which is foreshadowing an upward surge. If a breakout is confirmed, Pepe’s price could soar to new heights, with the next major target being $0.000032 in Q1 2025. Join The Rollblock Presale Before The 50x Moonshot! While both Ethereum and Pepe will likely see impressive rallies as the cycle progresses, Rollblock could become next year’s crypto dark horse. Its low market cap and cutting-edge GambleFi platform reveal a perfect growth formula that could see the price of RBLK skyrocket by 50x when the bull run is in full swing. Stage 9 of the RBLK presale is now live and tokens are selling at a discount for just $0.044. The best time to get involved? Now!

Although PEPE’s viral appeal and whale accumulation point to millionaire-making potential, the emergence of Rexas Finance (RXS) as a utility-driven tokenization platform presents even more possibilities. Now is the ideal time to explore their options since a $900 investment in each may make you a crypto millionaire before the bull run ends. Pepe Coin and Rexas Finance (RXS) Could Transform Investors from $900 To Crypto Millionaires Let’s dive deeper into the potential of PEPE and RXS to transform your crypto portfolio from $900 to millions. Pepe Coin (PEPE): A Meme Coin Turning Heads Pepe Coin has demonstrated its ability to remain in the forefront as one of the best meme coins to buy , with its outstanding performance this year. Currently, PEPE is trading at $0.0000182, a 2.39% drop in the past 24-hours, an opportunity for savvy investors to buy dip. Despite the recent drop, the frog-themed meme coin has gained nearly 1251.61% year-to-date, especially as whales keep piling it in enormous quantities. Notably, Lookonchain’s research showed that nine wallets, recently invested nearly $14 million in total, to acquire 555 billion PEPE coins. This represents increased confidence in the crypto coin by big players. Though volatile, PEPE is just 33% off its all-time high of $0.00002803, attained on December 9, 2024. This pattern suggests a bullish breakout, paving the way for a $900 investment to potentially transform you into a crypto millionaire before the bull run ends. While PEPE’s price surge has undeniable appeal, the emergence of a new crypto rival has sparked even greater buzz in the market. Rexas Finance (RXS): The New Contender with Massive Potential Rexas Finance (RXS) is emerging as a transforming tool that is ready to change the crypto scene. While Pepe Coin has gained significant attention for its viral appeal and impressive growth, Rexas Finance offers substantial value by allowing the flawless development and maintenance of digital tokens that reflect real-world assets (RWAs). This invention is a game-changer because it enables people to tokenize and exchange assets such as real estate, commodities, and intellectual property. Texas Finance is democratizing access to tokenization and fueling the next big wave of adoption in blockchain technology. The team’s decision to prioritize public presale funding over venture money allows regular investors to participate in a project that has already generated over $33.38 million from the first public presale stage. Priced at $0.175, the RWA token is currently in Stage 11 and has gained a startling 500% from its initial presale price. Its listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, similar to Pepe Coin’s listing strategies, further support its performance, demonstrating increasing investor trust. Rexas Finance (RXS) Tokenomics Market Confidence and Potential Return Rexas Finance (RXS) has reached vital benchmarks, establishing a reputation and trust among investors. The project’s successful Certik audit, the gold standard in blockchain security, guarantees the platform’s credibility and safety. Plans to list RXS on three elite exchanges further highlight the team’s dedication to enabling a global audience to adopt the token. These elements have positioned Rexas Finance (RXS) as a project with great potential to dominate the fast-expanding niche of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. As the presale is approaching close, market analysts are projecting a possible price spike of over 200,000%, which could raise RXS to $350 per token. Buyers preferring early-stage cryptocurrencies like RXS, could transform a $900 investment at the current presale price generating a multimillion-dollar portfolio before the bull run ends. Maximizing gains in the crypto market depends on spreading investments among attractive assets as it prepares for a possible spectacular bull run. Driven by actual use and acceptance, Rexas Finance (RXS) marks the next stage of crypto growth, while Pepe Coin rides on its meme currency momentum. Final Thoughts Pepe Coin has proven to be a force to be reckoned with, thanks to its staggering price surge and whale interest. For individuals trying to create life-changing wealth during this bull run, Rexas Finance (RXS) presents a convincing alternative, nonetheless. Its emphasis on real-world asset tokenization, presale success, and optimistic forecasts distinguishes it as a candidate. With a $900 investment in either PEPE or RXS, the idea of becoming a crypto millionaire before the bull run ends is no longer unrealizable. Whether it’s PEPE’s viral appeal or Rexas Finance’s (RXS) transforming power, investors who deliberately invest in both initiatives stand a better chance of maximizing each other’s unique qualities.

Now , Hong Kong remains one of the more crypto-friendly cities, even as 51 nations have already banned cryptocurrencies. Hong Kong strengthens crypto regulations despite restrictions According to the People’s Bank of China, Hong Kong has made significant advancements in its regulation and licensing procedures. This progress comes despite mainland China’s continued restrictions on crypto trading and recent regulatory changes to the international framework for crypto assets introduced by the Financial Stability Board. In its annual China Financial Stability Report , the bank highlighted Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) role in regulating and licensing. According to the bank’s report, the commission has virtual assets under two categories for supervision, securitized financial assets and non-securitized financial assets, while it enforces a unique “dual license” system for digital asset exchanges. Major financial institutions, including HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, are also mandated to incorporate virtual asset platforms into their routine customer monitoring processes, and crypto asset businesses must seek licenses from the commission. So far, the Securities and Futures Commission has licensed four new crypto exchanges in December: Accumulus GBA Technology (Hong Kong), DFX Labs, Hong Kong Digital Asset EX, and Thousand Whales Technology (BVI). Eric Yip, the SFC’s executive director of intermediaries, even commented: We have been proactively engaging with VATPs’ senior management and ultimate controllers, which helps drive home our expected regulatory standards and expedite our licensing process for VATPs. We aim to strike a balance between safeguarding the interests of investors and facilitating continuous development for the virtual asset ecosystem in Hong Kong. – Eric Yip Some Hong Kong’s crypto institutions disapprove of the regulatory requirements The Financial Stability Board established an International Regulatory Framework for Crypto Assets, outlining high-level guidelines for crypto asset oversight. Hong Kong has been striving to follow the framework; however, some crypto institutions are pushing back against its SFC’s regulatory requirements. The four licenses granted this December were just among nearly 30 applications this year. Of the nearly 30 companies that sought licenses, only around a dozen are still waiting for their licenses from the commission, as several major platforms, including OKX and HTX, withdrew their applications due to strict regulatory requirements.

This repayment marks a major milestone in rebuilding trust in the crypto industry after FTX’s shocking downfall in 2022. MASSIVE NEWS FTX begins repaying $16 BILLION to creditors on Jan 3, 2025! Payments expected within 60 days… and guess what? A big chunk of that $$$ might flow BACK INTO CRYPTO. The bull run just got its fuel. Buckle up. #Bitcoin #crypto pic.twitter.com/TwqeXknvYR — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 29, 2024 FTX’s repayment plan was approved in October, and customers with claims under $50,000 will be the first to receive their money. Notably as per the plan the first they will clear the smaller repayments followed by the larger repayments later in 2025. The company plans to return 98% of what customers lost, with many returning 119% of their claimed account value. FTX CEO John J. Ray III expressed confidence in the plan, saying, “We are well positioned to begin executing the distribution of recoveries back to all customers and creditors.” Boosting the Crypto Market This massive $16 billion repayment could boost the crypto market . Many of the creditors are experienced crypto investors who might reinvest their money into digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driving up demand and pushing prices even higher. Historically crypto market recovers only after massive corrections or liquidity inflow in the current scenario this is a perfect moment for a bully rally. The timing is perfect for the market, as Bitcoin has already crossed $100,000 this year , fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin halving . While customers will get back more than they lost, the repayments are based on November 2022, when Bitcoin was trading at just $17,000. With Bitcoin trading at $93K, many recipients might reinvest their funds to catch up on the gains they missed. Moreover, FTX has teamed up with well-known crypto firms Kraken and BitGo to handle the repayments. Their involvement shows how far the crypto industry has come in terms of reliability and infrastructure, which is a positive sign for investors looking for stability in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Bitcoin Price Dropping Today? , A Fresh Start for Crypto FTX’s repayments are more than just numbers it is also a move to regain the investor faith in the company.

Of the 740 ETFs launched this year, crypto ETFs dominate the top eight spots in terms of inflows. Following Donald Trump’s victory in 2024 US elections, inflows into BTC and Ether ETF have surged significantly in the hope of crypto-friendly policies and the plans of building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin ETF Dominate ETF Launches in 2024 Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the growing dominance of crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024. According to Geraci, the top eight ETF launches this year have all been tied to digital assets. These include four spot Bitcoin ETFs, two spot Ethereum ETFs, and two ETFs tracking MicroStrategy (MSTR). This surge in crypto-related ETFs stands out against the backdrop of nearly 740 total ETF launches in 2024. Thus, it highlights a major shift in the investing landscape as BTC and crypto become more mainstream.

Strong Inflows Continue for BTC and Ethereum ETFs Last week, between December 23 and December 27, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a net outflow of $388 million, reflecting some profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. However, the Fidelity ETF (FBTC) saw a weekly net inflow of $183 million, signaling sustained interest from certain investor segments.

Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted a potential bullish setup for Bitcoin (BTC) signaling a possible price rebound. However, the analyst emphasized that the recovery is contingent upon BTC maintaining its critical support level at $93,000.

Meanwhile, Russia is using Bitcoin to conduct commerce outside the traditional finance channels in the face of international sanctions. While these developments certainly bear strategic adversarial overtones, the way Bitcoin changes the equation shows great promise. Cryptocurrency provides the world powers with a peaceful competition over technology. It turns out that with Bitcoin , even atomic-era sovereign partners/rivals can settle differences by using money, like civilized people. Russians Gain Ground in Bitcoin Race The United States and Russia have long shared common interests, especially since allying against the Axis powers in World War II. They include a common interest in atomic safety, nuclear non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, and space colonization. They are also both secular states with constitutions that guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Meanwhile, both are majority Christian nations, with about two-thirds of each country identifying as a person of faith in a traditional belief system. While 20th-century disputes involving the US and Russia involved armed conflict, the Obama-Trump era has focused on de-escalation, demilitarization, and win-win outcomes. That includes strategic offensive arms reductions, economic tariffs on Russian imports, and trade sanctions against Russian financial institutions. Bitcoin adds another domain that deescalates conflict and harnesses it to technological advancement and commercial rivalry. Trump Promises US Will Take The Lead A month after his landmark election victory in November, Trump reiterated his promise that under the new administration, the US “will do something great with crypto.” “Because we don’t want China or anybody else— others are embracing it, and we want to be the head,” the incoming president told CNBC’s Jim Cramer. “We want to be the head of AI. We’re gonna be ahead of AI.” “And we’ve got to produce a tremendous amount of electricity. And you know that,” he explained. “It’s unbelievable when you think that we need more than twice what we already have. But we’ll be able to do it.” The way Trump sees it , in an ideal world, all the remaining Bitcoin would be mined in the United States. Bottom Line for Investors If you thought Redditors racing for Bitcoin drove its price up to incredible proportions, imagine what will happen as sovereign world powers join the fray.

On Dec. 28, on-chain investigator Taylor Monahan flagged a new scheme being leveraged by bad actors who claim to be recruiters for prominent crypto firms to approach targets with lucrative job offers on platforms like LinkedIn, freelancing platforms, Telegram, etc. Once the victim is interested, they are redirected to a video interviewing platform dubbed “Willo | Video Interviewing,” which isn’t malicious in itself but is designed to make the entire scheme look convincing to the victims. As part of the process, victims are initially asked standard industry-related questions, such as their views on significant crypto trends over the next 12 months. These questions help build trust and make the interaction seem legitimate. However, the real attack unfolds during the final question, which requires recording it on video. When trying to set up the video recording process, victims encounter a technical issue with their microphone or camera. This is when the real attack plays out, as the website presents malicious troubleshooting steps masked as a solution to the issue.

A troubleshooting guide presented to victims to fix a supposed technical glitch | Source: Taylor Monahan on X “It allows them to do anything on your device. It’s not really general purpose stealer, it’s general purpose access. Ultimately they’ll rekt you via whatever means are required,” Monahan wrote. This access could potentially allow malicious actors to bypass security measures, install malware, monitor activities, steal sensitive data, or drain cryptocurrency wallets without the victim’s knowledge, based on typical outcomes observed in similar attacks. Monahan advised crypto users to avoid running unfamiliar code and recommended those who may have been exposed to such attacks wipe their devices entirely to prevent further compromise. The attack deviates from the usual tactics seen in similar job recruitment scams. For instance, cybersecurity firm Cado Security Labs, earlier this month, uncovered a scheme involving a fake meeting application that injected malware, enabling attackers to drain cryptocurrency wallets and steal browser-stored credentials. Similarly, last year, crypto.news reported an incident where scam recruiters targeted blockchain developers on Upwork, instructing them to download and debug malicious npm packages hosted on a GitHub repository. Once executed, these packages deployed scripts granting attackers remote access to victims’ devices.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/last-months-rising-star-xrp-loses-momentum-due-to-stronger-us-dollar-here-are-the-details/,"The cryptocurrency market experienced a broad-based decline as a stronger US dollar put pressure on digital assets, with XRP leading the losses on Monday. XRP Leads Crypto Drop Amid Strong Dollar, Year-End Uncertainty The token has fallen by 5% in the past 24 hours, outpacing declines of up to 2% in other major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB. The strength of the dollar, as measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), has historically led to lower demand for dollar-denominated assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and gold. Asian stocks also fell, with the Asia-Pacific index reversing a five-day gain. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures pointed to further losses in the U.S. trading session. The decline came as investors adjusted their positions amid year-end uncertainty. Despite a 47% increase in bitcoin prices in the last quarter, the expected “Santa Claus rally” failed to materialize, with BTC prices falling by around 4% in December. The stronger dollar is linked to reduced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates and cautious optimism about macroeconomic policies. In the current environment, investors prefer traditional investments such as U.S. Treasury bonds and stocks that provide returns in a strong dollar scenario. While the market is facing short-term challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about the long-term direction of crypto markets. WeFi co-founder Maksym Sakharov expressed confidence in the resilience of bitcoin and altcoins despite the current consolidation. “The recorded sell-off is due to the market’s knee-jerk reaction to uncertainties regarding macroeconomic policies,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts are speculating about the asset’s potential during this cycle and have outlined an important support level that needs hold; otherwise, XRP could plummet toward $1. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP rode the Trump-induced rally like very few altcoins did, going from $0.6 to a multi-year peak of almost $3 within a month or so. However, its run was halted at the beginning of December, and the asset failed to break above $3 and head toward a new all-time high. Although the launch of its long-anticipated stablecoin in mid-December led to immediate and impressive gains , its momentum is gone once again now. In fact, XRP is down by 25% since that local peak on December 17. The past 24 hours have also been painful for Ripple’s cross-border token, which has slumped by 6% and is struggling to remain above $2. Many industry analysts have now outlined the $1.96 support as a crucial level that needs to be maintained in order for XRP to continue its impressive performance. If it falls, though, the cryptocurrency could drop to as low as $1, according to Andrew Griffiths. #XRP Xrp has been trading in what appears to be a bullish pennant. But if this bullish pattern where to fail it would fastly fall into the low $1 range. Being that Bitcoin has topped for the year, we may see lower prices for Xrp. Losing $1.98 would send Xrp into a dizzying fall.… pic.twitter.com/8K9OPp63rc — Andrew Griffiths (@AndrewGriUK) December 29, 2024 In contrast, XRP will have a chance to resume its rally and aim for a new all-time high during this cycle only if it bounces that support line, predicted another analyst – MAGIC. #XRP continues to hold above 1.98 (blue trendline) and it appears to be forming a bull flag on the weekly. If that bull flag fails and price drops below the 1.98 level, XRP could fall rapidly. 1.98 is critical support and 3.53 is the primary upside resistance. pic.twitter.com/hpyXHQXsqk — MAGIC (@MagicPoopCannon) December 29, 2024 The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Down Today Again? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-30 07:58:16

Both companies hired Kroll, an international restructuring firm that fuels speculations regarding mismanagement, opacity, and the consequences for creditors in the long term. The Vauld Experience: A Warning for Wazirx Due to the restructuring plan done by Vauld and spearheaded by Darshan Bathija and with the help of Kroll, creditors were not pleased. The scheme was to lock token values during a low market and that gave Kroll and Vauld high recovery rates when the market recovered. As for Vauld, although they have managed to refund about $100 million to creditors, they inflated it to $200 million during the market pump, so as to conceal their actual losses. Furthermore, the creditors of Vauld also had other issues. Writing off could only be filed in terms of frozen USD values to discourage claims for real token value decrease. More fuel was added to resentment over mismanaged funds, no audits, and the inability to recover $6-$8 million lost through hacks prior to insolvency. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Hacks This Week: Pudgy Penguins Phishing Scam Leads the Pack , Wazirx Acquiring Peek for Its Restructuring WazirX creditors did not quickly forget this as CEO Nischal Shetty recently proposed a restructuring , again with Kroll.

It is important when comparing Vauld and WazirX, the exposures to creditors, particularly when WazirX undergoes restructuring. Victims aka creditors have called for more attention, disclosure, passion for regaining lost funds and less of the cycle that was futile, disappointed Vauld users. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Galaxy Research’s Alex Thorn says he sees Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging by nearly 100% from current levels before 2025 expires amid increasing adoption of the largest digital asset by market cap. “Bitcoin will cross $150,000 in H1 and test or best $185,000 in Q4 2025. A combination of institutional, corporate, and nation-state adoption will propel Bitcoin to new heights in 2025. Throughout its existence, Bitcoin has appreciated faster than all other asset classes, particularly the S&P 500 and gold, and that trend will continue in 2025. Bitcoin will also reach 20% of gold’s market cap.” Source: Galaxy Research/X Thorn also believes that Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) will witness tens of billions of dollars in inflows next year. “The US spot Bitcoin ETPs will collectively cross $250 billion in AUM (assets under management) in 2025. In 2024, the Bitcoin ETPs collectively took in more than $36 billion in net inflows, making them the best ETP launch as a cohort in history. Many of the world’s major hedge funds bought the Bitcoin ETPs, including Millennium, Tudor, and D.E. Shaw, while the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) bought a position, according to 13F filings. After just 1 year, the Bitcoin ETPs are only 19% away ($24 billion) from flipping the AUM of all the US physical gold ETPs.” Data from crypto analytics firm Coinglass shows that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) collectively have nearly $110 billion in AUM. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $93,687. Looking at Ethereum ( ETH ), Thorn predicts that the leading layer-1 protocol will see fresh all-time highs next year. “Ether will trade above $5,500 in 2025. A relaxation of regulatory headwinds for DeFi (decentralized finance) and staking will propel Ether to new all-time highs in 2025. New partnerships between DeFi and TradFi (traditional finance), perhaps conducted inside new regulatory sandbox environments, will finally allow traditional capital markets to experiment with public blockchains in earnest, with Ethereum and its ecosystem seeing the lion’s share of use. Corporations will increasingly experiment with their own layer-2 networks, mostly based on Ethereum technology. Some games utilizing public blockchains will find product-market fit, and NFT (non-fungible token) trading volumes will meaningfully rebound.” At time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,420.

Lindner has called on the European Central Bank (ECB) and the German Bundesbank to follow the U.S. by adding cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to their reserves. German To Add Bitcoin To Their Reserves The FDP’s latest election manifesto shows a clear focus on digital assets. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are mentioned five times, showing how important they are becoming to the party’s plans. Lindner pointed to the United States, where crypto-friendly policies are being introduced under the Trump administration. He criticized Germany’s political leaders for neglecting the global shift toward digital currencies, stating, “I don’t hear anything about this in the central debates of the German Bundestag.” Strengthening Reserves with Bitcoin Lindner believes Bitcoin could make Germany’s financial reserves stronger. He highlighted how cryptocurrencies are now a big part of global wealth and warned that Europe needs to act quickly to avoid falling behind countries like the U.S. This idea is similar to ongoing discussions in the U.S., where Senator Cynthia Lummis has proposed a bill to allow the Treasury to buy 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. While experts, like Jeff Park from Bitwise Invest, think this plan has only a small chance of succeeding, it shows how Bitcoin is being viewed as a valuable asset. Germany’s Bitcoin History Earlier this year, Germany sold nearly 50,000 Bitcoins seized by Saxony’s public prosecutor’s office. Valued at around $53,000 per coin at the time, the sale resulted in a significant loss compared to today’s price of over $107,000, costing Saxony an estimated $2.7 billion. Bitcoin’s Market Outlook As of now, Bitcoin is trading at $93,370 , a decline from its all-time high of $108,000 on December 17, 2024. Analysts predict a possible correction in the near term, with Bitcoin hovering between $92,000 and $97,000. Meanwhile, key indicators, such as the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), suggest that the market is consolidating after a historic bull rally. With Lindner’s push for Bitcoin adoption and Germany’s evolving crypto narrative, the country could position itself as a leader in digital finance.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 08:06:51

The TGE and airdrop events were planned this year, but things got delayed. However, the enthusiasm is persistent as the listing date approaches, most importantly regarding the PAWS token price and airdrop distribution. So let’s discuss that. What Will be PAWS Token Price With Listing & PAWS Airdrop? PAWS coin is in the process of listing, but the team has not officially commented on the listing price, leaving the investors with random guesses. However, a few platforms have made some price estimates based on the similarity between PAWS and other dog-themed meme coins like DOGS. As per that, the PAWS token price could range between $0.0072 and $0.0078 per Binance. However, the PAWS token price can vary greatly depending on user acquisitions, the total supply of tokens, and other factors. This is why only further updates and the TGE could clarify the situation. PAWS Airdrop Listing Date, Snapshot, and Other Key Details The PAWS coin launch and airdrop have been in discussion for months, but finally, the investors are getting more clarity. Regarding the updates, the most awaited PAWS snapshot event will occur today, December 30, 2024, revealing how many tokens a user will receive with the airdrop. The eligibility for that has been cleared already, as the users need to be active users of the PAWS mini-app on Telegram and complete various simple tasks to earn the PAWS points. More importantly, the users need to connect their TON wallets before the snapshot to ensure they receive the airdrop. However, users are becoming uneasy as the team has not cleared crucial information like the PAWS airdrop listing date, total supply, percentage of token distribution, and many other key details. Regardless, things will become more evident with time. Meanwhile, the team has advised the users to stay connected with the mini-app for further updates. What’s In There For You? Crypto airdrops are a way to join the token’s community. More importantly, they allow users to earn free tokens with simple tasks, which is why investors have been eyeing the PAWS airdrop listing date to make some profits. With the token allocation revelation done, investors will find out how much they will receive and how much they could profit when the expected PAWS token price is around $0.007. However, things can change drastically, as many similar Telegram mini-games token launch teams have made last-minute changes in the airdrops, including Hamster Kombat, which is getting its season 2 soon. With that, the investors are hoping to see the HMSTR price rally to $1 after its collapse with last-minute changes in airdrop allocation. Now, we have to see what the PAWS listing will bring to users.

Besides, with pro-crypto Paul Atkins gearing up to replace the current US SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, the optimism further soars indicating a potential surge in Ripple price ahead. Besides, it also fueled speculations over a potential drop of the Ripple Vs SEC case, with the January 15 deadline approaching for the SEC to file an opening brief in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals. What Happens if US SEC Drops The XRP Lawsuit? The XRP lawsuit is one of the long-running cases in the crypto space and has gained notable traction from investors lately. However, with Donald Trump’s election win in November, the market sentiment remained high over a potential pro-crypto regulatory environment in the US. In addition, it also fueled speculations about whether the incoming US SEC chair Paul Atkins would dismiss the Ripple vs SEC case ahead. Notably, the current US SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, whom many deem an anti-crypto regulatory, will leave his position in January. In addition, Trump’s inauguration on January 20 has further bolstered market sentiment. Now, as the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins is set to replace Gensler, the market sentiment remained positive over a potential drop in the Ripple case. Notably, pro-XRP lawyers like Bill Morgan, Jeremy Hogan, Fred Rispoli, and others, have also indicated a potential dismissal of the legal case under the incoming US SEC chair. On the other hand, the January 15 deadline for the US SEC to file its opening brief in the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals is also approaching. Simultaneously, Ripple CTO Stuart Alderoty also called for an end to the ongoing XRP lawsuit, which has further fueled speculations in the market. This has also sparked discussions over its potential impact on Ripple price, with many anticipating a robust rally ahead. Will Ripple’s Native Crypto Price Rally? The market sentiment towards Ripple’s native crypto remained high, as evidenced by its robust rally recently. However, the rally has recently faded with the investors taking a pause amid the holiday mood. XRP price today was down nearly 6% and exchanged hands at $2.06, with its trading volume soaring 78% to $4.43 billion. However, CoinGlass data showed that XRP Futures Open Interest rose about 2%, indicating a bullish sentiment ahead for the crypto. Despite the recent dip, a flurry of experts expect a potential rebound ahead for Ripple price, especially with optimism soaring over a potential dismissal of the XRP lawsuit. For context, popular market expert EGRAG CRYPTO recently predicted the crypto to hit $6 by March 2025. On the other hand, he further said that the crypto is likely to hit between $13 and $27 in this bull cycle, reflecting his growing confidence in the crypto. However, the investors are keeping close track of the Ripple price, with the recent market volatility in focus. A recent XRP price analysis also hinted that the crypto could crash to $1 ahead before continuing its another run towards the north. Besides, if the US SEC, under Chair Gary Gensler, files its opening brief before the January 15 deadline, it could further weigh on the traders’ sentiment, which in turn could impact its price.

Data reveals that 75.1% of Ether holders have retained their tokens for over a year, a major leap from 59% at the start of the year. In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s long-term holder proportion has declined steadily, dropping from 70% in January to 62.3% by year-end. This divergence highlights a shift in sentiment within the cryptocurrency space, as ETH continues to strengthen its foothold among investors. Analysts suggest that this growing confidence in ETH stems from its versatility and evolving use cases, bolstered by consistent ecosystem developments and the integration of staking into Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Bitcoin Holders Cash Out Amid Price Volatility Bitcoin’s struggles in retaining long-term holders were further accentuated by its turbulent price movement in December. BTC’s value tumbled from its all-time high of $106,000 on December 16 to $93,000 by December 30. According to technical analyst Ger Van Lagen, this sharp decline was fueled by long-term holders capitalizing on the euphoric price spike. While Van Lagen remains optimistic, forecasting Bitcoin to surpass $200,000 in the coming months, the current metrics paint a picture of waning patience among BTC loyalists. This change in behavior raises questions about Bitcoin’s resilience amid growing competition from Ethereum and other blockchain ecosystems. Spotlight on Ether ETFs The rise in Ether’s long-term holder base isn’t occurring in isolation. December alone saw inflows into spot Ether ETFs more than double, with net investments climbing from $1 billion in November to $2.1 billion by month-end. These inflows signal robust institutional interest in ETH, especially with developments such as staking integration and increased regulatory clarity under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). With the cryptocurrency market entering 2025, Ethereum’s steady growth and adoption position it as a compelling asset for long-term investors. Meanwhile, Bitcoin faces the challenge of retaining its dominance as confidence appears to shift, albeit temporarily, toward its closest competitor.

Data from IntoTheBlock revealed that the proportion of Ethereum holders who kept their tokens for over a year increased from 59% in January to 75.1% by the end of December. IntoTheBlock @intotheblock · Follow This chart shows the percentage of long-term Bitcoin and Ether holders over the past year. While the share of long-term Bitcoin decreased, the percentage of long-term ETH holders climbed, surpassing that of Bitcoin early in the year. 7:30 PM · Dec 29, 2024 106 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies In contrast, Bitcoin’s long-term holders saw a steady decline, falling from 70% to 62.3% over the same period. This divergence in long-term holding patterns highlights a broader shift in market sentiment, with Ethereum appearing to attract more confidence amid growing adoption and regulatory clarity. Ethereum long-term holders soar Throughout 2024, Ethereum consistently gained ground as a preferred asset for long-term investors. IntoTheBlock categorizes long-term holders as those retaining their tokens for more than a year. By the end of December, three-quarters of Ethereum holders fell into this category, compared to 59% at the beginning of the year. This upward trend has been driven by factors such as the addition of staking options in Ether ETFs and increased regulatory clarity from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Bitcoin, on the other hand, experienced a noticeable decrease in its long-term holder base. Starting the year with approximately 70% of holders in the long-term bracket, the figure dropped to 62.3% by December. Analysts have linked this decline to profit-taking during BTC’s record-breaking rally in mid-December, which saw the asset hit an all-time high of $106,000 before settling at $93,711 by month’s end. Spot Ether ETFs see $2.1B inflows in December Ethereum’s rise in long-term holdings was complemented by a significant uptick in spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. December saw cumulative net inflows into these ETFs reach $2.1 billion, doubling the $1 billion recorded in November. This robust demand reflects a growing institutional interest in Ethereum as an asset with long-term potential, bolstered by its transition to a proof-of-stake model and growing utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, attributed to large-scale sell-offs by long-term holders, have not dampened optimism entirely. Technical analyst Ger Van Lagen projected Bitcoin could surpass $200,000 shortly, despite its recent volatility. The contrasting trends in long-term holding patterns suggest Ethereum may be viewed as a safer and more sustainable investment going forward. Why this optimism for Ethereum The optimism surrounding Ethereum heading into 2025 is also underpinned by broader market developments. Experts anticipate a Trump administration could favor cryptocurrencies like Ethereum through regulatory reforms, including overhauls of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This environment, coupled with the growing adoption of staking in Ether ETFs, positions Ethereum as a leader in the crypto space. By contrast, Bitcoin faces challenges in retaining long-term investor confidence, as seen in its declining holder percentage. While its role as a digital store of value remains unchallenged, the dynamics between Bitcoin and Ethereum illustrate a shifting landscape in crypto investment preferences.

The asset began its painful decline on December 17 when its price stood above $108,000. In just a matter of three days, it had lost around $16,000 and dumped to $92,000. The bulls intercepted the move and helped prevent a further drop below $90,000. In fact, BTC started recovering some ground and spiked toward $100,000 on a couple of occasions, but to no avail. The last such example was on December 26 when BTC touched that line but was quickly rejected once again. The subsequent decline pushed it south hard, and the asset fell to $95,000 over the weekend. However, the landscape worsened in the past 24 hours and dropped further to $93,000. Despite bouncing off that level, for now, BTC is still over 1% down on the day.

BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, TRX, AVAX, LINK, TON, SUI, and many others are also in the red, albeit in a less painful manner.

Over the past two days, another whale reportedly sold PNUT tokens to acquire 60.03 million MIRA tokens at $0.031 each, spending $1.87 million. However, the value of the MIRA tokens has since dropped to $1.2 million, resulting in an estimated loss of $600,000 for the investor, per recent data from Coingecko’s terminal. This move follows a similar trend from December 12, when another whale created a new wallet and withdrew 8.41 million PNUT tokens, worth $10.68 million at the time, from Binance.

PNUT in long-term decline, short-term gain The crypto coin’s market performance has faced considerable pressure in recent days. Its market cap stands at $687 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $303 million, an increase of 123%. Short-term indicators show a 0.09% decline in the last hour, while long-term data reveal a 44.79% drop over the past 30 days. PNUT market performance: Source – CoinMarketCap Despite garnering an extraordinary 1200% increase in value over the past 90 days, the token’s current price trajectory is showcasing some bearish signs in the long term. PNUT’s origin story as a memecoin is tied to the viral fame of Peanut, the squirrel. Peanut, who gained over 500,000 Instagram followers, became an internet sensation through Mark Longo’s viral videos. The tragic euthanization of Peanut and another rescued animal, Fred, sparked public outrage, inspiring the creation of PNUT and other Peanut-themed tokens. The token gained massive attention after Binance listed the token on November 11. The listing propelled the token to a peak market cap of $2.27 billion and an all-time high price of $1.80. The token’s popularity was further fueled by social media buzz, including mentions from Elon Musk, which helped create the wave to push its price upwards. After experiencing a price and market cap rally, legal controversies and market corrections took a toll on PNUT, and the price uptick that saw investors make millions decelerated exponentially. Mark Longo, popularly known as “the squirrel dad,” issued a cease-and-desist letter to Binance, alleging unauthorized use of his pet squirrel’s image to promote the crypto coin. Longo himself has faced accusations of running scams in the memecoin space, including alleged “rug pulls” in previous projects. Longo’s story is dangerously similar to the infamous Hailey Welch, who is currently facing a heap of lawsuits for the HAWK coin incident. After the news of Longo’s cease-and-desist letter broke, the token dropped 10.2% within 24 hours, falling from $1.17 to $1.05. As of now, PNUT is trading at $0.68, marking a 10.21% drop within a day. The token is currently changing hands almost at its lowest price point in over a month, leaving investors uncertain about its future prospects. PNUT’s upward momentum could continue in 2025 PNUT’s struggles come amid a broader downturn in the altcoin market, which has fueled Bitcoin’s rising dominance, now exceeding 58%. While the crypto market has seen speculative surges, including PNUT’s own 1000% rally earlier this year, maintaining momentum has proven difficult for many memecoins. That said, PNUT has managed to attract the attention of speculative traders. The token boasts over 80,000 on-chain holders and more than $12 million in locked liquidity. Its listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase may keep up a steady flow of interest, though its long-term stability, just like most memecoins, remains uncertain.

However, the start of a new year could end Bitcoin’s bearish outlook and kickstart a bullish outlook based on these top reasons. Top Reasons Why January 2025 Will See Bitcoin Price Skyrocket President-elect Donald Trump’s Inauguration on January 20. Capital inflows as FTX will start paying claims from January 3. MicroStrategy continuing its BTC buying spree. How Will BTC Price React to Donald Trump’s Inauguration? Many investors believe Bitcoin will crash during President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration on January 20. This is because investors who opened trades before the elections would consider closing them, leading to a short-term correction. However, this is unlikely due to January being a historically strong month with positive returns. Furthermore, the FTX claims set to be paid out in January will serve as a capital influx and propel BTC and the broader crypto markets higher. FTX’s Claims Payout in January 2025 May Propel BTC Higher Sunil, an FTX creditor activist, recently quashed a fake report that FTX claims would pay out $16 billion by January 3. According to Sunil, the “distribution does not that start on January 3.” He adds that “the $16 billion” would not be distributed within 60 days. Based on his approximation, $13 billion in cash will be distributed now, and the remaining $14 billion will be paid out in March 2025. He adds that 50% of FTX claims reserve worth $7 billion will not be distributed initially. Regardless, this payout will be a huge capital inflow for crypto markets and could serve as the necessary tailwind to drive BTC’s price higher to a new ATH. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Buying Spree Michael Saylor, the CEO and co-founder of MicroStrategy, has been a huge proponent of Bitcoin. His company holds 444,262 BTC worth $41.41 billion, of which 5,262 BTCs were acquired on December 23. Additionally, MicroStrategy announced its plan to dilute its Class A Common Stock and Preferred Stock. The proposal aims to convert 330 million Class A shares to 10.33 billion shares and 5 million preferred shares to 1.005 billion shares. Investors can assume Saylor’s plan to dilute shares is to add more BTC to their holdings. To conclude, the three reasons mentioned above suggest that 2025 will be a good year for cryptocurrencies, especially BTC. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Expert Predictions Let’s explore key Bitcoin price forecasts by some popular analysts and what they believe BTC will do next. According to popular crypto analyst CryptoBirb, Bitcoin is in the optimism phase and will trigger a “vertical” rally as it anticipates an entry into the belief phase. Based on the MVRV (market value to realized value) valuations, Birb notes that “We’re stepping into 2025 with vertical post-election rallies (+977% avg gain)” and projects an all-time high of BTC beyond $250K. BTC/USD 1-week chart Quinten, another popular analyst, compares the ongoing Bitcoin bull run with the past three cycles and hints that there is more upside before BTC forms a top. BTC Price After Halvings On the other hand, veteran trader Peter Brandt notes that Bitcoin forms a head-and-shoulders setup with $78,000 as its next target. This is a head and shoulders top pattern. It might complete and take price to $78,000; it might fail with a thrust hire: or, it might morph into something else. But as it stands right now, it is a head and shoulders top and must be chartist dealt with for what it is. pic.twitter.com/b9AUUO7ddL — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 29, 2024 The post Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Will Skyrocket In January 2025 appeared first on CoinGape .",Price Analysis|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Price Analysis|BTC price,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-30 09:23:06

The People's Bank of China also touched on the events taking place in the cryptocurrency sector in its 2024 Financial Stability Report. This report noted that while China was closely following many global developments, Hong Kong was making progress in its compliance with cryptocurrencies. While the report referenced Hong Kong’s progress at many points, it was stated that Hong Kong was actively exploring the management of crypto asset licenses. It was stated that although 51 countries and regions around the world, excluding Hong Kong, imposed bans on crypto assets, some countries softened or lifted their bans in 2024. The Rise and SEC's Bitcoin Approval! In the report, where it was stated that the rise in Bitcoin and altcoins attracted attention, it was stated that the rise started in 2023. The report stated that although there are official bans, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will be closely monitored by many countries around the world in 2024. The report, which specifically examines developments in the US, stated that in 2024, the US SEC took action against crypto asset issuers that violated the Securities Act. “Accordingly, the SEC rejected more than 20 spot Bitcoin ETF applications from 2018 to 2023. However, it approved the listing of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. While the SEC made a big splash with its Bitcoin ETF approval, the SEC Chairman later said that this does not mean that the SEC approves or recognizes Bitcoin products and investors should still be careful about the risks associated with Bitcoin and value-related products. In addition to developments in the United States and Hong Kong, the report also included the European Union's MiCA regulation and the regulatory efforts of the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. As you may recall, China banned all activities related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in 2021. However, it is claimed that China may lift the bans in the coming years. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: The People's Bank of China Published Its 2024 Report!

As a result, the volume has dropped to a large extent, indicating the sluggish behaviour of the market participants due to uncertainty circulating around major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, etc., and many more. While Ripple is expanding its network, the XRP price is believed to have a positive impact. Meanwhile, the current trade setup and the market sentiments raise serious concerns over the upcoming price action. The broader market sentiments are neutral at the moment, as the lack of bullish strength has paved the way for the bears to mount some upward pressure. The drop in the price has been supported by the rise in the volume, suggesting the market participants could be panic selling as the token reaches beyond the 2021 highs after remaining sluggish for a long time. Therefore, the lower targets have been activated, as the price is expected to reach $1.88 if the token fails to defend the crucial support at $2. The short-term price action of XRP suggests the token is primed for a major bearish action ahead of the yearly close. The stochastic RSI has been displaying a consistent trend, suggesting a drop in the token’s volatility. Besides, the MACD remains within the negative range without a rise in either bullish or bearish pressure. As the volume remains lower, there could be a fewer possibility of a breakout. Therefore, the XRP price may eventually reach the ascending support line at $2 after undergoing a small rise to $2.1. Additionally, the long-term price action also remains bearish, as the MACD suggests a drop in the buying pressure in the weekly chart. However, the rally appears to be reaching the lower support of the bull flag pennant, indicating a huge possibility of a rebound. Secondly, the RSI remains within the overbought range suggesting the bullish trend to prevail for a long time ahead. Therefore, if the XRP price sustains within the bullish pennant, a rebound may be initiated with the beginning of the fresh yearly trade. This could further pave the way for the token to march towards the higher targets in the coming days.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 09:26:48

Among them, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is already making waves with its new approach, and its Lightchain AI Presale is now open to early adopters. Unlike traditional memecoins like PEPE, which gained massive popularity during the last cycle, LCAI offers far more than just hype. PEPE’s legacy meme coin phenomenon PEPE shows the perfect tale of meme coin fast fame helped by group joy, fun, and quick spread. With its ease and connection, PEPE caught buyers notice, pushing huge price jumps. But like many meme coins, PEPE has no real use, leaning mostly on mood in the market for its worth While its effect on the meme coin world is clear, PEPE’s lasting power is not sure. Its price often links with short-lived fads, making it very weak to market changes and less trust from buyers when the buzz fades. Why LCAI could surpass PEPE Real utility Unlike PEPE, which thrives on cultural relevance, LCAI provides tangible value by solving real-world challenges. Its deflationary tokenomics, with a portion of transaction fees burned, enhances its appeal as a long-term investment. Market growth potential LCAI taps into the rapidly expanding markets of AI and blockchain, industries projected to grow exponentially in the coming years. By bridging these sectors, LCAI captures a broader audience than meme coins, whose appeal remains limited to niche communities. Sustainability and scalability With energy-efficient systems and scalable architecture, LCAI addresses key criticisms of traditional blockchain platforms. Its eco-friendly model positions it as a future-proof investment in a market increasingly conscious of sustainability.

In contrast, Lightchain AI’s robust architecture, mechanisms, and practical applications position it as a rising star with the potential to surpass meme coins like PEPE. As the market gears up for the next bull run, investors seeking a balance between speculative excitement and long-term value may find LCAI to be the ultimate contender. Could this rising token indeed outshine PEPE? Only time will tell, but the groundwork laid by Lightchain AI suggests it’s more than just a possibility, it’s a strong probability.

Drawing from historical trends, current market data, and strategic predictions, Rietveld shared why he believes XRP has significant potential in the coming years. He also emphasized the importance of acting now to capitalize on future gains. XRP’s Recent Growth and Market Trends Rietveld highlighted XRP’s recent performance, noting how it exceeded earlier expectations. In November 2024, XRP’s price surged approximately fivefold to nearly $3, showcasing remarkable growth within a short period. This development has led Rietveld to feel optimistic about XRP’s trajectory as the new year approaches. “Now that we have more updated information on what XRP has done today, I have a pretty good idea of what we can expect going into the new year,” Rietveld remarked. Using this foundation, he analyzed the potential value of a portfolio containing 1,000 XRP tokens by 2025. Why 1,000 XRP is a Key Benchmark Addressing his focus on 1,000 XRP, Rietveld explained that this figure offers a practical benchmark for his predictions. The number simplifies calculations and aligns with the portfolios of many XRP holders, most of whom own fewer than 1,000 tokens. However, Rietveld encouraged investors to aim for larger holdings—such as 10,000 or even 25,000 XRP—if they are looking to maximize returns in the future. Exploring XRP’s Path to $70 A critical part of Rietveld’s analysis focused on XRP’s historical market dominance and how it might influence future prices. He observed that between September and November 2024, XRP’s market share tripled, rising from 1.25% to 3.91% of the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization. Based on this momentum, Rietveld projected that XRP could achieve a market dominance of 20% by 2025. Under this scenario, XRP’s price could increase sixfold from its current value of $2.14, reaching $20 per token. At this price, 1,000 XRP would be worth $20,000. For an extremely bullish case, Rietveld suggested the possibility of XRP climbing to $70 per coin. Such a scenario would elevate the value of a 1,000 XRP portfolio to $70,000. He noted that XRP achieved significant dominance during its peak years in 2014 and 2017, with respective market shares of 16.9% and 18.1%. These historical benchmarks underpin his belief in XRP’s capacity to capture a substantial portion of the crypto market once again. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Conservative Outlook for XRP Despite his bullish predictions, Rietveld offered a more measured estimate for XRP’s value in 2025. He posited that even if XRP captures 10-15% of the total crypto market—which he estimates could grow to $12 trillion—XRP’s price could still land between $20 and $23 per coin. “This price is very reasonable, considering how much the market capitalization has grown in past bull cycles,” Rietveld explained, underscoring the steady growth potential of the cryptocurrency market. Rietveld’s analysis highlights the potential for XRP to deliver significant returns over the next year, particularly for those holding sizable portfolios. While his predictions span conservative and highly optimistic scenarios, he emphasized the importance of paying close attention to market trends and preparing for future opportunities. As 2025 approaches, XRP investors have several possible trajectories to consider, making it an asset worth watching in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.

This phase is crucial for investors as it often precedes significant price movements, setting the stage for the next bull run. Why Michael Saylor thinks BTC price could hit $130k Adding fuel to the fire of speculation, Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, has made a bold prediction that Bitcoin will reach a value of $130,000 by the first quarter of 2025. Michael Saylor ⚡ Founder of MicroStrategy (Parody) @Saylorsatsire · Follow $BTC has re-entered the accumulation zone.In my view, a few weeks of consolidation could set the stage for a massive breakout.$130K+ by Q1 2025 feels inevitable. See you there. 1:47 PM · Dec 29, 2024 7.3K Reply Copy link Read 251 replies The recent record-breaking $18 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum options that expired on December 27, 2024, contributed to a temporary dip below $93,000, but Bitcoin has since rebounded to around $93,411, signaling resilience and potential for upward movement. The accumulation phase of Bitcoin, as noted in recent market analysis, suggests that the digital currency is gearing up for another cycle of growth. This phase is identified by stabilization in price action, where large investors, or “whales,” accumulate Bitcoin at relatively lower prices, preparing for the anticipated surge in value. Michael Saylor’s prediction comes at a time when his company, MicroStrategy, continues to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, now representing a significant portion of the total supply. This strategy has been consistent since August 2020, when MicroStrategy began treating Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, aiming to maximize long-term value for its shareholders. Interestingly, Michael Saylor’s bullish outlook aligns with historical patterns of Bitcoin’s price cycles, as indicated by a chart shared by Vivek on X, which maps out Bitcoin’s journey through various market phases since 2011. The chart highlights that Bitcoin is currently in its “2nd Bull” phase, a period historically associated with substantial price increases.

I mean, Doge really does look good here. Can it not look good in a week from now? Of course it can, but it looks really good at the moment.” However, he emphasized the possibility of short-term pullbacks—something that could bring Dogecoin down to the $.026 region: “In the short term, could we come back down and test 26 cents? Which I’m gonna throw that out there […] I see no real reason to be uber bearish […] but is it possible that we come back down here? Sure.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Could Soar To $23 Based On These Bullish Fractals The $0.26 to $0.28 range emerged as the critical juncture for Dogecoin’s near-term outlook: “As long as we remain above this 28 to 26 cent level […] I see no reason to be super fearful. If we pierce that level […] A loss of $0.26 cents on weekly closes would be catastrophic.” Kevin traced this specific target back to November, when he first suggested Dogecoin would revisit the golden pocket near $0.26. According to him, many were skeptical, but that level eventually got hit: “I took a lot of heat for making that call back in early November when we were at 45 cents […] We ended up coming back down and testing that.” Looking to the upside, Kevin pinpoints a substantial resistance area between $0.30 and $0.35, calling it “big, big resistance.” Following that, he labels $0.94 to $1.00 as his “next big zone,” though he cautioned traders against assuming a guaranteed climb. For Dogecoin to breach previous all-time highs and truly enter “full-blown price discovery,” Kevin wants to see a break above the 0.703 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracements—roughly $0.53 and $0.59 cents, respectively: “I don’t see anything holding Dogecoin back from full-blown price discovery […] We want to break 53 cents […] and then the 0.786 at 59 cents. If we’re durably breaking past that 60 cent area, I don’t see anything holding Dogecoin back.” Drawing parallels to past market cycles, Kevin highlighted how Dogecoin historically checks in with its “bull market support band” and macro support levels before rallying: “We came back, we tested structure support […] bull market support band in this cycle. This is very similar to [the previous cycle]. You can’t deny the similarities.” He described how Dogecoin’s present chart mirrors its cycle patterns “almost insanely,” referring to a breakout followed by a falling wedge, an initial climb, and a retest of macro support: “Crypto has this insane innate ability to follow its cyclical nature of performance […] it’s truly amazing, really.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details Despite Dogecoin’s cyclical consistency, Kevin reminded viewers that external market factors and Bitcoin’s performance (which he called “the leader of the market”) could always derail patterns: “We obviously need Bitcoin to cooperate. We can’t have any crazy situations happen globally.” Kevin also examined the DOGE/BTC pair, noting a macro trend line and a golden pocket test: “We have this macro trend line […] we broke through that and we came back in. We’re currently at the bull market support band […] We came back and tested the macro golden pocket again.” He stressed that if Dogecoin remains above this zone on the DOGE/BTC chart, it should head higher. A breakdown, however, could spell trouble: “Kind of like that 26 cent level […] if we come down and break […] it will coincide with a break of the bull market support band and this macro golden pocket, in which case we can be in some pretty deep s**t.” Kevin also delved into macroeconomic and geopolitical factors that could influence Dogecoin and the wider crypto sphere. He posited that the President Donald Trump returning to the White House in January is “very bullish” if it leads to improved regulations, reduced conflict, and pro-growth policies: “We have Trump coming in the office in January, meaning we’re going to have a crypto-friendly administration […] If we can get the Ukraine and Russia war ended, that’s going to be bullish for markets […] We can get inflation back down to 2% and then start lowering interest rates faster.” When And How High Will DOGE Rise Again? From December dumps to Q1 optimism, Kevin noted how market participants often front-run expectations by about a month. He suggested that if January ends up choppy, February might be the point when markets begin their true climb: “Everyone thought October was going to be bullish. October was not bullish. November was bullish. Now everyone thinks January is going to be bullish […] Maybe February is bullish.” When pressed for specific price targets, Kevin pointed to several Fibonacci extensions and the Pi Cycle Top indicator on the Dogecoin chart: “If we break through previous all-time highs, the next resistance zone is going to be $0.94 up to $1.32 […] If we break through $1.32, the next big resistance zone that I’m eyeing is $2.19 up to $2.78.” However, he made it clear that any long-term price predictions depend heavily on technical indicators and confirmations. He highlighted multiple monthly indicators—MACD, RSI, Stoch RSI, and the Pi Cycle Top—as potential signals to exit positions: “I don’t care what the price is at that point […] once we get up into that zone, I’m taking profits off the board. If the monthly indicators start flashing, I’m getting out.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.32.

While many digital assets are facing a market-wide downturn, XRP’s price has taken a more significant hit, losing almost 30% of its recent gains and struggling to hold above the $2 mark. Key Factors Behind XRP’s Decline One of the major reasons for the ongoing price drop is the anticipation of XRP’s monthly token unlock. On January 1, 2025, 1 billion XRP tokens will be unlocked as part of Ripple’s operational funding strategy. Historically, such events often increase selling pressure, making traders cautious about price stability. Additionally, macroeconomic factors are playing a role. The Federal Reserve recently announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut . While this was expected, the Fed also issued a cautious forecast for 2025, reducing the expected number of rate cuts from four to just two. However, Coinglass data shows a slight drop in XRP’s open interest, suggesting that some traders are closing their positions due to increased market volatility. This has added to the downward pressure on XRP’s price. What’s Next for XRP? In the face of a bearish market, XRP has failed to hold its key support level at $2.20 and has been stuck in a tight range for the past month. This is similar to a three-month consolidation phase earlier this year, which ended with a price rally in November. If this pattern continues, XRP might not break above $3.00 until late February 2025. During this time, any large-scale selling could push the price down to $1.58, increasing losses for investors. On the brighter side, a positive shift in the crypto market could change things quickly. If XRP breaks past the $2.73 resistance, it could rise to $3.00 and even aim for a new all-time high above $3.31.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 09:39:34

Тhe successful month also wraps up one of the best years for the DeFi lending protocol since its 2021 peak. Sky Protocol locked in $22.18M in earnings for December, the highest level for the past six months, based on TokenTerminal data. Its performance reflects several trends in the past year, including DeFi’s overall recovery. Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO) achieved peak earnings in December, reflecting the market rally in Q4. | Source: DeFi Llama Most of the protocol fees also reflect the usage of DAI/USDS, the native stablecoin used for loans. In the past year, the supply of DAI rose to $6.2B, the highest level since the 2022 peak of $7.24B DAI. The creation and circulation of DAI are no longer tied to the MKR asset but rely on a wider selection of collaterals. Sky Protocol shifted its collateral balance in the past year The supply growth in the past year was achieved through a more diverse mix of collaterals, including tokenized T-bills. With this move, Sky Protocol became one of the drivers of RWA adoption, as the crypto sector put some of its earnings into T-Bills and then used them to secure additional growth. The third trend is the successful swap from MakerDAO to Sky Protocol. Over the past 12 months, the DeFi protocol had to go through rebranding in addition to overhauling its collaterals. As a result, MakerDAO stepped back, leaving Aave (AAVE) to become the top lending protocol. Some of the sub-DAO projects also relied on Aave for their passive yield, creating special vaults. Despite the slowdown against Aave, the treasury of Sky Protocol is also at a peak. The project holds $2.1B in its treasury as an additional security for the dollar peg of DAI/USDS. DAI/USDS is now supported by three main types of collateral. Crypto vaults hold more than $3.43B in value locked. The Peg Stability Module (PSM) holds special vaults with $1.56B in assets. Tokenized securities make up $296M after a recent removal of liquidity. RWA vaults shifted down from their peak valuation of $3.2B in 2023. The collaterals of Sky Protocol are not fixed and may reflect market conditions and potential risks. During bull market periods, DAI/USDS is more widely used for loans. The market rally in the last quarter of 2024 was immediately reflected in Sky Protocol’s revenues, which reached a peak of $1.3M in daily fees on December 7. Sky Protocol to push more for USDS adoption next year Sky Protocol continues with its calls to switch from DAI to USDS next year. The protocols also plan to grow more aggressively in the coming months, regaining a higher position as DeFi lending expands. At the end of 2024, more than $49B were locked in lending protocols, which exist on almost all leading chains. While Maker and Sky are not directly competing, the sub-DAO Spark Protocol rose to the second-highest spot, with $4.37B in value locked. However, the Sky ecosystem still lags behind Aave, which holds between $18B and $20B in loans and collaterals. Sky Protocol will aim to boost its position on Solana after starting the inflows of USDS into the new chain. In 2025, the protocol aims to offer full lending services, potentially competing with established lenders like Kamino Finance. Toward the end of 2024, the supply of USDS on Solana increased to over 100M tokens based on bridging data. The milestone was achieved just a week after the launch of USDS on Solana. The main use case for USDS is its passive income, with a savings rate of 12.5%. The supply of USDS grew above 1B tokens in the past year after spreading to multiple lending protocols. USDS can be staked for savings income through Sky, Spark Protocol, as well as Kamino Protocol and Drift on Solana. USDS has also spread to Base, which carries a version of Spark Protocol. Sky Protocol hopes to expand on expectations for a more crypto-friendly climate in 2025. In the coming year, both SKY and MKR tokens will remain deflationary , with no new mints except in extraordinary circumstances to protect the peg of DAI.

The SC published in its media release that it has begun enforcement proceedings against Bybit, a cryptocurrency exchange, and its business chief, Ben Zhou , for providing a crypto-selling platform without adequate registration on Dec. 27. The platform had been ordered to cease all digital platforms operating in Malaysia from Dec. 11 onwards, within 14 business days. This also includes Bybit’s website and mobile applications. The company must also cease advertising to Malaysian investors and deactivate its local Telegram support group. You might also like: UK to ban public crypto offers in incisive new regulatory climate The SC raised apprehensions regarding Bybit’s compliance with regulatory obligations and investor protection. The regulator said offering businesses a digital asset exchange without obtaining the SC’s Recognised Market Operator registration is an offence under section 7(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007. Both Bybit and Zhou have already been included in the SC’s Investor Alert List for similar regulatory offenses since July 2021. Bybit has complied with the enforcement directions, reiterated SC. However, it also cautioned Malaysian investors that trading with unregistered platforms means they are unprotected under the securities laws of Malaysia, making them more susceptible to financial crimes. There are now only six registered crypto exchanges that can legally operate in Malaysia- HATA Digital Sdn Bhd, Luno Malaysia Sdn Bhd, MX Global Sdn Bhd, SINEGY DAX Sdn Bhd, Tokenize Technology Sdn Bhd, and Torum International Sdn Bhd.

Once we have secured the appropriate licenses, we look forward to reconnecting with you again in the future. “ ByBit’s Malaysian Telegram message This marks the second European country where Bybit’s operations have been impacted recently. In August, Bybit left the French market after the country implemented stricter licensing requirements in preparation for the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets regulations.

Recent market statistics underscored a highly volatile trading session for the meme token, primarily attributable to a declining burn rate and broader trends. Here’s a brief report on why SHIB price cracked over 3% intraday, spreading apprehensiveness among traders and investors globally. Here’s Why Shiba Inu Price Is Falling The Shiba Inu token statistics indicate that the dog-themed meme crypto is facing the heat due to a broader volatile market trend post-U.S. Fed’s hawkish stance with rate cuts and a holiday sentiment brewing. It appears that the investors are keeping distant from the crypto sector amid the holiday mood, reflecting a waning risk-bet appetite of the investors. This has weighed on the top meme coins , as evidenced by the recent performance of DOGE, PEPE, and others. Further, even the Shiba Inu burn rate witnessed a 90% decline at the time of reporting, with only 606K tokens burnt. The decline in the burn rate, indicating no substantial reduction in the circulating supply, further aligns with the coin’s waning price action amid a turbulent market. Simultaneously, Coinglass data showed that the meme coin witnessed a substantial drop in futures OI amid the recent market turbulence. SHIB futures OI dropped to $51.84 million as of December 30, indicating a considerable drop in market interest for the asset. This OI drop, coming in tandem with the Shiba Inu price dip, further rationalizes the current momentum. What’s Next For SHIB? At the time of reporting, SHIB price cracked 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00002154. Its intraday low and high were recorded as $0.00002124 and $0.00002239, respectively. Notably, the waning price trajectory falls in line with the aforementioned statistics. However, the token’s intraday trading volume soared 25% to $398.15 million, indicating traders still remain optimistic about the asset despite the market volatility. Simultaneously, a recent Shiba Inu price analysis by CoinGape reveals that a $0.0001 price target might be possible by January 2025, given Bitcoin and the broader market recovery. Further, recent ecosystem developments, such as SHIB: The Metaverse launch and a looming TREAT token launch , have added to a bullish perspective for the token’s long-term prospects.

In a Dec. 29 X post , CryptoBullet, who has over 152k followers, noted that Ethereum is in the process of forming a bull pennant pattern on the 1-day ETH/USDT chart. He expects this pattern to be completed in the coming months, potentially leading to a massive surge to as high as $6,000 within Q1 2025. In technical analysis, a bull pennant pattern forms after an asset experiences an uptrend and typically indicates a potential continuation of the rally. The analyst recalled price action seen in May 2021 when ETH rallied past $4,000 for the first time after breaking out of a similar pattern in Q1 that year. Analyst James CryptoGuru predicted a similar price target for Ethereum based on a technical indicator. He noted that ETH has formed a multi-month bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern throughout 2024, which is expected to be completed by early 2025. If ETH breaks out of this pattern, it could potentially rally to as high as $8,100. Meanwhile, fellow analyst Jelle also anticipates a major breakout for ETH, pointing that Bitcoin dominance has broken down from a multi-year trend. They highlighted that the last time this occurred, ETH’s price quadrupled within approximately five months.

In contrast, BTC long-term holders dropped from 70% to 62% during the same period, according to a Dec. 30 X post from IntoTheBlock, citing its platform’s data . The continued growth in long-term holders could help sustain ETH’s price rally as the asset heads into 2025. Another potential catalyst for an Ethereum rally in Q1 lies in its historical performance patterns following the first quarters of years marked by a U.S. election and a Bitcoin halving cycle. According to CoinGlass data, the first quarter of 2017 and 2021 were among Ether’s best-performing quarters, with recorded gains of 518% and 161%, respectively. Additionally, spot Ether exchange-traded funds have emerged as a major growth driver, witnessing inflows on 22 of the past 24 trading days and accumulating over $2.5 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. The consistent momentum has fueled optimism, with one enthusiastic ETH advocate predicting that Ether ETFs could attract more than $50 billion in net inflows by 2025. Despite the bullish catalysts, the second-largest cryptocurrency could face some downward pressure due to selling activity among large holders. According to data from ITB, whale holder net inflow has dropped significantly, dropping from 220.88k ETH, valued at nearly $737 million on Dec. 23 to just 14.45k ETH valued at nearly $48 million on Dec. 28. The sharp drop in whale investments indicates a potential loss of confidence in the asset’s future gains among large holders. Such a trend could influence retail investors , who often follow the moves of these experienced market participants. At press time, Ether ( ETH ) was up 1%, exchanging hands at $3,413 per coin.

In accordance with the global release of Squid Game Season 2 on Dec. 26, SEND Arcade has decided to release the second installment of Squad Game. According to Magic Eden, Squad Game is a fully online “interactive survival game” where more than 450 players participate in a series of challenges spanning three weeks starting on January 2025. Similar to how Netflix’s Squid Game works, the prize pool will keep increasing as more and more players get eliminated. In the first round of Squad Game, players must choose one out of four symbols: a circle, a triangle, a star or an umbrella. The symbol with the smallest number of choosers will become the Death Symbol and the players who chose it will be eliminated. The second round is called Red Light, Red Light, echoing one of the iconic Squid Game rounds where a giant doll shoots down players who make a move in a twisted version of freeze tag. This round and the ones that follow are still closed from the last Squad Game in September, with a list of winners still shown on a leaderboard. It is still unknown whether the sequel will feature the same games or if new ones will be introduced. It is known that Squid Game Season 2 features old and new games, so it is possible that Squad Games might once again follow in its footsteps.

However, crypto analyst Axel Bitblaze believes this might not lead to a market crash but instead could be another buying opportunity, similar to past Tether FUD events. While the majority of exchanges have stopped operating in the EU this will not create a major impact on crypto despite a short-term correction. 12/ ➔ Conclusion: Tether FUD means buying opportunity, and the same goes for China ban FUD too. Interestingly, you'll either hear these FUDs at the pico bottom or during the full-blown bull run. Do one thing, take screenshots of crypto prices today and then wait till… — Axel Bitblaze (@Axel_bitblaze69) December 29, 2024 What does it mean for crypto? The delisting of USDT is a result of the European Union’s new MiCA regulations , which require stablecoins to follow strict rules on reserves. Tether has failed to meet these requirements, which is why exchanges in the EU are forced to remove it from their platforms. However, this does not mean that USDT will become illegal in the EU. According to the analyst EU crypto investors can still hold USDT in their non-custodial wallets and freely trade them on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The restrictions apply to trading USDT on MiCA-compliant exchanges. Despite the panic, Bitblaze points out that the stablecoin market performance is strong. Hence, if you bought crypto with USDT, there’s no need to worry. USDT continues to maintain its $138.5 billion market cap and $44 billion in daily trading volume, with 80% of its volume originating from Asia. The value of your crypto depends on the coins or tokens you own, not how you bought them. So, whether you use USDT, BTC, or fiat money, your assets are safe in your wallet or on the platform you’re using. The event is more bullish than bearish. Historically it’s Bullish! Bitblaze points out that Tether has faced similar FUD in the past, and each time, the market has bounced back. Going back to the past events, in October 2024, when the U.S. government launched an investigation on Tether, following the news Bitcoin dropped by $2,000 in minutes. However, after Tether’s CEO denied the claims, Bitcoin quickly recovered, rising by 43%. Other FUD events, such as accusations from the UN and attempts to depeg USDT, also caused temporary drops in the market, but these were followed by strong bull runs. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tether Invests $775M in Rumble and Targets AI Domination by 2025 , Is it a Buying Opportunity? Moreover, it is also believed that Tether FUD has historically been a signal for buying opportunities. The analyst concludes that these events typically occur either at the market’s bottom or during a full-blown bull run. He advises crypto investors to take screenshots of current prices and revisit them in February or March 2025, predicting that most assets will be trading much higher by then. Looking at the scenario, USDT is expected to dominate the stablecoin market while its market cap and its demand rise. Even though EU delisting is a setback, it’s unlikely to derail USDT’s long-term success. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Several key fundamentals suggest that this momentum could continue into the new year. While XRP is influenced by general market sentiment, the regulatory landscape will be crucial. Specifically, the upcoming leadership changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the ongoing case between the regulator and Ripple will be pivotal in determining whether XRP can make another attempt at reaching record highs. Currently, XRP is holding above the $2 support level, though market volatility has weighed it down. As of press time, the token was trading at $2.24, down over 5% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, XRP is also in the red, down 6%. Despite these recent setbacks, XRP’s post-election breakout has propelled the asset to a remarkable 260% increase year-to-date. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold XRP price prediction for 2025 As for the token’s price prediction for 2025, OpenAI’s artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT-4o , shared insights regarding what to expect. ChatGPT’s analysis suggested that Ripple’s growth and potential victories in ongoing SEC cases could drive XRP to between $5 and $7, particularly if adoption in cross-border payments accelerates, this being the base case scenario. In a more optimistic case, the AI platform noted that a broad cryptocurrency market bull run and Ripple’s expanded integration with banks might push XRP past $10. There is even a possibility, albeit less likely, that mass adoption and favorable regulations could propel the token to over $20 by 2025. Conversely, lingering regulatory challenges or a downturn in the broader crypto market could see XRP drop to between $1 and $2. While $5 seems to be the most reasonable estimate, according to ChatGPT, such a price target would push XRP’s market cap to nearly $300 billion. XRP’s technical outlook Regarding the technical aspect, cryptocurrency trading expert Armando Pantoja’s analysis in an X post on December 30 suggested that the token will likely hit a target of $3. The analyst noted that while some XRP holders express frustration over the current consolidation, the charts paint a different picture of strength and potential. He pointed out that XRP is forming a symmetrical triangle, a bullish continuation pattern often preceding upward price movement. XRP has stabilized just above the $2 mark, coiling tightly within the triangle. Pantoja indicated a possible breakout could send XRP between $3.20 and $4. XRP price analysis chart. Source: Armando Pantoja On the other hand, XRP is exhibiting a moderate level of volatility at 7.25%, indicating that potential price swings are to be expected. It is trading well above its 50-day Simple Moving Average ( SMA ) of $1.81 and its 200-day SMA of $0.85, pointing to bullish momentum over the medium and long term. However, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is at 46.95, placing it in a neutral zone—not overbought or oversold—which could suggest a period of consolidation before the next move. In summary, it will be important to watch for a break above the $2.10 level or retest the $1.81 support to determine the next direction in price movement.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 10:10:00

Table of Contents Recent audits cement Rollblock as a premier GameFi opportunity Elon Musk spearheads renewed Dogecoin excitement Shiba Inu’s momentum pauses amid correction Get in early to Rollblock to maximize ROI After experiencing a parabolic year overall, meme coins have arguably been the hardest-hit sector during this recent market crash. However, established entities such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are usually less impacted by rampant volatility, which is why they are suitable options for investors seeking relatively low-risk meme coins. Of course, this also means less potential ROI. For those seeking returns in the 10-100x ballpark, Rollblock is widely considered a superior opportunity, given its massive hype potential and impressive fundamentals in the GameFi sector. Read on to learn more about RBLK’s bullish position during its tentative presale.

Recently audited by SolidProof and licensed by Gaming Anjouan, Rollblock upholds stringent compliance standards, positioning itself as a reliable player in the GameFi industry during the current bull market. The RBLK token is central to Rollblock’s ecosystem, enabling its dynamic play-to-earn model and incentivizing user engagement. A key highlight is its revenue-sharing system, which allocates 30% of weekly profits for token buybacks, burns half to reduce supply and distributes the rest as staking rewards. This model ensures token stability and also cultivates a loyal and engaged community of players and investors, solidifying Rollblock’s long-term growth prospects.

Historically, Musk’s endorsements have led to price surges for Dogecoin, and his ongoing advocacy continues to bolster Dogecoin’s cultural stronghold. In addition, Musk’s hints at integrating Dogecoin into his X platform further amplify hopes for utility-driven adoption.

Hong Kong’s crypto-friendly environment is further highlighted by its listing of 12 cryptocurrency-linked ETFs, valued at HK$7.4 billion, indicating its readiness to embrace digital assets. There’s also speculation that Hong Kong might convert China’s reported 190,000 Bitcoin holdings into ETFs, which could significantly impact the local and global crypto markets. In Germany, former Finance Minister Christian Lindner has called for the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bundesbank to consider Bitcoin reserves. This proposal comes as a response to the US’s recent policy shifts under the new Trump administration, where there’s talk of including cryptocurrencies in national reserves. Lindner has emphasized that Europe should not lag in this crypto race, suggesting a potential examination of crypto assets as part of central bank reserves in Frankfurt. This global movement towards Bitcoin reserves isn’t limited to these regions; even Russia is contemplating similar measures amidst international sanctions, while Japan, for now, has decided against it. The US has also seen states proposing to hold a portion of their reserves in Bitcoin, with Wyoming’s Senator Cynthia Lummis vocal about accumulating over 1 million Bitcoins for a national strategic reserve. iDEGEN: the new memecoin set to list on exchanges in January 2025 As nations contemplate launching strategic Bitocin reserves, iDEGEN is emerging as a notable player in the meme coin sector. Launched on November 26, 2024, it has already raised over $10.6 million in its presale phase, selling more than 1.131 billion tokens. At the heart of the current hype around the memecoin is that it employs a unique pricing strategy where prices adjust every five minutes based on market activity, potentially offering a 5% price swing. This model is particularly appealing to traders who enjoy navigating volatile markets. Besides the ongoing dynamic presale, iDEGEN uses AI to adapt based on community feedback on X, fostering a more interactive and responsive environment. This not only enhances community loyalty but also positions iDEGEN as more than just a speculative asset. With an expected listing price 10% above the final presale price, early investors are looking at immediate gains. Speculation is rife that iDEGEN could achieve up to 10x gains by the end of the first quarter of 2025, fueled by its current momentum and the shift in investor interest away from traditional cryptocurrencies facing regulatory issues.

The move, which was announced via a post on X on Monday, allows users to stake their tokens and earn rewards for helping secure the network. This development marks another milestone in the platform’s rapidly growing ecosystem, which has already gained significant attention in the crypto community. 300 Million Tokens Staked at Launch At the time of launch, HyperLiquid staked a substantial 300 million HYPE tokens, valued at $8.4 billion, with additional contributions from users. In the first hour alone, another 7 million tokens were staked, highlighting the strong demand for this new feature. The tokens are distributed across 16 validators, with each validator offering users a chance to select where their staked tokens will go. While the staked tokens are bound by a vesting schedule, the rewards earned from staking will remain locked, ensuring that users continue to participate in securing the network for an extended period. This development follows a month after the HYPE token’s debut . Initially priced at $3.57, the token has seen impressive growth, reaching $27.89 as of now. With a current market cap of $9.2 billion, HYPE has surged into the top 20 largest tokens, surpassing competitors such as Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Pepe (PEPE), and Litecoin (LTC). HyperLiquid Soars Amid Controversy HyperLiquid’s trading platform has also seen remarkable success, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.64 billion. According to DefiLlama, the platform generates more than $1 million in daily revenue, further solidifying its position as a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. However, the platform has not been without its challenges. Recently, HyperLiquid became embroiled in controversy after blockchain security researcher Taylor Monahan alleged that North Korean-backed cyber actors were operating on the platform. This accusation, shared via an X post, led to a massive outflow of funds from the HYPE token and caused waves throughout the crypto community. Despite this setback, HyperLiquid continues to push forward, with its staking feature seen as a positive step for the platform’s future growth. As the crypto space continues to evolve, HyperLiquid’s future could very well depend on how it navigates regulatory challenges and bolsters user trust.

After three-quarters of sideways trading, digital assets saw a significant surge beginning in early November. While leading cryptos like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) benefitted, numerous altcoins and meme coins saw returns just as good — if not better, than their largest counterparts. That was certainly the case for the O.G. meme coin — Dogecoin ( DOGE ). At the beginning of the year, DOGE was trading at approximately $0.092. By early November, the price of Dogecoin had risen to $0.15, marking an impressive 63.04% rise. Following that, DOGE experienced an even more pronounced upswing — all thanks to Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA ) CEO Elon Musk . A longtime proponent of Dogecoin, Musk’s close alliance with President-elect Donald Trump, as well as the announcement of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) served to buoy investor trust in the humorous asset. By December 8, DOGE had reached prices close to $0.47 — a mark equating to a 414% gain on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. Since then, the meme coin has seen prices decrease by a little more than 32%, and was trading at $0.32 at press time — but one technical analyst thinks that a massive 6,770% surge might be in the cards for DOGE in the months ahead. Dogecoin price YTD chart. Source: Finbold Can DOGE hit $22.11? Renowned cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart detailing an ascending parallel channel pattern that DOGE has been in for more than a decade, as detailed in a December 30 post on social media platform X. While the channel is rather ambitiously plotted and steep, DOGE’s past price action has shown a pattern of rejection when racing either channel line. Martinez stated that if Dogecoin continues to follow the pattern, it could see prices surge by as much as 6,770% — a figure that equates to a price of roughly $22.11. #Dogecoin $DOGE could rally by another 6,770% if it continues to follow the ascending parallel channel pattern! pic.twitter.com/Js9mYGwevK — Ali (@ali_charts) December 30, 2024 At a price of $22.11, with a total supply of 147.41 billion DOGE, the meme coin’s market capitalization would be somewhere in the ballpark of $3.26 trillion — making it the 7th largest asset in the world, ahead of Bitcoin and silver. As enticing as this thesis is, it is based solely on technical analysis. The issuance of 5 billion DOGE per year provides steady inflationary pressure which serves as a headwind for positive price action . On top of that, just a couple of days ago, Martinez set a much more attainable price target of $4, along with a more detailed analysis. Other experts, like Trader Tardigrade , who forecast an upswing to $2, also see a large degree of upside for DOGE — Martinez’s 6,770% upside, unfortunately, appears to be a rather fringe opinion.

Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Reaches Critical Turning Point,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-etf-likely-in-2025-ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-reaches-critical-turning-point/,"The post XRP ETF Likely in 2025? Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Reaches Critical Turning Point appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP community is eagerly anticipating the US SEC appeal deadline on Jaunary 15th and its potential impact on the XRP ETF prospects. Notably, in November, the agency had requested an extension to submit its appeal by early January, with some speculating that the delay was to wait for the US election results . Appeal To Be Dismissed? However, now, with the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration and Paul Atkins as the next SEC chair, there is growing doubt about whether the agency will proceed with the appeal. The appeal will continue for now, and that process takes about a year. But there is the possibility that a new administration decides to move to dismiss the appeal. That's not something I recall happening before, but it's possible and maybe likely. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) December 22, 2024 Earlier, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO), Stuart Alderoty, had also called for an end to the 4 year SEC battle, urging the incoming Donald Trump administration to conclude this legal battle. He believes that with a crypto-friendly SEC chair like Paul Atkins, there’s a chance to rebuild confidence and bring the clarity the industry desperately needs. Notably, the regulator could clarify XRP’s security status and accelerate its ETF approval chances if the appeal is dismissed. So far, the agency has only approved Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs as they are not deemed securities. However, the market has remained hopeful that the new administration will approve several altcoin ETFs in 2025 like Solana and XRP. Companies like Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and WisdomTree have already submitted their XRP ETF proposals. As of this writing, prediction site Polymarket was pricing a 75% chance of an XRP ETF in 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Price is Going Down Today & What to Expect Next? , Bullish Outlook The current market positioning suggested that XRP holders expected an extra rally, driven by the potential ETF approval. The XRP holders might be waiting for the ETF outcome or expected 2025 altcoin season. With experts projecting that ETF approval could push XRP above $5, the wait could be worthwhile. Besides, adding to the bullish factors is a recent comment from a prominent analyst. Lark Davis, in a latest X post has shared a bullish message that the crypto market is headed towards a $10T market cap. “And when that happens, it will unleash mind-blowing gains that most people can’t even fathom,” he noted adding to the bullish momentum in the market.

But there are still some questions on investors’ minds as to how Atkin will address the ongoing crypto cases . Paul Atkins is a former SEC commissioner known for his pro-crypto views. He has always supported fair and transparent crypto regulations that encourage innovation in the crypto industry without suppressing technological advancements. In a recent x post crypto analyst Arthur (@XrpArthur) shared why Paul Atkins’ nomination by Donald Trump to succeed Gary Gensler as the chair of the U.S. SEC is great news for Ripple, XRP, and the entire crypto industry. Why Paul Atkins nominated by Donald Trump to succeed Gary Gensler is GREAT news for Ripple, XRP, and the entire crypto industry! Here is a THREAD to help you convince your friends to buy XRP on New Year's Eve pic.twitter.com/ZVRT7yHh4d — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 29, 2024 Why This Change Matters Crypto space has seen SEC’s overreach in many crypto cases under Gary Gensler’s tenure at the SEC. With his aggressive and manipulative stance,e XRP’s price went down over the years. The Ripple vs SEC lawsuit , which started years ago, has been one of the most high-profile cases, causing uncertainty and slowing down innovation in the crypto space. This decade-long case has scared investors and many new companies to enter the market in fear of regulations. However, Paul Atkins has a different approach. He is expected to fill current loopholes in the system. The priority will be to give priority to fair regulations that will support the crypto growth and innovation. Trump has played with the timings before the official charge he announced pro-crypto staff to gain the investor faith. Having said that Ripple is also bullish as Atkins’s appointment if comes true might help Ripple to end this lawsuit forever. What Does This Mean for Ripple and XRP? The biggest change under Atkins could be a quicker resolution of Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. If the case is settled faster, XRP could finally be cleared of its legal issues. This would make XRP more attractive to investors, especially institutions, which have been hesitant due to the legal uncertainty. Furthermore, with clearer and more predictable regulations under Atkins, XRP could gain more legitimacy in the U.S. market. This could lead to greater adoption of XRP, especially by institutional investors who are waiting for legal clarity before entering the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Here’s Why You Should Be Bullish on XRP Even As It Struggles at $2 , Bullish Outlook for XRP With Paul Atkins leading the SEC, XRP could see several positive outcomes. First, the token could gain stronger legitimacy in the U.S., which is crucial for its growth. Second, new waves of institutional and retail investors might flock to XRP, sensing the end of the legal uncertainty that has plagued it for years. On a positive note, Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which relies on XRP, could also experience massive adoption. As more businesses and financial institutions use RippleNet for cross-border payments, XRP’s value and use cases could expand significantly. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The country now hosts 1,359 Bitcoin ATMs , accounting for 3.5% of the global total , according to data from Coin ATM Radar . This milestone highlights a 29-month streak of uninterrupted growth in Australia’s crypto ATM infrastructure, positioning the nation behind only the United States (31,516 ATMs) and Canada (3,027 ATMs). Why Bitcoin ATMs Matter Bitcoin ATMs offer a bridge between traditional financial systems and cryptocurrency, enabling users to: Buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using cash or debit cards. Sell cryptocurrencies for cash in real-time. The rising number of Bitcoin ATMs reflects growing public interest and increasing crypto adoption in mainstream financial ecosystems. Australia’s Steady Growth in Bitcoin ATMs Over the past 29 months , Australia has expanded its Bitcoin ATM network at a consistent pace. This growth underscores: Public Adoption: A rising number of Australians are using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for investment and payments. Supportive Infrastructure: The establishment of more ATMs reflects greater accessibility for crypto users. Regulatory Environment: Australia’s clear and relatively supportive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies has encouraged crypto adoption. Global Comparison of Bitcoin ATM Networks As of December 2024, the global landscape of Bitcoin ATMs is as follows: United States: 31,516 ATMs (dominates with 80% of the global total). Canada: 3,027 ATMs (9.6% of the global total). Australia: 1,359 ATMs (3.5% of the global total). Factors Behind Australia’s Crypto ATM Growth Increasing Crypto Awareness Australians have shown growing interest in cryptocurrencies, driven by mainstream media coverage and increased education about digital assets. Institutional Participation Australian businesses and financial institutions are integrating blockchain technology, further legitimizing cryptocurrency usage. Ease of Access Bitcoin ATMs simplify the process of buying and selling crypto, making it more accessible to everyday users. The Road Ahead for Crypto in Australia Australia’s rise to the third spot in Bitcoin ATM adoption reflects its position as a global leader in crypto innovation. However, challenges remain, including: Regulatory Updates: Balancing innovation with consumer protection in the cryptocurrency space. Broader Adoption: Encouraging more businesses to accept cryptocurrencies as payment. Despite these hurdles, Australia’s continuous growth in Bitcoin ATMs signals strong momentum for cryptocurrency adoption. Conclusion Australia’s achievement as the third-largest Bitcoin ATM network globally highlights the country’s growing embrace of digital assets. With 1,359 Bitcoin ATMs and a supportive infrastructure, the nation is well-positioned to remain a leader in the cryptocurrency revolution.

PNUT meme coin has staged a strong recovery from the support of $0.50 and is eyeing a quick rally to $1 moving ahead, with a 35% surge in open interest. PNUT Price Rally After Strong Whale Accumulation Peanut The Squirrel (PNUT), a Solana-based meme coin, gained much traction during the US presidential elections last month hitting a $1 billion market cap within days of launch. However, the PNUT price has been moving sideways since then and recently dropped to retest the crucial support of $0.50, before bouncing back. On the other hand, the blockchain analytics platform Spot on Chain has identified significant accumulation activity in PNUT tokens. Whale wallet “FFDAa” recently withdrew 10 million PNUT tokens, valued at $6.1 million and representing approximately 1% of the total supply, from Binance. This transaction marks the whale’s first recorded acquisition of PNUT tokens. Following the withdrawal, nearly the entire amount was transferred to another wallet, “76yGJ.” With this transfer, wallet “76yGJ” is now ranked as the sixth-largest non-centralized exchange (non-CEX) holder of PNUT.

With the current bounce, the PNUT meme coin is once again testing a breakout from the downward trendline which will open the gates to the subsequent PNUT price rally to $1 and further to an all-time high of $2.3.

According to a CryptoQuant post by analyst AxelAdlerJr , recent data shows daily Bitcoin inflows to exchanges have hit approximately 30,000 BTC —levels last seen in 2016. Historically, such low inflow activity preceded significant Bitcoin rallies, raising hopes for another potential bull run. Key Indicators Supporting a BTC Rally 1. Low Exchange Inflows Current Levels: Exchanges are seeing daily BTC deposits of 30,000 BTC, reminiscent of the 2016 record lows. Market Implication: A reduction in Bitcoin deposits to exchanges indicates less selling pressure, which could tighten supply in the spot market. 2. Increased Exchange Outflows Netflow-to-Reserve Ratio: A negative ratio suggests Bitcoin is leaving exchanges at a faster rate than it is being deposited. Historical Context: Similar outflows have historically coincided with the end of bear markets , setting the stage for price recoveries. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin’s Price? Reduced Spot Market Supply The outflows and reduced inflows suggest that Bitcoin is being moved to long-term storage or wallets, reducing the amount of BTC available for immediate trading. Bullish Historical Patterns 2016 Example: A similar period of low exchange inflows preceded a major Bitcoin rally. Bear Market Cycles: Historically, exchange outflows have marked turning points in bearish cycles, leading to eventual price recoveries. Speculative Environment While these metrics indicate potential bullish momentum, they don’t guarantee immediate price increases. Market dynamics, macroeconomic factors, and investor sentiment will play significant roles in shaping Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Expert Commentary AxelAdlerJr notes, “Although past performance is not always indicative of future results, these patterns point to a potential shortage of BTC in the market, which could set the stage for a rally.” Other analysts echo similar sentiments, suggesting that continued accumulation by long-term holders could limit BTC’s availability, fueling upward price pressure over time. Current Market Sentiment Indicators to Watch: BTC Price Levels: Traders should monitor Bitcoin’s ability to hold key support levels and break resistance zones. Institutional Activity: Increased institutional interest, coupled with tightening supply, could further strengthen BTC’s price action. Macro Factors: Interest rates, inflation, and regulatory developments will impact broader crypto market sentiment. Conclusion The combination of low Bitcoin inflows , increased outflows , and tightening supply on exchanges highlights a potentially bullish setup for Bitcoin. While not a guarantee of immediate price movement, these indicators suggest that BTC could be on the brink of a significant rally, especially if historical trends hold true.

The adjustment occurred at 21:55 UTC on December 29 , underscoring the increasing competition among miners and the growing robustness of the Bitcoin network. The next difficulty adjustment, expected in approximately 14 days , is predicted to bring a slight increase of 0.26% , potentially setting the level at 110.07 T . What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? Mining difficulty is a measure of how challenging it is for miners to solve the cryptographic puzzles needed to validate Bitcoin transactions and add them to the blockchain. Key Points About Mining Difficulty: Dynamic Adjustment: The Bitcoin network adjusts difficulty every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks) to maintain a consistent block production time of 10 minutes . Influence of Hashrate: A higher hashrate—representing more computing power—leads to higher difficulty, ensuring the network remains secure and decentralized. The Significance of 109.78 T Historical Context The 109.78 T difficulty level represents the highest in Bitcoin’s history, highlighting the network’s continuous growth and resilience. Increased Mining Competition As mining difficulty rises: Profit Margins Tighten: Miners must invest in more efficient hardware and access cheaper energy to remain profitable. Network Security Improves: Higher difficulty means more computational power is needed to compromise the network, enhancing its security. Next Difficulty Adjustment and Outlook Predicted Adjustment The next adjustment, due in about 14 days, is anticipated to bring a modest increase of 0.26% , setting the difficulty level at approximately 110.07 T . Impact on Miners Efficiency Challenges: Smaller mining operations may face additional pressure to remain competitive. Industrial Miners Benefit: Large-scale operations with advanced equipment and low-cost energy sources are better positioned to thrive. What Drives Rising Mining Difficulty? Increased Hashrate: As more miners join the network, the collective computational power increases, pushing up difficulty. Bitcoin’s Popularity: Growing adoption and rising prices incentivize more mining activity. Technological Advancements: The development of efficient mining hardware has made it possible to handle higher difficulty levels. Current Market and Industry Sentiment Bitcoin’s rising mining difficulty comes amid a period of strong institutional and retail interest in the cryptocurrency. While the increased difficulty reflects the network’s strength, it also underscores the challenges faced by miners operating in a highly competitive environment. Conclusion The new mining difficulty milestone of 109.78 T is a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and growing network strength. As mining competition intensifies, the upcoming adjustment may bring slight changes, but the long-term trajectory points to sustained growth in the network’s robustness and security.

Although the index dropped by eight points compared to the previous day, it still reflects a predominantly positive market sentiment. Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by Alternative.me , measures market emotions on a scale from 0 to 100 : 0-24: Extreme Fear 25-49: Fear 50-74: Greed 75-100: Extreme Greed What Contributes to the Index? The index aggregates data from six key factors, each contributing a specific percentage: Volatility (25%) : Tracks sudden price swings in the crypto market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Reflects trading activity and interest. Social Media (15%) : Monitors discussions and sentiment across platforms. Surveys (15%) : Incorporates public opinion from polls (when available). Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Measures BTC’s share of the overall crypto market. Google Trends (10%) : Analyzes search interest in crypto-related topics. Why the Drop from 73 to 65? The eight-point decline in the index may be attributed to several factors: Weakened Market Momentum: A slight decrease in trading activity has dampened market enthusiasm. Price Consolidation: After recent rallies, key cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced minor price corrections. Despite the drop, the sentiment remains in the “Greed” zone, indicating a bullish undertone. What Does This Mean for Investors? Greed Zone Implications Potential for Overvaluation: High greed levels may suggest that the market is overheated, leading to overvalued assets. FOMO Risk: Fear of missing out can drive irrational buying behavior, increasing market volatility. Caution Amid Greed While greed signals optimism, investors should exercise caution: Evaluate Fundamentals: Assess the intrinsic value of assets before buying. Diversify Investments: Avoid putting all funds into a single asset, especially during periods of heightened greed. Recent Trends in Fear & Greed Historical Perspective Extreme Fear to Greed Transitions: Periods of extreme fear often precede market rebounds, while sustained greed can lead to corrections. Current Sentiment: The index’s position at 65 suggests a maturing rally but calls for vigilance as greed persists. Market Outlook With the index fluctuating within the “Greed” zone, the crypto market could see continued bullish activity, albeit with increased risk of short-term pullbacks. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s current position at 65 highlights a prevailing optimistic sentiment in the market. However, the slight dip from 73 reflects caution among some investors. As the market remains in the “Greed” zone , traders should balance opportunities with risk management to navigate potential volatility effectively.

In a recent 10x Market Updates report , Thielen highlighted the risk of heightened volatility in the crypto market, advising traders to tread cautiously as BTC’s recent parabolic rise could be followed by a significant pullback. Market Conditions and Inflation Report Weaker Inflation Report The report noted a weaker Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation report , suggesting a slowdown in price pressures. Despite this, Federal Reserve members continue efforts to ease concerns, underscoring the complexity of current market dynamics. Market Under Pressure Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain under pressure, reflecting cautious sentiment among investors. Factors Contributing to a Possible Bitcoin Correction 1. Parabolic Price Movement Rapid, exponential price increases in BTC are often unsustainable in the short term. Thielen suggests that such patterns frequently lead to sharp corrections as market participants lock in profits. 2. Heightened Volatility As Trump’s inauguration approaches, uncertainty around political and economic policies could contribute to increased market fluctuations. 3. Macro Concerns While easing inflation data is positive, lingering macroeconomic uncertainties and hawkish Fed policies continue to weigh on investor sentiment. Advice for Traders Thielen advises traders to: Exercise Caution: Avoid over-leveraging during periods of heightened volatility. Monitor Key Data Points: Stay updated on economic indicators and Federal Reserve announcements. Prepare for Corrections: Be ready to capitalize on potential market dips. Historical Precedents and Insights Bitcoin has often reacted to major geopolitical and macroeconomic events with significant volatility. Similar corrections have been observed following parabolic rises in: 2017: After reaching an all-time high near $20,000, BTC saw a prolonged correction. 2021: Rapid gains led to short-term pullbacks amid market speculation and regulatory concerns. Conclusion As Bitcoin continues its upward trajectory, Markus Thielen’s warning serves as a reminder of the potential for heightened volatility and corrections, particularly during significant political and economic events.

This figure, as reported by Bitcoin.com based on data from The Block , surpasses November’s total earnings of $1.21 billion , signaling a lucrative close to the year for miners. Breakdown of Revenue Sources 1. Block Rewards The majority of December’s mining revenue— $1.29 billion —came from block rewards, highlighting their continued dominance in miner earnings. 2. On-Chain Fees On-chain fees contributed an additional $37.69 million , underscoring the ongoing significance of transaction fees for miners. Key Drivers of Revenue Growth 1. High Network Activity The surge in miner earnings can be attributed to: Increased Bitcoin Transactions: A rise in trading volumes and on-chain activity, partly driven by year-end portfolio adjustments. Heightened Market Volatility: Fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price have encouraged active participation from both retail and institutional players. 2. Elevated Bitcoin Prices The sustained high price of Bitcoin has increased the value of block rewards, directly contributing to miners’ revenue. 3. Steady Hashrate Growth A robust mining infrastructure and rising network hashrate have maintained block production efficiency, ensuring miners capitalize on available rewards. Comparison with November Revenue November Revenue: $1.21 billion December Revenue (so far): $1.33 billion Increase: Approximately 10% , with two days left for further accumulation. The Role of Transaction Fees Fee Dynamics in December While transaction fees contributed $37.69 million , their share of total revenue remains modest compared to block rewards. Significance: Transaction fees typically rise during periods of network congestion and heightened trading activity. Outlook for Bitcoin Mining in 2025 Challenges Ahead Halving Event: The next Bitcoin halving, expected in 2025, will reduce block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC , potentially impacting miner profitability. Rising Difficulty: Increased mining difficulty could strain smaller operators. Opportunities Energy Innovations: Adoption of renewable energy sources could lower operational costs for miners. Institutional Investment: Continued institutional backing for Bitcoin could sustain network activity and miner revenue. Conclusion December 2024 marks a record-breaking month for Bitcoin miners, with revenues surpassing $1.33 billion , driven by strong block rewards and steady on-chain activity. As the mining industry looks toward 2025, adaptability to network changes and a focus on sustainable practices will be critical for long-term success.

According to local media outlet Wenweipo , Ng believes that leveraging Hong Kong’s “one country, two systems” framework to adopt Bitcoin could offer financial stability and long-term value preservation amid growing fiscal challenges. Bitcoin as a Strategic Reserve Asset 1. Fiscal Challenges in Hong Kong Deficit Concerns: Hong Kong’s fiscal deficit has surpassed 100 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) , raising concerns about financial sustainability. Role of Bitcoin: Ng argues that holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin could provide a meaningful fiscal impact. 2. Value Preservation vs. Asset Appreciation Small Holdings: A minor allocation of Bitcoin would primarily serve as a means of value preservation rather than generating significant fiscal gains. Strategic Allocation: A larger position in Bitcoin could potentially bolster asset appreciation and contribute to addressing the deficit. Leveraging the “One Country, Two Systems” Framework Ng emphasized that Hong Kong’s unique political and economic framework allows it to: Pioneer Digital Asset Adoption: Position itself as a leader in integrating digital assets into traditional financial systems. Align with Web3 Development Goals: Support Hong Kong’s broader ambitions of becoming a global hub for Web3 and blockchain innovation. Potential Benefits of Adding Bitcoin to Reserves Diversification of Reserves Bitcoin’s decentralized nature provides a hedge against traditional fiat currencies and economic uncertainties. Alignment with Global Trends Other nations and institutions, such as El Salvador and companies like MicroStrategy , have already integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Attracting Global Investors A bold move to include Bitcoin in reserves could position Hong Kong as a forward-thinking financial center, attracting blockchain companies and crypto investors. Challenges and Risks Volatility Concerns Bitcoin’s price volatility could expose Hong Kong’s reserves to significant short-term risks. Regulatory Hurdles The region would need to navigate complex international regulations related to digital asset adoption. Public Perception The move might face scrutiny or resistance from stakeholders unfamiliar with the benefits of Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Conclusion Johnny Ng’s proposal to incorporate Bitcoin into Hong Kong’s foreign exchange reserves marks a bold step toward integrating digital assets into traditional financial systems. While the move presents challenges, it aligns with Hong Kong’s ambitions to lead in Web3 innovation and blockchain adoption. As the global financial landscape evolves, Hong Kong’s decision could set a precedent for other regions considering Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

Conversely, Bitcoin (BTC) long-term holders saw a decline, falling from 70% to 62% over the same period. This shift highlights growing investor confidence in ETH heading into 2025, driven by Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem and market dynamics. Why Are More Investors Holding ETH for the Long Term? 1. Transition to Ethereum 2.0 The successful rollout of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) upgrades has bolstered investor confidence: Staking Rewards: Long-term holders can earn rewards by staking ETH. Reduced Supply Growth: The deflationary effects of EIP-1559 and staking withdrawals have increased ETH’s appeal as a store of value. 2. Expanding Use Cases Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi , NFT , and Web3 ecosystems: DeFi Boom: A growing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and protocols rely on Ethereum. Institutional Adoption: Companies and institutions increasingly see Ethereum as essential infrastructure for blockchain-based innovations. 3. Market Sentiment Bullish Outlook: Many investors anticipate further ETH price appreciation in 2025 due to its expanding utility and ecosystem growth. Why Are Bitcoin Holders Declining? 1. Profit-Taking As Bitcoin prices surged in early 2024, many long-term BTC holders likely sold their holdings to lock in profits. 2. Competition from Altcoins ETH’s rising dominance, along with the growing appeal of other Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains, may have drawn investors away from BTC. 3. Changing Narrative While Bitcoin remains a leader as a store of value , some investors are diversifying into assets with broader use cases, such as Ethereum and newer blockchain technologies. The Numbers: A Closer Look Metric January 2024 December 2024 Change ETH Long-Term Holders 59% 75% +16% BTC Long-Term Holders 70% 62% -8% What Defines a Long-Term Holder? IntoTheBlock Definition: A long-term holder is typically someone who has held the asset for over a year , indicating strong conviction and reduced likelihood of short-term trading. Implications for 2025 Ethereum’s Growing Momentum Ethereum’s expanding ecosystem positions it as a key player in blockchain innovation. Increased long-term holding indicates confidence in ETH’s future growth and stability . Bitcoin’s Market Position Despite the decline in long-term holders, Bitcoin remains a strong store of value and leader in crypto market capitalization. BTC’s digital gold narrative may attract renewed interest if macroeconomic uncertainty arises in 2025. Conclusion The rise in long-term ETH holders to 75% in 2024, coupled with the decline in long-term BTC holders , underscores a shift in market dynamics. As Ethereum solidifies its role in decentralized finance and innovation, investor confidence in ETH’s long-term potential is growing.

Notably, recent on-chain data indicated that the crypto exchange concluded its 800 million Bitget token burn saga, sparking optimism over its price as the supply takes a massive hit. As a response, market enthusiasts are now anticipating a breakout in the Bitget token’s price ahead amid recent community developments. BGB Price Eyes Gains As 800M Token Burn Concludes According to recent data by on-chain tracker @ai_9684xtpa on X, five multi-sig wallet addresses related to Bitget were recorded to have aided in achieving the massive burn saga. Per data by Arkham, some of these addresses were – ( 0x2dd ), ( 0xe36 ), and (0x255). On December 30, these addresses collectively burned 800M BGB, worth $5.2 billion. Overall, this massive burn indicates that the supply has reduced significantly, sparking optimism over the asset’s price in light of the law of supply and demand. Notably, CoinGape previously reported that this massive burn comes in line with the new Bitget Token white paper . The crypto exchange aims to bolster its coin’s tokenomics with the 800M token burn, equivalent to 40% of the crypto’s total supply. In response, crypto market participants expect phenomenal gains in BGB price ahead. How Is The Crypto Delivering In The Market? Despite the massive burn, BGB price tanked nearly 14% intraday and is currently sitting at $6.40. Its 24-hour low and high were $6 and $7.19, respectively. The waning price action aligns with the broader market’s recent volatile trend. Nevertheless, it’s noteworthy that the weekly charts indicated gains worth 56%. This broader bullish momentum has fueled speculations of further gains as the supply takes a huge blow. Simultaneously, CoinGape spotlighted another saga that poured additional optimism into the crypto’s future movements. Bitget recently merged BWB and BGB coins, creating a more unified token for its ecosystem. This chronicle has added to market optimism surrounding the asset, underscoring the potential for further gains with revolutionized tokenomics. Market watchers remain bullish on BGB price ahead, expecting remarkable gains by next year in light of the abovementioned developments.

Holders can anticipate a maximum price of $5.78 in 2028. By 2030, FTM might touch $9.32. Fantom (FTM) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Launched in June 2018 by Dr. Ahn Byung Ik and Matthew Hur, Fantom employs a unique consensus mechanism called Lachesis, which utilizes asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance (aBFT) to achieve rapid transaction processing speeds of up to 300,000 transactions per second while maintaining security and decentralization. The platform operates on the Fantom Opera blockchain, which is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible, allowing it to run existing Ethereum smart contracts and develop new ones. This interoperability is enhanced by Fantom’s modular architecture, where each dApp can operate on its own blockchain network, ensuring that performance is not affected by congestion in other areas of the network. Fantom’s native token, FTM, serves multiple purposes, including transaction fees, staking for network security, and governance rights within the ecosystem. The platform is recognized for its scalability, low transaction costs, and energy efficiency, making it an attractive option for developers looking to build decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

Image source: Coinmarketcap Fantom (FTM) launched its mainnet in December, with initial trading prices mostly below $0.02 in 2019. FTM experienced gradual growth, staying under $0.05 for most of 2020 but reaching around $0.017 to $0.02 by December due to growing DeFi interest. Prices surged from $0.02 in January 2021 to $3.48 by October, driven by DeFi adoption and positive market sentiment. The year ended with a correction to around $2.30. In 2022, FTM faced significant fluctuations due to macroeconomic factors, with prices dipping below $0.50 mid-year. Despite recovery attempts, bearish trends dominated. Early volatility in 2023 saw prices around $0.40, recovering to $0.55 mid-year before settling between $0.45 and $0.50 by year-end. In early 2024, FTM surged from around $0.31 in January to above $1.00 by March, driven by strong bullish momentum and increased trading volumes. After peaking in March, the price corrected, dropping to lower highs and lows by April. Following the correction, FTM found support around $0.60 in May and entered a consolidation phase between $0.50 and $0.80 in June. Despite volatility and tests of the $0.50 support, it held firm.

The error occurred on December 19 during the mining of block 875475, which included a transaction with a fee 91,127 times higher than what was needed. Foundry Refunds Large Overpaid Bitcoin Fee After recognizing the mistake, Foundry reached out to the sender and refunded the excess fee after assessment. In a statement to The MinerMag, the mining pool assured that this refund did not affect the payouts of its regular customers stating that the payout system disregards the three highest and three lowest transaction fees each day. Its official tweet read, “We have received numerous messages from across the industry, and we want to extend our thanks to everyone who reached out on the user’s behalf. Please note that this decision was made after thorough deliberation, and we will continue to handle these instances on a case-by-case basis.” This incident marks the second such event in recent months, following a similar action by Antpool in November 2023, when it had to refund a $3 million Bitcoin transaction fee after a user error led to the highest-ever fee paid on the Bitcoin network. As reported earlier, the user mistakenly submitted 83 BTC as a fee on November 23, following which the Bitcoin mining company froze the fee temporarily, and announced its plan to verify the sender’s identity before issuing a refund. Meanwhile, Foundry’s pool, with a massive hash rate of 273.6 EH/s, remains the largest in the industry, far surpassing Antpool’s 146.7 EH/s, according to data compiled by Hashrate Index. Additionally, Foundry controls almost 38% of the market share among pool operators, while Antpool accounts for 18%, at the time of writing. Foundry Layoffs The latest development comes less than a month after Foundry was reported to have laid off 60% of its workforce, as part of its “realignment” strategy. The layoffs at Foundry mainly affected employees outside of the company’s core operations. Originally employing 250 people, 20 were reassigned to Yuma, while around 160-170 staff were let go. This included the entire ASIC repair and hardware teams, though mining pool operations remained unaffected. Foundry was also believed to have been exploring selling its site operations team, which oversees Bitcoin mining locations.

Despite the announcement, SHIB’s price remains in decline, down 20% over two weeks, amid broader market correction. The Upcoming Development Shiba Inu’s leading developer who uses the X moniker Shytoshi Kusama recently said they will introduce a podcast in 2025. It will consist of 44 episodes and touch upon different aspects of the entire ecosystem of the meme coin. Kusama explained that every Monday, the podcast’s topic will be meme coins, while Tuesday will be dedicated to Treat (TREAT). The token serves various purposes, including as a reward for users participating in the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s activities. Every Thursday the streaming will feature “tech talk ,” on Friday Kusama will “do shootouts and follows,” whereas Saturday will be “all about spirituality.” There will be no podcast on Wednesday and Sunday. “Next year will be epic, and I am so excited to share what we’ve built,” the developer concluded. The upcoming podcast represents another community-oriented effort. Earlier this year, Kusama and Kaal Dhairya (two of the anonymous developers of Shiba Inu) revealed they would step down by the end of 2024 and hand full control over to the SHIB Army. The former said this move aligns with their vision for true decentralization in the cryptocurrency space. SHIB Price Outlook Despite the announcement about the forthcoming development, the price of the meme coin remains in the red. It currently trades at around $0.00002165, a 3% fall on a 24-hour scale and a 20% decline in the past two weeks. SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko The underperformance coincides with the broader decline of the entire cryptocurrency market since the latest FOMC meeting. Recall that Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted from over $108,000 on December 17 to its current $93,500 after America’s central bank hinted that the rate cuts might be paused in 2025 due to rising inflation concerns. One factor signaling that SHIB bulls might experience further pain in the near future is the exchange netflow . According to CryptoQuant, inflows surpassed outflows on most days last week. This suggests a shift from self-custody methods toward centralized platforms and could be viewed as a bearish factor since it increases the immediate selling pressure.

These payouts may lead to upside in the cryptocurrency industry as recipients buy more coins. Here are some of the top crypto to buy in 2025 ahead of these $16 billion payouts. Best Crypto To Buy Ahead of FTX Payouts Some of the top cryptocurrencies to buy ahead of these FTX payouts are the FTX Token (FTT), Near Protocol (NEAR), Solana (SOL), and DexBoss (DEBO). FTX Token (FTT) FTX Token will be a top crypto to buy as attention move to the upcoming payouts. FTT price has already risen by over 255% from its lowest level this year. The coin has risen above the key resistance point at $3.3897, its highest point on October 7. FTX Token has risen above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level and formed a golden cross pattern. Therefore, the FTX coin price will likely have a bullish breakout as the hype surrounding the payouts rise. More gains will be confirmed if the coin rises above the double-top at $4.1683. A drop below the psychological point at $3.0 will point to more downside. FTX Token Price DexBoss (DEBO) DEBO is another fast-rising cryptocurrency to buy ahead of these FTX payouts in 2025. It is an upcoming DEX network that has raised over $233,000 from investors in its token sale. The network is aiming to challenge incumbent players like Uniswap and Raydium by offering better services. For example, it will enable users to trade over 2,000 crypto tokens, have excellent safety features, and have artificial intelligence solutions. You can buy the DEBO token here . Near Protocol (NEAR) Near Protocol is another cryptocurrency to buy ahead of the FTX payouts because it was one of the top FTX investments. The Near token has retreated in the past few days after peaking at $8.247 on December 6. The weekly chart shows that the NEAR price has remained in an uptrend in the past few months. It has remained above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest levels since December last year. NEAR has also moved above the 200-week and 50-week moving averages. Therefore, the coin could bounce back, and possibly retest the year-to-date high of $8.97, up by 73% from its current level. A drop below the ascending trendline will invalidate the bullish view. NEAR Price Solana (SOL) Solana is another top crypto to buy ahead of the FTX payouts. The SOL token has retreated from $265 in November to $192 today. It has formed a falling wedge and a bullish flag chart pattern and found support at the 200-day moving average. Solana Price Therefore, the January Effect may push it much higher in the next few days. If this happens, the initial level to watch will be $210, the highest point in March this year, followed by the year-to-date high of $265. Still, you should watch out for the 200-day moving average as moving below it would point to more downside.

Rexas Finance gains traction with its focus on real estate tokenization and DeFi, challenging established players like Dogecoin and Ripple. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The potential for massive returns Rexas Finance’s presale gains momentum Conclusion As new entrants with innovative systems enter the market, the crypto industry changes dramatically. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have long been leading players, Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast acquiring popularity. With a presale price of $0.175, Rexas Finance generates news as a transforming agent in real estate tokenizing and decentralized finance (DeFi). Rexas Finance: The potential for massive returns Ripple has long been a favorite among institutional investors for its cross-border payment features. Still, a lack of diversification and legal hurdles have slowed its development. Likewise, Dogecoin suffers to retain long-term value and investor confidence even if it is a meme coin that is rather popular. With its creative approach to real estate tokenization and DeFi, Rexas Finance presents a convincing substitute. While Dogecoin is a speculative asset and Ripple concentrates on payments, Rexas Finance provides real-world solutions that address critical holes in asset management and financial services. Blockchain-based Rexas Finance is meant to redefine DeFi by tokenizing actual assets, especially real estate, hence transforming DeFi. Tokenization lets properties be split into smaller, tradable pieces so that investors may access high-value assets once out of reach. This invention makes transactions efficient, open, and safe. Rexas Finance provides rapid, dependable financial services catered for a new age by using advanced blockchain technologies. Driven by its presale performance and creative use case, Rexas Finance’s listing price is expected to climb dramatically following its launch. Projected to have a strong market debut, analysts might double investments several times over a short timeframe. The platform’s emphasis on high-value asset tokenization fits market patterns supporting cryptocurrencies with practical use. Rexas Finance’s presale gains momentum Rexas Finance’s ongoing presale has been truly remarkable. At its eleventh stage, the project has sold over 381.2 million tokens, raising over $33.3 million. This result demonstrates increased investor confidence in Rexas Finance as a game-changing cryptocurrency. At $0.175 per token, the possibility for exponential gains has sparked broad interest. Early adopters who invest $800 may see their portfolio grow to $32,000 within eight weeks of the token’s expected market debut. Recent listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, two of the most reputable sites for monitoring cryptocurrency performance, confirm Rexas Finance’s reputation even more. These listings draw more investors to the project’s expanding ecosystem because they offer more visibility and support its validity. One of the company’s top blockchain security companies, CertiK, has also inspected the platform to guarantee openness and credibility for its customers. Rexas Finance presale valued RXS at merely $0.030 at the first stage. Rising by 485% to $0.175, the presale has moved to stage 11; the token’s value has increased; early investors have witnessed a staggering 6x return on investment (ROI). The community-driven approach of the project and its artistic aspects have attracted institutional and personal investors, creating demand and bolstering projections of RXS’s future price. Rexas Finance is redefining decentralized finance by merging blockchain technology with actual asset tokenization. Its capacity to provide the real estate industry with safe and open transactions sets it apart from the changing scene of cryptocurrencies. Investors looking for significant profits increasingly consider Rexas Finance a future-proof investment. At its current presale price of $0.175, Rexas Finance allows investors to make an impressive 3,900% return, which means that a $800 investment could turn into $32,000 in just eight weeks. This considerable percentage gain shows that RXS could become more popular than Ripple and Dogecoin, thanks to its cutting-edge DeFi and real estate tokenization systems. Conclusion With utility in decentralized finance and real estate tokenizing, Rexas Finance is positioned to beat Ripple and Dogecoin. Having a presale price of $0.175 and having raised over $33.3 million, the platform is being known as a transforming agent in the cryptocurrency scene. Rexas Finance is changing the financial scene as its ecosystem grows, and this creative coin attracts investors. Investing $800 now might become $32,000 in just eight weeks.

It has plunged by over a third from its December highs as some investors remain optimistic about the third-biggest meme coins. So, can the Pepe price surge to $1 in 2025? Pepe Coin Price Unlikely To Hit $1 In 2025 Pepe was trading at $0.000018 on Monday, meaning that the coin needs to surge by over 5.5 million percentage to get to $1. These gains are possible in the crypto market, as we have seen with Bitcoin’s surge from below $1 in 2009 to $108,000 earlier this month. Pepe coin is unlikely to experience these gains in 2025. For that to happen, the crypto industry needs to see the biggest momentum ever. And Pepe’s market cap would jump from the current $7.8 billion to almost $400 billion by then. Still, there are rising odds that the value of Pepe will do well in 2025. In an X post, Yazan , a crypto pundit with over 25k followers, predicted that the coin would surge in 2025 and get to a $69 billion market cap. Such a move would push its price to $0.0001648, which is a 783% surge from the current level. Pepe Price Chart He used a weekly chart and explained that the coin has historically gone through a period of accumulation, breakout, accumulation, and breakout. He believes that it is now in an accumulation that will lead to a stronger rebound. Pepe Price Analysis: More Volatility Ahead of Eventual Rebound The daily chart shows that the Pepe coin price peaked at $0.00002830 in December and then pulled back as the broader crypto momentum faded. Its highest level this month was between the overshoot and extreme overshoot levels of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Pepe has now stalled at the strong pivot reverse, where it is forming a bearish pennant chart pattern, a popular sign of downward continuation. While it has dropped below the 50-day moving average, the coin has remained slightly above the 100 day average. Therefore, the coin may have a bearish breakout as sellers eye the major S&R level at $0.00001192. Such a move would become valid if it drops below the crucial support at $0.00001725, its highest level in March this year. Pepe Coin Price Chart On the flip side, if the accumulation thesis plays out well, the Pepe coin price will likely rebound and retest the year-to-date high of $0.00002830. A move above that level will point to more gains in 2025. More Pepe coin gains will depend on the broader performance of the crypto industry, which is often highly correlated.

Bybit winds up services in Malaysia According to the agency’s recent order, seemingly communicated to Bybit on December 11, 2024, the exchange should halt its mobile apps and website in the nation within two weeks.

The Securities Commission added Bybit and CEO Zhou to the Investor Alert list for breaching similar regulations since July 2021. Meanwhile, SC confirmed that the crypto company has complied with the directives. The regulator urged Malaysian investors to use licensed platforms to avoid financial crimes such as money laundering. The agency added, The public should alert the SC if they come across any suspicious websites or receive any unsolicited phone calls or emails offering unauthorized investment schemes, especially those that promise high returns with little or no risks. Bybit confirmed SC’s enforcement through the Malaysian Telegram group , stating that users should brace for possible conveniences.

Evolving European regulations Bybit’s latest move to exit the Malaysian market comes as Europe’s comprehensive Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework takes shape.

That has forced multiple European exchanges to delist Tether USDT, signaling the expected regulatory clampdown. In conclusion, the crypto space braces for significant shifts amid the evolving regulatory landscape. Trading firms continue to adjust their operations as Europe’s MiCA framework goes into effect.

From Charles Gasparino's sharp critiques of the XRP community to Ripple CTO David Schwartz addressing misconceptions about his net worth, the debates surrounding the blockchain company reflect the complex dynamics of the crypto ecosystem. While XRP’s market performance and Ripple's ongoing legal battles with the SEC draw global attention, the personal narratives of its key figures add another layer to the unfolding story. Fox Business Reporter Charles Gasparino Intensifies Feud with the XRP Community Amid Ripple Lawsuit Controversy Fox Business reporter Charles Gasparino has reignited tensions with the XRP community, delivering scathing remarks that have once again put him at odds with supporters of the cryptocurrency. Known for his provocative takes on financial matters, Gasparino recently dismissed the concept of an ”XRP army,” a term often used to describe the passionate and vocal supporters of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. In a move that angered the XRP faithful, Gasparino alleged that the community is primarily composed of individuals who ”bought the coin and made insiders rich.” His remarks come amidst lingering disputes between Ripple Labs, the blockchain company behind XRP, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Adding fuel to the fire, Gasparino also criticized the recent ruling by US District Judge Analisa Torres in the Ripple case, calling it ”dumb.” The Ripple case has been a focal point of debate in the cryptocurrency industry. While Judge Torres ruled that secondary sales of XRP are not securities, Gasparino has consistently questioned the implications of this decision. He has gone as far as to suggest that Ripple’s legal victory was overstated, asserting last November that the company ultimately ”lost” its battle with the SEC. In his latest commentary, Gasparino expressed skepticism that the departure of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler would lead to a change in the agency’s stance on Ripple. According to Gasparino’s sources, even under the leadership of libertarian Paul Atkins, who is poised to replace Gensler, the SEC is unlikely to abandon its long-standing case against Ripple. In an article for the New York Post, Gasparino detailed the challenges the cryptocurrency industry might face under Atkins’ tenure. While Atkins is viewed by some as more open to innovation in the financial sector, Gasparino suggests that his appointment does not guarantee leniency for Ripple or the broader crypto space. XRP’s Market Rollercoaster The XRP token experienced a significant rally in the fourth quarter of 2024, driven in part by optimism surrounding the legal battle and broader market sentiment. However, Gasparino downplayed the rally, asserting that only insiders truly benefited from the price surge. He also highlighted the token's inability to sustain its gains, noting that XRP has since surrendered a substantial portion of its value. This characterization of XRP’s performance has further angered its community, many of whom view Gasparino as an antagonist in the ongoing debate over Ripple’s future. The reporter has previously referred to the XRP community as a ”cult,” a remark that cemented his contentious relationship with its members. Gasparino’s critiques bring attention to broader concerns about the cryptocurrency industry's regulatory landscape. The SEC’s case against Ripple is one of the most closely watched legal battles in the sector, with significant implications for how digital assets are classified and regulated in the United States. If Gasparino’s predictions hold true and the SEC continues to pursue the case under Atkins, it could dampen investor sentiment and prolong the uncertainty surrounding XRP. The XRP community, however, remains steadfast in its belief that Ripple’s technology and the token’s use cases will prevail in the long term. The XRP community has responded to Gasparino’s latest remarks with characteristic fervor. Social media platforms have been inundated with posts defending the token and criticizing the reporter for his perceived bias against Ripple. Prominent members of the XRP community argue that Gasparino’s views do not reflect the broader adoption and innovation occurring within the Ripple ecosystem. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has previously criticized detractors like Gasparino for spreading misinformation, emphasizing that the company is committed to fighting for regulatory clarity and advancing the use of blockchain technology. Ripple CTO David Schwartz Denies Billionaire Status Amid XRP’s Resurgence Meanwhile, David Schwartz , the Chief Technology Officer at Ripple, has publicly refuted claims of being a billionaire, reigniting discussions about the financial windfalls of key figures in the cryptocurrency space. In a recent social media post, Schwartz denied crossing the billion-dollar mark, even as XRP, Ripple's associated cryptocurrency, remains in the spotlight following a major rally earlier this year. Ripple, headquartered in San Francisco, gained global attention during XRP's meteoric rise in 2018, when its top executives were listed among the world's wealthiest individuals. Co-founder Chris Larsen saw his net worth soar to an astonishing $54 billion during the rally, thanks largely to his allocation of 9 billion XRP tokens. Similarly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly amassed a fortune close to $10 billion at the cryptocurrency’s peak price. Schwartz, often dubbed Ripple's ”trillion-dollar man” by outlets like Forbes, followed a different path. Rather than accumulating XRP tokens, Schwartz opted for a 2% equity stake in Ripple and a salary. As of 2019, Forbes estimated his net worth at $90 million—a stark contrast to the fortunes of his colleagues. In 2021, Schwartz addressed his financial standing, stating that his net worth was ”a lot less than $170 million.” Reflecting on the volatility of his holdings, he remarked, ”Circumstance has forced me to have a lot of my net worth tied up in highly volatile assets. Obviously, I'm very happy with how it’s turned out, but always a bit on edge due to the risk.” Schwartz’s Cryptocurrency Portfolio Despite foregoing a significant XRP allocation early on, Schwartz remains an active participant in the cryptocurrency market. In 2020, he disclosed holding XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), and several other altcoins. However, his investments, tied to the unpredictable world of digital assets, have made his financial journey less stable than that of Ripple’s early investors. While Schwartz's conservative approach to Ripple's token distribution reflects his caution, it also places him outside the ranks of high-profile cryptocurrency billionaires such as Binance founder Changpeng Zhao and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. Earlier this year, XRP experienced a significant rally, briefly reclaiming its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This resurgence was driven by investor optimism surrounding Ripple's legal battle with the SEC. The case has had far-reaching implications for the classification of digital assets, making Ripple and XRP a central topic in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. During this rally, Chris Larsen reportedly added $6 billion to his net worth in a single month, solidifying his place among the elite in the crypto billionaire club. However, this wealth distribution among Ripple’s top brass has often sparked criticism within the cryptocurrency community, with some alleging that early insiders disproportionately benefitted from XRP’s success. Schwartz’s public denial of billionaire status sheds light on his measured approach to wealth accumulation and the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. His decision to prioritize equity in Ripple over a massive allocation of XRP tokens is a departure from the strategies of other Ripple executives who saw their fortunes balloon during XRP’s peaks. The CTO has often expressed caution regarding the risks of holding large amounts of volatile assets. In October 2021, Schwartz candidly acknowledged the tension between enjoying financial gains and managing the stress of market unpredictability. This transparency has earned him respect among industry peers and crypto enthusiasts alike, even as XRP continues to fuel debates about wealth distribution in the blockchain sector. As XRP remains a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency market, Ripple's leadership continues to face scrutiny over its financial strategies and the role of XRP in the company’s broader vision. Schwartz, with his pragmatic approach and technical expertise, has become a key figure in shaping Ripple's narrative amidst ongoing regulatory and market challenges. For now, the Ripple CTO’s wealth pales in comparison to the staggering fortunes of his colleagues, yet his influence in the cryptocurrency space remains undisputed. His financial decisions and public commentary offer a rare glimpse into the complexities of navigating personal wealth in an industry marked by rapid innovation and extreme volatility.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-30 13:30:00

The Federal Reserve had interest rates at painful highs for most of the year, inflation refused to hit target levels, and a chaotic election season kept businesses and consumers on edge. Yet, somehow, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the U.S. will likely close the year as the top-performing economy among G7 countries. It wasn’t a perfect year by any stretch. But compared to the doom-and-gloom projections, the resilience was undeniable. So, what kept the economy moving when it should’ve stalled? Consumers kept the wheels turning The real MVP of 2024 was the American consumer. Wage growth outpaced inflation, giving households a bit more breathing room and total wealth hit record highs. These factors kept spending alive, with Bloomberg Economics estimating a 2.8% rise in household outlays—nearly double initial projections. Consumer spending literally was the lifeline of the economy this year. But here’s the thing, not everyone was spending from a position of strength. The pandemic-era savings cushion is gone for most households, and many are leaning on credit to maintain their lifestyles. Credit card balances soared, delinquency rates ticked up, and lower-income Americans bore the brunt of the strain. Meanwhile, the wealthier crowd—boosted by gains in stocks and housing—kept the spending numbers looking good. It’s a tale of two economies, wrapped up in one. The labor market, once the backbone of consumer confidence, also started to fray. Hiring slowed throughout the year, job openings shrank, and the unemployment rate edged higher. Workers who lost their jobs faced longer spells of unemployment, a classic recession red flag. Yet somehow, wages held steady, growing at about 4%—enough to keep the spending party alive… for now. Inflation wouldn’t budge, and the Fed stayed tough Inflation. The Fed’s favorite headache. After sharp drops in 2023 and early 2024, progress toward the magical 2% target stalled. By November, the Fed’s preferred metric—the core personal consumption expenditures price index—stood at 2.8%. Better than 2022’s numbers, but still not good enough for the central bank to feel comfortable. Jerome Powell and his crew slashed rates by a full percentage point in 2024, hoping to ease some of the pain on businesses and households. But he made it clear that until inflation shows real improvement, don’t expect any more cuts in 2025. Investors hated this. And so markets panicked, interpreting the central bank’s tone as a “hawkish pivot.” Stocks took a nosedive, and criticism of the Fed’s communication strategy hit a new peak. The disconnect between the Fed and the markets is glaring. If there was one place where the Fed’s policies hit hardest, it was housing. Mortgage rates dipped briefly to a two-year low in September but shot back up to nearly 7% as expectations for further rate cuts evaporated. Homebuilders, desperate to move inventory, pulled out all the stops—offering mortgage buydowns, covering closing costs, and even cutting prices outright. Did it work? Kind of. Sales stabilized but stayed far below pre-pandemic levels. The resale market, which dominates U.S. home purchases, hit rock bottom in 2024, the worst year since 1995. For many would-be buyers, the dream of homeownership remained just that—a dream. President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda added fuel to the fire. His promises to ramp up domestic manufacturing sounded good in theory, but the details—tariffs, mass deportations, and sweeping tax cuts—have caused fears of inflation, labor shortages, and supply chain chaos.

With this eight consecutive Monday purchase, the company’s stash has skyrocketed to over 446,000 BTC. MicroStrategy has acquired 2,138 BTC for ~$209 million at ~$97,837 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD. As of 12/29/2024, we hodl 446,400 $BTC acquired for ~$27.9 billion at ~$62,428 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/58aXM7g6u2 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 30, 2024 After the multi-billion dollar acquisitions announced in November and early December, MicroStrategy has slowed down on its BTC investments but still continues to allocate millions. The latest, announced by co-founder Michael Saylor earlier today, came at an average price of $97.834 per BTC. The firm has now spent just shy of $28 billion to accumulate its stash at an average price of $62,428. Although bitcoin’s price stands around 15% away from its all-time high registered last week, MicroStrategy’s holdings have a current value of $41.5 billion. This means that the firm now stands on an unrealized profit of more than $13 billion. As it happened with the last couple of purchases, though, Peter Schiff, the well-known BTC critic, was first to bash Saylor and the company he co-founded. The gold bug has repeatedly claimed that MicroStrategy’s purchases are the only thing that pushed BTC’s price north. He now said that this “smaller buy” with an average price above the current one cannot keep the asset rising. Once again you’ve announced a smaller buy at an average price that’s above the current price. You’re no longer buying enough Bitcoin to keep the price rising. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 30, 2024 It’s worth noting that BTC’s price has indeed tumbled in the past couple of weeks. It went from over $108,000 to its current level of $93,000, losing 15% in the process after the latest FOMC meeting for the year.

However, while meme coins capture attention, their utility remains limited. Enter Lightchain AI (LCAI) , a revolutionary blockchain project combining artificial intelligence and decentralization. With its ambitious roadmap and growing presale success, Lightchain AI aims to surpass not just meme coins but all competitors in dApp revenues by delivering impactful real-world solutions. Meme Coins Drive Solana dApp Revenues but Lack Sustained Utility In 2024, Solana's shared apps had a big jump in money, hitting $365 million in November, mostly pushed by funny coin sites. Clearly Pump.fun was the first Solana app to go past $100 million in one month of money making with $106 million. Even with this money growth, worries have come up about the long-term use of these meme coin places, since they often lack lasting uses beyond guessing trades. This brings up questions about ͏the lasting worth and steadiness of such income streams in the Solana ecosystem. Lightchain AI’s Vision Transforming dApp Revenues with AI-Powered Solutions Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized applications, offering tools that go beyond entertainment and speculation. Its platform is designed to cater to industries like logistics, finance, and healthcare, enabling real-world applications that drive significant value. Through its collaborative ecosystem, Lightchain AI encourages developers to build on its platform, creating dApps that harness AI’s capabilities for predictive analytics, resource optimization, and decision-making. This approach ensures that dApp revenues are not only high but also sustainable, positioning Lightchain AI to surpass meme coin-driven revenues on platforms like Solana. Why Lightchain AI Is Poised to Surpass SHIB, DogWifHat, and Solana dApps Lightchain AI’s growth potential lies in its ability to offer practical, industry-focused solutions that extend beyond the speculative nature of meme coins. Its ongoing presale, which has raised over $5.7 million, reflects strong investor confidence in its vision. Unlike SHIB and DogWifHat, Lightchain AI’s scalability and developer-friendly tools create an ecosystem where meaningful applications thrive. By bridging AI with blockchain, the platform addresses gaps in efficiency, transparency, and data security, ensuring its relevance across multiple sectors. This unique positioning sets Lightchain AI on a path to dominate dApp revenues and reshape the blockchain landscape. Also, Lightchain AI’s commitment to sustainability and social responsibility further strengthens its appeal. With a focus on carbon neutrality, the project aligns with growing global concerns about blockchain's energy consumption, making it an attractive option for environmentally conscious investors. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Nvidia’s vice president of robotics, Deepu Talla told the Financial Times that the company is expecting to introduce its next version of compact computers for humanoid robots during the first six months of 2025. Nvidia bets on the coming robotics boom Nvidia has played a significant role in driving the thriving AI industry with its chipmaking business. Its chips are in demand worldwide as the demand for AI systems continues to grow. However, stiff competition is also arising within the sector. This has pushed Nvidia to also look elsewhere. The $3.3 trillion company is now banking on the robotics boom projected in the near future. According to Caliber , humanoid robots are expected to become more present in industries, warehouses, automotive factories, and even in some homes in 2025, although it is yet uncertain how mainstream they will become. Now, the launch of Nvidia’s next version of compact computers for humanoid robots, Tetson Thor, will be a launchpad for its plans to be a top platform for this projected boom in AI robots. “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI and robotics is around the corner.” ~ Talla. Talla also told the Financial Times he believes that the market is at a “tipping point.” According to the Financial Times, this also comes as the chipmaking giant is expecting more rivalry from the likes of AMD. At the same time, competition from cloud computing titans like Google and Amazon cannot be overlooked. Nvidia is now channeling funds towards the “physical AI” space to help the new robotics firms grow. For instance, the company joined Microsoft and OpenAI in a February funding round that valued humanoid robotics company Figure AI at $2.6 billion. Robotics business is a small fraction of Nvidia’s earnings According to the Financial Times report, the robotics business represents a small share of Nvidia’s total revenue, although the chipmaking company did not give a breakdown of the figures from its robotics segment. During its third-quarter performance update released on November 30, Nvidia reported that data center revenue made up around 88% of the total $35.1 billion, which was 17% above the previous quarter and 94% from a year ago. According to the company , data center revenue alone was 17% ahead of the previous quarter and 112% from a year ago. Commenting on the financial statements then, CEO and founder Jensen Huang also acknowledged businesses were making investments into industrial robotics. “Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI.” ~ Huang. According to a Cnet article , multiple humanoid robots are competing to secure their place in a crowded space, and next year is shaping up to be the “banner year for the marching metallic mechanisms made in our image.” Companies intensified AI robot efforts in 2024 During the past year, firms like Boston Dynamics revealed a new all-electric Atlas robot, while retiring its iconic hydraulic Atlas – now known as HD Atlas. The new robot can move in “superhuman ways.” Other companies, including Figure, Agility Robotics , and 1X, are also forging new partnerships with firms like OpenAI and Nvidia, using their hardware and software to assist robots in talking and performing different tasks faster than if they had to start from scratch. Companies like Elon Musk’s Tesla have notably chosen to use the data, hardware, and software it was developing for driver’s assistance in its cars and repackaging it in a new form factor with its Optimus robots. Meanwhile, in other robotics news, Pymnts also recently wrote about an MIT research that developed an AI system that could enable warehouse robots to handle odd-shaped packages and navigate crowded spaces without putting humans at risk. This development comes when retailers and logistics firms are grappling with rising pressure to automate amid surging e-commerce demand. The research shows that while robots excel at repetitive tasks like moving pallets, MIT’s PRoC3S technology tackles the long-standing challenge of robots handling more complex warehouse jobs safely. “In theory, PRoC3S could reduce a robot’s error rate by vetting its initial LLM-based assumptions against more specific and accurate understandings of the warehouse environment,” Erik Nieves, CEO and co-founder at Plus One Robotics, told Pymnts. “Think about it like this: A warehouse robot operating solely on LLM guidance has been described how to complete a task,” continued Nieves. He added that the PRoC3S goes a step further “by placing a digital robot in a simulated environment of that task.” According to Nieves, this basically shows the difference between classroom instruction and “a really good field trip.” From Zero to Web3 Pro: Your 90-Day Career Launch Plan",AI|Amazon|AMD|Google|Nvidia|Tesla,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-30 13:46:36

According to VTV, despite repeated warnings from the police urging the public to stay alert and avoid falling victim to such scams, these illegal operations continue to target unsuspecting individuals. During an investigation, Hanoi City Police uncovered a plan by Trieu Nu Cuoi Company to host a conference with 300 customers at Bao Son Paradise in An Khanh Commune, Hoai Duc District, Hanoi, scheduled for December 24, 2024. Upon searching the company’s offices, the police seized a variety of items, including documents and computers. Primary findings revealed that Trieu Nu Cuoi Company had been promoting QFS coins, incorporating spiritual elements into its marketing efforts. The total revenue generated from the sale of these coins was estimated at around 30 billion VND. Authorities also intercepted the company’s plan to further promote QFS coins by convincing individuals to invest between 4 million and 39 million VND (approximately $190 to $1,350) at these events. The Hanoi City Police’s Investigation Security Agency has issued a public notice, urging anyone who may have been harmed in the case to promptly contact the agency for resolution in accordance with legal procedures, ensuring their legal rights and interests are protected. Through this case, the Investigation Security Agency also once again advises the public to carefully research and verify information before investing in virtual currencies.

According to the local newspaper Wen Wei Po , Wu said Hong Kong regulators should study the impact of U.S-issued Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on the market as a starting point before they decide to add Bitcoin to the national reserve. He argued that Hong Kong authorities could take advantage of of China’s “one country, two systems” policy to include Bitcoin ( BTC ) in its national reserve for financial security. The newspaper noted that China currently holds the second largest Bitcoin reserve, worth 190,000 BTC from illegal trade confiscations. “If major economic powers take the initiative to include Bitcoin in strategic reserves, the value of Bitcoin will be more stable, causing more countries to follow suit and minimize their traditional asset holdings,” said Wu. The Council Member and Chairman of the Web3 Subcommittee on Virtual Asset Development did not recommend holding onto “small currencies.” Instead, he specifically recommended Bitcoin due to its high trading volume on the market, making it a more desirable asset compared to more traditional commodities like gold and silver. He mentioned El Salvador and Bhutan as examples of regions that have successfully added Bitcoin to their national reserves, as well as several U.S. states. You might also like: Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania to create the state-level Bitcoin reserves. What are these bills? In his interview with the news outlet, Wu pointed out that cryptocurrency is already integrated into Hong Kong’s financial institutions. For example, he mentioned there are already as many as 12 Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Moreover, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has been known to invest in a “small portion” of cryptocurrency to diversify its assets. Wu believes that Bitcoin will be beneficial for preserving Hong Kong’s financial security. In testing the waters, he suggested that regulators apply the principle of “same business, same risk, same rules” when it comes to holding crypto assets within the national reserves. In the past few months, lawmakers in Japan, Russia and even the EU have made calls for governments to adopt Bitcoin in their national reserves. Although some countries have outright rejected the idea, others remain open to the possibility. The U.S. in particular have been leading the trend, though even some are doubtful it will happen. As previously reported by crypto.news on Dec. 11, another Hong Kong lawmaker named Johnny Ng also brought up the topic of adding cryptocurrencies to Hong Kong’s fiscal reserves. Though, Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, Joseph Chan responded by saying that crypto assets were not the target investment for Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund.

Peanut the Squirrel ( PNUT ) rose 15.4% over the past 24 hours, exchanging hands at $0.7102 while bringing its market cap to over $710 million. The meme coin’s daily trading volume was also up 190%, hovering over $596 million at press time. PNUT’s rally came despite a 1.8% drop in the broader meme coin market, valued at $107.3 billion, and a 3.1% drop in the global crypto market, which stood at $3.41 trillion at press time. Why did PNUT surge? The meme coin rallied as whales took up interest in it. According to a Dec. 30 X post by on-chain tracker Spot On Chain, a whale withdrew 10 million PNUT tokens, worth approximately $6.1 million, from the crypto exchange Binance. Nearly all the tokens were transferred to a decentralized wallet labeled “76yGJ,” making it the sixth-largest PNUT holder. Notably, the tokens withdrawn mark 1% of the total supply of PNUT tokens in circulation. Just three days earlier, crypto.news reported that a different whale had transferred 15,140 SOL to heavily invest in PNUT and two other popular meme coins. The move mirrors a trend from Dec. 12, when another whale withdrew 8.41 million PNUT tokens, valued at $10.68 million at the time, from Binance after creating a new wallet. Whale accumulation is typically viewed as a bullish signal for an asset’s price, as retail traders often follow these investment patterns, anticipating an uptrend in the asset while aiming to make quick gains from the potential price surge. PNUT’s rally also came amid a surge in demand from futures traders. According to data from CoinGlass, the open interest in its futures market has jumped 35% over the previous day to over $222.92 million when writing. You might also like: Meme coins crash: why are Brett, PNUT, Popcat falling? However, the biggest catalyst likely driving the Squirrel-themed token’s price surge appears to be market speculation surrounding a possible listing of the altcoin in two of the premier exchanges in the U.S., Coinbase and Robinhood. Coinbase officially included the asset in its listing roadmap on Dec. 11. However, the exchange is yet to unveil an exact date when the token would be available for trading. Meanwhile, market commentators also speculate that Robinhood will list the meme coin as it has already secured a listing on top-tier global exchanges such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit, among others. More recently, PNUT was listed on Blockchain.com and the Indian crypto exchange Zebpay. Meme coins typically tend to strongly rally following a listing on a major centralized exchange due to the added exposure. As crypto.news reported earlier PNUT rallied over 20% after Coinbase said it was considering listing it. Community sentiment surrounding the meme coin appears largely bullish, with 78% of 73.6k votes anticipating further gains, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, per CoinCarp , the total number of PNUT holders rose by 10% in December, contributing to improved liquidity and a stronger community base. $pnut double bottom pattern is in Attempting a strong reversal pic.twitter.com/RLfkeJ6MG7 — Dami-Defi (@DamiDefi) December 30, 2024 Read more: Peanut the Squirrel owner takes legal action against Binance for listing PNUT, boosting his JFP token by 200%",News|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|Meme Coin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-30 13:51:08

Besides, it also fueled speculations over the future of the broader crypto market, especially as the top altcoins often follow BTC’s performance. However, despite the recent dip, Matrixport has recently predicted a potential New Year breakout for BTC, citing its historical trends and other factors. Will Bitcoin Price Bounce Back Stronger This New Year? Top crypto research firm Matrixport recently highlighted historical trends as an indicator of a possible New Year breakout for Bitcoin price. In a post on X, the firm pointed to the cryptocurrency’s strong rally in recent months and the subsequent consolidation phase. Notably, Matrixport noted that Bitcoin’s Futures Open Interest surged by 50%, from $18 billion in October to $29 billion in December. During this time, the funding rate also climbed significantly, peaking at 80%. Historically, such rapid buildups in market positions have been followed by consolidation periods before an upward trend resumes. “Bitcoin is currently digesting the exuberance of the past few weeks,” Matrixport stated. They also emphasized that subdued trading volumes over the holiday season might signal a temporary pause rather than a reversal. As 2025 approaches, traders are anticipating renewed market activity, potentially driving Bitcoin prices higher. This has also fueled speculations over a potential rally ahead for the top altcoins . Although Bitcoin’s dip has cast a shadow on its recent gains, many view this as part of the market’s natural cycle. In other words, the new year could see fresh inflows, reigniting a rally that aligns with the broader adoption and interest in digital assets, Matrixport suggested. Source: Matrixport, X BTC Rally Ahead? BTC price today was down around 2% and exchanged hands at $92,928, while its trading volume soared 78% to $39.55 billion. The crypto has touched a high of $95,067.72 while witnessing a monthly price dip of about 4%. However, despite the recent dip, Bitcoin Futures Open Interest stayed near the flatline, indicating a bullish momentum ahead for the crypto. In addition, historical data from CoinGlass showed that Bitcoin price often tends to rally in the first quarter of the year. For context, BTC has surged 69% and 71% in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Having said that, the market eagerly awaits a potential breakout ahead for the crypto. Source: CoinGlass Despite the optimism, some experts remained cautious over the short-term pullbacks in Bitcoin price. For context, Peter Brandt has recently predicted a potential BTC crash to $78K, sparking market discussions. However, in another recent post, Brandt predicted BTC to hit $108K again in the coming days, which reflects his growing confidence in the crypto. Source: Peter Brandt, X Meanwhile, despite the short-term concerns, the long-term outlook of the bullish crypto still remained strong.

Galaxy Research Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $185K by 2025 as Nation-State Adoption Grows Fundamental Predictions for Bitcoin and Ethereum Bitcoin (BTC): Expected to “test or top” $185,000 in late 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Predicted to exceed $5,500 in the next 12 months. “A combination of institutional, corporate and nation-state adoption will propel Bitcoin to new heights in 2025,” said Alex Thorn, Galaxy’s research director. Nation-State and Corporate Adoption: Galaxy predicts that five Nasdaq-100 companies and five nation-states will add bitcoin to their balance sheets or sovereign wealth funds. US Bitcoin ETFs: Assets under management (AUM) in US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds are expected to exceed $250 billion by 2025. Asset Management Platforms: At least one major platform is expected to announce a bitcoin allocation of 2% or higher next year. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is set to witness significant growth, with the total amount of BTC locked in DeFi protocols expected to double from the current $11 billion.

This significant decline reflects the broader market uncertainty, with increased selling pressure and cautious investor sentiment weighing heavily on ADA’s price. Despite this, on-chain data suggests a shift in dynamics, hinting at a potential recovery for the embattled cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Moves 8,000 BTC Aged 5-7 Years – What Happened Last Time Top analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted key metrics indicating whale accumulation in recent weeks, adding a layer of optimism to ADA’s outlook. According to Martinez, Cardano’s most significant support zone lies between $0.77 and $0.68, a range that has been consistently respected by the market. This support has proven crucial in stabilizing ADA’s price, providing a base from which a recovery could materialize. The sustained interest from large holders signals confidence in ADA’s long-term potential, even amid short-term volatility. As Cardano continues to defend critical support levels, market participants are watching closely for signs of a breakout. With whale activity increasing and technical indicators aligning, Cardano’s next moves could redefine its trajectory, offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise challenging environment. Cardano Setting The Stage For A Move Cardano has faced a sharp downturn following its explosive rally in November, entering a phase of deep correction that rattled investor confidence. Despite the recent pullback, ADA appears to be finding stability as it consolidates above critical support levels, sparking renewed optimism for a potential rebound. Prominent analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, identifying Cardano’s most significant support zone between $0.77 and $0.68. According to Martinez, ADA’s price action has closely respected this range, reinforcing its importance in preventing further declines. Should ADA continue to hold above this level for a few more days, the groundwork for a strong recovery could be laid, potentially reversing the bearish trend. Adding to the positive outlook is the behavior of large market participants. On-chain data reveals significant whale activity during this consolidation phase, suggesting that major investors are taking advantage of the lower prices to accumulate ADA. This pattern of accumulation often signals growing confidence in a project’s long-term potential, even in the face of short-term price volatility. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought Over 90 Million DOGE In 48H – Details As ADA holds its ground above the crucial support zone, market participants eagerly await a breakout. If a sustained rebound occurs, it could position Cardano for a powerful rally, reclaiming recent losses and potentially testing new highs. Price Action: Key Supply To Test Cardano is currently trading at $0.87, grappling with increased selling pressure that has kept its price subdued. Despite the challenges, ADA has demonstrated resilience by holding above key support levels, indicating that buyers are still active in the market. However, the next few days will be crucial for determining its direction. A significant price milestone lies at the $1 mark, which has acted as a psychological resistance level in recent weeks. If ADA can successfully reclaim $1 with strong volume and momentum, it could pave the way for a massive rally. Such a breakout would likely see ADA targeting its yearly high of $1.32, a level last reached during its impressive November rally. Clearing this resistance would signal renewed bullish sentiment and potentially attract additional buying interest. Related Reading: A 20%-30% Correction Is ‘The Most Bullish Thing’ That Could Happen To Bitcoin – Analyst On the downside, the risk of a deeper retracement remains if selling pressure intensifies. ADA could test lower demand zones around $0.75, which aligns with historical support levels. This scenario would likely lead to a period of further consolidation as the market seeks equilibrium.

Current technical indicators signal a bearish outlook, implying that prices may further decline in the short term. However, projections indicate potential recovery in the coming months. Here are the key factors that could establish a price floor for Solana. Has Solana Price Formed A Bottom? Crypto analyst Trader recently highlighted a key pattern in Solana’s price movement. He pointed out an ascending triangle formation, suggesting potential upward trajectories. According to him, the $199 mark stands as a crucial resistance level. Flipping this hurdle into a support floor will suggest that SOL has formed a bottom and that its ready for a recovery rally. Therefore, Solana price prediction hints that a breakout above the $199 threshold could trigger a significant rally to the upside, potentially revisiting $230. Source- Tweet SOL Technical Analysis: Solana Struggles Amid Bearish Crypto Market Volatility Solana price fluctuations continue as it trades below its 2021 peak of $260, with a record high at $263.83 in November 2024. Today, the latest SOL price has decreased by 2%, mirroring a broader decline in the crypto market, which saw a 1.63% drop in total market capitalization over the past day. Currently, SOL is at $193, hinting at potential recovery prospects for the upcoming year. To regain bullish momentum, surpassing the $200 threshold is critical. If the market conditions improve, analysts anticipate Solana might approach $220 by early January. However, barring significant developments, it will oscillate between $190 and $200 shortly. Meanwhile, Bitcoin stabilizes near $93,000 , supporting a more optimistic outlook for Solana, which has recently rebounded by 5%. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a slight convergence, suggesting a potential shift in momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), positioned at 43, indicates that Solana is neither overbought nor oversold, staying within a neutral range. SOL Price Chart: TradingView For Solana price to find its bottom, surpassing the $199 resistance level is crucial. Achieving this could signal a reversal of its recent downturn, marking the beginning of a potential recovery phase. This shift is vital for Solana to stabilize and regain upward momentum.

To that end, the AI agent platform is considering changing its tokenomics and potentially building a layer 1 blockchain as the year comes to a close. The team has initiated discussions with contributors to enhance the value accrual of its token. ai16z’s most recent governance considerations involve a gradual revision of its token economics. According to sources, the entity intends to create a token launchpad similar to Pump.fun in the first quarter of 2025. This platform may be the core center for deploying AI projects built on the Eliza framework, with its native token serving as the base currency for agent-to-agent interactions. In addition, the launchpad could employ various value capture mechanisms, such as strategic liquidity pool pairings, ai16z token stake for access, and launch fees. The project could also contemplate the launch of a layer 1 blockchain that is specifically designed for AI applications, as indicated by a document that contributors have shared. ai16z surges to a $1 billion market cap Following the introduction of its new advisors, ai16z has seen significant accumulation by large investors. The token reached a market cap of $1.5 billion over the weekend before retreating to a value of around $1.4 billion at the time of writing.

The token has been one of this year’s top-performing cryptocurrencies, soaring nearly 400% from its August lows. This rally has boosted AGLD’s market cap to over $227 million and its 24-hour trading volume to $1.3 billion. Acala ( ACA ) continued its upward trend, reaching a high of $0.12—a 155% increase from its lowest level this year. The rally comes as the Polkadot ( DOT ) network continues to perform strongly, with its total value locked rising to over $111.4 million. These tokens experienced double-digit gains as the mood in the crypto industry remained muted and volume fell. Bitcoin crashed below $94,000, meaning that it has crashed by 15% from its highest level this year. The crypto fear and greed index, a popular gauge on sentiment in the industry, has moved from the extreme greed zone of 90 to the neutral point of 50. Also, the altcoin season index has moved from the year-to-date high of 87 to 44. Meanwhile, most altcoins were in the red. Movement crashed by 10% on Dec. 30, while Helium, Pudgy Penguins, Curve DAO, Ondo, and Mantra were among the worst-performers, falling by over 7%. The next potential catalyst for Bitcoin and other altcoins will be the potential January Effect , a situation where assets rise in the first days of the year.

While large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) saw significant moves to the upside, altcoins and meme coins saw even more impressive gains in the tail end of 2024. While we’ve seen already established meme coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) provide triple-digit returns, the meme coin market is no less dynamic than it was last year — and even completely new entrants are seeing rapid moves to the upside. Recently, a meme coin on the XRP Ledger saw one such significant increase in price — at present, Kitty Cup (KCUP) is trading some 85.66% above yesterday’s prices. The question is — is this rally at all sustainable? KCUP was launched on October 22 — at present, it is trading at $0.001129, up from $0.0006114 on December 29, and has a total market capitalization of just $1 million. KCUP price 1-day chart. Source: TradingView The rise of this XRP meme coin is impressive — but likely won’t continue As seen in the chart above, KCUP’s price action has been quite volatile in the near term. Such sharp movements are indicative of low liquidity. Except for the largest candles seen in the chart, KittyCup does indeed exhibit a low level of trading volume. In addition, there was no notable catalyst behind the surge — this was apparently just another instance of the Internet really loving cats , which are arguably one of the most common sources of memes in general. https://twitter.com/KittyCupCoin/status/1873381433903047085 Nonetheless, when utility and fundamentals are out of the question, investors simply move on to other criteria they consider important. There is a significant degree of optimism regarding KCUP online — with traders citing the fact that it is the only cat-themed cryptocurrency on the XRP ledger and that the meme it is based on has demonstrated a strong degree of staying power in an otherwise ephemeral space. While those arguments certainly might be true, this is still essentially a bet on the opaque whims of the Internet — there are no reliable ways to analyze an asset such as this, so it, unfortunately, remains relegated to being a speculative bet.

This new feature allows HYPE holders to stake their tokens with validators, earning rewards while contributing to the security and decentralization of the platform. HYPE Staking Goes Live on HyperLiquid HYPE token staking is now available on HyperLiquid’s decentralized exchange, the Hyper Foundation announced. The foundation also stressed the importance of staking for the security of the network and attracting more people to the project. ”With staking, the various users in the HYPE staking community can collectively secure the network,” the Hyper Foundation said in a post that was shared on X. Staking allows users to transfer their tokens to trusted validators so that the users can receive more tokens depending on the performance of the validators. The validators take an active part in proposing new blocks for the network based on the amount of staked HYPE. The foundation also recommended checking validator metrics such as uptime and time online, reputation and reviews, commission rates, and contributions to the community. More than 320 million HYPE tokens have been staked across many validators as of now. In the HyperLiquid platform, the rewards are only given to the validators who have successfully participated in consensus, which is why it is crucial to select the proper validators. Plans to Strengthen Decentralization During the presentation, the Hyper Foundation unveiled the Delegation Program that will be used to incentivize the most efficient validators. While the specifics of the programme have not been made public yet, the foundation said that it would be rewarding validators active in the ecosystem and its protection. The staking system also includes the possibility to use locked HYPE tokens. However, rewards from these tokens are currently non-withdrawable until the lockup period is over. This mechanism promotes long term loyalty to the network while at the same time balancing the reward sharing system. Consequently, the success of HyperLiquid is in line with the general trend of the DeFi industry. Grayscale Research recently added HYPE into the Top 20 diversified crypto assets list where the company highlighted network growth, adoption, and sustainability as major factors for such inclusion. Other tokens on the list are Ethena’s ENA, Virtual Protocol’s VIRTUAL, Jupiter’s JUP, Jito’s JTO, and Grass. HYPE/USD: Source: Coinglass On the derivatives market, HYPE has observed an increase in its open interest which is now at $585.90 million from a previous 0.98%. In addition, the trading volume increased by 21.75% to $318.03 million which shows that more people are participating in the market as staking is gradually becoming popular. Will HYPE Price Breakout To $36? Since the token generation event that took place on the 29th of November, HYPE has shown exceptional price appreciation, with the coin rising by over 640%. The token reached its peak at $34 on December 22, and has since remained fairly constant at around $28. At the moment, HYPE has a total supply of 333.9 million tokens, which is trading at a $9.3 billion market cap and has a fully diluted valuation of $27.9 billion. Concurrently, HYPE’s price chart indicates a bullish breakout from a falling wedge formation, a common reversal signal. However, the price has moved sideways after the breakout, signaling a consolidation phase. Analysts project a potential price target of $36, based on the wedge’s height, provided bullish momentum resumes. HYPE/USD : Source: TradingView) Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers near 47, slightly below the neutral 50 level, suggesting weak momentum. Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays bearish tendencies but shows signs of flattening, potentially signaling waning selling pressure. Key support lies around $26.50, with resistance between $28 and $29. A breakout above this range could propel the price toward $36. Conversely, failure to hold support at $26.50 might invalidate the bullish outlook.

Here we will explore why crypto bulls are shifting focus from SHIB and ME to capitalize on this new DeFi coin before it explodes. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Shiba Inu Struggles in December, But Crypto Bulls Keep Faith Shiba Inu has faced challenges in December 2024, losing over 16.59% in token price this month and more than 32% since December 9, 2024. Despite the dip, SHIB rebounded from $0.00002095 to $0.00002233 as whales and crypto bulls continued accumulating. For example, on December 23, whales purchased 1.21 trillion SHIB worth $26.6 million while selling 413 billion SHIB, causing a net inflow of 799.32 billion tokens, which is an 11-day high. Exchange reserves have also dropped continuously from 140.87 trillion SHIB on December 7 to 135.74 trillion, highlighting reduced selling pressure and increasing confidence in SHIB’s long-term potential. SHIB was valued at $0.00002222 on December 26, down 7.98% in the past week. Meanwhile, a new crypto trading project outpaces Shiba Inu with its innovative features like the Trade2Earn program, rewarding every trade with its DeFi coin, and its staking rewards program offering crypto bulls up to a 20% APY. The ME Token Faces Setbacks as a New DeFi Coin Offers Higher Profits Magic Eden introduced its ME token on December 10, 2024, with an airdrop surpassing $700 million. Although there were complications during the claim process, more than 70,000 traders claimed almost 69 million ME tokens in the first hour. Magic Eden attributed the challenges to high app traffic but insisted on the airdrop’s massive participation and trading activity. Valued initially at around $4.51, ME fluctuated between $4.41 and $6.05 , reaching a high of $1.6 billion market cap before settling below $1 billion. However, ME has dropped below $4 recently with crypto bulls turning to a new DeFi coin with significant profit prospects. ME was trading at $3.55 on December 26, up 21.55% in the past week. A new DeFi coin project outshines Magic Eden with its innovative features, letting users earn passive income and trade risk-free with up to $500,000 capital.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Ki Young Ju says that for the US to seriously consider a BTC standard, it would have to see its global economic dominance threatened by another nation. “I personally support the idea of Bitcoin Standard. However, I question whether the U.S., while continuing to grow as other economies stagnate, would adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. For the debate to gain serious momentum, the U.S. would need to see its global economic dominance genuinely threatened. At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the U.S.’s continued supremacy.” The Bitcoin Standard – which is also a book written by Saifedean Ammous – refers to the idea that the US government could use Bitcoin as a reserve asset. According to Ju, while it’s in the realm of possibility that the government creates a BTC standard, even if it did, the government’s intentions would vastly differ from that of Bitcoin bulls and investors, though no specifics were mentioned. “While it’s conceivable that the U.S. government could purchase Bitcoin for risk management or economic leverage, its motivations would likely differ greatly from what Bitcoiners imagine. The notion of buying Bitcoin to prepare for a Bitcoin Standard or as a tool to defend the dollar system seems far removed from the current reality. With global capital flowing into the U.S., many still believe the dollar’s dominance is secure.” Ju concludes by noting that if President-elect Donald Trump’s term is successful and he rebuilds the strength of the US dollar, he could change his pro-BTC stance. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing U.S. economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign. He could easily step back from his Bitcoin advocacy, citing changing priorities, without alienating his voter base.” Earlier this month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the government is not legally allowed to hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset and has no plans to change the law, causing the crypto king to see a significant dip in price.

33767162,[object Object],1735572628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Looks To Reclaim All-time High, Current Cycle To Outperform Past Cycles?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-looks-to-reclaim-all-time-high/,"Considering the ongoing cycle is still in the bull phase, confidence in Ethereum about an impending significant rally to unprecedented levels has emerged within the community. ETH may have faced heightened volatility over the past few weeks, but crypto analysts contend that the altcoin’s next major upswing might be on the horizon. A Historic Comeback Toward Present All-Time High Imminent Titan of Crypto, a technical expert and trader, delved into Ethereum’s price performance in the ongoing cycle, suggesting a move to historical levels. In the analysis, Titan of Crypto claims ETH may be on the verge of reclaiming its current all-time high of $4,800. The expert’s perspective is based on past trends, particularly the 2021 market cycle in which ETH achieved its present price peak. His prediction points to a similar trend when periods of consolidation preceded notable price spikes in 2021. Growing negative sentiment about ETH’s price performance among investors is the major reason for Titan of Crypto’s bullish analysis. While many complain about ETH’s lackluster performance in the ongoing cycle, the analyst highlighted that the altcoin is ahead of the 2021 market cycle. As of December 2020, the expert noted that Ethereum was still 90% below its previous all-time high. Meanwhile, the altcoin is just 44% below its current all-time high this month, implying a potentially improved bull cycle than the last one. In the past cycle, ETH did not regain its peak until January 2021. Since this cycle is performing quite similarly to past scenarios, Titan of Crypto’s analysis suggests that the crypto asset might also revisit its all-time high soon, possibly in January 2025. With increasing investor confidence , heightened adoption of decentralized applications, and consistent network upgrades, Ethereum could attract the necessary momentum to surge to a new peak. However, monitoring key resistance levels and general market conditions will be important to determine ETH’s next move in the upcoming weeks. ETH’s Price Hints At Path To A $7,300 Milestone Despite the current volatility in the market, ETH continues to display potential for a significant move toward uncharted territory. Recent price action shows that Ethereum has formed a crucial chart formation, sparking optimism among investors about an upward breakout. According to market expert Crypto Patel, an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern has emerged in the 5-day time frame. This key formation, which is frequently linked to remarkable price increases indicates that the altcoin is poised to rally as it eyes a breakout on the upside. Should ETH break out from the bullish pattern, the expert is confident that the digital asset may rally to the $7,300 level. After that, Crypto Patel expects other altcoins to follow suit shortly, urging investors and traders to be patient.",Ethereum|altcoins|consolidation|Crypto Patel|ETH|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Inverse Head And Shoulders Formation|Titan of Crypto,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-30 15:30:28

Each quarter, the Grayscale Research team evaluates “hundreds of digital assets” to guide the rebalancing of the FTSE/Grayscale Crypto Sectors family of indexes. In the words of the research note, “Our approach incorporates a range of factors, including network growth/adoption, upcoming catalysts, sustainability of fundamentals, token valuation, token supply inflation, and potential tail risks.” The newest additions to the top 20 list are guided by three main market themes that Grayscale believes will shape the coming months: the US election and potential regulatory implications, rapid developments in decentralized AI, and the expanding Solana ecosystem. Related Reading: 2025 Crypto Forecast: Four-Year Cycle Points To Peak In Q2/Q4, Expert Advises Caution While Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Chainlink, Uniswap, SushiSwap, Aave, Bittensor, Optimism, Lido DAO, Helium, Arweave, Aerodrome and Akash Network remain on the the list, six new altcoins were added compared to the previous quarter. “We are adding the following six assets to our Top 20 list for Q1 2025,” the report states, emphasizing each project’s notable alignment with one or more of the aforementioned themes. Best (New) Crypto Assets For Q1 2025 Hyperliquid (HYPE): A Layer 1 blockchain geared toward on-chain financial applications, Hyperliquid’s flagship product is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for perpetual futures. Built around a fully on-chain order book, HYPE seeks to capture the growing demand for advanced derivatives trading in a decentralized environment. Notably, HYPE has seen a meteoric rise over the past weeks, already claiming rank #19 on the list of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Ethena (ENA): Ethena protocol has introduced a novel stablecoin, USDe, backed by hedged positions in Bitcoin and Ether. As Grayscale explains, “Specifically, the protocol holds long positions in Bitcoin and Ether and short positions in perpetual futures contracts on the same assets.” A staked version of the token leverages the pricing differential between spot and futures markets, potentially offering a unique yield profile for participants. Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL): Operating on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network, Virtual Protocol enables the creation of AI agents designed to function autonomously. “These AI agents are designed to perform tasks autonomously, mimicking human decision-making,” Grayscale notes. The platform further allows for co-ownership of these agents via tokenization, bridging AI capabilities with blockchain infrastructure. Related Reading: Expert Reveals Top 15 Crypto Predictions For 2025 You Need To Know Jupiter (JUP): Jupiter has emerged as a leading DEX aggregator on Solana, recording the highest total value locked (TVL) among all Solana applications. With Solana’s user base broadening and speculation intensifying around memecoins and AI agent tokens, “we believe Jupiter is well positioned to capitalize on this growing market activity,” states the report. Jito (JTO): Jito is a liquid staking protocol on Solana that has demonstrated strong adoption over the past year. Notably, Grayscale highlights the project’s substantial earnings: “Jito has experienced substantial growth in adoption over the past year and offers one of the best financial profiles in all of crypto, generating over $550mn in 2024 fee revenue.” Grass (GRASS): Grass rewards users for sharing unused internet bandwidth via a Chrome extension. “This bandwidth is used to scrape online data, which is then sold to AI companies and developers for training machine learning models,” according to Grayscale. The project monetizes web scraping by redistributing rewards to users who contribute their idle bandwidth. Furthermore, Grayscale notes that it continues to be “excited about themes from previous quarters such as Ethereum scaling solutions, tokenization, and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN).” Examples of these established themes include Optimism, Chainlink, and Helium, which remain in the Top 20 due to their alignment with scaling, tokenization, and DePIN use cases, respectively. Notably, six assets—NEAR, Stacks, Maker CELO, UMA, and TON—have been rotated out of the Top 20 list this quarter. “Grayscale Research continues to see value in each of these projects, and they remain important elements of the crypto ecosystem. However, we believe the revised Top 20 list may offer more compelling risk-adjusted returns for the coming quarter,” Grayscale notes. At press time, HYPE traded at $29.45.

In the second to last week of December, XRP lost $20 billion in market cap — going from $152 billion to $132 billion. It has, unfortunately, continued this losing streak — at press time, the token’s market cap had receded to $116 billion, having shed $6 billion in a matter of hours on December 30. At press time, XRP was trading at $2.03 — down 25.09% from a December 2 high of $2.71. Although year-to-date (YTD) gains stand at 230.84%, the token has seen prices decrease by 5.88% on the daily chart on strong volume. XRP price 1-day chart. Source: Finbold XRP could easily drop beneath $2 — but would most likely recover quickly The $2 mark represents a crucial psychological barrier — a sustained drop beneath those levels would doubtlessly engender an even more bearish sentiment. With YTD returns being as impressive as they are, taking profits or reinvesting them in assets that are on the upswing is quite a rational move. XRP seems set to drop $2 in short order — and while that move will most likely cause a prolonged drop, this is still the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the world, and the drop will most likely be temporary. Let’s take a closer look at some of the most important factors affecting XRP. Ripple Labs’ escrow system unlocks 1 billion XRP tokens on the first day of every month. That’s due to happen on Wednesday — and the increased selling pressure and supply are almost certainly going to drive prices below $2. This will most likely be temporary — XRP will, in all likelihood, trade in tandem with the wider crypto market, which primarily takes its cues from Bitcoin ( BTC ). As the fundamental theses behind the bull run haven’t shifted significantly (even accounting for the announcement of fewer FED rate cuts in 2025), it appears as if it is only a matter of time before the uptrend resumes. In addition, with the chairmanship of Gary Gensler set to end, the likelihood of XRP spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) being approved is all but certain — a development that would go a long way in stabilizing price action.

Source: TradingView Why ‘Santa Claus rally’ was replaced by a ‘Grinch downturn’ The lack of the ‘Santa Claus rally’ – or, perhaps, the presence of the ‘Grinch downturn’ – can largely be attributed to a relatively expected correction and consolidation phase following a massive upsurge as, for example, the cryptocurrency market capitalization skyrocketed $1.4 trillion from $2.29 trillion at the start of November to $3.69 trillion on December 17 – a 61.14% increase. Furthermore, it fell in line with a broader plunge that came as the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting reignited fears of weakening equity markets and the likely higher inflation rate in 2025. Indeed, while digital assets, spearheaded by Bitcoin ( BTC ), which fell from about $108,000 in mid-December to $91,687 at press time, took much of the attention, the S&P 500 stock index is down 2.83% since December 17. Additionally, major stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) and Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA ) are down 5.17% and 13%, respectively. S&P 500 index 30-day price chart.

Still, it is worth pointing out that the latest decline, despite seeing vast amounts of wealth erased from the markets, did little to diminish the overall rise of digital assets – and technology stocks and gold – in 2024. In fact, while the $200 billion 5-day wipe is staggering and was doubtlessly painful for many investors, the cryptocurrency market is still up $1.47 trillion in 2024, as it started the year with a market capitalization of $1.67 trillion.

Down more than 8% and holding just above $300 on Monday, MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are now lower by about 30% since just after the announcement of their inclusion into the Nasdaq-100 index and nearly 50% from their late November record high. The signs of at least a major short-term top in one-time barely known enterprise software company turned juggernaut Bitcoin Development Company MicroStrategy were everywhere. First among those signals was the rocketing stock price — at its high of $543 in late November, MSTR was up nearly eight-fold in 2024 and more than a 50-bagger since the company began buying bitcoin (BTC) in August 2020. There was also founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor — never shy about promoting his company's prospects and evangelizing for Bitcoin — who late this year had somehow become even more ubiquitous on the financial news, podcast and social media carousels. It wasn't just the constant appearances, but subtle changes in Saylor's attitude to what might charitably be described by U.S. sports fans as ""spiking the football"" following a touchdown. Among them was the constant promotion of the MicroStrategy-invented key performance indicator of ""bitcoin yield,"" which recalled late 1990s made-up internet bubble metrics like ""page views."" His company flush with cash from share and convertible debt sales, Saylor — for reasons unknown — late in the year also got in the habit of teasing announcements of sizable new bitcoin purchases on the Sunday prior to the official regulatory filing on Monday morning. And then there was the emergence of copycats. Despite years of the obvious success of Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy, there had been a decided lack of other publicly traded corporates adopting the same. Yes, a few — even large-caps like the Elon Musk-led Tesla and Jack Dorsey-led Square — had dipped their toes into bitcoin acquisition. No other company of note, though, was willing to not only adopt bitcoin as their main treasury asset but take advantage of willing markets to raise additional capital with which to accumulate tokens. That changed in a sizable way this year however, with small cap medical device maker Semler Scientific, Japan hotel operator Metaplanet, and a number of bitcoin miners among those embracing the Saylor vision — each of them earning social media plaudits from Saylor with every capital raise and bitcoin purchase announcement. If something cannot go on forever, it will stop Not content with being maybe the greatest trader ever and accumulating many billions of dollars, George Soros wanted to be known as a great thinker. It's no coincidence that his magnum opus on trading — the Theory of Reflexivity — sounds suspiciously similar to a famous theory from a fellow named Einstein. Soros explained that investor perception and its effect on prices is a constant two-way street. In this way, perception (which is often wrong, as humans are fallible) can not just influence prices, but literally create its own reality, i.e. 1) investors believe a stock will go higher because earnings are about to get a big boost, 2) the stock price goes higher, 3) the high stock price allows management to raise capital at a cheaper cost than otherwise, 4) this improves earnings, 5) the stock price goes even higher, 6) the bulls pat themselves on the back for their brilliance and win over converts, … and so on. Strip away much of Soros' philosophy and this is also known as a virtuous circle, in which MicroStrategy had surely found itself in 2024. Part of Soros' trading genius was recognizing these circles when they were happening and jumping on — in size. Another part of his genius was figuring out when the circles were about to break and getting out or even betting against them. ""If something cannot go on forever, it will stop,"" said the late economist Herb Stein, who at the time was talking about government budget/trade deficits. Stein's Law, it turns out, was equally applicable to MicroStrategy shares. Scoreboard: still showing remarkable gains Changing hands at about $430 just after the Dec. 14 announcement of its coming inclusion into the Nasdaq-100 Index, MicroStrategy is now selling at just above $300, a decline of roughly 30% in just two weeks. Looking back, there appear to have been cracks in the MicroStrategy bubble three weeks earlier. The stock peaked at about $543 on Nov. 21. Despite bitcoin's continued rise through late November and early December to an ultimate high above $108,000, MSTR lost ground — what technicians might call a troubling negative divergence. At the current $300, MicroStrategy for the moment is suffering a peak-to-trough drop of 45% in about five weeks. MSTR shares have still put in a remarkable performance under anything except that very tiny time frame. They remain higher by more than 400% year-to-date and about 20-fold from the time Saylor initiated bitcoin purchases in August 2020. While the bears might thus say the plunge has far to go, the bulls would surely point out that during MSTR's run since August 2020, the stock has suffered a number of similar scary short-to-medium term declines and has always resolved higher. What would Soros say? Just possibly, he would remind that his Theory of Reflexivity taught that prices can go further (both upward and downward) than most could possibly expect.",Markets|MicroStrategy|MSTR|Bitcoin|Michael Saylor,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-30 15:32:11

A shift to DeFi lending and DEX activities is driving the trend. Solana (SOL) is setting out as one of the most active chains for 2024. Solana saw increased stablecoin inflows in the last days of the year, surpassing all other chains. Based on data by Lookonchain, Solana attracted more than $454M in stablecoin inflows in the past week. Methods for tracking inflows differ, but the overall trend is for more active bridging of stablecoins into Solana’s apps and lending pools. Solana also surpassed Base despite the recent rush to AI agent tokens. Stablecoin flows can shift depending on the available earnings potential of various chains. Arbitrum, formerly one of the key L2 chains, saw the biggest stablecoin outflows. Solana was the day’s leader in stablecoin inflows, tapping the expanded liquidity in 2024. | Source: Artemis Despite the L2 narrative, not all chains managed to attract value in the year to date. Former DeFi star ZKSync Era saw an outflow of more than $2B net, along with Linea, Blast, and Avalanche. On a year-to-date basis, stablecoins have boosted Optimism, Base, Solana, Arbitrum, and SUI. Ethereum remained the most active chain in hosting USDT, adding to the available liquidity. Overall, stablecoins crossed the $200B barrier, driven by Tether, in addition to new mints for DAI, USDS, and Ethena’s USDe. Ethereum remains a stablecoin donor, traffic shifted to Solana and Base Stablecoin flows shift in the short term, and Solana achieved its leading position as of December 30. The chain saw $8.8M in netflows for the day, followed by SUI’s $2.9M in netflows. Solana competes with Base for fund inflows, though it has only made second place for the past three months. In the year to date, Base remains the most significant target for stablecoin inflows. For 2024, the chain attracted $7.8B in inflows, with $3.5B retained as net inflows. Solana attracted $5.3B in new inflows while retaining $2.1B in net flows for the year to date. The chain recently added more than 100M USDS from the Sky ecosystem as it aims to expand DeFi lending. As a result, Solana carries $5.254B in bridged stablecoins, with a total value locked rising to $8.58B. Solana lagged in attracting value, only peaking in December at above $9B in various tokens and stablecoins. Jito Liquid Staking and Kamino Finance made the bulk of value locked, but DEX, like Raydium and Jupiter, also drew in $4.47B in their liquidity pairs. Stablecoin flows measure bridging activity , which varied depending on the available apps. Arbitrum was one of the EVM-compatible chains with highly active bridging. For Solana, the bridging from Ethereum was more rare, but once funds were sent to Solana, they were more likely to stay. Arbitrum, on the other hand, had a much more active turnover. The recent trend in stablecoin flows shows that trader expectations have shifted in the year to date. The trend accelerated as Solana and Base became the top chains that carried AI agent tokens. As the only source for those tokens, bridging stablecoins for trading was key to accessing the new markets. Solana activity moved from memes to DeFi Meme tokens were one of the main drivers of growth on Solana in the past months, with two significant series of expansion. Despite this, not all traffic on Solana was of the same quality. The chain carried multiple low-value transactions, with up to 35% transaction failures. In the past year, Solana was also the leader in carrying out trading bot activity. Routing and bot usage were key for Solana to ensure a successful DEX trade or token sniping. Up to 86% of all bot traders use Solana as their destination chain. Most of the Solana traffic is also from wallets with 0.01 SOL as a balance. However, the inflow of stablecoin activity shows value is also accrued, usually linked to whale wallets using the protocols. Solana’s lending expansion also hinged on meme tokens. Some leading memes, such as DogWifHat (WIF) , were used as collateral on Kamino to borrow more stablecoins.

This week, for example, the Solana ecosystem had nearly half-a-billion dollar in stablecoins ’ inflow, while the Ethereum ecosystem lost millions. In particular, Solana had a $424.87 million inflow of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC in the last seven days. According to data from Lookonchain , this was the largest stablecoins inflow in all blockchains, with Coinbase ’s Base in second. This marks a huge milestone for Solana that could boost its ecosystem and SOL’s price to new highs. Essentially, stablecoins inflow usually mean increased demand for the ecosystem and increased liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. All that gets even more relevant when comparing to how other chains performed in the same period. Lookonchain consolidated that data, in a one-week time frame from December 30, 2024, comparing the top 15 blockchains. Stablecoins (USDT & USDC) change (7D) of top 15 chains. Source: Lookonchain Ethereum and other blockchains’ stablecoins net flow Base, Polygon ( POL ), Optimism ( OP ), Noble, and Aptos ( APT ) joined Solana with a positive seven-day stablecoin net flow. They absorbed $75 million, $35.2 million, $15.29 million, $8.15 million, and $3.45 million, respectively. Meanwhile, Arbitrum ( ARB ), Avalanche ( AVAX ), and Ethereum ( ETH ), led the top 15 chains with significant outflows of USDT and USDC. They lost $206 million, $67.13 million, and $63 million in stablecoins, respectively, with the Ethereum ecosystem being highly affected. Mantle Network ( MNT ), Sui Network ( SUI ), The Open Network ( TON ), Near Protocol ( NEAR ), Fantom ( FTM ), and the BNB Chain ( BNB ) joined the ranks although with more balanced flows going from minus $19.35 million to minus $0.29 million, in order. Interestingly, however, the Ethereum ecosystem continues leading in stablecoin liquidity, with over $111.59 billion, according to data from DefiLlama . This is a significantly high liquidity when compared to the $68 billion in total value locked (TVL) across Ethereum protocols. On the other hand, Solana currently has $5.23 billion in stablecoins, with $8.56 billion in TVL. If the trend of the last seven days continue, Solana could fight for the third position in stables, surpassing BNB and Arbitrum. Binance ’s smart chain currently has $6.82 billion in stablecoins, while Arbitrum has $6.75 billion. Blockchains TVL and stablecoin liquidity. Source: DefiLlama Solana (SOL) price analysis As of this writing, SOL, Solana’s native token, trades at $187.69, up 3.54% in the last seven days. This price surge is similar to Solana’s 4.95% TVL increase in the same period. Yet, it still lags behind the weekly 8.20% increase in stablecoin liquidity that Finbold reported. Moreover, SOL price briefly traded above $200 earlier in this analyzed last seven days. An upward potential of around 6.5% considering this local top alone. Solana (SOL) one-week (7D) price chart. Source: Finbold Therefore, while stablecoins inflow does not guarantee an immediate and proportional price surge, it could strengthen its growth potential. USDT and USDC entering Solana’s ecosystem while leaving others like Ethereum’s is an indicator worth considering and watching. Furthermore, this inflow could, not only benefit SOL, but also be distributed among the entire Solana ecosystem, while also shows a user’s preference in using stablecoins via the Solana blockchain, known for having faster finality and lower fees than Ethereum. Nevertheless, trading and investing in cryptocurrencies has inherent risks and unpredictability, requiring caution despite the positive indicators. SOL price could go both up or down in the following days as the year-end’s expected volatility plays its role.

While 4-year cycle traditionalists believe that the market will peak around Q4 2025, others are more cautious, purporting an April-May top, based on a careful analysis of previous cycles, market psychology, and the current trajectory of this cycle. Regardless, the best course of action is to sell incrementally cryptocurrencies like Solana on the way up to secure gains preceding the bear run. To maximize gains in this bull run, low-cap gems in trendy sectors such as Rollblock present the best opportunities for amassing returns in the 50-100x zone. Read on to learn more about RBLK’s lucrative potential. Ready to capitalize on iGaming’s growing demand: Why Rollblock could become the next 100x gem Rollblock is transforming iGaming with its unique play-to-earn platform, blending traditional and blockchain gaming for a rewarding user experience.

With this, platforms like pump.fun highlight Solana’s real-world use cases, showcasing SOL’s ability to handle high transaction volumes efficiently and fulfill niches within the crypto space Recently, Solana has garnered significant attention from institutional investors with filings for Solana-based ETFs by major players like Grayscale and 21Shares. ETFs have historically driven massive inflows, as seen with Bitcoin’s 181.5% surge following ETF approvals in early 2024. Should the SEC approve these Solana-based ETFs, the resulting inflows could catalyze a substantial price rally, further elevating Solana as a top contender to rival Ethereum in the competitive layer-1 blockchain space. Looking to capitalize on altcoin season? Get into Rollblock before NYE! Given that crypto market cycles repeat, signs point to another altcoin surge on the horizon around Q1 2025. As no one can predict for certain when the market top will occur in 2025, investors should remain cautious and prioritize selling on the way up. Holding cryptos too long into a bear market could erode gains, and it is crucial to lock in profits when market momentum is strong and crypto enters into the mainstream consciousness.

Hashflow’s deep liquidity and best prices make it an attractive option for traders navigating the evolving crypto landscape. As the market expands, Hashflow’s innovative approach positions it as a strong competitor among other coins and platforms. Starknet (STRK) Starknet is turning heads in the blockchain community with its fresh approach to scaling Ethereum. By utilizing a technology called “STARK,” it processes transactions off-chain through a method known as zero-knowledge rollups. This technique batches transactions together, validating them efficiently before recording them on the Ethereum mainnet. The result is faster transactions and lower costs for users. Developers are also embracing Starknet’s unique coding language, Cairo, which makes building on the network more accessible. Since launching its first block in November 2021, Starknet has showcased significant innovation in making blockchain technology more scalable and user-friendly. The introduction of the STRK token adds an extra layer of functionality to the network. STRK is used not only for transaction fees but also for staking and governance, allowing users to participate actively in the network’s future. This aligns with Starknet’s vision of transparency and community involvement. In a market where efficiency and scalability are increasingly important, Starknet’s approach sets it apart from traditional solutions. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, projects like Starknet highlight the potential for more streamlined and cost-effective transactions, making them noteworthy developments in the current market landscape. Worldcoin (WLD) Worldcoin (WLD) is a bold project aiming to reshape digital identity and promote financial inclusion worldwide. Launched in 2023 and co-founded by Sam Altman, it uses AI and biometric technology—specifically eye scans—to create unique, secure digital IDs. By leveraging the innovative Orb device for iris-based identity verification, Worldcoin seeks to provide fair wealth distribution and universal access to the digital economy. With over two million users already onboard and plans to value the token at $3 billion, it’s positioning itself as a major player in the crypto space. Worldcoin’s potential lies in its ambitious vision of an inclusive digital economy supported by cutting-edge technology. The fixed supply of 10 billion WLD tokens suggests a model aiming for stability and widespread adoption. While privacy concerns over biometric data use have led to investigations in several countries, the surge in WLD’s value reflects strong market interest. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Worldcoin’s focus on identity verification and financial inclusion sets it apart. In the current market cycle, as digital identity becomes increasingly important, WLD offers a unique proposition that could attract those looking for innovation in the crypto world. Dymension (DYM) Dymension (DYM) is making waves with a new approach to blockchain technology. It offers a modular platform where developers can create and launch their own specialized Layer 2 rollups, known as RollApps. These RollApps aim to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more flexible. By building on the Cosmos SDK and using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol, Dymension ensures its platform can work smoothly with other blockchains. This focus on interoperability sets it apart and helps connect different blockchain networks. Despite entering a crowded field, Dymension has caught attention with a big move: a 70 million DYM token airdrop. This shows strong initial interest and could boost its user base. However, for Dymension to succeed, it needs more developers to build on its platform and a broader community to adopt it. Compared to other coins, Dymension’s innovative take on rollup technology and its use of the Cosmos framework give it an edge. In the current market, where scalability and interoperability are key trends, Dymension looks promising. Its unique approach could help it stand out and grow in the evolving blockchain landscape. Conclusion HFT, STRK, WLD, and DYM are strong low-cap projects with significant potential in the unfolding 2024 bull run.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 15:44:00

His recent comments on the XRP “army” have angered investors and led to a drop in the cryptocurrency’s price. On Sunday, Gasparino took to X (formerly Twitter) to dismiss the idea of an XRP army . He argued that it is simply early investors and insiders who want to see the altcoin’s price rise. XRP holders quickly fired back, accusing the journalist of bias and misrepresenting their community.

This decline was in sync with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which have shed billions in value this month. In an X post, Michael van de Poppe, a prominent crypto pundit with over 748,000 followers on X, said that Chainlink’s uptrend had just begun. He believes the coin is now in search of higher lows and that its valuation in Bitcoin terms remains significantly low. Request 02 – $LINK The uptrend has begun.

It has moved to the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level and fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average. Most notably, Chainlink price has formed a head and shoulders pattern, a common reversal signal. The current price is at the neckline of the H&S chart pattern. Historically, this formation often precedes further downside movement. As a result, the coin may continue to decline, with sellers targeting the next key support at $18, the 61.8% retracement point. A move below this level could push LINK to the psychological support level at $15. While Chainlink’s outlook for 2025 may remain bullish, its performance will largely depend on the overall trajectory of the crypto industry.

Renewed whale activity, improved network engagement, and bullish chart signals boost optimism for DOGE's value trajectory. As market sentiment shifts, Dogecoin again proves its staying power in the altcoin space. Could this meme coin achieve new heights and outperform expectations? Let’s dive into the possibilities. Rollblock Set for Another Price Increase Before New Year’s Day Rollblock (RBLK) is emerging as the most anticipated DeFi altcoin in 2025. Rollblock has launched the first decentralized gaming platform by introducing cutting-edge blockchain technology to online gaming, attracting significant attention. The project’s presale has already raised over $7.7 million, showcasing strong investor confidence in RBLK’s potential. Rollblock distinguishes itself by combining blockchain transparency with excitement. The platform has passed a SolidProof audit and secured an e-gaming license from Gaming Anjouan, underscoring its commitment to security. The platform encrypts all financial data and processes bets on-chain, protecting users from fraud and manipulation. Users can join Rollblock by signing up with an email, purchasing RBLK tokens with compatible cryptocurrencies, and accessing its casino games. The platform boasts over 7,000 AI-driven casino games, including classics and innovative Web3 titles like KENO and Max Car Racing. A major draw for investors is Rollblock’s plan to transform the $450 billion gambling market by sharing up to 30% of weekly casino profits with RBLK holders. The platform will use these profits to buy back tokens, increasing the price. Of the purchased tokens, 60% will be burned to create scarcity, while 40% will be distributed to stakers, offering APYs of 30% or more. Currently, RBLK tokens are available for $0.044 in stage 9 of the presale. Analysts predict another price jump by New Year’s Day. With expectations of delivering 880% returns to early investors, Rollblock is set to dominate the DeFi space and redefine online gaming before its launch in Q1 2025. Dogecoin Poised to Reach the $1 Price Mark Soon Dogecoin’s price dropped 22.41% on Friday amid intensive selling activity. However, bullish signals appear on its chart, suggesting an upward trend. Whale interest in Dogecoin has spiked, as large transactions have surged by 41% during the last 24 hours. Currently, Dogecoin is priced at $0.316, reflecting a 2.68% intraday gain—the memecoin trades above its 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages, showing positive momentum. The growing optimism has boosted Dogecoin’s network activity, pushing Open Interest beyond $2 million. Despite a slight intraday dip of 1.85%, bringing the price to $0.3287, analysts remain confident that Dogecoin could soon reach the $1 mark. Dogecoin’s appeal this altcoin season is driven by whale activity. Recently, whales purchased 250 million DOGE, worth $80 million, signaling strong confidence in Dogecoin’s potential. Such large-scale investments often indicate a belief in long-term growth, making Dogecoin a focal point for investors. Rollblock to Surpass Dogecoin Soon Analysts believe Dogecoin is preparing for a significant rally, likely outpacing most memecoinsin gains. Meanwhile, Rollblock is gaining attention as a potential competitor, poised to surpass Dogecoin. Rollblock’s blockchain-powered GameFi project combines real utility with scalability, offering investors a compelling alternative with long-term growth prospects.

Stock index futures suggest continued struggles for equities, following a 1.1% drop in the S&P 500 at the end of last week. According to economists, 2024 has been a record-setting year for Wall Street. The S&P 500 reached 57 record highs, placing it among the top five years for all-time records. Over the past year, the Nasdaq Composite has gained over 31%, the S&P 500 has climbed 25%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen a more modest 14%. However, rising bond yields are presenting challenges for equities. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield closed last week at its highest level in seven months. Since September, yields have jumped nearly a full percentage point, even after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate. Treasury yields could pressure stocks Analysts attribute the rising bond yields to concerns over President-elect Donald Trump’s tariff and tax policies. These policies could fuel inflation and expand the federal deficit, increasing bond supply and suppressing prices. Julian Emanuel, a strategist at Evercore ISI, warns that long-term yields could continue to exert medium-term pressure on equities, even if broader economic conditions remain favorable. “ Rising long-term bond yields pose the biggest challenge to the bull market as 2025 begins ,” Emanuel wrote in a recent note, pointing to increased equity market volatility following the Federal Reserve’s December meeting. The bond market is reaching a peak while the crude oil market finds a bottom, both driven largely by inflation. Bitcoin positions itself as a key player due to its decentralized nature and limited supply, offering an alternative to the depreciation of traditional assets. As… — GG (@LuillyDRR) December 27, 2024 Emanuel emphasized that while bond yields may pull back slightly in the short term due to elevated Treasury short positions and easing geopolitical tensions, the medium-term outlook remains challenging. The interplay between rising bond yields and equity valuations will be crucial in determining market trends in early 2025. The strategist also predicts that a 10-year Treasury yield of 4.5% is manageable for equities, but a breach of 4.75% could trigger a deeper correction. Notably, stocks have shown resilience in periods of rising yields, advancing 117% since the bond market trough in 2020. However, during periods when yields surpassed 4.5% or 4.75%, equities posted negative returns of -2.1% and -3.7%, respectively. Corporate earnings bolstered by economic resilience In 2024, earnings growth extended beyond the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants, with the other 493 S&P 500 companies exiting their earnings recession. According to FactSet data, S&P 500 earnings are projected to grow 15% year over year in 2025. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist, notes that this earnings growth will likely sustain the bull market. “ The weight of evidence suggests the primary market trend remains higher, driven by earnings growth in 2025, ” Lerner stated in his market outlook. The broader U.S. economy has also demonstrated resilience. November retail sales exceeded expectations, GDP growth remains above trend at 3%, and the unemployment rate continues to hover around 4%. While still elevated, inflation has shown signs of moderation, giving investors hope for a “soft landing” where prices stabilize without significant job losses. Market tailwinds and headwinds into 2025 Several tailwinds are supporting market optimism heading into 2025. Record corporate profits are expected for a second consecutive year, with net profit margins projected to remain nearly 12%. Sectors beyond technology, including health care, industrials, and materials, are anticipated to see profit increases in the high teens. However, headwinds are where economists are expressing little to no optimism. Federal Reserve officials now project the federal funds rate to fall to 3.9% in 2025, an increase from their earlier September estimate of 3.4%. While the Fed delivered a substantial 50 basis point rate cut in September, most adjustments over the past year have been in smaller 25 basis point increments. The latest projections suggest the central bank anticipates two more rate cuts in 2025, down from the four cuts previously forecast in September. BREAKING: Fed projections imply 50 basis points of rate cuts in 2025, another 50 bps in 2026. — unusual_whales (@unusual_whales) December 18, 2024 If interest rates are not accordingly cut in 2025, given the Federal Reserve’s commitment to combating inflation, it may risk a policy error that could potentially harm the labor market. Additionally, analysts reckon that the Trump administration’s policies , while business-friendly, could introduce growth challenges through higher tariffs. Tech stocks, which have driven much of the market’s gains, face potential stagnation as investors grow wary of excessive spending on artificial intelligence without corresponding earnings growth.

Imagine that investors of established projects like Solana and Cardano know about this new altcoin and are jumping on it. Now imagine that this next big crypto token is still available, and you can get it, but only for a limited time. You’d jump on it too, right? Well, so will many other investors. This article introduces Remittix, explains its growing stature, and why no savvy investor who knows about it should miss out on it. Why Remittix is a crypto investor magnet Remittix is a PayFi crypto solution. This means that it makes crypto payments smooth and easy. But Remittix is not just any other crypto payment solution; it is intertwined with innovation that is taking it to the top of the PayFi industry. Specifically, Remittix allows anyone to send fiat to any bank account in the world via their crypto wallet. It takes the cryptocurrency in your wallet, converts it to fiat, and then sends it to any bank account across the globe via local payment networks. This is a groundbreaking use case that crypto enthusiasts have been yearning for. Apart from banking the unbanked, it fosters genuine adoption of cryptocurrencies and takes it to the next level. Unlike the dinosaurs of cross-border remittances, Remittix is fast, secure, and cheap. There’s a flat fee for each transaction and no FX costs or any other hidden charges. For the crypto investor, Remittix offers staking rewards up to 30% APY. There’s also a competition where ten winners will each claim $25,000 in USDT, and there are other numerous mouth-watering incentives for participating in the Remittix community. This new altcoin is destined to be a crypto bigwig, and it is set to rally explosively on its way to the top. Solana keeps struggling post crypto liquidations A few weeks ago, the crypto market crashed, and coins like Solana are still reeling from the aftershock. Trading above $240 before the price correction, SOL is now around the $180 price level. Even worse, Solana hasn’t had a tangible resurgence since the drop, causing SOL holders to start worrying about its future. Solana remains a massive crypto project and could rise again. But ambitious investors are already jumping ship and leaving Solana. For these guys, Remittix is a worthy option, and most of them are taking the plunge. Resilient Cardano succumbs to market pressure Like Solana, Cardano also shed a significant portion of its value after the market crashed. However, ADA has been resilient- up to the last fortnight at least. Dropping from $1.3, ADA is now trading around $0.8, which isn’t so bad in relation to other coins. Nevertheless, there are several wantaway ADA investors as well. Cardano hasn’t had a decent performance in the last half of December, and with the way things are, it is more likely to drop further. Don’t miss out on the next big crypto Apart from being a surging star, RTX offers bigger potential than Solana and Cardano. It also has a more attractive entry-level price of $0.0167. Given that RTX is set to fetch early investors a profit of 10,000% joining its roaring presale seems like a no-brainer.

With ADA demonstrating resilience and a steady recovery, many investors are viewing it as a promising choice for portfolio diversification. However, the market’s true bright spot is 1Fuel OFT, whose presale is capturing the attention of early investors eager to secure the token at its initial price. 1Fuel OFT’s innovative DeFi featuresand robust market potential make it a top contender for the next crypto bull run. Bitcoin Experiences Shocking Drop Bitcoin has always been known as the best crypto to buy, and recently achieved a historic all-time high of $106,147 in December. But it has seen a sharp decline, causing unease among investors. The cryptocurrency has recovered 0.33% in the past 24 hours but is still down 2.32% in the past week, settling at $$94,778.67. This drop from its all time high has caused many investors to be concerned about whether Bitcoin would perform well in 2025. Analysts have projected that Bitcoin’s value would go as high as $180,000 by the end of 2025. Investors continue to manage Bitcoin and other altcoins in trusted platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. ADA Attracts Investor Spotlight Ahead of 2025 As Bitcoin dominance in the crypto market has reduced, Cardano has been drawing a lot of attention from investors that want promising opportunities. Recently, it finally achieved an all-time high of $1.231. Analysts have set varied price targets for the token, with conservative estimates around $4 and more optimistic forecasts reaching as high as $7. ADA’s prospects for 2025 are driven by the Hydra scaling solution and rising real-world adoption. Platforms like MetaMask and Trust Wallet make it easy for investors to manage and stake ADA alongside other tokens. But traders are also diverting their attention to some promising tokens in presale for the ever-changing crypto space. Investors Rush to Accumulate 1Fuel OFT in Presale As Bitcoin dominance wanes, investors are turning their attention to tokens in presale like 1Fuel OFT. The ongoing presale of 1Fuel has become a beacon of investor interest, with stage 2 already over 67% complete. In a remarkable show of demand, more than 90 million tokens have been sold in record time, raising over $900,000. 1Fuel stands out in the competitive altcoin market, primarily due to its innovative features embedded in its decentralized exchange (DEX) wallet. Unlike MetaMask and Trust Wallet, which often require multiple wallets and tokens for cross-chain transactions, 1Fuel offers a streamlined solution. Additionally, its inbuilt privacy mixer, cold storage options and crypto card for real-world payments, provide a comprehensive ecosystem for digital asset management. These advanced functionalities, combined with its promise of 1000% growth upon listing in 2025, position 1Fuel OFT as the best crypto to buy. 1Fuel is expected to change the way DEX wallets are used, especially since it offers more advanced features like cross-chain swaps and inbuilt privacy mixers. These are features that are not currently offered by traditional wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. 1Fuel is expected to lead the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation.

DOGE’s Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE), the very first meme coin, continues to hold its own relatively in the market. The network operation is mostly community-driven and decentralized; DOGE has attracted partnerships and collaborations with different firms and organizations, targeting Dogecoin’s recognition and integration into current payment systems and platforms. DOGE’s current standing gives it an edge over younger entrants such as PEPE. While DOGE’s growth rate has recently slowed—leaving investors wondering if it can repeat its previous performance—the coin has started to gain momentum with substantial whale buy-ins. DOGE has just moved from -5.2% to $0.31; the trading rate going from -13.49% to $2.69b. 1FUEL: The DeFi Game Changer While meme coins rely heavily on hype, 1Fuel is built on substance . Its presale numbers—rapidly increasing—are a testament to the substance that the new coin offers. 1Fuel stresses user privacy and security while maintaining the wallet’s flexibility and cross-chain functionality. The platform uses Hashed Time-Locked Contracts (HTLCs) to protect transactions, ensuring that they are executed systematically, adding a layer of security that manual cross-chain transactions lack. 1Fuel is positioned as the best cryptocurrency to buy today as its market trajectory shows that it could produce the long-term growth that many meme tokens struggle to attain. Furthermore, its utility-driven tokenomics and vision for decentralized finance make it the best new cryptocurrency for investors looking beyond speculative trends. With its presale momentum rising, 1Fuel is more than just another token but a balanced investment option with long-term potential. Conclusion PEPE and DOGE have generated momentum in the cryptocurrency industry, transforming early adopters into millionaires. However, their overreliance on market trends and community hype raises concerns about their sustainability. For those looking for a well-rounded option, 1Fuel distinguishes itself as the best cryptocurrency to buy today given its emphasis on pragmatic usability and innovation. The platform’s features—including its cryptocurrency wallet and staking programs—make it just the right fit for investors aiming to balance risk, reward and prolonged sustainability.

At this point, Foundry USA Pool attracted market attention by refunding the large amount of transaction fees that were mistakenly paid. BTC Block 875475 was mined on the Foundry USA Pool, where a user paid 8.18 BTC for a transaction, which is 91,127 times the required fee. The mining pool, which did not remain indifferent to this situation, reached out to the user and refunded the excess fee. Foundry USA Pool said in a statement that this refund does not affect payments for its regular customers and that its payment system does not take into account the three highest and three lowest transaction fees each day. “On December 19, Foundry USA Pool mined block 875475, which contained a Bitcoin transaction in which the user inadvertently paid a fee of 8.18 BTC, which was 91,127 times more than was required to be included in the block. Our Foundry team contacted the affected individual and after careful consideration, decided to refund the overage fee. We have received many messages from across the industry and would like to extend our thanks to everyone who reached out to us on behalf of their users. We would like to point out that this decision was made after a comprehensive evaluation and that we will continue to address such situations on a case-by-case basis.” This incident involving Foundry USA Pool is not an isolated incident in Bitcoin mining. It is the second such incident in recent months, following a similar incident in which Antpool was forced to refund $3 million worth of Bitcoin transaction fees after a user error led to the highest fee ever paid on the Bitcoin network in November 2023. Because in November 2023, another mining pool, Antpool, also returned the extraordinarily high transaction fee of 83.6 BTC, which was approximately $ 3.1 million at that time, to the user. *This is not investment advice.

And it's not just because of its impressive concept or bold promises: the project is already backed by an impressive army of investors, a well-thought-out ecosystem and real cases of interaction with the traditional financial world. Let's break down exactly why NST could be a game changer for the market by 2025 and why it makes sense to join the pre-sale now. A revolutionary solution for real assets What most often keeps large financial institutions and ordinary people from diving into the crypto world? First of all, it's the lack of a clear mechanism for linking tokens to real world assets (Real World Assets, or RWAs). Often blockchain projects remain only on paper, with no direct application in the offline economy. Nebula Stride solves this problem by offering tools to digitize real assets. Imagine real estate, gold or other valuables that can be tokenized and exchanged without intermediaries, avoiding unnecessary formalities. It is predicted that the RWA market could reach astronomical levels by 2030, and Nebula Stride is ready to lead the way today. Why Nebula Stride? 1. Multi-chain infrastructure. The project is initially built with support for the most popular networks: Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon and others. For investors and developers, this means freedom of action, lower commissions and no bottlenecks when transferring assets. 2. QuickMint Bot and NFT platform. Not everyone knows how to create and issue tokens or NFTs on their own. QuickMint Bot simplifies this process to a few clicks, which opens doors to new users and accelerates community growth. 3. Community and referral programs. The secret to any crypto startup's success is a strong fan base. Nebula Stride attracts 10,000 to 15,000 new members per day through referrals, incentivizing further development of the ecosystem and increasing the value of the token. 4. Reliability and Transparency. The company has been audited by CertiK, one of the leading players in cybersecurity for blockchain. This means that the project code has been checked for vulnerabilities and meets high requirements. All of these points add up to one coherent picture: Nebula Stride is building an infrastructure that provides real benefits to participants. Because of this, NST can become a long-term asset, not just a temporary trend. Prospects by 2025: a realistic scenario Some forecasts indicate that in 12-18 months the price of NST may reach $50, and by 2027 it may exceed the $100 mark. Of course, every investment decision comes with risks, but the Nebula Stride team is working hard to further develop technology and increase public trust, which reduces the likelihood of unfavorable scenarios. How to get started? The first step is to visit the official Nebula Stride website, where you can find all the necessary information about the project, the roadmap, partner programs and the current token price during the presale. There you can also find links to Telegram, Discord and other channels where users discuss the latest news and share their ideas. Be sure to check out the community: you will see that Nebula Stride brings together not just investors, but people who truly believe in the potential of decentralized finance and the real integration of blockchain into our daily lives.

But it is already obvious that Nebula Stride (NST) has a serious chance not only to gain a foothold in the market, but also to set new standards in the field of DeFi and tokenization of real assets. If you're ready to move with the emerging ecosystem, benefit from price appreciation, and participate in creating the future of finance, the NST presale could be the chance you don't want to miss. There is an era ahead of us in which projects that can combine traditional finance and blockchain technology will play a major role. And all indications are that Nebula Stride is poised to become one of those engines of progress that will be at the top of the rankings and on the lists of the most promising investments in 2025.

TETHER ADDS ANOTHER $700M BITCOIN TO RESERVES SOURCE: ARKHAM pic.twitter.com/jhj4jIEh5o — Arkham (@arkham) December 30, 2024 Notably, this is the largest transaction sent to Tether’s strategic bitcoin reserve since March 2024, when it transferred 8,888.88 BTC. The firm also sent 8,888.88 BTC to the fund on the last day of 2023. Currently, Tether Bitcoin reserves holds a total of 82,983 BTC. The firm accumulated this funds for $2.99 billion at an average price of approximately $36,125. These Bitcoin holdigns are currently worth $7.68 billion. Tether’s Increasing Efforts To Diversify In May 2023, Tether announced that it would start allocating as much as 15% of its profits into bitcoin and now holds over $7.6 billion in BTC. This move was aimed at diversifying the company’s holdings during a year when it began printing cash. Lately, Tether has made mindful efforts to diversify its holdings and invest its capital in emerging sectors like AI, bitcoin mining and decentralized communications. Besides, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has expressed ambitions to venture into other technological sectors, including artificial intelligence and energy. As per a previous report, Tether could bring some of its artificial intelligence plans to fruition by early 2025. Delisting Concerns Tether faces growing concerns as there is a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in the market around USDT’s legality in Europe once the MiCA rules are enforced. With the full implementation of the Markets In Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation today, there are increasing concerns over the potential delisting of Tether. Amidst growing concerns, USDT’s market cap fell from $140.5 billion to $138 billion over the past week, declining by $2 billion, which is the largest drop in a year of continuous growth.

Bitcoin, after hitting an all-time high of $108,135 on December 17, has seen a retracement towards $93,000. Similarly, Dogecoin has faced pressure, dipping from its recent highs near $0.48 to settle just above $0.30 at the time of writing. According to technical analysis of both cryptocurrencies, an interesting correlation has emerged that points to Dogecoin surging to $5 in the next few months. The 800-Day Trend: A Case For Dogecoin’s Correlation With Bitcoin Bitcoin and Dogecoin have one of the biggest correlations among cryptocurrencies, particularly during market cycle transitions. Bitcoin has always led inflows and outflows into the crypto market, and Dogecoin has historically mirrored its price trends very closely. Related Reading: Doji Formation On Bitcoin Chart Suggests BTC Could See 2 Months Of Upside In The New Year As pointed out by a crypto analyst on social media platform X, these patterns often extend beyond immediate price movements. For example, the number of days between Bitcoin’s cyclical bottoms and Dogecoin’s subsequent peaks has shown a consistent rhythm. Particularly, technical analysis shows that there’s been a consistent pattern of approximately 800 days between Bitcoin’s bottom and Dogecoin’s next major peak. The historical data supporting this theory is compelling. This first time this pattern showed up was in 2017, when the Dogecoin price peaked 868 days after Bitcoin’s bottom of the preceding bear phase in 2015. Again, the 2021 bull rally exhibited this same phenomenon, with Dogecoin peaking at its current all-time high of $0.7316 875 days after Bitcoin’s bottom in 2019. What Lies Ahead For Dogecoin Price? The ongoing market cycle appears to be following a similar trajectory. Bitcoin reached its most recent bottom at $15,422 during the first half of 2023, following a long bear market that saw significant declines across the crypto industry in 2022 and early 2023. Since then, Bitcoin has entered a new bullish phase, gaining momentum in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024. Related Reading: El Salvador Bitcoin Buying Spree Continues, BTC Holdings Now At 6,000 Keeping in mind the 800-day trend, Dogecoin’s next major peak could align with a timeline of approximately 800 days from Bitcoin’s 2023 bottom. This projection places Dogecoin’s potential peak around March or April 2024. In terms of price targets, the analysis provides an optimistic outlook for Dogecoin. Based on historical price performance and the scale of previous rallies, a price of $5 has been identified as a realistic target for Dogecoin around the projected timeline. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.32, down by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. If this trend repeats itself, Dogecoin’s price could soar by 1,460 % from its current levels to new all-time highs. While this seems ultra bullish, it pales in comparison to other predictions of Dogecoin price peaks. Several analysts have speculated that Dogecoin could hit as high as $20 in 2025.

But first some background on how Boltz Pro works. According to Kilian, a co-founder of Boltz , the balances of Boltz’s wallets and Lightning channels are constantly shifting, especially as the volume and velocity of sats flowing through the platform increases. So, the idea behind Boltz Pro is that users can help provide liquidity for swaps in the event that Boltz’s balances run low. Here’s an example: Let’s say Boltz is running short on its base chain bitcoin supply. Boltz will set its dynamic fee to -0.15% for bitcoin-to-Lightning swaps. This means that users get paid a 0.15% fee. Once Boltz has seen enough volume flow in this direction and Boltz’s bitcoin wallet is refilled, fees will return to normal. You won’t need to sign up to use Boltz Pro. Just stay on the lookout at https://pro.boltz.exchange/ for when fees on the platform flip negative and take advantage of the opportunity. And keep in mind that Boltz never takes custody of user funds, so you get to earn these sats in a non-custodial manner. This is now the first place I’ll check when I’m looking to move sats between the base chain and Lightning or vice versa, as I’d much rather be paid to use Boltz than pay to use it. Kudos to Boltz for enabling users to make a few extra sats for helping them out. This article is a Take .

Bitcoin ( BTC ) has dropped 1.8% in the past 24 hours to $91,800, a price not seen since Dec. 5, the day it broke through $100,000 for the first time. The largest cryptocurrency has fallen more than 14% from its Dec. 17 record of $108,278. Ether ( ETH ) has lost less, falling 0.7% to $3,320, though it’s now 17% below its December highs, and still has not surpassed the record $4,820 it hit in 2021. Solana ( SOL ) is also proving a little stronger than bitcoin, with the SOL/BTC ratio up 0.35% today. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is also in the red, sliding 3.74%. Ripple ( XRP ) and Stellar ( XRM ) have taken the biggest hits, down 6% and 6.3% respectively, while the most resilient coin besides ether has been litecoin ( LTC ), which is 1.9% lower. Stocks of crypto-related companies also took a hit. MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Coinbase (COIN) fell 7% and 5.3%, respectively and major bitcoin mining firms like MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) have dropped more than 7%. The selling pressure is partially caused by investors cashing out after bitcoin shot up more than 117% this year. Profit-taking currently exceeds $1.2 billion on a seven-day moving average, and while that is significantly less than the Dec. 11 peak of $4.0 billion, it’s still much more than usual. Additionally, the lion's share of profits is being taken by investors who have held bitcoin for many years. Macroeconomics are also weighing on the market, with the U.S. Chicago PMI — which measures the performance of the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sector in the Chicago area — flashing its lowest reading since May, suggesting an economic slowdown is underway. Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate policy going into 2025 isn’t helping, since the U.S. central bank has signaled it will pause rate cuts until at least March. The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, slated for Jan. 20, may also be playing a role. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones are down more than 1%. ""The market exceeded expectations in 2024, but signs of exhaustion signaled the need for consolidation,"" Joe Carlasare, partner at Amundsen Davis, told CoinDesk. ""Looking ahead to 2025, I’m optimistic but expect the path to diverge from consensus, as markets often do. Bitcoin’s adoption continues to grow, and I anticipate it will generally move in line with traditional markets. If the U.S. avoids a significant growth slowdown, bitcoin should perform well, though the ride may be bumpier than in 2024.""",Markets|Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|SOL|MicroStrategy|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-30 17:02:42

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 17:04:00

Seven leading crypto executives weigh in on what lies ahead, from the DeFi resurgence to regulatory changes and emerging markets adoption. Michael Harvey, head of franchise trading at Galaxy Digital, predicts that decentralized finance (DeFi) will experience a major revival. After explosive growth in 2020 and subsequent dormancy, DeFi is now gaining traction with improved regulations and user experiences. Next-gen protocols like Spark and Ethena are also on the way, as are key players like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. Harvey noted Solana’s growing dominance, noting that decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes frequently exceed Ethereum’s. Bitcoin is also joining the DeFi wave, and efforts are underway to leverage its security for programmable use cases, including Ordinals and the expanding BTCFi ecosystem. Amar Kuchinad, global CEO of Copper.co, predicts that 2025 will be a pivotal year for traditional financial institutions experimenting with blockchain. He predicts a rise in fragmented asset baskets such as tokenized government bond funds like BlackRock’s BUIDL. Kuchinad predicts that public blockchains will evolve from real-time consensus layers to periodic clearing systems, while private and hybrid chains will handle day-to-day operations. These changes could lead to faster payments, reduced risk, and increased capital efficiency. With Donald Trump in office, VALR CMO Ben Caselin expects nations to increasingly embrace Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset despite resistance. However, Caselin warns of an impending collapse due to speculative token issuance, likening it to reckless central bank money printing. Related News: Applauded Move from the Largest Bitcoin Mining Pool! $777K Error Compensated! Caselin also sees regional consolidation, with licensed national and continental exchanges leading the way in emerging markets, while unregulated global exchanges could decline. Morgan Krupetsky, head of corporate and capital markets at Ava Labs, predicts a surge in tokenized stocks, fixed income securities and other assets as businesses seek more efficient and transparent financial instruments. He believes regulatory changes like the repeal of SAB 121 could empower banks to adopt public blockchain infrastructure. Krupetsky also predicts that traditional companies will further blur the lines between traditional and digital finance by integrating blockchain technology, particularly in payments and supply chain management. Norris Wang, co-founder of Balance.fun, predicts that the stablecoin market will exceed $250 billion by the end of 2025, which will happen once stablecoins are recognized by regulators as hybrid instruments. Wang expects a balance between strict regulation of onshore stablecoins and pragmatic policies for offshore instruments. Wang also sees DeFi innovation accelerating, deeper integration between DeFi and fintech, and a resurgence of crypto talent in the US, solidifying New York’s role as a global crypto hub. Plume CEO Chris Yin noted the growing intersection of AI and crypto, noting that AI agents are driving new use cases, and he expects real-world assets like tokenized real estate and stablecoins to remain at the center of the crypto space and appeal to institutional adopters. Mohammad Raafi, CEO and co-founder of Fasset, points to high-growth markets like Indonesia and Pakistan as drivers of crypto adoption. Tokenized real estate and decentralized financial solutions are enabling global real estate investment and financial inclusion in regions with limited banking access. Raafi notes that more than 60% of new crypto wallets in 2024 will be created in emerging markets, and this trend is expected to increase in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Stablecoin growth on Binance reflects strong buying pressure and market stability. With $29B in reserves, liquidity remains strong, fueling confidence in 2025 markets. Binance, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has reached a significant milestone in its stablecoin reserves. The exchange now holds $31 billion in stablecoins, a dramatic increase from $7 billion in June 2023. This nearly fivefold jump highlights the growing liquidity and confidence in the digital asset market. Stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC, are essential for providing liquidity, ensuring stability, and facilitating smooth transactions during market volatility. This growth underscores Binance’s position as a leading platform in the crypto space.

According to Arkham monitoring data, Tether now holds 82,983 BTC worth $7.68 billion at current prices. The reserves were reportedly accumulated for $2.99 billion at an average price of approximately $36,125 per Bitcoin. This is the third instance this year where Tether has added to its Bitcoin holdings. Blockchain data reveals that in early 2024, the stablecoin issuer acquired 8,888 BTC, valued at $379 million, bringing its reserves to 66,465 BTC. The addition followed Tether’s announcement in May 2023 that it would use profits to purchase Bitcoin for its reserves and explore Bitcoin mining ventures. Tether continues Bitcoin accumulation as USDT supply declines In April 2024, Tether purchased another 8,888 BTC for $600 million, increasing its holdings to over 75,000 BTC at the time. This acquisition positioned Tether as the seventh-largest Bitcoin holder globally, an update uncovered through on-chain data rather than an official disclosure from the company. Tether bought another $650 million worth of BTC in Q1. They now own $5 billion in #Bitcoin 🤯 pic.twitter.com/22vc5dhelg — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) May 4, 2024 Tether had vowed to allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward purchasing Bitcoin starting this month. “ Bitcoin has consistently demonstrated its resilience, establishing itself as a long-term store of value with significant growth potential ,” said Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s Chief Technology Officer. He highlighted Bitcoin’s limited supply, decentralized framework, and increasing adoption as enough reasons for the largest crypto by market cap to attract institutional investors. While Tether continues to expand its Bitcoin reserves, its USDT stablecoin has experienced a sharp contraction. According to Coinmarketcap data, USDT’s circulating supply has dropped by more than $1.1 billion in the last seven days. Tether circulating supply drop in the last seven days | Source: Coinmarketcap. The drop could have been sparked by Tether’s hesitance to collaborate with Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) regulations. MiCA has directed exchanges to delist the stablecoin by the end of the year if Tether does not comply with the agency’s rules. As the most widely used stablecoin, USDT plays a critical role in providing liquidity across cryptocurrency markets. The reduced supply has diminished liquidity for Bitcoin transactions, causing a decrease in buying pressure. Bitcoin’s price has been hovering around $92,000, with trading volumes on the decline. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has fallen to 44.78, and the On-Balance-Volume (OBV), now at 90K, point to bearish sentiments and reduced market participation. European stablecoin market grows following regulatory clarity In Europe, the stablecoin landscape is evolving and fueled by regulatory clarity from MiCA. Tether’s decision to discontinue its EURt stablecoin has created opportunities for new entrants. Societe Generale’s SG-Forge recently launched its Euro-backed stablecoin for retail investors, while financial institutions like Oddo BHF SCA, Revolut, and BBVA are exploring similar initiatives. Jean-Marc Stenger, CEO of SG-Forge, confirmed that discussions are underway with multiple banks about partnerships and white-labeling technology for stablecoin issuance. Despite the heavy regulatory requirements, Stenger expressed confidence that more banks would enter the space. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, are simultaneously exploring deposit tokens. These tokens are tied to bank accounts but differ from stablecoins in that they often cannot be transferred across institutions. JPMorgan’s Kinexys unit predicts that interest in bank-issued stablecoins will accelerate in the next three years, driven by customer demand and profitability prospects. However, not all financial institutions are eager to enter the stablecoin market. Xapo Bank in Gibraltar, for instance, has chosen not to issue its own stablecoin, citing Tether’s dominance. Instead, the bank aims to integrate blockchain efficiency with traditional banking security, allowing customers to deposit stablecoins into savings accounts without competing directly in the issuance space. “ We don’t want to be in that space, we want to be the tool that allows the efficiency of the blockchain network to interact with the legacy, security of your bank account ,” Joey Garcia, Xapo Bank’s chief legal officer, remarked.

Our Jito price prediction expects the JTO price to record a maximum of $5.53 in 2024. In 2030, we expect the JTO price to achieve $57.27. In December 2023, the Jito (JTO) token airdrop garnered significant attention for the Solana blockchain , which had been facing challenging times. The event also highlighted the importance of liquid staking on Solana while empowering holders to influence platform governance. Based on these developments, we’ve compiled our Jito price prediction, explored the factors behind these forecasts, and provided insights into the role and utility of the JTO token.

However, if the JITO price successfully breaks above $3.47, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $4.24. JTO/USD chart. Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, JITO price may drop below the immediate support line at $3.08, resulting in a correction to $2.63. Is Jito a good investment? For enthusiasts within the Solana community, the introduction of JTO marks a significant event, as it empowers users to govern one of the network’s largest liquid staking protocols. Undoubtedly, those engaged with the protocol will be keenly interested in the token. Another critical factor influencing predictions for Jito’s price in 2024 is the progress of the Jito protocol itself. While there’s no specific roadmap to anticipate upcoming enhancements, unveiling a future roadmap or declaration of forthcoming developments could significantly boost interest in the token. Why is the JTO price down today? JTO’s price lost its momentum around $3.5, resulting in a minor correction. Sellers are currently defending a surge above the $4 mark. Will JTO’s price recover? If JTO’s price faces buying demand around the current price level, we might see a strong rebound and JTO might surge toward $4. Will JTO reach $10? JTO price might reach the $10 mark in 2024 if buying demand surges and Jito attracts altcoin investors. However, our JTO price prediction states it might reach the $10 level by 2026. Will JTO price reach $100? Due to the effort of the Solana community, JITO Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the JITO (JTO) Coin will reach $100 soon, which is a short-term target. Is JTO a good long-term investment? JTO tokens have gained popularity thanks to strong community support through airdrops, benefiting the Solana ecosystem. However, conducting thorough research into their long-term potential is crucial to determine if they represent a viable long-term investment. Recent news/opinion on JTO news Solana-based Jito is set for its biggest token to unlock on December 7, with 135.71 million JTO tokens valued at approximately $521 million. This release, equivalent to about 103% of the current circulating supply, will be allocated to core contributors and investors. Jito price prediction December 2024 Over the last few days, JTO coin prices have aimed to surge above crucial Fib levels. If the BTC price aims for a move above $100K this month, we might see a solid surge in the JTO price. According to technical analysis, the JTO price might record a maximum level of $4.2 and a minimum of $2.8, with an average value of $3.1 throughout December. Jito price prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high Jito Price Prediction December 2024 $2.8 $3.1 $4.2 Jito price prediction 2024 The effects of Bitcoin Halving typically appear 12-18 months afterward, but 2024 might see a different trend due to heightened institutional interest and improved macroeconomic factors. During the JTO airdrop, the token was available on major exchanges except Kraken, leaving one significant listing announcement to excite traders. However, this impact is likely minor. Progress on the Jito protocol is a critical factor influencing the 2024 Jito price forecast. While there isn’t a clear roadmap, announcing future developments could boost interest in the token. Based on technical analysis and forecast data, the projected minimum price of Jito in 2024 is $4.86. The price could climb to a maximum of $5.53, with an expected average of around $5.05. Jito price prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high Jito Price Prediction 2024 $4.86 $5.05 $5.53 Jito price prediction 2025-2030 Year Minimum Price ($) Average Price ($) Maximum Price ($) 2025 7.14 7.34 8.56 2026 10.72 11.08 12.61 2027 14.94 15.49 18.79 2028 22.55 23.17 26.05 2029 33.51 34.67 39.75 2030 46.60 47.99 57.27 Jito price prediction 2025 According to JTO tokenomics, additional Jito tokens will be released at the close of 2024 and the start of 2025, continuing throughout the year. This increase is likely to exert downward pressure on the value of Jito crypto. However, 2025 is also expected to showcase the significant impact of the Bitcoin Halving, which could propel crypto markets and tokens to new all-time highs, potentially boosting the Jito token price. A comprehensive technical analysis of past pricing trends suggests that in 2025, Jito is anticipated to have a minimum price of $7.14. Its maximum price could reach $8.56, with an expected average trading value of $7.34.

Bitdeer stands out with its all-in-one Bitcoin mining model, including self-hosting, cloud mining, ASIC hardware, and hosting services, ensuring year-round revenue. The company is expanding its capacity, targeting 2540 MW by 2026, with significant projects in Norway, Ohio, and Bhutan, aligning with its HPC and AI diversification. Despite high R&D costs, Bitdeer maintains strong short-term liquidity and is poised for revenue growth with the commercial rollout of SEALMINER machines in 2025. Bitdeer ( BTDR) has shown impressive performance in this Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) market cycle, being one of the new entrants into the publicly traded Bitcoin miner list, having made its market debut just last year. BTDR is up 233% since I last covered it in June with a “buy” rating. My “buy” rating in June was buoyed by the company's vertical integration strategy through the development of its proprietary ASIC mining hardware, known as the SEALMINER. Its steady capacity expansion, and the company's diversification into HPC and AI hosting. Miners' stock price Dec 4 to December 27 (Seeking Alpha) Among the Bitcoin miners, Bitdeer has recently shown a type of momentum that isn't a fluke. Since Bitcoin hit the very important $100,000 psychological level on December 4, Bitdeer has led the gains among publicly traded Bitcoin miners - a stark opposite of when I covered it in June at a time it lagged in YTD gains among miners. Bitdeer is up 47% since Bitcoin crossed that key milestone for the first time. BTDR has defied the Bitcoin-driven volatility that other Bitcoin stocks have been experiencing. Mining peers like Mara Holdings ( MARA ), Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), Hut 8 Corp. ( HUT ), Core Scientific ( CORZ ), IREN Limited ( IREN ), and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) have all recorded negative returns (see the chart above) since Bitcoin decreased from the $100k mark, now trading around $93,000; however, BTDR remains defiant. BTDR is exhibiting the characteristics of a strong growth stock, going to 2025. Strengths for Bitdeer Going Into 2025 The crypto community anticipates 2025 to be a transformative year for Bitcoin and crypto in general. The newly elected U.S. President, if true to campaign promises, will be creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. And the creation of this reserve is a main catalyst that most Bitcoin investors are hoping for, as this will give Bitcoin more legitimacy and increase demand for the asset. If this happens, the positive effect on well-positioned Bitcoin-linked businesses will be enormous. And how well is Bitdeer positioned going into 2025 to leverage Bitcoin bull market momentum? Here are some factors I’d consider. Bitdeer- The Most Diversified Bitcoin Miner Bitdeer continues to stand out among the miners today both in its operations model and its price chart. As of today, Bitdeer is one of the few miners that can be considered an “all-in-one” provider of Bitcoin mining products and services. Bitdeer has a foothold across all the Bitcoin mining business models - self-hosting, cloud mining, hosting services, ASIC hardware manufacture and sales, and is also diversifying into HPC and AI. This level of diversification will create an all-year-round sales improvement for Bitdeer in 2025. When hosting services demand is low, those resources can be migrated for use in self-hosting. When Bitcoin price takes a dip, revenue from HPC (if it eventually kicks off fully in 2025) could help offset that from mining. The propriety hardware Bitdeer has been building will also be available for commercial sale, opening new stream for revenue for the miner. Expanding Capacity Bitdeer seems ready for all aspects of mining and hosting business, with 895 MW total capacity currently and a target of 2540 MW capacity by 2026. An additional 1,100 MW of power capacity is expected to go online in 2025. The company is advancing the construction of a 175 MW data center in Norway, with approximately 40 MW expected to be operational by the end of 2024. A 221 MW data center is under development in Ohio, with construction anticipated to be completed in 2025. A 500 MW data center project commenced in March this year in Bhutan, with completion expected in mid-2025. The expansion aligns with the company's diversification into HPC and AI. The 1,100 MW of electricity going online in 2025 will accelerate Bitdeer’s hashrate capacity expansion as well as the HPC service. Bitdeer is looking to achieve over 40 EH/s hashrate under management capacity in 2025 with its proprietary SEALMINER machines. Based on the company's latest reports , the SEALMINER A1 is at the mass production stage and commercial sales of the A2 machines will kick off in Q1 next year. 3.7 EH/s of the A1 machines were being mass-produced as of the end of Q3. 0.1 EH/s of the A1 machines is already energized and 0.4 EH/s delivered for installation, as of the end of Q3. Bitdeer's energy capacity expansion and self-mining expansion are progressing on the same timeline. Having both the power capacity and self-mining hashrate deployed at the same timeline means that the new mining machines will be immediately operational once deployed, helping Bitdeer achieve better efficiency. New Sales Pipeline and Solid Short-Term Liquidity Despite weak financials in the most recent quarter (Q3 2024), Bitdeer has managed its balance sheet prudently. In Q3, Bitdeer saw very poor margins. Gross profit was a mere $2.8 million of the $62 million reported revenue - which represented a 4.5% gross margin. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $8.5 million. The financials were hampered by high operating expenses which mainly consisted of R&D costs. The high operating expenses in Q3 were due to R&D costs of $24.8 million related to the one-off development expense of the SEAL02 chip and amortization expense of intangible assets related to acquisition of ASIC design firm Freechain Inc. Bitdeer has managed to keep its short-term liquidity position on its balance sheet attractive, despite the high R&D costs and the effects that the Bitcoin halving has had on its business. Bitdeer still maintains a positive equity position of $520.7 million in the short term, and $291.3 million in cash and 430 Bitcoin held. Data by YCharts Bitdeer’s R&D expenses have truly been on the high side in 2024. But now that the commercial roll-out of the SEALMINER machines and chips is drawing near, there should be an increase in revenue generation and better margins once the machines hit the market. Sales from these machines should be able to offset future operating expenses related to the mining machines production. Demand for the Bitdeer miners is taking an uptrend even before they officially hit the market. As of the end of Q3, around 7 Eh/s of the 35 Eh/s SEALMINER A2s under production for commercial sale have already been reserved by customers. 7 Eh/s represents around 30,000 mining units. While many of our peers have pursued a self-mining hash rate growth strategy, we pursued a more long-term strategy of first focusing resources on the development of our own ASIC technology. We believe this significantly differentiates our business from the rest of the sector in terms of our strategic positioning, revenue and cost structure. Q3 earnings call Risks While Bitdeer's short-term liquidity position looks good, last month Bitdeer added leverage to its long-term liquidity position by issuing $360 million in convertible notes bearing an annual interest rate of $5.25%. Though this strengthens Bitdeer's ability to fund expansion and growth initiatives, this new debt has increased Bitdeer's financial risk because the crypto market remains volatile, and overnight events that can turn the market highly bearish should not be ruled out. Any time a miner takes on debt, it presents fresh risks. Takeaway SEALMINER Roadmap (Bitdeer) Bitdeer has followed through with the SEALMINER roadmap. And the company's entry into the ASIC market, currently valued at around $10 billion, will change the financial and market standing of Bitdeer in 2025. BTDR is a Bitcoin mining stock to watch out for in 2025. Verified Market Research Bitdeer is entering into the ASIC equipment manufacturing sector with mining machines that will go head-to-head with those of the leading players in the space. Bitdeer’s SEALMINER A2 machines, utilizing the more efficient SEAL02 chips, have undergone testing. The tests conducted in October showed the SEALMINER A2 achieved 226 th/s and an efficiency of 16.5 joules per terahash. The stat is impressive and is on par with what is obtainable from the most popular miners currently in the market, from manufacturers like Bitmain and Canaan. I wish you a happy and bullish new year in advance.",BTC-USD|BTDR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-30 17:30:04

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 17:44:25

This time, it’s about a wild rumor claiming the bankrupt crypto exchange will distribute $16 billion in cash within 60 days starting January 3. Sunil, an FTX creditor, called out AIXBT, accusing them of spreading outright lies. He clarified that FTX doesn’t even have $16 billion available. Let’s clear up the math. FTX has about $13 billion in cash right now and plans to hold back $6.5 billion. That leaves between $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion for the first distribution. That’s not pocket change, but it’s far from the dreamland figures being thrown around. Sunil said, “False: Distribution does not start 3rd Jan and $16bn within 60 days.” What FTX actually has to work with FTX collapsed in November 2022. It went from being one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world to the biggest crypto joke. Thanks to Sam Bankman-Fried and his web of mismanagement and fraud, the exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Alameda Research, the trading firm tied to FTX, crumbled right along with it. Now, fast forward to December 2024, and FTX’s financial cleanup is still a mess. As of now, the company has $13 billion in cash. That number might hit $14 billion by March 2025. But here’s the thing: FTX wants to hold on to $6.5 billion of that for disputed claims and other recovery efforts. The bankruptcy team, led by CEO John J. Ray III, has clawed back assets from every corner of the crypto world. Venture capital portfolios, lawsuits, and other liquidated holdings are expected to add another $5 billion to $7 billion. First payouts and the timeline you can actually believe FTX’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan goes live on January 3. After that, the first distributions are expected within 60 days. The company’s priority is smaller creditors, those owed $50,000 or less. But the total amount available for that initial payout sits around $6.5 billion and $7.5 billion. Sunil explained the timeline in no uncertain terms. He said the first $7 billion would be distributed by March 25, 2025. The rest? That’s tied up in disputed claims. FTX has set aside 50% of these claims—about $7 billion—for a reserve. This money won’t go anywhere until all the disputes are resolved. If history is any guide, that could take years. To handle the chaos, FTX is leaning on BitGo and Kraken to manage the payouts. These companies have been tapped to make sure creditors get what they’re owed. And it’s no small task, considering the sheer number of claims they’re dealing with. FTT token rockets while creditors wait While creditors are busy sorting through what they’ll actually get, the market is having a field day. The FTX Token (FTT), which was nearly worthless just a few months ago, has surged. As of press time, it’s trading at $3.50. That’s a 245% jump since September, pushing its market cap over $1.1 billion. Optimism around the payouts is driving the FTT rally. FTX’s recovery plan aims to repay creditors up to 119% of their claims. For smaller investors, that’s a big deal. If you were owed $10,000, for instance, you might end up with $11,900.

The list highlights cryptocurrencies the company believes demonstrate strong potential for the upcoming quarter. The Six Tokens According to the December 30 report , this update emphasizes tokens linked to three primary market themes: the U.S. election and its potential regulatory implications for decentralized finance (DeFi) and staking, breakthroughs in decentralized AI technologies and blockchain adoption by AI agents, and the growth of the Solana ecosystem. Based on these factors, Grayscale has added Hyperliquid (HYPE), Ethena (ENA), Virtual Protocol (VIRTUAL), Jupiter (JUP), Jito (JTO), and Grass (GRASS) to its Top 20 list. Hyperliquid, a Layer 1 blockchain, powers financial applications and operates a decentralized exchange for perpetual futures with a fully on-chain order book. On the other hand, Ethena introduced USDe, a stablecoin backed by hedged positions in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), offering staking opportunities tied to price differences between spot and futures markets. Virtual Protocol enables the creation of tokenized AI agents on Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 network. This functionality allows agents to interact autonomously with their surroundings and users. Jupiter, the leading decentralized exchange aggregator on Solana, has the highest total value locked (TVL) of any application on the network. Another Solana project, Jito, is a liquid staking protocol that generated over $550 million in fee revenue in 2024. The last of the six, Grass, operates as a decentralized data-sharing platform. It compensates users for sharing unused internet bandwidth via a Chrome extension. This bandwidth is then sold to AI developers for training machine learning models, offering a unique approach to monetizing data. In addition to these new entries, Grayscale rotated out some tokens, including Celo (CELO), from the Top 20. While these removed tokens remain relevant to the broader crypto ecosystem, the company explained that the updated selection better reflects the risk-adjusted returns expected for the upcoming quarter. Smart Contract Platforms Grayscale’s latest report also highlighted the intensifying competition among smart contract platforms. Despite major wins in the final quarter of 2024, Ethereum faces growing pressure from competitors like Solana and The Open Network. The research explains that these platforms are gaining traction by addressing the ‘blockchain trilemma,’ balancing scalability, security, and decentralization with innovative solutions. Fee revenue also continues to play a critical role in driving the value of smart contract platform tokens. For that reason, Grayscale included Ethereum, Solana, Sui, and Optimism in its top 20 list for Q1 2025 as standout smart contract platforms. According to the asset manager, these projects can generate sustainable fee revenues while delivering long-term value to their ecosystems.

In a new press release, the Blockchain Association says the “midnight” decision by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury Department to force DeFi protocols to follow the same reporting rules as securities brokers would “cripple” the US digital assets industry and impose unlawful compliance regulations on developers. Last week, the Treasury Department issued a press release about a new rule that requires DeFi brokers to report on the gross proceeds of sales of their digital assets. As stated by Marisa Coppel, head of legal at the firm, “The IRS and Treasury have gone beyond their statutory authority in expanding the definition of ‘broker’ to include providers of DeFi trading front-ends even though they do not effectuate transactions. Not only is this an infringement on the privacy rights of individuals using decentralized technology, it would push this entire, burgeoning technology offshore. Blockchain Association continues to stand with the innovators and users of DeFi, and will continue to fight this misguided rulemaking to ensure the United States remains a home for decentralized finance technology and developers alike.” In a recent thread on the social media platform X, Kristin Smith, the chief executive of the Blockchain Association, says the new rules are unconstitutional. “Today we’re taking action, filing a lawsuit that argues today’s broker rulemaking violates the Administrative Procedure Act and is unconstitutional. We stand with our nation’s innovators and will continue working to ensure the future of crypto – and DeFi – is here in the United States.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

To read full editions, subscribe . The AI agent frenzy was kickstarted by GOAT. GOAT is a Solana memecoin that spawned from an experiment by creator Andy Ayrey when he pitted two Claude AI models in an endless debate. GOAT still sits today at a comfortable $404 million market cap, but no longer dominates the mindshare it once did. First to copy GOAT’s success was the AI agent Luna (LUNA). It’s a busty anime girl chatbot that streams 24/7 on social media — need I say more? Chat with her, tip her with her own LUNA token (why does anyone do that?), or be like A16z-backed Story Protocol : Hire Luna for social media marketing. The Luna virtual companion was launched on Virtuals Protocol , an “AI Agent launchpad” on Base that is the most recognizable brand name in this meta right now. Formerly the PathDAO gaming guild, Virtuals took pump.fun’s successful formula and applied it to AI agents. Launch an agent token, hit a target market cap on a bonding curve, and pair the agent’s token in a liquidity pool on Uniswap. What Virtuals did differently, however — and what has gotten investor-types bullish on its token — was tying its native VIRTUALS token to the cost of launching agents and running inferences, as well as pairing it with agent tokens in a Uniswap liquidity pair (rather than SOL). Within the Virtuals ecosystem, Luna faces competition for speculative capital from other similarly looking chatbots like Airene , or more “utility-based” agents like aixbt , an agent that scrapes troves of social media data to surface trading alpha (aixbt is incidentally bullish on everything). $AIXBT is now a $1 billion market cap project based on mindshare, and it still wouldn't be overpriced. @aixbt_agent has undeniably become the most influential entity in all crypto right now. From @cookiedotfun to @_kaitoai , the signs are everywhere—this is a movement, not just… https://t.co/G4qAorXSVb pic.twitter.com/rg075ZYPTn — Diamond Hands Dig 👾 💎 (@DiamondHandsDig) December 29, 2024 Just as agents face competition, so too do the picks-and-shovels of agents. Besides Virtuals, a myriad of AI agent launchpads already exist, such as vvaifu.fun, Creator.Bid, MyShell.ai, Zentients and more. Then we have the AI agent “frameworks.” These are simply code libraries that make it easy for devs to customize their agents and integrate them into the virtual Wild West. The leading agent framework is ai16z’s “Eliza,” but there’s also Virtual’s G.A.M.E (Generative Autonomous Multimodal Entities), the Python-based ZerePy, the Solana-focused RIG, and more. And of course, each one of these frameworks has its own token that speculators are furiously aping into. Source: Messari Finally, we have the AI investment DAOs. The idea is simple: Deposit SOL/ETH and receive a DAO token that lets you share in the “hedge fund’s” upside. Ai16z was the first investment DAO to launch on Solana, now with an AUM of $23.4 million. People apparently really trust the investor acumen of AI agents. Presently, its native AI16Z token is valued at an astounding $1.4 billion market cap. Daos.world and VaderAI are two upcoming AI investment platforms on Base that have gained steam in the past week. At least six funds have already emerged on both platforms, with about a collective million in capital raised. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Czecker shared the “big personal news” in a post on X , revealing that his exit as head of growth at the synthetic dollar protocol comes after an incredible journey that has seen the project grow into one of decentralized finance ecosystem’s top platforms. “It has been a truly incredible and rewarding journey,” he wrote. “I joined the protocol around the seed round, drove $1B+ in DeFi partnerships while making sure Ethena is on your mind 24/7 and had incredible fun while doing it.” The outgoing Ethena ( ENA ) team member notes he’s been “actively involved” with the project from zero to a multi-billion dollar success story. The USDe ( USDe ) stablecoin issuer’s total value locked, according to DeFiLlama, currently stands at nearly $6 billion. Much of the rollercoaster growth has come amid huge demand from yield-hungry investors.

I’ve been doing this for years without any real holidays, worked with every major liquidity provider, protocol, KOL in the space and deserve some rest. I’ve done literally everything you could do in DeFi,” he noted. Czecker plans to continue supporting Ethena from outside, and will take a one to two months of deserved break and rest. When he returns to actively participating in the industry, his plan is to avoid “pure DeFi.” Rather, he will look to explore other sectors, including artificial intelligence, memes, SocialFi, entertainment and fashion.

Crypto predictions for 2025 range from meme coin enthusiasts forecasting a supercycle to Bitcoin maxis projecting the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. However, the most widely agreed-upon point is the start of the highly-anticipated “altseason”. All eyes are now on Ethereum, XRP and new altcoins like Best Wallet Token , which could see outsized growth in 2025. Crypto Predictions 2025 - Ethereum To $6000? There is a growing consensus amongst experts that the Ethereum price could hit $6000 in 2025. For instance, prominent trader Crypto Tony has used Elliot Wave Theory to project that the ETH price could surge to $6,300 in early 2025, provided it doesn’t fail to defend the $3,200 support level. Similarly, analyst Mikybull Crypto highlights that Ethereum’s continued consolidation above the 0.618 Fibonacci Level suggests a rally to the 1.618 Fib level, which is currently at $6,000. The falling Bitcoin Dominance also suggests that ETH could outperform BTC next year, ushering in the highly-anticipated “altseason”. BlackRock’s Head of ETF Jay Jacobs has also revealed that the $11.5 trillion asset management company has just scratched the surface with its spot Ethereum ETF, despite holding over $3.5 billion worth of ETH. Could The XRP Price Hit the $10 Mark In 2025? There have been a plethora of crypto predictions regarding XRP, almost all bullish in nature. It is hard to find any cryptocurrency that has benefitted more from Donald Trump’s US Presidential victory than XRP. It is not without any reason that the XRP price has surged by over 460%, reaching a multi-year high of $2.80. President-elect Trump has already appointed a pro-crypto SEC Chair in Paul Atkins. The odds are now extremely high that the SEC will drop its lawsuit against Ripple. Moreover, the agency could also approve spot XRP ETFs. Experts have also suggested that there is a significant institutional demand for XRP. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has repeated on multiple occasions that XRP could become the second-largest cryptocurrency once again, a spot it held before the SEC’s lawsuit. In that scenario, it wouldn’t be a surprise if the XRP price hits $10 in 2025. New Altcoins In High Demand In 2025 Ethereum’s strength will usher in the altseason, which will result in a strong demand for new altcoins. Smart money investors are front-running this scenario, already stacking low-cap crypto coins. For instance, the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has already raised over $6 million in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) amid strong whale and retail interest. $BEST is the native token of Best Wallet, one of the leading Bitcoin and crypto wallet brands. Best Wallet shot up in fame recently due to its strong growth and is currently seeing a 50% MoM increase in its user base. The company aims to capture 40% of the $11 billion non-custodial wallet business by 2026. As such, Best Wallet already has an edge over chain-specific wallets like MetaMask and Phantom. Its users can buy, swap and store crypto from over 60-plus chains. Moreover, cutting-edge features like Best Card, Best DEX, staking aggregator, presale aggregator, etc., have made it a one-stop shop for all things crypto. With Best Wallet’s strong growth, it is no surprise that smart money investors are betting on $BEST, with some eyeing up to 10x returns from it. Users are also taking advantage of Best Wallet’s unique “Upcoming Tokens” feature, which allows investors to buy trending presale coins without leaving the app. Visit Best Wallet Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Real Estate Platform Janover To Adopt Bitcoin As Payment,https://cryptonews.com/news/a-i-real-estate-platform-janover-to-adopt-bitcoin-as-payment/,"A.I. real estate platform Janover announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin payments in light of MicroStrategy’s success in the adoption of the Satoshi Nakamoto-created cryptocurrency, a Monday press release shows. Janover To Adopt Bitcoin Payments According to the Boca Raton-based company, Janover will accept not just Bitcoin , but Ethereum and Solana for select services in hopes of further aligning itself with market trends. The press release indicates that the reasoning behind the organization’s decision to expand into cryptocurrencies comes from “increasing support” for digital assets in terms of domestic policy. “At Janover, we remain focused on our core business. We do, however, recognize the broadening acceptance and significant future potential of digital currencies like Bitcoin,” said the company’s CEO, Blake E. Janover. Additionally, Janover cites success from “corporate strategies” seen in “broader financial markets” as a means of “long-term value creation.” “We’ve seen how companies like MicroStrategy have successfully capitalized on Bitcoin’s appreciation, and we believe there’s an opportunity to participate in the market in a measured, responsible way,” Janover said. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet News of Janover’s adoption of Bitcoin comes the same day that MicroStrategy announced it had purchased $209 million worth of the cryptocurrency as it continues its strategy of stockpiling the coin. According to Yahoo , the Michael Saylor-led firm’s December 30 purchase marks its eighth straight week buying up Bitcoin following its Fall 2024 surge in value. BREAKING: MicroStrategy stock, $MSTR , is now down -45% from its all time high seen 1 month ago. Over this same time period, #Bitcoin is up ~1%. pic.twitter.com/aTcPF4Ssgx — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 30, 2024 The Virginia-headquartered company, who joined the Nasdaq 100 last week, was down more than 8 percent as of Monday morning. MicroStrategy’s latest reported descent marks a 45 percent drop from it’s all time high just last month. As of Monday morning, Bitcoin itself was down nearly two percent. The coin previously reached an all time high of over $108,000 earlier this month following a rally prompted by pro-crypto sentiment surrounding the November election of President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who most recently launched his family’s crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has long pledged to enact a crypto-friendly regulatory framework when he returns to the Oval Office. In December, he tapped former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins to replace outgoing chair Gary Gensler after years of his regulation-by-enforcement approach to the crypto sector. With Janover and other companies adopting a Bitcoin-friendly approach to business, combined with expectations of regulatory relief on the industry, it may be just a matter of time before the rest of the country follows suit.

Despite a modest uptick during the Christmas season, the persistent bearish pattern has led investors to reconsider their stakes in ADA. The cryptocurrency’s continued presence in a descending channel raises questions about its potential to reach new highs in 2025. How Cardano Price Can Hit ATH in 2025 Cardano price is projected to achieve a new all-time high (ATH) by 2025, based on a technical analysis chart. The chart delineates a potential head and shoulders pattern, indicating a bullish reversal could propel ADA’s price beyond previous records. The analysis pinpoints several critical zones and trajectory paths that ADA might follow in the coming years. Initially, the currency faces a substantial support zone around $0.567. If this level holds, it could form the base for a potential surge. According to the chart, after touching this support, the top altcoin might ascend to test higher resistance levels. Experts suggest that a significant rise could occur post-2024, following the completion of the right shoulder of the pattern. This movement aligns with a projected trendline that sees ADA gradually climbing, potentially peaking at $3.09, which would surpass its former ATH. The pattern analysis on the chart highlights a drop of approximately 7.75% from the neckline of the head and shoulders pattern. Such retracements are common in bullish reversals, often seen as consolidation before a strong upward movement. Source: TradingView ADA Price Analysis Cardano price has seen a recent dip below the critical $1 threshold after briefly peaking earlier this month amidst a wider bullish trend in the crypto market. Despite this setback, there’s potential for ADA to rebound by 20% come January 2025, possibly reaching the $1.20 level. If the momentum continue, a surge to $3.10 is conceivable, replicating its 2021 performance. Conversely, a bearish turn could push its value below $0.80. Currently, the ADA price trading value has decreased by 1%, sitting at $0.8612. Nonetheless, there’s a noticeable 50% increase in market volume, now at $891 million. This uptick indicates a growing interest in Cardano, even amid price fluctuations. In conclusion, while the Cardano price journey back to its ATH by 2025 faces significant challenges, the potential for a bullish reversal remains. Continued support and market interest could indeed set the stage for ADA to reach new heights.

The digital asset platform has become the first to be approved under Europe’s regulation. According to the announcement, the company secured approval under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which the European Parliament passed last year. 🏆 achievement unlocked ✅ we've received approval under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation in The Netherlands 🌍 this enables MoonPay to innovate crypto payments across Europe! 🫡 2025 is going to be big pic.twitter.com/adLjntXhLo — MoonPay 🟣 (@moonpay) December 30, 2024 The firm secured its license from the Netherlands’ Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). This accomplishment allows the crypto services firm to provide services related to digital asset payments throughout Europe. MoonPay co-founder and CEO Ivan Soto-Wright said, “This approval is a testament to MoonPay’s proactive approach to regulation and our commitment to building a trusted bridge between the traditional financial world and the rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem.” Ivan Soto added, “MiCA represents a pivotal moment for the European digital asset industry, and we’re proud to have worked collaboratively with the Dutch AFM to be among the first to embrace this new regulatory framework.” MiCA requirements are causing big issues in Europe at the moment. However, with their license, there is so much that can be done. In this case, as of today, December 30, the framework is fully in place. MoonPay plans to use this legal clarity to grow its business in Europe. The company also wants to look into new ways to pay and use digital assets while making sure they stay in line with changing standards. What this means for MoonPay MoonPay crypto platform’s achievement after the final filing of the MiCA regulation policy draft has caused a lot of market talk. At the same time, the huge success comes with speculation of a continued bull market in 2025. This has made Dutch investors even more excited. In addition, MoonPay’s new service for Dutch users could help improve the market mood by giving a lot of new investors a chance to trade crypto. Bitcoin and other top crypto are moving very quickly compared to larger trends. This means that buyers should be willing to take small risks. Notably, this win comes at a time when MoonPay is said to be in talks to buy crypto payment provider Helio Pay for around $150 million. If the deal goes through, it will be MoonPay’s biggest purchase since it started in 2018, which will make it even stronger in the market. Are MiCA regulations against or for the crypto industry? Well, MiCA regulations are a bit tricky. Coinbase, a European exchange, eliminated Tether (USDT) and five additional stablecoins from its European platform this month. Coinbase stated that it may reinstate them if they satisfy the new criteria. The exchange asserted that it would be providing issuers with an opportunity to reenter the market by adhering to the regulations. This is because MiCA offers a transition period of 6 to 18 months for stablecoins such as USDt to attain compliance. In response, Tether (USDt) saw its market value drop by $2 billion as exchanges adjusted to the changes. In addition, ByBit stopped certain perks for EU customers because of this regulation. The exchange told its traders, “As part of our ongoing compliance efforts following the upcoming implementation of MiCA on Dec 30, 2024, we would like to inform you about updates regarding your participation in events on the Bybit platform.” Bybit stated that beginning Dec 18, 2024, users from the EEA will no longer be eligible to participate in any events on Bybit. Starting Dec 18, 2024, EEA users (Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland etc.) will no longer be eligible for Bybit events. Make sure to complete any ongoing event tasks by Dec 23, 10AM UTC to secure rewards, with all distributions finalized by Dec 28, 2024‼️ #Bybit #MiCA #Crypto pic.twitter.com/PG1CyKiWJW — Tomek (@miedzybrodzki) December 18, 2024 However, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) has successfully met MiCA’s requirements. This has secured the requisite e-money license and established USDC as a viable option in the EU market. In the same light, Kraken, another significant crypto exchange in Europe, regards MiCA as a critical juncture in the region’s crypto market. To extend its presence, it has acquired the Dutch exchange BCM and is collaborating with local businesses in Spain to further its expansion. Additionally, SIX, the Swiss stock exchange, is contemplating the establishment of a platform for crypto trading within the European Union. SIX endeavors to attract institutional investors by providing a secure and regulated trading environment that capitalizes on Switzerland’s sophisticated regulatory standards. EU’s final MiCA policy is set The final draft policy had new rules and methods for finding and reporting suspicious activities, even when they happened across borders. Crypto asset service providers (CASPs) are required to submit applications for licenses to conduct business within the European Union (EU) beginning in January 2025. A period of up to 18 months enables current providers to continue operations while transitioning to full compliance. This provision allows EU member states to allow existing crypto service providers to operate from December 30, 2024, to July 1, 2026, subject to the duration selected by each state. Nevertheless, this period is not mandatory for all jurisdictions, which means that certain EU member states may provide a lesser period. In addition, the enforcement of the Transfer of funds regulation (TFR) will commence on December 30, 2024. To guarantee transparency and prevent money laundering, CASPs must establish systems for exchanging personal data between the sender and recipient of crypto asset transfers. By July 2026, all CASPs must have achieved full compliance with MiCA regulations. This involves obtaining the necessary permits from their National Competent Authority, implementing strong security processes, and creating operating standards that prioritize consumer safety and transparency.

The partnership between Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) and modular layer-1 blockchain for RWAfi Plume Network targets RWAfi. According to the two platforms, the aim is to expand access to products such as Ondo U.S. Dollar Yield (USDY) across Plume Network. By combining Ondo’s expertise in Treasuries-backed yieldcoins, and Plume’s RWAfi-tailored infrastructure, the two projects can simplify onboarding and capital integration. Native issuance of Ondo’s USDY on Plume is a step in that direction. Read more: BounceBit partners with Ondo Finance for tokenized real-world assets The flagship Ondo Finance project USDY is currently the fourth largest tokenized U.S. treasuries product with over $450 million in value across eight blockchains. Hashnote’s short duration yield coin, BlackRock;s BUIDL and Franklin Templeton’s Onchain U.S. Government Money Fund have their current total value locked at $1.8 billion, $621 million and $554 million per data from rwa.xyz . Launching USDY on Plume will see Ondo bring the 4.65% APY to the platform’s users. It also promises to expand access to the yieldcoin to global individual and institutional investors. However, Ondo does not offer this product to U.S. investors. The collaboration does not just offer an opportunity for the expansion of RWA use cases, but also contributes to the overall growth of DeFi. Katie Wheeler, vice president of partnerships at Ondo Finance, noted in a statement that the partnership will be a boon for the whole industry. “Plume is creating a network effect of opportunities for RWA issuance, and having a composable, yield-bearing asset to power this economy is a boon for both the asset utility and the ecosystem as a whole,” Wheeler said. The Plume Network team has recently sealed several key partnerships and integrations, including with Google Cloud, Chateau Capital and on-chain private credit platform Credbull.

As Cardano prepares for a potential surge toward the $3 mark, the competition in the altcoin space is heating up. These three tokens are attracting unprecedented attention due to their unique features, strong growth potential, and the high returns they offer to investors who get in early. Cardano’s Path to $3 and Whale Interest Cardano (ADA) has been a top pick for investors because of its careful and study-based way. As one of the top Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, Cardano gives room to grow and saves energy, making it a good choice for long-term rise. Lately, Cardano’s ADA coin is getting noticed by big crypto players with guesses leaning toward a $3 goal by the end of 2025. The spark for this interest is Cardano’s stead͏y work, which has many new updates and growing deals in different fields. The start of Hydra, Cardano’s way to do more transactions fast, might push speeds to new levels, backing decentralized apps (dApps) and letting quicker DeFi trades. This rise, mixed with the growing use of Cardano apps, is sparking big fish interest; setting up for major price gain. Dogecoin (DOGE) Meme Coin That Keeps Surging While Dogecoin (DOGE) originally gained fame as a meme coin, it has continued to draw interest due to its strong community and continued market relevance. Whales have kept a close eye on DOGE, knowing that its massive market cap and wide adoption provide strong support for further growth. What makes DOGE a compelling investment is its public awareness and celebrity backing—especially as it gains use in e-commerce and payment solutions. Recently, the rise of Dogecoin in the broader crypto community, especially with its ties to Elon Musk’s ventures, has solidified DOGE’s position as a top contender. As Ethereum and Bitcoin continue to lead the market, DOGE benefits from its position as the most prominent meme coin, creating opportunities for whales to ride the market wave. Lightchain AI Rising Star in the Blockchain Space Amid the ongoing success of Cardano and Dogecoin, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is quickly emerging as one of the most exciting presale opportunities in the crypto world. Priced at just $0.0041 during its presale, Lightchain AI has become a favorite among whales seeking new, high-potential investments. Lightchain AI brings a unique value proposition by integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, sets it apart from other blockchain networks. This innovation, along with its energy-efficient design and clear roadmap, has caught the attention of top investors. By the time its testnet and mainnet launches take place in 2025, Lightchain AI could see its token value skyrocket as AI-driven applications begin to take center stage in the blockchain space.

By 2027, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $152.88. ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $506.58 by 2030. Ethereum Name Service is a network that allows crypto-enthusiasts to rename their crypto addresses into something more uncomplicated for them to remember easily. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7, hitting an ATH of $85.69, and currently trading below $30. How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon?

ENS prices seek resistance at $34.00. The ENS price analysis for December 30 shows a recent decline from $34.00 to $32.45, indicating bearish pressure after a brief period of consolidation. The resistance level is near $34.00, where selling pressure has been observed, while support is identified around $32.00, providing a potential rebound zone. The movement reflects a short-term downward trend, with traders watching for a breakout above resistance or further dips toward support to determine the next direction. Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart: ENS price struggles amid weak bullish momentum The daily chart for Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a recent price rebound from its lower levels around $30, moving toward $34. However, the price remains consolidated after witnessing a sharp drop earlier today. The current trading range indicates some buying interest, but the upward momentum is not yet strong enough to push past key resistance at $35. Support is observed near $32, providing a potential cushion if the price declines further. ENS price struggles amid weak bullish momentum The RSI on the daily chart is at 46.48, which suggests slightly bearish conditions as it is below the neutral 50 level. However, it is gradually attempting to recover. The MACD line is below the signal line, and the histogram displays red bars, indicating prevailing downward pressure. These indicators reflect limited bullish momentum and potential further consolidation before a clearer trend develops. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis: Consolidation with signs of indecision In the hourly chart of ENS, the price is trading within a relatively narrow range of around $33.84, reflecting a period of consolidation after recent fluctuations. The price movement shows attempts to break higher but lacks strong momentum, as sellers appear to cap gains. This suggests a balance between buyers and sellers in the short term, with no clear trend direction established. Consolidation with signs of indecision The RSI is at 44.26, indicating neutral momentum with a slight bearish tilt, as it remains below the midpoint of 50. The MACD histogram shows small negative bars, highlighting weak bearish momentum, while the signal and MACD lines are close to converging, signaling indecision in the market.

The overall analysis of ENS reveals a market experiencing fluctuations within a defined range, showing both upward momentum and resistance to further gains. Despite occasional spikes in price, the trend indicates a period of consolidation, with buyers and sellers balancing each other out. This suggests the market is searching for direction, as any significant movement beyond current levels could set the tone for future trends. While some stability is evident, the price remains vulnerable to external factors that could either strengthen support or break through resistance Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will fully recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $105.66 by 2026. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500?

Table of Contents WEPE seeks to level the playing field for all traders Experts highlight WEPE’s strong community and explosive potential WEPE’s price will increase by another 147% before it launches – here’s how to enter the presale The meme coin market is down by 2.23% in the past 24 hours, which brought its value to $96.5 billion, a far cry from its ATH of $137 billion earlier this month. Despite the bearish market sentiment, Pepe-themed meme coins are seeing gains today, with Pepe (PEPE) and Book of Meme gaining over 3% each. Although most established meme coins struggle to make significant gains, Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) is bursting through its funding goals at a rapid rate, even when the broader meme coin market faces red trends. Since its inception on December 3rd, the project has raised over $38 million as investors add WEPE to their portfolios to secure their spot in its upcoming trading channel. Let’s take a look at what WEPE intends to bring to the meme coin space and whether it’s a worthwhile investment.

According to the project’s whitepaper , WEPE’s developers intend to share trading strategies, signals, market insights, investment calls, and more, giving WEPE utility. WEPE’s team has also allocated 15% of its total 200 billion token supply to Trading Rewards, a special rewards system that will be available to those following the trading channel. To become eligible for WEPE’s trading rewards, investors will need to follow its trading calls and submit proof of their investment in its VIP channel during WEPE’s upcoming weekly trading competitions. https://twitter.com/WEPEToken/status/1863905080426058015 WEPE’s popularity and early presale success come as no surprise, as it is featured in Best Wallet’s Upcoming Tokens section, which makes it visible to over 100,000 of its monthly users. Previously, Best Wallet featured Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Catslap (SLAP), which left their presale stages and made 600% and 5,500% gains in just 48 hours post-launch, respectively. Since WEPE is currently outperforming them, averaging more than $1 million raised daily, it could repeat their success on launch or deliver even greater returns. Experts highlight WEPE’s strong community and explosive potential Although Wall Street Pepe offers utility by acting as a key to the project’s upcoming crypto signals channel, it’s a meme coin first, and as such, its success largely depends on the strength of its community. The project allocated 38% of its total token supply to marketing, which has already helped it amass an impressive follower count of more than 28,600 on X (Twitter) and 12,000 on Telegram . Besides attracting investors, WEPE is receiving significant attention from crypto experts, including 99Bitcoins, a channel run by a team of meme coin analysts with over 720,000 subscribers. Experts from the 99Bitcoins team see a 100x potential in WEPE, pointing to its growing community and unique approach to the meme coin market. They’ve also pointed out that the project offers a 34% staking APY, allowing investors to passively earn extra WEPE. They see purchasing and staking WEPE as an excellent alternative to investing in established coins that are facing high volatility. The experts have encouraged their audience to start accumulating WEPE during its presale’s early stages, as its price increases every 24 hours, and it has already shot up by 83.05% since December 3rd. WEPE’s price will increase by another 147% before it launches – here’s how to enter the presale WEPE has allocated 20% of its total token supply to the presale, leaving 40 billion tokens up for grabs before it launches on DEXs. The project’s whitepaper reveals that the presale will end on April 25th, 2025, or once the tokens reserved for the presale sell out. Additionally, the whitepaper shows the final presale stage will see WEPE selling for $0.000249, representing a 147% increase from its current price of $0.0003661. WEPE’s per-token price will increase every time a funding goal is reached or enough time passes, which usually happens every day, leaving investors with limited time to secure it at lower prices. Ritual complete. Green candles lighting the way. 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/9lZZr4diqN — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 29, 2024 Investors can add WEPE to their portfolios by purchasing it with ETH, BNB, USDT, or a credit or debit card. No minimum investment is required, making the presale equally attractive to whales and casual traders. Besides early adoption, WEPE’s developers also emphasize investor security. The project’s smart contract has been audited by Coinsult , which found no critical threats to investor funds. Plus, 15% of the total token supply is set aside for liquidity, minimizing the risk of a rug pull. Although there are no guarantees when it comes to the success of meme coins, WEPE stands a solid chance to explode on launch if it keeps its momentum in 2025.

The Michael Saylor-founded company has acquired an additional 2,138 BTC for approximately $209 million, boosting its total holdings of the flagship cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy Boosts Its Bitcoin Coffers Bitcoin stockpiler MicroStrategy announced on Dec. 30 that it had increased its holdings of the largest cryptocurrency. The Virginia-based company, which already owns more Bitcoin than any other publicly traded company, bought 2,138 BTC between Dec. 23 and Dec. 29. MicroStrategy said it used $209 million in cash to purchase the BTC at an average price of $97,837 per BTC. The firm now holds 446,400 BTC, which is currently worth roughly $41.5 billion, and has spent $27.9 billion to build its Bitcoin treasury. MicroStrategy has acquired 2,138 BTC for ~$209 million at ~$97,837 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 47.8% QTD and 74.1% YTD.

Last Monday, the business intelligence firm bought 5,262 BTC for $516 million. The average price was over $106,000, meaning the company bought that batch of coins near the local market top. That said, Saylor has repeatedly indicated that he will continue buying Bitcoin at any price and has no plans to sell. MicroStrategy Plans To Issue More Shares To Fund More Bitcoin Purchases According to a Monday SEC filing, MicroStrategy financed the latest acquisition by selling 592,987 shares during the same week, accruing approximately $209 million in net proceeds. As of December 30, MicroStrategy still has about $6.8 billion worth of shares available for sale from its planned $21 billion equity offering and an additional $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Since announcing its ambitious 21/21 plan in October, MicroStrategy has bought over 194,000 BTC worth around $18 billion, achieving around 42% of its planned investment goal in less than two months. The company sought the SEC’s permission in a Dec. 23 filing to increase the number of its authorized shares for its Class A common stock and preferred stock. This would give MicroStrategy greater flexibility in funding Bitcoin purchases. The firm aims to raise the authorized Class A common stock to 10.33 billion shares from 330 million. Additionally, it seeks to increase the number of authorized preferred shares from 5 million to over 1 billion.

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 19:04:15

In a new thread on the social media platform X, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,700 followers that the next time prominent stablecoin Tether’s ( USDT ) dominance level (USDT.D) tests the 4.7-5% area, the crypto king will see a significant price decrease. “BTC is starting to break down. If USDT.D tests 4.7-5%, Bitcoin into $85,000 seems appropriate.” Source: Justin Bennett/X According to Bennett, the market won’t hit its bottom until Tether’s dominance levels reach the target area. An asset’s dominance level is the ratio between its market cap versus the market cap of the entire crypto market. “My plan hasn’t changed. I still think we’ll get Tether dominance into the 4.7-5% area before we see the crypto market bottom. Another 7% to go, give or take.” Source: Justin Bennett/X The crypto strategist goes on to say that USDT.D is on the rise and should hit the 4.7-5% area in the coming weeks. “The weekly chart says it all. Note how USDT.D closed above 4.29% two weeks ago and closed above last week. As long as this is holding on a weekly closing basis, that 4.7-5% area is next.” Source: Justin Bennett/X According to the analyst, as of this morning, BTC bulls have just under a day and a half to turn things around. “Bulls only have 33 hours to turn things around, which seems unlikely given today’s bloodbath from stocks. We’ll see.” The top crypto asset by market cap is trading for $92,046 at time of writing, a 1.9% decrease during the last 24 hours.

SEC Yearly Recap: Was 2024 the Most Important Year?,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-yearly-recap-was-2024-the-most-important-year/,"TL;DR The Ripple v. SEC case culminated in August when Judge Torres ordered the company to pay a $125 million fine for breaching certain securities laws. The penalty represented a substantial reduction of what the regulator initially asked for. Donald Trump’s election victory and Gary Gensler’s announced resignation fueled optimism among XRP supporters, expecting pro-crypto leadership to influence the case’s resolution favorably. The First Half of the Year 2024 has been quite eventful for the legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the first months of the year, both entities filed various motions in preparation for the trial’s start. For instance, the SEC requested Ripple to hand over essential documents such as the company’s financial statements for 2022 and 2023 and its post-complaint XRP sales contracts. The firm opposed the demand, maintaining that those records were untimely and unrelated to the case. This caused the agency to re-submit the motion, claiming that the documents could offer essential insights into Ripple’s financial history and help determine if the company breached specific securities regulations. The firm reacted with a motion to file a sur-reply letter, seeking “to correct a significant factual mischaracterization made by the SEC.” Eventually, Judge Sarah Netburn ruled in favor of the Commission, ordering Ripple to disclose its financial records for the years 2022-2023. The two entities continued to submit documents and data until the beginning of the trial stage. As CryptoPotato reported , the legal proceedings between Ripple and the SEC reached that pivotal phase on April 23. While many industry participants raised their hopes that this could be a sign of a soon-approaching settlement, the complexity of the court process and possible appeals from both sides mean that the case could be prolonged for a few more years. In May, the popular American attorney Jeremy Hogan claimed that the lawsuit had entered a stage with fewer developments, and both entities had to wait for the judge’s decision. Ripple and the SEC continued to throw punches at each other , clashing over a key witness’ testimony and arguing about the potential size of the company’s fine for violating certain laws. The watchdog sought a $2 billion penalty on the company, alleging it of conducting an unregistered securities offering by selling its XRP token. Ripple disagreed, insisting that the amount should not exceed $10 million. It compared its case to another legal battle between the agency and Terraform Labs, saying allegations of fraud are only present in the second lawsuit. The Court’s Decision In August, Judge Analisa Torres ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million civil penalty for violating federal securities laws through its institutional sales of XRP. It is worth mentioning that in the summer of 2023, the same magistrate found that the company’s programmatic sales of XRP to retail clients through centralized exchanges did not breach the rules. Many industry participants viewed the August ruling as a huge victory for Ripple, considering that the fine represents just a fraction of what the SEC initially asked for. The company’s executives also seemed pleased. CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the firm respects the court’s decision, while CLO Stuart Alderoty stated the organization will pay the penalty in cash off its balance sheet. Nonetheless, the SEC officially appealed in October, triggering a fresh doze of uncertainty. The action means that the lawsuit entered a new phase comprised of filings and a briefing process. Donald Trump Comes to the Stage Many crypto proponents cheered Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections (held on November 5). Those in favor of Ripple and its native token were also among the pack due to the Republican’s promise to fire the SEC’s Chairman Gary Gensler on day 1 after taking office. Gensler has been in charge for over three years, during which time the agency has filed numerous lawsuits against crypto businesses. While some doubted that Trump could fire him (since the SEC operates as an independent entity), the Chairman said he would resign in January next year. Moreover, the newly elected president of the States picked the pro-crypto Paul Atkins to succeed him. The XRP Army expects the Commission’s upcoming leadership to take a less hostile stance toward the cryptocurrency industry and push the case against Ripple to a favorable resolution soon.

According to the data, the crypto whale who bought AAVE and UNI made a total of $49.89 million. However, the whale wallet, which recently reactivated, interestingly made a new purchase of the AIXBT altcoin, which is not listed on Binance, Bybit or Coinbase. However, it is important to remember that this altcoin is extra risky due to its market value and the fact that it is not listed on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. The data shows that the crypto whale in question made the purchase through Wintermute. In its latest move, the whale wallet purchased $1.3 million worth of AIXBT tokens from the Wintermute address. The Debank profile of the whale wallet can be accessed here. Related News: 7 Experts Revealed What They Expect in the Cryptocurrency Market in 2025 The whale wallet has paid $6.1 million to Wintermute so far, purchasing a total of $4.26 million worth of AIXBT, $500,000 worth of NFTXBT, and $330,000 worth of EMP since December 4.

This steady Bitcoin buying strategy, which has largely paid off since the asset’s price has soared, has continued up until now. Recent data shows that El Salvador purchased another 1 BTC on Dec. 29, pushing the Nayib Bukele country’s total holdings above the 6,000 BTC mark. This substantial stash makes El Salvador the sixth country to hold 6,000 BTC or more. El Salvador Now Holds $562 Million In Bitcoin According to The National Bitcoin Office of El Salvador’s portfolio tracker, El Salvador’s BTC holdings now stand at 6,000.77 Bitcoin, currently worth $562.3 million following its latest purchase. El Salvador holds the sixth most Bitcoin among nation-states, behind only the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Bhutan, data shows. While El Salvador typically adds one Bitcoin per day, it acquired 11 BTC , worth $1 million, just a day after striking a $1.3 billion deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that stipulated changes on its controversial Bitcoin Law in return. In September 2021, El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director Stacy Herbert announced in a Dec. 19 post that the tiny Latin American nation may continue to purchase Bitcoin at an “accelerated pace” going forward. Herbert further revealed that the Salvadoran government would sell or phase out its government-sponsored wallet, Chivo . The authorities gifted citizens $30 of free BTC via the app back in 2021. Has Bukele’s Big BTC Bet Borne Fruit? Since making Bitcoin legal tender, President Nayib Bukele has been a vocal supporter of crypto adoption. His government has launched several projects including a Bitcoin mining operation powered by geothermal energy from a volcano and the introduction of Bitcoin-backed volcano bonds. El Salvador also offers a so-called “freedom visa” for crypto enthusiasts. El Salvador bought its 6,000 BTC at an average price of $45,465; it’s now worth $562 million, meaning the country is sitting on over $157 million in profits — a roughly 108% gain on its initial investment. While it’s unclear whether other nation-states will actually follow in El Salvador’s footsteps and stockpile Bitcoin anytime soon, one thing is clear: Interest in holding the world’s largest cryptocurrency as a strategic reserve asset has reached a fever pitch .",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|El Salvador,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 19:15:09

Bitcoin consensus orbits around two important variables, economic actors and miners. Economic actors decide whether a set of consensus rules has value by deciding whether to honor their side of a transaction based on whether it is valid according to their consensus rules. Miners decide which set of consensus rules they will mine within, choosing the one that presents the highest value to them. Users who actually use Bitcoin, that is to transact and operate businesses, services, and other protocols to make use of blockspace, gain an influence through both mechanisms. A set of consensus rules needs two things, users who will value it, and miners who will mine it. Users buying blockspace attract miners with more revenue beyond what the block subsidy creates. To the degree that fees make up miners' revenue, users who generate those fees have that much proportionate “power” of a sort over miners. They decide in the event of a disagreement over consensus rules which side to give that revenue to, meaning miners would have to follow those rules to earn it. The threat of institutional adoption and regulatory encroachment very much do present a risk to Bitcoin in the long term if people simply stop doing anything with bitcoin but hold it. In that type of environment, regulations can come down on miners and brokers and very much influence events around consensus changes. They can attempt to veto useful and valuable changes, and try to push useless or damaging ones. So what do we do to counteract that? We actually use Bitcoin for more than holding and investing. That is why scalability is so important. Because it allows more people to directly interact with the system in that way, to directly exert their influence. The more we actually use Bitcoin, the more influence users collectively have to exert in the future over consensus. If Bitcoiners relegate bitcoin to nothing more than an asset to hold, something to let sit idle, then we will eventually lose it. We will lose our say and influence in the markets bitcoin facilitates, we will lose our influence over the consensus rules that miners choose to mine, we will lose it all. Bitcoiners need to be active, not passive. We need to transact, we need to build more businesses, consume more blockspace. With payment networks like Lightning or Ark, uncensorable derivatives markets using DLCs, even dumb things like Ordinals and Inscriptions. The demand for blockspace needs to come from distributed and diverse sources, not just massive institutions and companies easily subjectable to regulatory and government influence. Bitcoin is very much a “use it or lose it” thing. I’d rather not see it lost to people who actually care about freedom due to apathy. This article is a Take .

It noted that no ETF has ever had such an exceptional debut as it grew to a behemoth with more than $50 billion in assets in less than a year which makes it the fastest-growing cryptocurrency ETF in history. IBIT’s size grew to match the combined assets of over 50 long-established European market-focused ETFs. Todd Sohn of Strategas Securities highlighted this in a note, while Nate Geraci, the President of The ETF Store has called it “the greatest launch in ETF history.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart noted: “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class,” he said. “At the current asset level and an expense ratio of 0.25%, IBIT can expect to earn about $112 million a year,” he added. Notably, Larry Fink, the firm’s CEO, who once criticized Bitcoin as a tool for global money laundering has now shifted his view as he began to view Bitcoin as “digital gold.” BlackRock’s entry into the spot-Bitcoin market, supported by its strong ETF track record, led to the approval and launch of the first US Bitcoin ETFs in January. Following this approval, BlackRock, along with Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, and others, launched the first cohort of US Bitcoin ETFs. Together, these 12 funds now manage approximately $107 billion in assets. BlackRock’s Contribution To BTC Rally IBIT now holds more assets than BlackRock’s gold ETF, the second-largest gold fund globally. Notably, Geraci believes that IBIT in 2025 could surpass SPDR Gold Shares, the largest gold ETF, barring a collapse in the price of Bitcoin. IBIT’s success also marked a significant turning point for Bitcoin, potentially boosting its legitimacy and acceptance in the financial market. It also played a significant role in pushing Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 for the first time, attracting both institutional investors and formerly skeptical individuals. Remarkably, IBIT and other Bitcoin ETFs have contributed significantly to Bitcoin’s 118% price rally this year. Since its launch, IBIT has had only nine days of outflows and typically accounts for over 50% of the daily trading volume in the group.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-30 19:23:54

38317561,https://blockworks.co/news/blockworks-2024-reflections,1735586980,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,2024 Reflections,https://blockworks.co/news/blockworks-2024-reflections,"Dear Blockworks Community, Since launching in December 2017, our mission has been to build the world’s best source of crypto insights and information for investors and professionals. We’re here because we believe crypto improves the world by broadening access to assets, increasing transparency, and reducing financial friction. This market moves in extreme cycles, but if you zoom out, you’ll see that every year more and more value moves onchain. This trend will continue for decades, and as it does, the number of investors, founders, developers, and professionals building in crypto will grow by orders of magnitude. These participants will all need access to information to make investments, build companies, and scale protocols. This dynamic will continue to fuel a massive market for crypto data, research, and high-quality insights. From day one, we built Blockworks to provide this information. And as the industry has grown, so have we. Our business is simple Our media channels give professionals and investors the essential news and insights they need to make informed decisions. Our events create the connections that move the industry forward—bringing together executives, founders, investors, and developers to shape the future of crypto. Our data and research provides professional investors with the tools and alpha they need to make smarter investment decisions. And our newly formed advisory business helps protocols build better, stronger businesses. We make money through ads and sponsorships, event tickets, advisory services, and access to our proprietary research and data platform. While it might look simple in theory, execution is everything—and execution in both media and software is tough. Social media and AI are reshaping how people consume news, putting pressure on those who can’t adapt. In the past few years, many of our competitors have either folded or been forced to sell due to these pressures. Meanwhile, if you’re building software products without a robust distribution funnel, that means you’re often forced to spend more than you make to acquire customers. In turn, you become reliant on VC dollars. We refer to this internally as the “VC hamster wheel.” We avoid both these pitfalls by owning the distribution layer and by staying profitable. Default Alive Folks at Blockworks are sick of this story, but I’ll tell it again. Three months into starting Blockworks, Mike and I met with a successful entrepreneur at his office in New York. We wanted his advice. How could we compete with the incumbents (CoinDesk, Cointelegraph), the upstarts (The Block, Decrypt), and the institutions (Bloomberg, WSJ)? At the time, this felt impossible. He gave us one piece of advice that resonated: In an industry as volatile and as vicious as crypto, sometimes all you need to do is survive. This became, and continues to be, a foundational principle for Blockworks. We have run Blockworks differently than many of our competitors. Instead of chasing every last ounce of growth, we have intentionally made decisions that sacrificed all-out growth to stay “default alive.” The culmination of many of these decisions put Blockworks in our best position yet as we headed into 2024. But we still had to execute. Thanks to the best team we’ve ever had, 2024 was our most successful year yet : Advertising and Sponsorships : We hit all-time highs for advertising and sponsorships on both an annual and quarterly basis; Q4 2024 was our best quarter ever. ARR : Our ARR is also at an all-time high, and we now have more than 100 enterprises, funds, and financial institutions who use the Blockworks Research platform. House of Brands : We believe the future of media lies in dedicated niche brands, each serving a unique audience. We now have five strong brands under our umbrella—each with their own podcast, newsletter, telegram community, and soon, in-person activations. Podcasts : We published 672 podcast episodes, which were listened to more than 15 million times across YouTube, Spotify, Apple, and other podcasting platforms. Our podcast network is the largest in the industry, and I believe now one of the top 3 financial podcast networks in the world. Newsletters : As the value of a page view decreases, the value of a newsletter subscriber increases. Our newsletters grew to nearly 200,000 subscribers. Reporting : Our newsroom published 2,230 stories that reached readers in all 195 countries, cementing Blockworks as the go-to resource for crypto news. Following the acquisitions of two other crypto media publications, we are proud that we remain independent. Research: Our research team published 159 research reports and is now seen as the leading analyst team in crypto. Data : “Improve the data, improve the industry.” We shipped massive improvements to our data platform, and we now cover user metrics, financials, and token data for more than 30 of the industry’s leading protocols and applications. Advisory: We launched Blockworks Advisory to help protocols sidestep common pitfalls and accelerate their path to success Acquisitions : Building upon our House of Brands strategy, we acquired and integrated both The Drop and The Breakdown into the Blockworks family, strengthening our editorial and insights capabilities. Our Competitive Advantage Our data platform is fueled by the reach of our media channels; our reporting is fueled by our proprietary data and research. This media-data flywheel is the synergy that keeps us ahead of our competitors. No other media outlet has our depth of onchain and financial data, and no other research or data platform has our distribution capabilities. Looking Ahead to 2025 In 2025, you will see us: Become crypto’s defacto data and research platform Double down on our House of Brands strategy, scaling each property and adding new ones. This means growing podcasts, newsletters, and communities, as well as adding in-person components to each brand Turn Blockworks into a talent destination for podcasters, writers, reporters, and researchers. This means finding talent early, building brands around them, and designing the incentives to retain them. It also means investing in journalism at a time when others are divesting Host three of the industry’s best conferences: DAS New York and DAS London for institutions; Permissionless for developers and builders More tightly integrate our media and events with our research and data Help more protocols scale via our advisory business The Little Moments: Day After Day As we look back over the past seven years, building Blockworks has been less about the big moments in time—less about the product launches, the huge hires, and the exciting fundraise. It’s been more about putting one foot in front of the other, day after day after day while making sound decisions that optimize for sustainable, long-term oriented growth. That’s how we survived Covid and made it through both the 2018-2019 and 2022-2023 bear markets. It’s also how we were ready to thrive in this new bull market. And that’s how we’ll continue to build the best crypto media and information brand and platform in the world. Thank You We couldn’t do this without our customers, employees, readers, and listeners. Your support powers our mission every day. As we move into 2025 and beyond, we are more excited than ever about the future of crypto—and our role in it.

Currently, Cardano is trading at $0.8381, down from highs of up to $1.3264. On December 20, Cardano’s price dropped below $0.8, reaching a low of $0.7673, sparking concern among investors. While there was a slight uptick since that time the market has been notably bearish. If this support fails to hold, it could lead to further downside momentum, with the next target at $0.76. Despite the decline, some analysts believe the token could quickly recover in 2025, including MN Consulting founder Michaël van de Poppe . Cardano could rise above $3 in 2025 or 2026 In an X post on December 30, MN Consulting Founder Michaël van de Poppe predicted that Cardano’s token price could hit record highs of $3.09 in 2025 or 2026. The analyst projected that the token’s price would recover around $0.7460, a critical resistance point for years after the asset’s decline in 2022. With the level breached in 2024, Poppe considers it a support zone for the next price rally. However, ADA must overcome the potential resistance at the $1.2430 mark to see new highs in 2025. He added: The scenario remains the same. Pretty heavy run upwards and a 40% correction. I think we’re getting towards the end of this correction, through which I’m expecting a new leg up for things like ADA. ~ Michaël van de Poppe Some analysts are looking to Cardano’s historical performance as a guide for future price movement. In the past seven years, the ADA token’s price recorded a median 20.4% growth rate in January. That would mean if the token were to follow the same trend, the price should rise by a considerable 20% in January 2025. Moreover, in January 2023, ADA saw a 59.2% growth rate and a 90% growth rate in 2021, emphasizing the token’s success in the month. Cardano faces price drop amid elevated Fed rates Most crypto assets, including Cardano, have experienced a decline in token prices, particularly after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced that interest rates are likely to remain elevated in the coming months due to persistently high inflation. Although Fed rates have now dropped to 4.25-4.5%, the current rate may stay at this level for an extended period. At the time of writing, ADA’s token price was at $0.8381, trading down by 5.2% in the last 24 hours. Although its price has declined, Cardano’s 24-hour trading volume has surged by 48.42% to $849.09 million.

It quickly caused a frenzy in the crypto sector, giving rise to Squid Game-themed tokens. For a time, these tokens made headlines in both the crypto and entertainment worlds, but the hype was short-lived. Now, with the release of Squid Game Season 2, these tokens are seeing a resurgence. However, as history proves, profit-making in these markets comes with a risk. The Rise and Fall of the Original SQUID Token The SQUID token emerged when Squid Game became a global hit in 2021. This play-to-earn crypto asset promised quick profits to those who joined the hype early. At its peak, the token rose by over 75,000% but had no official link to Netflix or the show. Investors rushed in to lose everything when the creators executed a “rug pull,” vanishing with millions. The crash, followed by Twitter flagging the token’s official accounts as suspicious, left many investors with heavy losses, making it a cautionary tale in the crypto world. Binance Investigates: A Cautionary Tale for Crypto Enthusiasts After the SQUID token crash, Binance, a leading crypto exchange, investigated the crash. In 2023, Binance said the token was likely a scam, showing how some projects use pop culture to trick unsuspecting investors. The investigation revealed the shady side of crypto investments, where excitement and fraud often go hand in hand. In an interview, Mati Greenspan, founder of Quantum Economics, shared his concerns about the token. Greenspan noted that if Binance is looking into it for fraud, it is probably not a good investment. He also pointed out that the name “SQUID” was an unofficial copy of the popular show, showing the token’s creators lacked honesty. He advised users to research the project’s team and ensure the token is legitimate before investing in projects like SQUID. Season 2 Sparks New Interest: A Fresh Wave of Tokens As excitement for Squid Game Season 2 grows, the SQUID token and its various imitations have gained new attention in the market. The latest version of the SQUID token, built on the Ethereum blockchain, saw its value jump by 280% in just 24 hours. This increase happened earlier today. While this rise is exciting for some, it’s important to remember past lessons. The re-emergence of these tokens highlights the risks of jumping on the hype around meme coins. In an October interview, Mark Cuban, a billionaire investor and crypto supporter, expressed doubts about memecoins. He compared the memecoin market to a game of “musical chairs.” Cuban warned that all memecoins are like long-term rug pulls with no real-world value . His comments added to the skepticism surrounding the hype memecoins.

Is it innovative features, promising returns, or the potential to reshape digital finance? For many, it’s a mix of all three. A few stand out for their unique offerings and value propositions among the plethora of cryptocurrencies. Solana has gained widespread attention for its lightning-fast transactions and scalability, making it a developer go-to. Similarly, Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is redefining how decentralised web services operate, aiming to power the next generation of the Internet. Yet, apart from the rest, is Qubetics ($TICS), a project combining innovation with user-centricity. From its virtual card-enabled wallet to its impressive presale momentum, Qubetics is capturing investor interest like no other. This article will delve into the latest updates and features of Qubetics, Solana, and ICP—three of the best coins to invest in December 2024. Revolutionising Digital Transactions: The Qubetics Wallet with Virtual Card Capabilities The Qubetics Wallet has introduced a feature that could redefine how we think about digital finance: the ability to generate virtual cards directly within the application. Imagine seamlessly creating a secure, temporary card for your online purchases without worrying about exposing your primary payment methods. This innovative functionality boosts convenience and adds a critical layer of security, giving users greater control over their transactions. But the excitement doesn’t stop there. Qubetics recently hosted an AMA session , allowing its community to engage with the team, ask questions, and learn more about the platform’s roadmap. Such initiatives reflect Qubetics’ commitment to transparency and fostering trust among its growing user base. Could this be why analysts call Qubetics one of the best coins to invest in December 2024? The Scalability King: Solana’s Continuing Ascent Solana has cemented itself as a blockchain powerhouse known for its ultra-efficient design and unparalleled transaction speeds. Its proof-of-history consensus mechanism enables thousands of transactions per second, making it a developer favourite for decentralised apps and NFTs. Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, showcasing its resilience and capacity for innovation. It’s no wonder investors still consider it a strong contender in the crypto space. Pioneering the Future of the Internet: ICP’s Vision Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is carving out its niche as a pioneer in decentralised computing. By enabling web services to run directly on the blockchain, ICP aims to eliminate reliance on traditional centralised infrastructure. Its mission to create a more open and equitable internet has attracted both developers and investors, highlighting its potential as a transformative force in the digital world. Massive ROI Awaits! Why Qubetics Presale is the Best Coin to Invest in December 2024 The Qubetics presale is in its 13th phase, and time is of the essence for those seeking lucrative returns. Each phase ushers in a 10% price increase, with a final-stage jump of 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at just $0.034, with over $7 million raised, more than 10,600 holders, and 355 million tokens sold. For those eyeing an impressive ROI, consider this: after the presale, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, offering a staggering potential return for early participants. The steady rise in token value and robust community backing make Qubetics one of the best coins to invest in December 2024 . Conclusion Each of these cryptocurrencies—Qubetics, Solana, and ICP—offers unique advantages, making them top contenders among the best coins to invest in December 2024. Solana impresses with speed and scalability, ICP reimagines the internet, and Qubetics leads the charge with its forward-thinking features and outstanding presale performance. However, Qubetics ($TICS) stands out for its unmatched combination of user-centric tools, transparency, and high ROI potential. With its virtual card-enabled wallet and an ongoing presale that promises exponential returns, Qubetics is not just a cryptocurrency—it’s a movement in digital finance. Don’t wait too long, as the presale won’t last forever. Secure your stake in the future today!

I remember covering the news of MicroStrategy’s first bitcoin purchase , and I’ve watched the stock rise from $14 to $400 per share. All that time, I didn’t buy. Yet, this past Friday, for the first time since 2018, I bought stocks — specifically MicroStrategy (MSTR) and a couple other companies also holding bitcoin on their balance sheets. It was something I never thought I’d do again. In 2018, I sold all my stocks for more bitcoin when the price crashed into the $3,000 range, and I have not purchased any other asset than bitcoin since then. That changed this week. I was reading this interesting thread from Jeremy Garcia , founder and CEO of Satoshi's Journal , and he was summarizing MicroStrategy’s Q3 2024 earnings call from earlier this year. It made me come to some realizations. First, if bitcoin is going to succeed in reaching a price in the hundreds of millions and beyond, then it makes sense to get some exposure to a company that now holds 446,400 BTC, is trading in the Nasdaq 100 Index, and has the future potential of joining the S&P 500. A strategic bitcoin reserve strategy has the potential to make MicroStrategy one of the most, if not the most, valuable company in the world, and MicroStrategy is only going to continue to buy more bitcoin, according to Michael Saylor himself. If MicroStrategy is to become the world's most valuable company, then their stock price today would be extremely undervalued to what it would be at that point in the future. Why wouldn’t I buy some? I already feel dumb enough for not buying any. Sure my bitcoin has performed extremely well, but MSTR has outperformed bitcoin. I know I could just buy spot bitcoin, and maybe that’s the safest play to make. But I’ve also been accumulating bitcoin for a long time, and am interested in allocating some capital to buy shares in companies also betting on bitcoin’s future success. I would be earning more fiat that I could then take and buy more bitcoin (if the stocks outperform BTC) but even if they don’t, it gives me the opportunity to take profit and use it for life expenses. Another thing in the back of my mind is, what if something unforeseen happens in the future and I mess up and lose my bitcoin stack due to a personal error. I’ll admit, I have anxiety knowing that even though I have thought out my bitcoin custody, and taken the necessary steps to properly secure my coins, something could still go wrong. In this way, the thought of having some other assets to fall back on just in case is a positive. Look, I’m bullish on bitcoin. And if bitcoin succeeds then I think the companies, individuals, and countries adopting it will likely succeed as well. I love winning, and want to get some exposure to companies also winning big. If I am wrong on these bets then so be it, it’s only a small allocation to my overall portfolio. But the potential upside is worth the time and risk I think. None of this is financial advice, I’m just sharing my thoughts on what I’m doing as a Bitcoiner. For now, that means I’m buying MSTR. This article is a Take .

The utility token for the AI agent project ai16z ( AI16Z ) is trading for $1.52 at time of writing, up 23.7% in the past 24 hours. With a market cap of $1.65 billion, the Solana ( SOL )-based altcoin is the 79th-largest crypto project. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down nearly 2% on the day, trading for $91,998 at time of writing. The entire crypto market cap is valued at $3.36 trillion at time of writing, down 3.4% in the last 24 hours. The market strength of ai16z comes as the project is proposing a new tokenomic plan that aims to increase the utility token’s value by better leveraging the benefits of the ecosystem’s AI agent known as Eliza. “The main challenge is that while the Eliza agent framework is thriving in terms of adoption and technical innovation, the ai16z token currently lacks strong mechanisms to accrue value, leading to misaligned incentives. The partners recognize this needs to change to sustain ai16z’s momentum… Overall, there is strong consensus that major tokenomic upgrades are urgently needed to better capture the value that Eliza is creating. An official launchpad is the leading proposal, but with healthy debate on the details and trade-offs.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

However, as the crypto market matures, long-term holders reassess their portfolios, seeking projects with solid fundamentals, real-world application, and sustainable growth potential. This has led many to turn their attention to PropiChain (PCHAIN), an emerging, blockchain-powered real estate poised to power the future of the $600 trillion global real estate market. With its unique value proposition, leading industry analysts strongly project that PCHAIN will hit 40,000% growth in the coming months. PCHAIN's staggering 40,000% growth potential has made it a compelling option for Dogecoin long-term holders looking to diversify their holdings beyond memecoins. For these Dogecoin long-term holders, PropiChain's appeal lies in its innovative approach to revolutionizing the multi-trillion-dollar real estate market. By bridging the gap between traditional property markets and the blockchain, PCHAIN has positioned itself as a leader in the tokenized asset revolution. As Dogecoin investors rotate to PCHAIN for stability and transformative growth, the platform's growing ecosystem signals a huge shift in the crypto investment landscape. Dogecoin Dwindling Wave and the Emergence of PropiChain Dogecoin (DOGE) began its journey as a 'joke' crypto asset but has quickly gained traction thanks to its vibrant community, celebrity endorsements, and viral social media presence. At its peak, Dogecoin reached a market capitalization of over $80 billion in 2021. However, DOGE's reliance on community sentiment and meme culture has made it highly volatile. While many early adopters have enjoyed significant returns, long-term holders have faced challenges as the Dogecoin growth momentum has slowed in a more mature crypto market. Over the last 2 weeks, Dogecoin has lost over 20% of its market value, a growing concern for long-term investors. However, the emergence of PropiChain has brought a glimmer of hope as the project promises a 40,000% growth potential in a few months. As a revolutionary blockchain-based real estate platform, PropiChain uses smart contracts, artificial intelligence, the Metaverse, and RWA tokenization technology to redefine the future of the $600 trillion global real estate. What sets PCHAIN apart is its dual appeal to risk-averse investors and growth-seekers. The platform's emphasis on tokenizing tangible real estate properties offers stability that is often missing in assets like Dogecoin. Also, its innovative approach and early-stage development offer up to 40,000% upside potential. Why Dogecoin Holders Are Rotating to PropiChain Several factors are driving the migration of Dogecoin holders to PCHAIN: Enhanced Utility While DOGE's primary use case remains a digital currency for tipping and small transactions, PropiChain's tokenized asset model offers tangible real-world applications. This utility ensures that PCHAIN's value is backed by the world's number one asset class. Stability Through Real Assets PCHAIN's integration of real estate assets into its ecosystem provides uncommon security in the crypto space. This stability protects investors from the highly volatile crypto market, making PCHAIN investment a low-risk and high-reward venture. Market Timing & Growth Potential With its potential to deliver 40,000% growth in a few months, PCHAIN is positioning itself as a high-reward investment opportunity. The broader crypto market has entered a consolidation phase, and many investors are seeking projects with strong fundamentals. PCHAIN's focus on real-world assets aligns well with this shift in the crypto investment landscape. PropiChain's Quest to Revolutionize the Global Real Estate Market PropiChain (PCHAIN) is transforming the global real estate market by harnessing cutting-edge technologies such as smart contracts, artificial intelligence (AI), the Metaverse, and tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA). PCHAIN streamlines property management through smart contracts, automating key processes such as leasing and lease renewals. These automated solutions minimize reliance on intermediaries, reduce transaction costs, and enhance transparency and efficiency in real estate transactions. The platform provides investors 24/7 tailored support through AI-powered virtual assistants and chatbots. It offers comprehensive guidance at every stage of investors' investment journey. With advanced predictive AI tools, PCHAIN delivers in-depth market forecasts, enabling investors to identify emerging lucrative opportunities. Another standout feature of the platform is its integration of the Metaverse, which allows for immersive property exploration using virtual reality and 3D visualization technologies. This innovation lets investors virtually tour properties from anywhere in the world, eliminating the need for physical visits. The tokenization of real estate assets represents a groundbreaking development for the real estate sector. By converting real estate properties into digital tokens, the PCHAIN facilitates fractional ownership, making it possible for investors with modest capital to invest in portions of high-value properties. PropiChain is redefining real estate investment by merging innovative technologies with user-centric solutions. Its unique combination of AI insights, virtual property exploration, asset tokenization, and automated smart contract capabilities makes it a game-changer in the industry, offering unprecedented opportunities for investors worldwide. Conclusion The shift from Dogecoin to PropiChain marks a significant evolution in investor behavior within the crypto space. With PCHAIN's 40,000% growth potential, your $1000 investment in the ongoing PCHAIN presale would yield a staggering $400,000 ROI. Join the presale now to enjoy such massive returns on your investment. The project raised over $1.3 million during the first presale round and has reached $500,000 in the ongoing second presale round. This indicates investors' confidence in the project and its potential. The token price will increase from $0.011 to $0.023 for the third and final presale round. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the project's smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities. Additionally, the token is listed on CoinMarketCap , increasing accessibility and visibility to potential investors.

Local Korean news outlet The Hankyoreh reports that the Seoul Southern District Court has sentenced the 55-year-old to two years behind bars and ordered him to pay a fine of 52 million won ($35,367) for receiving money and lavish items as bribes from businessman Kang Jong-hyun. Kang allegedly shelled out 3 billion won (roughly $2 million) in cash and over $272,000 worth of luxury watches, designer bags and exclusive restaurant membership cards to get a coin listed on Bithumb. Kang received a sentence of one year and six months of jail time for breach of trust charges. The bribery scheme also involved former professional golfer Ahn Sung-hyun, who served as the middleman responsible for receiving and delivering the cash and goods. The court said that he deceived Kang when he took a large portion of the money intended for Lee. Ahn was sentenced to four years and six months in prison. Bithumb is South Korea’s largest crypto exchange by daily trading volume and a coin listing can potentially drive up prices. The price of PONKE ( PONKE ) and Raydium ( RAY ) surged after the platform announced spot trading support for these two Solana ( SOL )-based crypto assets last month.

Staking activity has kept rising while ETH retreated to $3,400, a 16% drop from its December peak. Related Reading: Whales Are Back: Dogecoin Price Forecast Soars To $20 Due to investors staking record amounts of ETH, the total staked assets have exceeded expectations. Even while short-term price fluctuations have led some to doubt Ethereum’s viability, this surge in staking is a sign of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term worth. Investor Confidence Indicated By ETF Inflows Another significant development is the increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are concentrated on Ethereum. The net total of $2.68 billion has been amassed over the past 25 days, with ETF inflows recorded on 23 days. On December 27, the total net assets of ETFs exceeded $12 billion as a result of the nearly $48 million in daily inflows, data from SoSoValue shows. The Ethereum ETF offered by BlackRock has garnered the majority of these investments, underscoring the institutional interest in ETH in defiance of the recent price decline. The popularity of Ethereum spot ETF reflects the larger crypto market, in which ETFs are starting to be a preferred choice for both institutional and ordinary investors. On the other hand, significant inflows of Bitcoin ETFs in recent months suggest that traditional financial markets are progressively welcoming digital assets. Price Action And Broader Market Dynamics Ethereum’s price decline, on the other hand, illuminates an alternative narrative. Ether’s price drop is likely to be driven by profit-taking following its recent rally and broader macroeconomic uncertainties, as the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. Regulatory pressures and concerns about the likelihood of another interest rate rise have accentuated the cautious mentality of traders. Despite the slump, some analysts see this as a time of consolidation rather than cause for worry. They note that Ethereum’s staking and ETF inflows are strong markers of long-term market confidence. Broader Perspective Ethereum’s most recent advancements occur amid an atmosphere of optimism regarding its ecosystem. Continued attention is being drawn to recent enhancements, such as the transition to proof-of-stake and ongoing scalability improvements. These developments are enabling Ethereum to preserve its leadership in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Related Reading: Bitcoin As A Strategic Asset?

In his statement, Mow called the concerns uninformed or agenda-driven, highlighting Tether’s strong market position and historical resilience. With $143 billion in assets under management (AUM), Tether is far from vulnerable, Mow said. “The time of FUD was when the company probably had less than $100 million in assets,” he said, adding that Tether is now one of the top 20 holders of U.S. Treasuries, outpacing all but 18 countries in treasury holdings. Mow also noted the importance of Cantor Fitzgerald, a major financial services firm that backs Tether. According to Mow, Cantor Fitzgerald’s CEO, who has been nominated as the future US Secretary of Commerce, is an indication of the stablecoin’s institutional credibility. Related News: Great Whale's Trouble: He Opened a Long Position in Bitcoin, Lost $6.7 Million, Paid $667,000 in Fees Mow noted Tether’s leadership in the stablecoin market, with trading volumes 16 times that of its closest rival, USD Coin (USDC), and Tether’s role in serving hundreds of millions of users in the southern hemisphere, where it has become a vital tool for financial inclusion. Taking aim at Tether’s critics, Mow offered a “friendly historical reminder” of the events surrounding Bitcoin’s controversial on-chain forks. He accused Coinbase and Circle, the companies behind USDC, of trying to fork Bitcoin and take control of the network. In response, Mow credited Tether’s team for creating on-chain split markets that played a key role in preventing the rise of “fake Bitcoin forks.” *This is not investment advice.

The analyst views the idea of the Dogecoin price reaching a $10 target as akin to chasing fairies in the current market. As a result, another analyst is advising investors to consider more stable and innovative opportunities like WallitIQ (WLTQ) .

Analyst Calls Out The Dogecoin Price $10 Target: Is It Time For Investors To Move On? The $10 Dogecoin price target has been making headlines, but an analyst has dismissed it as an unrealistic fantasy. With Dogecoin price falling over 22% in the past week and struggling to maintain momentum, the analyst argues that for Dogecoin price to reach a $10 target, it would require a massive market cap and rapid surge that the Dogecoin price recent trajectory cannot realistically support. Meanwhile, another analyst is drawing attention to WallitIQ (WLTQ) as a far more promising investment opportunity, citing the altcoin’s 30,000% growth potential, robust utility, and the strong demand seen in its presale.

As institutional and retail investors poured into the crypto market, ADA enjoyed a brief rally, positioning itself as one of the top altcoins benefiting from the bullish sentiment. However, despite the ongoing rally, the Cardano price has struggled to sustain its momentum, failing to break past the critical $1 resistance level. In contrast, PropiChain (PCHAIN) has emerged as a standout performer, attracting significant inflows from ADA whales. Cardano Price Struggles Below $1 Amid Market Decline The Cardano price at $0.9473 today has seen a significant decline, dropping over 18.86% over the past week and 7.98% in the past month. This downturn is largely driven by the broader cryptocurrency market’s bearish sentiment, with major assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) also facing losses. Profit-taking after earlier gains has also increased selling pressure on ADA, while technical indicators suggest further declines in the Cardano price if key support levels are breached. In response, ADA whales are reallocating funds after an underwhelming month. With all other major utility altcoins and even meme coins facing double-digit declines, many are seeking out the best crypto presale projects to invest in now as they offer a low entry point and potential for explosive gains. ADA Whales Turn to PropiChain (PCHAIN) as Cardano Price Drops Compared to Cardano (ADA), PropiChain (PCHAIN) possesses an even greater revolutionary potential, as the platform aims to tackle the $634 trillion real estate industry's most persistent challenges. This innovative platform is set to redefine how we approach real estate investing, combining cutting-edge blockchain technology, RWA tokenization, smart contracts, metaverse, and artificial intelligence. Although real estate is one of the largest and most lucrative industries in the world, its traditional structure is riddled with fraud, high entry barriers, rigidity, and inefficiencies. For decades, only high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors could access premium real estate opportunities. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is changing all of that. Through fractional ownership , PropiChain allows investors to trade fractions of high-value properties, transforming real estate from an exclusive asset class into one that’s accessible to everyone. With just a few hundred dollars, users can now own shares of premium properties, opening up a trillion-dollar market to millions of new participants. This tokenization of real estate not only democratizes participation but also injects liquidity into a traditionally illiquid sector by allowing for instant property transactions that usually take 44 days on average. Furthermore, PropiChain’s blockchain technology ensures every transaction is secure, transparent, and immutable. By recording ownership and transaction details on an incorruptible ledger, PropiChain eliminates the risk of property fraud, one of the most pervasive issues in the industry. The platform’s smart contract capabilities further streamline operations for asset managers. Tedious tasks like asset leasing, rent collection, and lease renewals are automated, saving asset managers both time and money by reducing operational costs, eliminating expensive middlemen, and ensuring efficiency. Adding another layer of innovation is PropiChain integration of AI-powered tools, which are free for all PCHAIN holders . These tools empower users to make better investment decisions with predictive analytics, personalized property search experience, instant property valuations, and automatic asset trading. Cardano Price Rally Stalls Below $1, PropiChain Set to Explode 17,409% With the Cardano price plummeting after failing to capitalize on the Bitcoin (BTC) rally, investors are now skeptical about the token’s potential to blast past $1 like its rival, XRP. Now, as the broader crypto market declines, Cardano whales eagerly seek out the best altcoins to buy now, with many pointing to PropiChain (PCHAIN). Considering PropiChain's disruptive potential in one of the largest industries and PCHAIN's 17,409% growth potential , it's no surprise why the presale has raised almost $2 million in record time. Forget the Cardano Price – PropiChain Presents 17,409% Opportunity Amid rising bearish sentiments, investors are seeking out stable, realistic, high-potential investments moving forward. Considering the rising interest in RWA tokenization projects, especially from Wall Street giants like BlackRock, PropiChain (PCHAIN) is shaping up to become one of the best cryptos to buy for 2025 . Already, the PropiChain presale has seen massive participation, with almost $2 million worth of PCHAIN altcoins acquired just weeks into the presale. While many regret missing round one, the second round is offering investors a whopping 17,409% returns, potentially turning a $1,500 investment into $262,635 by Q1. However, the window to acquire PCHAIN today at $0.011 is almost gone as the presale traffic tripled following news of early success in the first round, along with trust and excitement around the BlockAudit security audit and PropiChain getting listed on CoinMarketCap . While many investors lament the negative Cardano price movements, ADA whales are piling investments into PropiChain as this is the lowest the PCHAIN price will ever be again from today.

This development comes as the Zeus Network aims to enhance cross-chain liquidity and expand decentralized finance (DeFi) options. zBTC Brings Bitcoin to Solana’s DeFi Ecosystem The Zeus Network has successfully launched zBTC, a trustless, tokenized version of Bitcoin, on the Solana blockchain. zBTC allows users to engage with DeFi applications on Solana while retaining Bitcoin’s original security and value through a 1:1 peg with native BTC. Post the announcement, Zeus Network token ZEUS saw a price surge of over 4% as of press time trading at $0.7427. As per the network, zBTC launch is a major step in opening up cross-chain liquidity between Bitcoin and Solana blockchains. Bitcoin owners can now stake their assets into Solana’s DeFi market to generate returns without sacrificing the security of their BTC. “The First Permissionless BTC Now Live on Solana!” @ApolloByZeus , the Bitcoin liquidity terminal, has officially launched Mainnet v1, bringing $zBTC to @solana . The Zeus Ecosystem kicks off a new era of cross-chain liquidity utilization, transforming on-chain Bitcoin DeFi.… pic.twitter.com/0PEpbx7pJ3 — Zeus Network (EPOCH 1) (@ZeusNetworkHQ) December 30, 2024 This integration is enabled by the Zeus Program Library (ZPL) and the ZeusNode infrastructure which provide a secure and efficient way for performing Bitcoin transactions across different chains. APOLLO Enables Bitcoin Yield Opportunities APOLLO, the first dApp in the Network ecosystem, has been introduced in the market together with the launch of zBTC. The APOLLO platform aims to function as a Bitcoin liquidity terminal where users can gain access to various investment options and generate consistent returns on their BTC in Solana’s DeFi sphere. This feature guarantees that the Bitcoin assets are safe on the Bitcoin blockchain network while being actively used in Solana’s fast and scalable ecosystem. In its first phase, APOLLO has started enabling selected customers to mint zBTC after staking their Bitcoin. This feature opens up Solana for BTC holders to interact with DeFi dApps on the layer while at the same time provide a smooth Bitcoin to zBTC conversion. Cross-Chain Liquidity Framework Sets New Standards The Zeus Network’s ZeusNode architecture and ZPL are the key enablers of this innovation. These technologies allow for the validation, tokenization and transacting of Bitcoin on the Solana network without having to change Bitcoin’s original protocol. This cross-chain liquidity solution provides a safe transfer between the Bitcoin and Solana networks, with cheaper and faster transactions than on Bitcoin’s chain. Implementing a multi-party computation (MPC) model, ZeusNode Guardians guarantee that Bitcoin transactions on Solana are fully trustless and secure. This harmonized validation structure ensures the validity of the transactions and also enables integration of Bitcoin in the Solana blockchain. The network also shared that it aims to enhance its functionality and include UTXO-based cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Kaspa within the ecosystem by the year 2025. Zeus Network Roadmap and Ecosystem Growth Zeus Network has set goals for its ecosystem, starting with plans to onboard 1% of Bitcoin liquidity to Solana by mid-2025. The network aims to manage 2,250 BTC during this period, further strengthening its position in the cross-chain DeFi market. Additionally, the Zeus Program Library will be open-sourced in 2025 to encourage developers to build new applications within the Zeus ecosystem. This move is expected to attract more decentralized applications and drive broader adoption of cross-chain Bitcoin liquidity solutions. Justin Wang, co-founder and CEO of Zeus Network, stated, “Zeus Network and its Guardians are redefining Bitcoin’s liquidity utilization, providing permissionless pathways for Bitcoin integration on Solana.” The post Zeus Network Launches zBTC On Solana Unlocking Bitcoin Yield Potential appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Blockchain News|solana|Zeus Network (ZEUS),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-30 20:12:23

A time when the global economy seemed to collapse in on itself, but those who had the foresight to invest during the chaos emerged stronger. Well, the crypto world is no stranger to its own roller-coaster moments, and BTFD Coin is a prime example of seizing the right opportunity at the right time. With its presale surging past $4.6 million in just the first month, many are starting to ask: Is BTFD Coin the next big meme coin to hold long-term? When it comes to meme coins, the landscape has evolved dramatically. Initially, meme coins were mostly seen as novelties, jokes in the vast crypto market. But over time, they’ve gained real traction, becoming more serious investment opportunities. So, how does BTFD Coin stack up against other projects like Turbo and COQ Inu? Let’s dive in and explore what makes BTFD Coin a top contender among the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term. In this article, we’ll explore three key players in the meme coin space: BTFD Coin, Turbo, and COQ Inu Protocol. Each one has its unique proposition, but BTFD Coin seems to be setting a new standard with its innovative features, community-driven approach, and impressive presale performance. By the end of this article, you’ll understand why BTFD Coin might be the most compelling investment opportunity in the meme coin space right now. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Revolution BTFD Coin has quickly become one of the most talked-about meme coins in the crypto market. In less than a month, it has already raised over $4.6 million in its presale, attracting more than 7,000 holders who are eager to join the movement. Starting at a presale price of $0.000004 per coin, BTFD has now surged to $0.000142 as it enters Stage 13. This rapid growth highlights the overwhelming demand for BTFD Coin and the widespread belief that it’s set to achieve remarkable milestones in the crypto world. With over 60 billion $BTFD coins sold, the community continues to expand, rallying behind the coin’s mission and meme culture. Don’t miss out—use the BIG50 code during the presale to unlock extra coins and maximize your holdings! The buzz surrounding BTFD Coin is not just because of its potential price increase, but because of the features that make it stand out. BTFD is introducing a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, a referral program, staking rewards, and a strong, engaged community that could lead to a substantial long-term value increase. By offering these innovative features, BTFD Coin is positioning itself to be more than just a meme coin; it’s building a lasting ecosystem that appeals to both gamers and investors alike. If you’re wondering why now is the time to jump in, consider this: during the 1973 economic collapse, many investors made the mistake of pulling out during the panic. Those who bought the dips came out on top. Similarly, now could be your chance to take advantage of the BTFD presale before its price skyrockets after the full launch. If you’re thinking about long-term gains, the BTFD Coin presale is one of the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term. $BTFD draws inspiration from the resilience shown by legends like Warren Buffett during the 1973 financial crash. At $0.000142 in Stage 13, it’s an opportunity to buy low and watch your investment grow. Boost your portfolio with the BIG50 bonus! Use code BIG50 during your purchase to gain 50% extra tokens. For example, 100 coins bought means 150 in hand. Don’t miss this chance to secure $BTFD now. Turbo: A Promising Meme Coin but Not Without Its Challenges Turbo has carved out a niche for itself in the meme coin space, boasting a solid community and a focus on real utility in the crypto world. With a lower presale price and a roadmap that promises to incorporate more blockchain-based features, Turbo aims to be a more serious contender for investors looking for long-term growth. However, despite its ambitions, it doesn’t quite have the same explosive growth trajectory as BTFD Coin. Turbo has made strides with its unique approach to governance and staking rewards, but it lacks the same level of excitement and hype surrounding its presale. While its community is growing steadily, it’s still a far cry from the numbers BTFD Coin is pulling in. Turbo also faces tough competition from more established projects, making it harder to maintain momentum. When comparing Turbo to BTFD Coin, the major differentiator is the pace and strength of the presale. Turbo is certainly one to keep an eye on, but for now, it doesn’t have the same magnetic pull or promising ROI that BTFD Coin offers. If you’re after one of the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term, BTFD Coin may be a better bet. COQ Inu Protocol: A Different Kind of Meme Coin COQ Inu Protocol has been garnering attention for its unique take on the meme coin trend. Unlike other meme coins that rely heavily on community-driven hype, COQ Inu aims to create a more structured, decentralized platform. Its focus is on creating a protocol that enhances DeFi (Decentralized Finance) capabilities and offers more than just the promise of a meme coin. While COQ Inu’s roadmap includes some intriguing plans for tokenomics and future partnerships, its presale performance has not been as exciting as BTFD Coin’s. With a smaller, less active community and fewer tokens sold, COQ Inu has yet to capture the same level of investor interest. It’s still in the early stages of its development and, unlike BTFD Coin, doesn’t seem to have the same viral energy driving its growth. For investors looking for the best meme coin presales to buy and hold for the long term, COQ Inu could be an interesting option—but it doesn’t quite offer the same level of immediate potential or return as BTFD Coin.

In contrast, meme coins and modularity projects have experienced significant declines in the last 30 days. Winners and Losers The latest data from Web3 analytics platform Dexu AI shows that AI agents generated an impressive 72.2% return over the past month, led by ai16z (AI16Z) and Phala Network’s PHALA token. At that time, AI16Z saw its value rise by nearly 295%, while PHALA added 209% to its price. Other strong performers here were Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), which gained 132% in 30 days, and the crypto market intelligence token AiXBT, which rose by 125%. Recently, Bitfinex posited that AI agents could revolutionize crypto with their ability to perform tasks like executing transactions, managing digital wallets, and crafting investment strategies. However, the category wasn’t the only success story in December. Centralized exchange (CEX) tokens also performed well, with the narrative climbing 41.37% across the month. Further, the “sweat-spot” sector, which focuses on projects combining blockchain functionality with user-focused applications, saw a respectable 24.4% rise. Other traditional spaces, such as decentralized finance (DeFi) and derivatives, experienced relatively smaller but steady growth at 13.2% and 12.3%, respectively. Additionally, real-world assets (RWA) also did well, gaining 7.21%. Nevertheless, the previous 30 days were not so profitable for the rest of the narratives. The retractions were led by the modularity category, which lost 32.1%, and low-risk tokens (LRTs), which dipped by 30.8%. Meme coins also saw a substantial 28.7% decline, possibly reflecting investor fatigue. This was despite a recent Binance report indicating that such tokens had overtaken Bitcoin and Ethereum in terms of ownership. Per data from CoinGecko, many of the highest-capped assets in the category, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK), saw their prices dip by double digits over 30 days. The biggest casualty among them was dogwifhat (WIF), shedding nearly 41% of its value in that period. Additionally, GameFi, privacy tokens, and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) also experienced losses, with GameFi sinking 21.78% and privacy coins dropping 12.46%. L1s Top Market Cap In terms of market capitalization, Layer 1 (L1) blockchains remain dominant at $2.75 trillion, pushed mainly by Bitcoin’s $1.85 trillion valuation. Centralized exchange tokens boast the second-highest worth at just over $129 billion, followed closely by meme coins, which, despite a generally poor December, are still valued at nearly $86 billion per Dexu AI. Categories like DeFi and AI follow a bit further behind, with the former capped at just under $39 billion and the latter valued at slightly over $23 billion. Narratives with the smallest market size include privacy coins, LRTs, and decentralized science (DeSci). As of December 30, privacy coins were capped at $2.72 billion, while DeSci remains a niche sector priced at only $284 million.

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts, get ready! The week is packed with potential, and if you’re hunting for the best crypto to buy this week, it’s time to focus on projects that stand out with innovative use cases and long-term growth potential. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to crypto, these three top-tier cryptos could redefine your portfolio. Let’s explore why Web3Bay, Solana, and HNT (Helium Network Token) are worth considering right now. 1. Web3Bay: Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Blockchain Technology Looking for the best crypto to buy this week? Web3Bay ($3BAY) is reshaping the e-commerce world with its decentralized, blockchain-powered marketplace. This project is eliminating traditional barriers like high transaction fees and limited payment options, creating a platform where merchants and consumers can interact seamlessly. Unlike conventional e-commerce platforms, Web3Bay is fully decentralized, ensuring users have complete control over their data and transactions. It combines cryptocurrency payments with traditional options like PayPal, making it accessible to both blockchain enthusiasts and casual shoppers. For merchants, particularly in underbanked regions, Web3Bay opens doors to global markets without the need for traditional banking systems. What makes Web3Bay stand out as one of the best cryptos to buy this week is its presale structure. Currently priced at just $0.00345, 3BAY tokens offer early investors a ground-floor opportunity. With a 15% price increase at each presale stage and projected returns of over 500x, the platform’s growth potential is immense. Key features include: Decentralized Marketplace: Offers transparency and user-driven operations. Low Transaction Fees: Leverages blockchain to minimize costs. Hybrid Payment Options: Supports both crypto and fiat payments. Security and Governance: Utilizes smart contracts and a DAO model for decentralized decision-making. If you’re searching for a project with tangible utility and exponential growth potential, Web3Bay could easily be the best crypto to buy this week. 2. Solana: Lightning-Fast Transactions for Modern Blockchain Applications In the past week, Solana has demonstrated significant activity within the cryptocurrency market. On December 23, 2024, the Solana network achieved a record-breaking 72.8 million transactions in a single day, surpassing the combined total of other major blockchains. This milestone underscores Solana’s scalability and efficiency, reinforcing its position as a leading platform for decentralized applications. Despite this achievement, Solana’s price has experienced volatility, with reports indicating a decline of over 30% since late November. The platform’s thriving ecosystem and strong developer community continue to push boundaries, making Solana an attractive option for both short-term gains and long-term potential. If speed, efficiency, and utility are what you’re after, Solana is undoubtedly among the best crypto to buy this week. 3. HNT (Helium Network Token): Decentralizing Wireless Connectivity Helium, known for its decentralized wireless network for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, has garnered attention due to recent market movements. Analysts have noted that HNT’s price is testing key levels as momentum appears to soften, suggesting potential challenges ahead. Despite short-term gains, technical indicators present mixed signals regarding its future trend. Additionally, Helium’s price predictions indicate a potential rise to $11 in 2024, with expectations of reaching new record highs by 2030. These projections are based on Helium’s innovative approach to decentralized connectivity and its expanding network of active nodes. Investors are advised to consider both the current market sentiment and Helium’s long-term prospects when evaluating HNT as an investment opportunity. Closing Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out on This Week’s Top Picks Timing is everything in the world of crypto, and the week offers the perfect chance to evaluate, strategize, and invest in projects that align with your goals.

Trump the Grinch (TRUMPGRI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPGRI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump the Grinch can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump the Grinch could become the next viral memecoin. Trump the Grinch launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump the Grinch on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump the Grinch by entering its contract address – 93BLFCVkzBwnSUUjiyaVRQSpjEvaXdZe3oS3iyHnhind – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPGRI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 20:22:00

However, recent weeks have seen a sharp downturn for Chainlink, mirroring losses across the broader cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin. This downturn has wiped billions from the market’s value. Despite these challenges, as the year draws to a close, Chainlink’s price appears set for potential gains eyeing ATH. Can Chainlink Price Price Hit ATH In January? The LINK price stands at $21.02, reflecting a slight decrease of 1.24% over the past day. The digital asset saw a fluctuation between $20.10 and $21.73 throughout the day. Despite the day’s volatility, many analysts are speculating whether the asset could surpass its historical peak of $52.88 achieved on May 10, 2021. This resilience could signal a bullish outlook as we approach the new year. The MACD indicator, reflecting a convergence away from the zero line, suggests growing bullish momentum. If the bullish trend continues, LINK price prediction could surge to $30, then $40, potentially hitting $52, marking a new all-time high. However, if bears mount more pressure, the LINK could break below the support levels. Chainlink Price Chart: TradingView Chainlink Price Set for Major Growth by 2025 Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe has recently highlighted a new upward trend in the Chainlink price relative to Bitcoin. He notes that Chainlink establishes a higher low, indicating a potential surge. Despite this promising trend, he points out that Chainlink’s current valuation compared to Bitcoin remains significantly low. Van de Poppe predicts a substantial rise in LINK’s value by 2025, suggesting it could reach new heights. This optimism is based on key technical resistance points that, once overcome, could lead to stronger upward movements. Source: Tweet Ali charts signal a promising opportunity for Chainlink traders. The latest analysis on the 12-hour chart through the TD Sequential indicates a potential uptick in LINK’s price. Investors are encouraged to consider this moment to enhance their positions. Source: X If Bitcoin’s price resumes its upward momentum toward $100K in 2025, Chainlink price could capitalize on the bullish market sentiment. With strong technical indicators and rising investor confidence, LINK might surpass its previous ATH, solidifying its position in the crypto ecosystem.

Since its launch, the presale has generated over $680,000. 2025 is upon us, and there is still time left to get your hands on Solana’s latest memecoin marvel, Husky Inu (HINU). The project’s recently launched presale has exceeded all expectations since going live and is expected to exceed all expectations in the upcoming year. Let’s look at why the expectations for Husky Inu are so great. Shiba Inu Welcomes a New Friend: Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu (HINU) is still a pup and has already made its mark in the crypto world. The memecoin made a strong entrance, positioning itself as a strong contender against memecoin giants Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Husky Inu is marketed as Shiba Inu’s new best friend and is trying to dominate the memecoin market. Husky Inu and its native token, HINU, aim to add value and utility to its holders. The duo are working to build a robust, supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently launched the presale for HINU, which has captured significant attention from investors. The project has big things in store for its backers, with plans to launch an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). Husky Inu’s Earn App users will receive HINU tokens as a reward for engaging with the project and completing tasks such as liking, reposting, and sharing content. The DEX will facilitate decentralized trading, enhancing utility and value for HINU holders. Since going live, the project has raised over $680,000 in presale. Expectations Are High for Husky Inu (HINU) Husky Inu made a name for itself thanks to its commitment to a reliable token ecosystem. It achieves this through a carefully designed distribution model and capped maximum supply. Husky Inu also boasts a host of unique features, including: Capped Token Supply: HINU tokens are limited to 100 billion to ensure scarcity and value retention. Deflationary Mechanism: 50% of all Husky Inu Exchange and DEX platform fees will be used to buy back and burn HINU tokens to reduce the circulating supply over time. Early Investment Opportunity: Husky Inu successfully launched the HINU presale, allowing early backers to buy their stake for a humble $0.00012500 per token. Charity Voting: 5% of the total Husky Inu (HINU) token supply will be allocated to community rewards and charity, supporting user-voted charities and goodwill causes. Speedy Transactions: Husky Inu leverages the speed and scalability of the powerful Solana blockchain to bring users quick, low-cost transactions. How Can I Join the HINU Presale? Buying Husky Inu presale tokens is very simple, and the project provides guidelines for purchasing HINU tokens today. Husky Inu recommends following the step-by-step guide below: Step 1: Connect a Wallet The presale widget can be found on the top of Husky Inu’s webpage. To get started, users can connect their wallets using various options. Should you encounter any issues or cannot connect, please contact Husky Inu’s official Telegram Channel. Step 2: Select a Network After connecting your wallet, users can join the HINU presale on the Solana chain. You can purchase HINU tokens using native currency or with BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, DOGE, TRX, DASH, BCH, or USDT on Ethereum Tron chains. Step 3: Buy Tokens After completing the first two steps, you can move on to step 3. Specify the amount of BTC, ETH, BNB, LTC, USDT, DOGE, TRX, DASH, or BCH you would like to trade for $HINU, and then approve the transaction in your wallet. Remember that you will not receive tokens immediately during the presale but can claim them once it has concluded.

The border cryptocurrency market remained in a downward trajectory as bearish sentiment prevailed. The overall cryptocurrency market capitalisation dropped 4.3% in the past 24 hours to $3.36 trillion as of press time. The crypto fear and greed index dropped by 4 points to 50 from yesterday’s 54, signalling a shift towards neutral sentiment as traders adopt a more cautious stance in the face of uncertain market conditions. Why is BTC falling? Today, Bitcoin traders reacted to the looming US debt ceiling deadline as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Congress that the U.S. could hit its borrowing limit between January 14 and 23. Fears of a US default are rising because Congress has a limited window to raise or suspend the debt ceiling, and political gridlock often delays decisive action. If lawmakers fail to act in time, the US risks running out of cash to meet its financial obligations, which could trigger significant economic consequences. During such scenarios, investors tend to pull back from volatile assets, seeking safety in more stable options. Interestingly, while Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against economic instability, it has consistently underperformed in the days following debt ceiling resolutions. Bitcoin also dropped as bearish technicals appeared on its daily chart. Earlier in the day, veteran trader Peter Brandt flagged a head and shoulders top pattern on the BTC/USD chart. This is a classic reversal pattern that indicates a shift from a bullish to a bearish trend. It is usually followed by a price drop if it’s confirmed. Based on the chart, a daily close below the neckline at around $90,000 would validate the pattern. If this breakdown happens, Bitcoin could see a drop towards the $78,000 level in the coming weeks, according to the analyst. Adding to the narrative, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted a lack of support below the $93,000 mark. IntoTheBlock data shows a sharp drop in buying interest in this price range, with fewer Bitcoin addresses holding BTC below this level. With Bitcoin now trading at $91,863.90, this lack of support becomes even more critical. This means that if Bitcoin fails to reclaim $93,000, there’s little structural support to prevent further downturn. Yet the long-term narrative remained bullish as many analysts reiterated that corrections are normal during bull runs, and Bitcoin has averaged 30% pullbacks during past cycles. One bullish case was offered by trader and influencer Jason A. Williams, who told his X followers that the biggest digital currency was trading in an accumulation zone, which could lay the foundation for a break out above $131,000 by Q1 2025. Fellow analyst Moustache reinforced the narrative, pointing to a bullish megaphone pattern that BTC had formed over 3.5 years and was currently retesting. Once confirmed, he added that this could push prices above six figures once again. Upon writing, BTC was down over 2% on the day, trading at $91,943. Meanwhile, losses were more pronounced across the altcoin market, with only the best-performing crypto among the top 99 tokens managing to secure double-digit gains, as the altcoin season index remained below 50. The top altcoin gainers for the day were: ai16z ai16z (AI16Z) has gained over 20% in the past 24 hours, bringing its market cap to over $1.6 billion when writing. Its daily trading had fallen 17.6% to $115 million after starting the day with a trading volume of $202 million. Source: CoinMarketCap AI16Z deviated from the broader crypto market downturn after the project shared a plan to update its tokenomics to add more utility to its native token. Ai16z is an AI-focused venture capital fund powered by meme fund launcher Daos.fun. According to its updated tokenomics, the project plans to create an open-source Pump.fun inspired launch pad for its AI projects. Fees generated from the platform will be used to buy back AI16Z tokens from the market and create a liquidity pool. The project also plans to utilize the token as the base currency within its agent-run ecosystem. The updated tokenomics of the project and the increased utility of AI16Z tokens seem to have drawn investor interest. Lido DAO Over the past day, LDO rose 3.2%, trading at $1.84 while its market cap stood at $1.63 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap While there was no particular reason for the recent gains in LDO, the altcoin rallied on the back of a significant surge in trading activity and rising open interest. Data shows a 41.48% increase in trading volume to $193.01 million and a 3.73% rise in open interest to $128.75 million. Traders were likely positioning themselves in anticipation of further gains once momentum returns to the market, considering Lido is the largest defi protocol in terms of total value locked. Ethena Ethena (ENA) rose 2.2% over the past day, exchanging hands at $0.95 per coin while its market cap rose to over $2.7 billion at press time. The altcoin trading volume over the past day was up 85.9% at $500 million. Source: CoinMarketCap ENA bucked from the broader market trend as the research arm of Grayscale added ENA as one of the top 20 crypto assets to perform well in Q1 2025. The recognition gained from such a prominent firm has likely strengthened investor interest in the altcoin and helped it rally amid a falling market. Whales also helped keep ENA in the green as large holder net flows flipped from a $5.14 million outflow on December 28 to a $664,000 inflow on December 29. Though the inflows from whale holders seem modest compared to the recent outflows, it has likely reignited fresh interest among retail traders likely contributing to the token’s price gain.

To read full editions, subscribe . There was no shortage of crypto price predictions this year, particularly (it seemed) in November and December after the election. Some had been eyeing the $125,000 level for BTC at the end of 2024, while others did warn of a pullback . Where we stood at 2:10 pm ET Monday: BTC at ~$94,300 and ETH at ~$3,400. Bitcoin has dropped roughly 12% since rising above $108,000 on Dec. 17. Ether was trading higher than the $4,000 mark that day, but has fallen 15% since. 21Shares research strategist Matt Mena attributed this in part to the more hawkish vibes from the Fed heading into 2025. The forecast of two rate cuts next year (instead of three) “dampened market sentiment and is a key factor behind the recent downturn in prices for BTC, ETH and other risk assets,” he argued. Mena also noted that the six-month high in the 10-year Treasury yield further diminishes the appeal of crypto assets, as investors shift toward safer and more predictable returns. Then there’re those who are locking in gains realized over the year, Mena said. At the same time, others are employing tax-loss harvesting strategies — selling assets that have declined in value to offset capital gains and reduce taxable income . He and other analysts have called this a “healthy” correction, typical for bitcoin after a significant run-up. If BTC can stay above $85,000, the 21Shares exec told me he thinks it will sustain the uptrend seen in recent months. Otherwise, we could see accelerated selling and further price declines. “The next major psychological price level to watch is $110,000,” Mena added. “Once bitcoin breaks through this resistance, we could see a swift surge to $120,000, with the potential to target $150,000 by the summer as momentum builds.” Sergei Gorev, head of risk at YouHodler, predicts the corrective sentiment in the crypto market to persist into 2025. He cited the historical correlation between BTC and the declining M2 money supply as a key factor. But Galaxy’s Alex Thorn wrote in a Friday research note that he expects BTC to ultimately reach 20% of gold’s market capitalization in 2025 (it’s currently slightly more than 10%). Thorn thinks BTC will cross $150,000 in the year’s first half — as well as a “test or best” of $185,000 in Q4.“A combination of institutional, corporate and nation state adoption will propel bitcoin to new heights in 2025,” the Galaxy research head wrote. “Throughout its existence, bitcoin has appreciated faster than all other asset classes, particularly the S&P 500 and gold, and that trend will continue in 2025.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

However, this has not made the $HYPE airdrop any less successful as the token accumulates gains of nearly 275% since it hit the secondary market according to data from CoinMarketCap. Despite its temporary weakness, high-profile crypto analysts are enthusiastic about what the future holds for HYPE. This includes Ansem, a popular figure on X who is known for his early bets on Solana (SOL) and dogwifhat (WIF) that allowed him to reap millions. In a recent tweet, he compared $HYPE’s prospects with that of $SOL back when the token was worth only $8 in a tongue-in-cheek way. I missed SOL $8 to $200 I won't miss HYPE to $300 — Ansem (@blknoiz06) December 16, 2024 Although he has not provided many details about his bullish stance on this new token, this protocol is already making its way to the headlines amid its appealing value proposition and tokenomics. Hyperliquid is a perpetuals exchange that operates in its own layer-one (L1) network . Multiple tokens can be traded within its platform through a user-friendly interface at competitive trading fees. The $HYPE token has been designed as a deflationary asset as its total supply shrinks every year. This is achieved by progressively burning tokens with the income generated by trading fees. As a result, the value of the $HYPE token is poised to increase over time as long as the exchange is being used widely. Data from DeFiLlama indicates that the total value locked (TVL) of Hyperliquid currently stands at $2.3 billion making it the 19 th largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol in the crypto space at the moment. Although Hyperliquid still has much to prove in terms of adoption and growth, the protocol has already proven that it can attract significant interest from investors who see significant price appreciation ahead for its native token $HYPE. $Hype Breaks Trend Line Support but Resumes Upward Trajectory $HYPE moved up at a frantic pace shortly after its airdrop. However, the token faced a significant pullback since December 21 that slowed down its pace and pushed it below the $25 area temporarily. The token found support shortly after at $24 and has been progressively making higher lows and higher highs since then, meaning that a new uptrend is forming. Although the former trajectory is no longer dominating the price action, $HYPE is still moving up. The road to retest its all-time highs may not be as smooth as before but as long as the price holds above $20 the outlook for the token is positive. Ansem’s comments may have aided $HYPE’s short-term performance as he is a widely followed voice in the crypto space, boasting nearly 633,000 followers on the social media platform X. Whether the market’s excitement for this protocol and its native token continues will depend on adoption, TVL growth, the rate at which $HYPE is burned by the project’s treasury, and other similar factors. This Vote-to-Earn (V2E) Token Has Raised Millions in Just a Few Days The pioneer meme coin of the vote-to-earn (V2E), Flockerz , has been attracting significant interest for investors every week amid its innovative model that compensates token holders for participating in the project’s governance decisions. Thus far, the $FLOCK presale has raised $8.25 million in less than 14 days as investors have opted to take advantage of the discounted price at which the token is being offered. The Flock Don't Stop! With just 25 days left in the presale, The Flock continues to show its strength, with 8M raised! What a proud day for all of Flocktopia pic.twitter.com/GA7JDEt4YX — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 27, 2024 Flockerz introduces a novel mechanism that incentivizes holders to vote and have a say on how the project advances toward its goals. Vote-to-earn (V2E) has emerged to become a widely adopted approach that meme coins may be embraced in the near future to build stronger and more engaged communities. With $FLOCK, investors earn from multiple sides. They can generate staking rewards with a generous APY, they will benefit from receiving token rewards for casting votes on the protocol’s most critical proposals, and they will also gain from progressive increases in the price of the token once its presale ends and exchanges start to list it. The presale price of $FLOCK stands at $0.0065561. This is a heavily discounted price that the developing team is offering to position early buyers favorably to gain once the asset is listed on major exchanges. To buy $FLOCK, visit the official website of Flockerz and simply connect your wallet. You can convert USDT or ETH or use a bank card to complete your purchase. Don’t miss out on this chance to buy a nascent meme coin that will disrupt how projects engage and incentivize their communities.

In a recent interview, Daly argued that crypto should be considered its own distinct asset class, rather than being grouped alongside gold as is often the case. Defining crypto: more than just a commodity “I see crypto as a complicated thing, and the service we need to do for everyone is really unpack what we mean and call it what it is once we’ve done that,” Daly stated on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast. She emphasized that crypto could serve multiple roles—a currency, a medium of exchange, or an asset that can appreciate or depreciate in value—and that these terms require clear definition. “So I don’t think of it as like gold,” Daly added. It has properties like gold sometimes, but I don’t think of it like that. Contrasting views within the Fed Daly’s perspective presents a slight departure from the views of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who earlier this month energized the crypto community with his comments on bitcoin. Powell described bitcoin as a “speculative asset,” comparing it to virtual or digital gold. “People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value,” Powell said at the New York Times DealBook conference. It’s highly volatile. It’s not a competitor for the dollar; it’s really a competitor for gold. The road to currency status Echoing Powell’s sentiment, Daly stressed that crypto is not yet ready to function as a currency, despite the aspirations of many crypto enthusiasts. “The property it needs is that it has to grow as the economy grows,” Daly explained. So its value doesn’t change just because people want it. So when more people want a dollar bill, the dollar bill doesn’t rise in value. What causes the dollar to fluctuate is the economy and how fast our growth is relative to other countries. So that is a property it will have to perfect for it to be a currency. Crypto’s market momentum despite regulatory uncertainty While the path to official recognition as a currency by Congress remains uncertain, the momentum behind various digital assets continues to build. Bitcoin has seen significant gains since Donald Trump’s election on November 5, breaking through the $100,000 mark for the first time on December 4. Bitcoin prices have risen 38% since Election Day and are 106% higher this year. Crypto-linked stocks like Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) have also seen impressive growth. Institutional adoption and the Trump factor The warming sentiment towards crypto is also reflected in recent investments from institutional players that typically favor traditional assets. In May, Wisconsin’s pension fund purchased over $160 million in bitcoin shares, signaling growing acceptance from traditional financial players. Furthermore, MicroStrategy (MSTR), led by Michael Saylor, has continued its aggressive acquisition of bitcoin. The new Trump administration’s appointment of venture capitalist David Sacks as a crypto czar may pave the way for new initiatives, including a potential bitcoin reserve. “Just the fact that there would even be someone who would be focused on making the United States a leader in crypto, bitcoin mining, and other areas President Trump has talked about is a sea change,” Benchmark Company analyst Mark Palmer said on Opening Bid. “We assume in our analysis [that] the price of bitcoin will reach $225,000 by the end of 2026.” He also emphasized that “The fact that we are seeing increased institutional adoption of bitcoin is key here.” The post Crypto's identity crisis: Fed's Daly says it's no gold, needs its own definition appeared first on Invezz",Crypto|Economic|World|Federal Reserve System|USA|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Invezz', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",invezz,2024-12-30 20:33:14

He pointed to the emergence of a bullish wedge, which, if confirmed, could signal significant price appreciation extending into 2025. However, this longer-term view, contrasts with short-term signals from XRP’s daily chart, which indicates a possible pullback from its local high of $2.728. Here are two views of $XRPUSD a weekly chart and a daily chart Strong opinions, weakly held A chart is not an opinion and an opinion is not necessarily a position – this is a concept hard to understand by rookies pic.twitter.com/SvaT5hojLW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 27, 2024 Brandt has also noted the formation of a Half Mast Flag pattern on the XRP/USD chart . “If this pattern completes,” he stated, “the distance to upside should equal advance into tip of flag.” While this technical setup often predicts a continuation of prior gains, it is not a guaranteed indicator of sustained upward momentum. Assessing the December Rally and Its Aftermath XRP experienced a substantial surge in December, peaking at $2.72 on December 3. This marked one of the asset’s highest points since its 2018 all-time high. However, the rally lost steam, and XRP has since been on a gradual decline. Market volatility intensified during the holiday period, further hindering price recovery efforts. The introduction of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin briefly reignited investor interest, leading to a minor uptick in price. However, the rally was insufficient to push XRP toward new highs, leaving the asset 36% below its peak valuation recorded nearly six years ago. As of now, XRP is trading at approximately $2.14, reflecting a period of stagnation as it struggles to regain upward momentum.

Meanwhile, its 24-hour trading volume has climbed by 5% to $5.42 billion, resulting in a volume-to-market cap ratio of 4.41%. This indicates consistent liquidity levels within the market.

With the similar aims that the regime’s debanking efforts had, Morgenstern said the goal remains to “unplug” miners from the energy grid. The flag on this government overreach calls for immediate investigation according to Morgenstern. Operation Chokepoint 2.0 in Bitcoin Mining In an OpEd by Morgenstern and Sam Lyman, the chokehold in the mining industry started in 2022. They recalled that at the time, the Biden Aministration published a White paper on Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). The White paper proposed limiting or eliminating Bitcoin mining in the country. They both highlighted with specificity the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 strategy employed by the Biden White House. This include imposing a 30% tax on the energy that mining firms utilized in their operations. The authors also noted that the government demanded a comprehensive energy audit from all Bitcoin miners earlier this year. Rather than give in to the demand, these crypto mining firms sued and won the government for the regulatory overreach. They pointed out that these unplugging agenda was the governments’ way of controlling emerging economies. Meanwhile, many industry leaders have also attested to the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 manifestations in other areas beyond Bitcoin mining. Silvergate Bank’s former CTO Chris Lane has always shared his account of how Federal regulators fueled the collapse of the crypto friendly bank. Beyond speculations, recent Coinbase files revealed FDIC’s role in debanking crypto firms in the United States. This presented a clear evidence of the claims debanking claims of the regulator. Where to From Here? With the exposition of the subtle attack on Bitcoin mining by the Operation Chokepoint 2.0 agenda of this administration, lawmakers like Rep French Hill are calling for investigation into the chokepoint claims . Morgenstern and Lyam also echoed this sentiment, directly calling on swift action from the incoming Donald Trump administration. Trump’s appointed Crypto Czar David Sacks has also shared his take on investigating the Operation Chokepoint 2.0. With the mission spelt out, industry leaders including John Deaton are now skeptical on whether the administration can act fast before the Midterm elections which might change Congress’s majority. The midterm elections come quick. Let’s hope @realDonaldTrump @JDVance @elonmusk @VivekGRamaswamy @DavidSacks @BoHines @howardlutnick Scott Bessent and others make it happen within the first 2 years. https://t.co/I0mgXTB3na — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) December 30, 2024 The post Riot Platforms Exec Reveals How Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Impacted Bitcoin Mining appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Bitcoin mining|Operation Chokepoint 2.0,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2024-12-30 20:40:02

Just a few days after he criticized Judge’s Analisa Torres ruling earlier this month, which put to an end a high-profile legal case between the company and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gasparino is now slamming the project’s founders and their motives. There is no ""XRP Army."" But there are a bunch of dudes who bought the coin that made insiders rich and they've been waiting for their pay day ever since. See creepy Jimmy–it aint fun stalking me. Sad Ha! https://t.co/B7mz83F4ax — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) December 29, 2024 In response to a comment from James Rule, a notable supporter and Ripple (XRP) investor, he highlighted that this so-called “army” is just a group of people who have made the developing team rich. He is referring to Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse, David Schwartz, and Stuart Alderoty, who are the most prominent public figures and leaders of the blockchain company and whose net worth is estimated to be in the billions of dollars. The news anchor’s rift with the XRP community started a couple of days ago when he called the Judge’s ruling on the XRP v. SEC case “idiotic”. During an interview with Anthony Pompliano, he claimed that the judge’s distinction between retail and institutional investors and her stance on diminished disclosures established a dangerous precedent. Gasparino’s comments rapidly drawn severe backlash from XRP supporters, some of which called him a “manipulated parrot” while others asked him to “stay on his lane” referring to his lack of understanding about the crypto space. Shortly after the ruling, the price of XRP was propelled as investors saw it as a major victory for the blockchain company. With the additional help of the post-election tailwind, the token accumulates gains of 234% since the year started and have made it the fourth most valuable cryptocurrency with a market cap of $117.87 billion as of today. XRP Keeps Dropping and Comes Closer to Critical Support Area The price of XRP has been steadily dropping lately as early buyers may have decided to take some of the profits they brought in November. After reaching an all-time high of $2.90 on December 3, the token has retreated by 30% and it is currently approaching a critical support area at $1.95. This level has served as a bouncing pad in two occasions already, confirming its importance to market participants. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in a clear downward path, meaning that momentum is in favor of bears while trading volumes have subsided lately and are currently well below the levels seen in mid-to-late November. Moving forward, traders will be taking a close look at what happens once the price reaches the $1.95 threshold as a drop below could result in further weakness for XRP in the near term. Meanwhile, a strong bounce above this area could push the token to the $3 level shortly and even higher if there’s enough interest to push the price above the $3.5 mark. Less Than 24 Hours Left to Buy This Promising Meme Coin During its Presale A new meme coin is about to launch and investors are betting that it will be a sensation. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has attracted over $38 million from early buyers in just a few weeks as its presale is coming off the heels of the successful listing of Pepe Unchained ($PEPU) . With just 15 hours left until the next price increase, time is running out to jump in at the current price. Ritual complete. Green candles lighting the way. pic.twitter.com/9lZZr4diqN — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) December 29, 2024 The $WEPE token is currently available at a discounted price of $0.0003661 that offers both limited downside and ample runway for 10x or even 100x gains once the token is listed on exchanges. Pepe-the-Frog-themed tokens have been quite popular among meme coin investors and the success of $PEPU, which produced gains of over 300% shortly after it was listed, shows that there’s still significant untapped potential on tokens that feature this character. The most powerful feature that can make $WEPE even more successful than its predecessor is an eager desire to build a community of investors who want to stand up against the dominance that deep-pocketed groups have exert on certain digital assets. The WEPE army has come to challenge the status quo by introducing a community-centered token that will take on whales to produce life-changing wealth for those who get in early. There’s still a bit of time to buy $WEPE at this heavily discounted price. Visit the Wall Street Pepe website and connect your wallet to invest in this presale while it is still running. You can either convert ETH or USDT tokens into $WEPE or use a bank card. No time to waste, the WEPE army is closing ranks and you don’t want to miss this chance.

CryptoZeus, a well-known analyst within the meme coin community, has raised expectations for PEPE’s future, describing the token as “extremely explosive.” In a recent YouTube video , CryptoZeus highlighted PEPE’s resilience amidst market fluctuations, noting that the coin’s price consolidation suggests it could be on the cusp of another breakout. “PEPE could potentially be on the drive for another explosive breakout coming up soon,” he said, referencing a triangle consolidation pattern since December 9. He further predicted that if this breakout materializes, PEPE could reach 0.0000314 USD, with the possibility of the coin eliminating up to four zeros from its price, setting a new all-time high for the token. He also underscored the critical role of community support and retail adoption in the success of meme coins like PEPE. The token is already gaining significant traction, particularly among large retail holders, with over 92,000 investors contributing substantial amounts. Additionally, PEPE’s community continues to grow rapidly, with more than 355,300 holders and approximately 1,000 new holders joining daily. In addition to these positive developments, recent whale activity has further fueled speculation about PEPE’s potential. Recently, one of the largest whales, which had not traded for over 600 days, moved 2.1 trillion PEPE tokens worth $52 million. Such activity suggests a surge in interest from large investors , further fueling expectations of a significant price rally for PEPE. This has led many to draw comparisons between PEPE and other meme coin success stories like DOGE and SHIB, which saw explosive growth in previous bull markets. Predictions from CoinCodex also suggest that PEPE could reach $0.000152 by 2029, representing a 600% increase. Other forecasts also indicate significant growth in the next two to five years, with many analysts believing that PEPE is on the cusp of a parabolic price movement. The broader market environment also adds to the optimism. Bitcoin’s recent price rally has historically led altcoins, including meme coins, to follow suit, often resulting in impressive performances. According to CryptoZeus, this ongoing bull run could continue attracting institutional money into Bitcoin and blue-chip coins like PEPE, providing a significant boost in price. “In a bull market, the money flows into blue-chip cryptos. While low-cap coins can offer quick profits, blue chips like Bitcoin and PEPE generally outperform as institutional money pours in.” He added. PEPE was trading at roughly $0.000019 at press time, reflecting an 11.81% drop in the past 24 hours. However, the coin’s trading volume surged by 60% during the same period, reaching $3.45 billion. Additionally, PEPE’s market cap climbed from the 25th to the 23rd, underscoring its growing momentum despite the price decline.",Cryptocurrency|News|PEPE,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-30 20:44:20

Thus, participants can participate in the staking process without requiring the full 32 ETH to run a validator node. Furthermore, Rocket Pool introduces the concept of “rETH” tokens, issued to users who stake ETH in the Rocket Pool network. These rETH tokens represent users’ stake in the pool and can be traded or transferred independently of the underlying ETH, providing liquidity and flexibility to participants. Overall, Rocket Pool aims to democratize Ethereum staking and contribute to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by providing a secure, efficient, and accessible platform for staking participation. As DeFi continues to gain traction, Rocket Pool stands out as a pioneering project at the forefront of innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Likewise, when the price stabilized and a new influx of liquidity began, the price rebounded strongly.” According to Negentropic, liquidity could be the deciding factor in a Bitcoin price pump. “This suggests that we could potentially see a price pump once liquidity flows back into the market and the price does not drop to lower levels as long as network growth remains at bullish levels.” Source: Negentropic/X In an accompanying Swissblock post, the market intelligence firm suggests that profit-taking must calm down before BTC can rise again. “Profit-taking above $90,000 and near $100,000 has persisted among market participants (no surprise, as long-term holders continue to take profits). However, this selling pressure is gradually losing intensity. For price momentum to resume within the bullish territory, profit-taking must stabilize, and we need to avoid large volumes of selling that create spikes on the chart.” BTC is trading for $92,077 at time of writing, down 1.7% on the day.

To read full editions, subscribe . Fund issuers continue to dream up crypto ETFs they hope to launch in 2025. We recently highlighted Bitwise’s filing for a Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF to invest in those with at least 1,000 BTC. Related, Strive Asset Management filed last Thursday for a Bitcoin Bond ETF that would seek exposure to convertible securities issued by MicroStrategy and others expected to use a big portion of proceeds to buy BTC. REX Advisers then shared plans to launch a Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF that (you guessed it) would invest in convertible bonds issued by companies holding the largest crypto asset. ProShares also plotted three bitcoin-related funds. A so-called S&P 500 Bitcoin ETF would take a long position in S&P 500 stocks and a short US dollar/long bitcoin position. The latter piece is done via bitcoin futures as a way “to currency hedge the US dollar exposure of the S&P 500 stocks position,” a company filing notes. Two other planned products similarly aim to replicate the performance of bitcoin-denominated investments in Nasdaq 100 stocks and gold. ProShares files for S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, & gold ETFs denominated in btc… Basically a long position in underlying stocks or gold & then a short usd/long btc position using btc futures. I’m calling these btc hedged ETFs. Bitcoin is starting to eat tradfi. pic.twitter.com/6gsThIWvFT — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 28, 2024 Perhaps more interestingly, Volatility Shares filed for an ETF that would invest in solana futures contracts “that trade only on an exchange registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.” These do not yet exist. The company did not immediately return my request for comment. Volatility Shares, which offers leveraged BTC and ETH futures ETFs, is also the firm that revived the effort to launch ether futures funds in mid-2023. Though it ditched those plans when many others followed suit by re-filing for similar products, some credited the firm as being crucial to achieving approval of those (and ultimately spot ETH ) products. Several firms — VanEck , 21Shares , Canary Capital , Bitwise and Grayscale — have active filings for spot solana ETFs. It remains uncertain whether the SEC will deviate from its precedent of requiring a regulated futures market — such as those available for BTC and ETH but not for solana — before approving other spot crypto funds. One thing’s for sure (as stated on X by Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas): “Damn. ETF issuers don’t sleep (or take the week [between] xmas and new years off).”It’s probably a sign there’s plenty more filings to come in the new year.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is valued at a notional $27.2B, surpassing other startups with high-profile launches. Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned out to be the biggest launch for 2024, taking the top spot with a fully diluted value of $27.2B. The HYPE token appreciated rapidly after the airdrop, while the perpetual futures DEX increased its listings and volumes. Hyperliquid’s launch arrived in November, after months of sparking expectations with airdrop farming. The HYPE token launched during a period of heightened market activity and near-peak prices. Even with questions raised on the sustainability of Hyperliquid, the airdrop achieved an unexpectedly high valuation, as it did not sink after the token launch. For Hyperliquid, becoming a top airdrop for 2025 was a major success, as the project started with extremely low expected valuations. HYPE airdrop value has been calculated at FDV as low as $150M, surprising the recipients of the airdrop. HYPE still traded at $27.34 toward the end of the year, after peaking above $32. HYPE gets support from token burns and from the highly active protocol fees, which accrue during periods of market volatility. In 2024, despite the meme trend of launching tokens and growing their valuation, large VC-backed projects remained one of the strong trends. Those projects had a much higher fully diluted value, raising expectations of demanding sufficient demand to keep their token from sinking. Based on CryptoDiffer data, 2024 had one significant project each month, with a minimum value of $1.27B for Drift Protocol. High-FDV projects propose long-term vesting schedules Despite this, the new batch of high-FDV projects was greeted as new opportunities, to which a more liquid market could adapt. To avoid pressure on the token price, Hyperliquid keeps $6.44B in value locked, based on the share of core contributors . Unlocks for early contributors and investors will start in November 2025, giving enough time for HYPE to establish its range. HYPE was just 31% unlocked as of December 30, while some of the unlocked tokens were vested again. The recovery of DeFi brought in Ethena (ENA), a project that benefitted from the 2024 market. Ethena traded at a valuation of $2.8B at the end of 2024, though with FDV of $14.3B. For Ethena, token unlocks will start in April 2025 for early investors and other special interest groups. The unlocks will happen almost monthly, and dilute the market cap by 5.38% a month. The third-largest project was Ondo Finance, with an FDV of $13.4B and a market capitalization of just $1.95B for its tokens in circulation. Ondo Finance is preparing for one of its largest unlocks on January 18, 2024, which will dilute the currently circulating tokens by 134%. The unlocking event will free up 19.4% of the total supply, leaving the market to absorb up to $2.9B in tokens, if the holders try to sell. Those three most ambitious projects all depended on an ongoing bull market to retain growth. Ondo Finance rode the trend of RWA asset tokenization, aiming to offer institutional-grade products on-chain. Ethena depended on the bullish trend for Ethereum (ETH) to make its fees and distribute them as earnings to the holders of its synthetic stablecoin. For all three of the top projects for 2024, the current value locked is much lower compared to their FDV. Hyperliquid locked in $2.55B in its bridges, a small fraction of the value locked in its tokens. Ethena had a value locked of $5.95B based on its issuance of USDE stablecoins, while Ondo Finance only carried $612.53B TVL. The new batch of projects from 2024 remains closely watched, even as older low-float tokens are still putting new tokens into the market. In the last week of 2024, another $421M in tokens was unlocked, still diluting the supply of top tokens like SUI and Optimism (OP).

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 524,500 followers on the social media platform X that BTC shattered two support levels on the weekly chart, suggesting that its short-term uptrend has come to an end. According to the analyst, the price action indicates that BTC could take a breather in the coming weeks. “The weekly support has been lost. The five-week technical uptrend is over (orange). Bitcoin is showing increasing signs of transitioning into a multi-week correction. Any relief rally, if at all needed, into these old supports could turn them into new resistance to confirm additional downside continuation.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Rekt also highlights that Bitcoin is flipping previous supports into resistance levels, lending more credence to his bearish BTC stance. The trader now sees Bitcoin hitting the $90,000 price level. “Old supports are acting as new resistance. As a result, technically, the breakdown has been confirmed. But the follow-through in bearish downside continuation ever since has been relatively limited thus far. $94,250 on the daily would need to be lost for the price to drop into the low $90,000s.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $93,487.

The team outlined their current priorities and steps taken to recover funds, remedy the situation, and revitalize the protocol. Recovering Stolen Funds and Requesting Recovery Resources Radiant Capital confirmed that efforts to recover stolen funds or secure external recovery resources are ongoing, but the protocol acknowledged that there has been no significant progress or positive updates to share thus far. Related News: Onchain Data Reveals: This Cryptocurrency Whale Made $49 Million in Profits on One Altcoin Today, Now Buys Another Altcoin Improvement Plans The team announced that a unified community proposal has been prepared for a second DAO vote. The process is expected to go more smoothly after the council review and consensus phase. Community members are encouraged to participate in a survey to determine which of the three proposed options will guide the protocol’s improvement strategy. Current focus includes: Addressing Lost Deposits: Recapitalizing the protocol to enable modest refunds and establish a foundation for long-term recovery. Attracting Partnerships: Partnerships aim to secure new capital and recovery resources to enhance the recovery process. Comprehensive Revitalization Plan: Developing a framework for recapitalization and recovery that can improve the protocol’s prospects and attract future investments. Radiant Capital has announced plans to elect a new community council as outlined in the DAO bylaws. This proposal is currently in the community collaboration phase and will soon enter the governance process. The new council will replace the inaugural council, with elections planned to be held annually going forward. In October 2024, Radiant Capital suffered its second attack of the year. The first incident involved a flashloan attack in which the attackers withdrew approximately $4.5 million from the protocol. The second attack greatly eclipsed that figure, resulting in an estimated $53 million in losses from user wallets. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts have identified three pivotal RSI levels, 74, 70, and 65 as key thresholds for understanding the Ripple token trajectory in the near term. XRP Price Prediction: Will RSI Levels at 74, 70, or 65 Define the Next Move? According to a post on X by analyst Egrag Crypto , XRP price may experience significant momentum shifts based on its RSI levels. At press time, the monthly RSI indicator was at 78.29, signaling strong bullish momentum for XRP. A bounce from this level could drive the RSI toward 88 or even higher, indicating sustained upward momentum. If the RSI dips to 70, it may reflect emerging bearish momentum. However, a bounce from this range is critical to preserving the ongoing bull run. The level of 70 is being closely monitored as a potential pivot point for XRP price trends. Additionally, Egrag Crypto pointed out that the RSI level of 65 is a decisive point for Ripple’s token price. A drop to this zone signals entry into bearish territory. However, as long as the RSI does not close below 65, there remains the possibility of a recovery. On the other hand, a close below 65 on the top technical indicator could signify the end of the current bullish cycle, triggering further downside. This level is regarded as the final line of defense for maintaining upward momentum in Ripple’s price trajectory. Source: X Technical Analysis and Market Sentiment In addition, analyst Ali Martinez has observed a tightening in the Bollinger Bands on XRP daily chart. This technical pattern often signals a period of low volatility, potentially leading to a significant price breakout or breakdown. Analyst Egrag Crypto further shared in a different analysis emphasizing the importance of the $2.12 mark for XRP. The analyst identified it as a critical resistance level for the bulls to reclaim. Highlighting the Fibonacci channel at 0.236, the chart suggests a potential bullish trajectory if XRP achieves a daily closure above this level. Additionally, the analyst marked $2.75 as the next significant target while acknowledging the $1.67 zone as an equilibrium point, providing strong support for XRP’s current consolidation phase. Source: X Despite the bullish projection, XRP price has faced a challenging week, declining by 4.88% over the past seven days. Starting from a high of $2.23 earlier in the week, XRP struggled to maintain momentum, dropping to as low as $2.00 before recovering slightly to $2.12. Moreover, in an earlier report, experts projected Ripple’s token to rally to $4, contingent on breaking resistance levels at $2.60, $2.65, and $2.75. However, they cautioned that failure to hold above the crucial $2 support could ignite bearish momentum, dragging XRP price down to $1.22.

Noteworthy, MiCA offers a unified legal framework across the European Economic Area (EEA). Its aim is to combat illicit activities like money laundering while it improves consumer protection, transparency, and market stability. MoonPay Receives Approval to Legalise Offerings With this MiCA license , MoonPay has proven to be compliant with these rigorous standards. It has also positioned itself for expansion of its services in the European crypto ecosystem. Also, it would also be able to lead innovation in the same region. Users can continue to interact with the exchange’s fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat payment services across Europe. Ivan Soto-Wright, MoonPay’s CEO and co-founder, noted that the “approval underscores MoonPay’s commitment to regulatory excellence and our mission to build a trusted bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy.” EU MiCA Finally Comes Into Effect It is worth noting that MiCA legislation took full effect today. The comprehensive regulatory framework requires that all stablecoins be issued by entities with an e-money license. Additionally, stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether, need to hold reserves in independent banks and track transactions. While Circle has aligned itself to fulfil the requirements of the rule, Tether is still undecided. The largest stablecoin issuer is concerned about the impact that the crypto regulation will have on USD-pegged stablecoins. Similarly, the broader crypto ecosystem is constantly discussing how the MiCA rule will affect the market, especially with President-elect Donald Trump’s potential crypto-friendly policies in the United States. Many entities in the crypto industry think that the introduction of MiCA could leave the market at risk . MoonPay in Talks to Acquire Helio Pay Amidst these exciting times, reports have it that MoonPay is negotiating a $150 million acquisition of prominent crypto e-commerce platform Helio Pay. Should this pull through, this deal would become MoonPay’s most significant acquisition since inception. Hence, it signals a strategic push into the growing e-commerce sector. Moreso, the acquisition could boost the firm’s offerings by integrating its self-service platform, which supports over 6,000 merchants and content creators. Helio Pay already accepts Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins, such as USD Coin (USDC), as a payment option.

With the cryptocurrency market gravitating towards projects offering real-world applications and innovative solutions, Lightchain AI has emerged as a standout. By seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, it provides practical solutions for industries such as healthcare and logistics, setting itself apart from speculative tokens. The presale price of just $0.004 has further piqued interest among high-net-worth investors looking to diversify beyond established options like Solana. With a robust roadmap emphasizing scalability and transformative utility, Lightchain AI is redefining the intersection of blockchain and AI. As excitement builds, it has become a top choice for whales seeking promising opportunities in the rapidly evolving crypto space. While Solana Whales have been actively accumulating Lightchain AI, Ethereum investors are also taking notice as they look to diversify their portfolios and tap into the potential for exponential growth. Why Lightchain AI? Lightchain AI is getting attention as a strong player in the crypto market, and for good cause. Its fresh way of mixing smart machines with block chain tech makes it stand out as a special project with use in real life. Unlike lots of tokens that only chase quick profits, Lightchain AI offers useful ways to help fields like health care, shipping, and money through its Smart Machine Virtual Tool (SMVT) This feature lets quick AI math happen right on the blockchain, fixing hard problems but keeping clear and spread out. Also, Lightchain AI's start price of $0.004 makes it a nice spot f͏or investors wanting big gains. The plan’s aim on spread-out rule and group-led growth builds faith and open-mindedness. These points, along with its strong path ahead, have drawn the eyes of backers moving from well-known plans like Solana and Ethereum tokens. This has made it a name to watch. Solana Whales and Ethereum Investors Driving Surge Solana whales and Ethereum investors are increasingly eyeing Lightchain AI, driving its momentum in the competitive crypto market. These high-net-worth individuals and institutional players are seeking innovative projects that go beyond the typical blockchain offerings, and Lightchain AI fits the bill with its integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain. For Solana investors, Lightchain AI offers a diversification opportunity as it builds a robust ecosystem with unique use cases in healthcare, logistics, and finance. Meanwhile, Ethereum investors, familiar with the potential of decentralized applications, are drawn to Lightchain AI’s scalable AI-driven solutions and decentralized governance model. This influx of interest reflects a broader market trend where sophisticated investors pivot towards projects that promise both long-term utility and high growth potential. As these strategic players accumulate positions, Lightchain AI’s projected 300% surge appears increasingly achievable. Lightchain AI’s Transformative Potential Lightchain AI’s transformative potential lies in its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain, offering solutions that go beyond traditional cryptocurrency projects.

So, let’s look at how to mine Litecoin. Table of Contents What is Litecoin mining and how does it work? Requirements to start mining Litecoin Step-by-step guide to mine Litecoin Litecoin mining profitability FAQs What is Litecoin mining and how does it work? Mining Litecoin ( LTC ) is what keeps everything in check. Think of miners as the guardians of the system, using their computers to solve puzzles that confirm and record transactions. Their reward? Brand-new Litecoin, straight from the network. To improve their chances of earning rewards, many miners team up in mining pools, sharing the load and the rewards. You might also like: New cryptocurrency to mine for free: Top 10 projects Litecoin’s Scrypt algorithm is one of its standout features, crafted to make mining easier for newcomers. Beyond accessibility, it gives Litecoin a performance boost, allowing transactions to process faster than Bitcoin’s SHA-256 approach. Initially, mining Litecoin didn’t require fancy equipment — just your regular computer. But as technology evolved, ASIC miners became the go-to hardware for efficient mining. Scrypt relies on memory, storing data in RAM to solve puzzles. This setup was meant to keep mining fair, though modern hardware has largely tipped the scales toward those with specialized machines. Requirements to start mining Litecoin To mine Litecoin, you’ll need more than just a regular computer. These days, you’ll need an ASIC miner, which is made specifically for Litecoin’s Scrypt algorithm. It’s way more powerful than a typical PC, so it’s a must for serious mining. You’ll also need mining software to link your miner to the network. Since mining on your own can be a long shot, many miners join pools to combine their resources and increase their chances of getting rewards. Just remember — mining uses quite a bit of electricity, so make sure your power costs are manageable. If you’ve got everything you need to mine LTC, let’s take a look at how to get started. Step-by-step guide to mine Litecoin How to mine Litecoin? Getting into Litecoin mining is pretty cool, but there’s a catch: it takes a bit of preparation. Here’s a simple, step-by-step guide to get you started: Choose a Litecoin mining pool . Popular mining pools like LitecoinPool.org or F2Pool are great choices because they let you team up with other miners, boosting your chances of earning rewards. Download mining software. After joining a mining pool, the next step is to get your hands on some mining software that’s compatible with your setup, like CGMiner or BFGMiner. It’s pretty simple — just download the software, install it on your computer, and you’ll be ready to start mining in no time. Configure the software. Open the mining software and configure it with your pool’s details (server address and port) and your Litecoin wallet address, where your rewards will be sent. Start to mine Litecoin . Launch the mining software to begin solving cryptographic puzzles. Your miner will start working to verify transactions and secure the Litecoin network. Monitor performance. Keep track of your miner’s progress and electricity usage to ensure everything is running efficiently and you’re getting rewards. Litecoin mining profitability LTC mining profitability isn’t fixed — it can change based on a few things like the price of Litecoin, the type of mining hardware you’re using, your electricity rates, and even the mining pool you join. Generally, more efficient hardware and lower electricity costs mean more potential for profit. But keep in mind, the crypto market can be unpredictable, so your earnings might fluctuate over time. Mining pools also impact profitability since they allow you to combine resources with others, making it easier to earn consistent rewards. It’s important to keep track of your mining performance and regularly calculate whether your setup is still profitable. Remember, mining requires ongoing investment in hardware, electricity, and sometimes cooling solutions, so always assess if your current setup is worth the effort. You might also like: Litecoin gains pushes 80% of LTC holders into profit FAQs How long does it take to mine 1 Litecoin? The time to mine LTC mostly comes down to the power of your mining equipment, the pool you’re using, and how hard the network is to mine right now. With today’s ASIC miners, it can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. Just remember, the mining difficulty changes, so it’s never quite the same. How much Litecoin is left to mine? The total supply of Litecoin is capped at 84 million coins.As of December 2024, around 75.4 million LTC have already been mined, leaving about 8.6 million still to be mined. However, with decreasing block rewards over time (due to halvings), it will take decades to mine the remaining coins. What are the risks of mining Litecoin? Mining Litecoin sounds exciting, but it’s not without its risks. The biggest one is how much electricity you’ll use, which can lead to some serious bills. Plus, your mining gear can wear out over time, and the crypto market can be unpredictable — prices can drop when you least expect it. Oh, and don’t forget, mining pools can take a cut, meaning your profits might not be as high as you hope.",Learn|Mining,EN,0,0,BTC|LTC|MARKET|MINING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2024-12-30 21:25:48

To read full editions, subscribe . A curious filing landed on the SEC’s database Friday. Volatility Shares filed for a Solana futures ETF, which would issue securities that track the price movements of underlying SOL futures contracts trading on a CFTC-registered exchange. There’s a catch though: No such SOL futures contracts exist. ETF analysts nevertheless said the filing bodes well for spot Solana ETFs’ chances of being approved sometime in 2025. “Many believe that with Paul Atkins as SEC chair , a wider range of products will be possible. This filing appears to be a bet on that,” Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said in a direct message. Volatility Shares is a leveraged ETF specialist based in Palm Beach Gardens, FL. The smallish firm has arguably still helped shift the overton window for regulators: Grayscale argued in 2023 that Volatility Shares’ leveraged bitcoin futures ETF was riskier than Grayscale’s proposed spot bitcoin ETF, so Grayscale’s product should be approved. Now, Volatility Shares is offering another nonconsensus product in a Solana ETF space that is currently built on making bets. Its Solana futures ETF would give some investors exposure to 2x or the inverse of the daily price change of SOL futures. SOL futures contracts don’t currently trade (bitcoin and ether both have futures trading on the CME), but Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said the filing is probably a good sign that SOL futures are “on the way.” Regulators could be more likely to approve spot ETFs if they see “a healthy market that’s liquid enough for SOL to trade,” Sol Strategies CEO Leah Wald said, noting that bitcoin and ether ETFs were only approved by the SEC after CME futures began trading. Conventional wisdom used to hold that futures were a needed prerequisite for crypto ETFs, but that math seemingly changed with the possibility that a Trump electoral victory would end Gary Gensler’s tenure as SEC chair. At least five firms have already filed for spot SOL ETFs over the past six months despite the lack of futures. Still, a futures market likely wouldn’t hurt the spot SOL ETFs’ approval odds. “Alright, I’ve seen enough…Registering formal prediction,” Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, wrote on X. “Spot solana ETFs will be approved in 2025.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

He predicted it could crash to as low as $78,000 and explained why he holds such a bearish sentiment. Peter Brandt Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash To $78,000 In an X post, Peter Brandt predicted that the Bitcoin price could crash to $78,000. This prediction came as he revealed a head and shoulders top pattern. The legendary analyst remarked that a complete formation of this pattern could cause a price breakdown to this target. Brandt added that this pattern might fail with a “thrust hire,” or it might morph into something else. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests $15 By May 2025 Peter Brandt stated that as it stands now, it is a head and shoulders top pattern for the Bitcoin price dealt with for what it is. The legendary analyst isn’t the only one who has raised this bearish pattern for Bitcoin. Crypto analyst Aksel Kibar also highlighted a potential head and shoulders pattern that formed on the BTC chart. The analyst indicated that this bearish pattern put the Bitcoin price at risk of dropping to $80,000. He also raised the possibility of this pullback pushing the flagship crypto to the broadening pattern that completed with a breakout above $73,600. However, the analyst suggested that this bearish pattern can still be invalidated as it still needs to breach below the neckline before this breakdown becomes a real possibility. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez also recently provided a bearish setup for the Bitcoin price. He stated that a drop below $93,600 could send the flagship crypto to $80,000 or even $70,000. On the other hand, he remarked that BTC needs to break above $94,800 to confirm a price rebound. How It Could Play Out For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto provided insights into how it could play out for the Bitcoin price. He stated that Bitcoin might experience a dump before heading to Q1 2025 before the final rally to a cycle top. He added that 2025 will be more volatile than most market participants expect. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Gets Caught In Long Cup And Handle Pattern That Could Send Price Crashing Below $0.2 The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could rally to a cycle top of around $130,000. Crypto analyst Jelle also recently predicted that BTC could reach $140,000 in the next three months. Despite Bitcoin’s current tepid price action, the analyst is confident that the crypto will still rally much higher. He stated that everything points to the Bitcoin price being higher a few months from now. The crypto analyst added that it doesn’t matter whether BTC drops to $87,000 in the meantime or not, as it will still rally higher later on. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,600, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Musk AI King (MUSKAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Musk AI King can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk AI King could become the next viral memecoin. Musk AI King launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk AI King on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk AI King by entering its contract address – 8hfjjhqWbfVZsqxCKVQu115AXUzUPTHZFXZwk81rYTMw – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-30 21:44:00

By 2027, AAVE could reach a maximum price of $1,027. In 2030, AAVE will range between $933.57 to $1,985.68. Aave is a leading decentralized finance ( DeFi ) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain , known for its innovative financial solutions such as flash loans, which allow users to borrow instantly without collateral, and dynamic interest rates that adapt to market conditions. Participants in the Aave ecosystem can deposit their digital crypto assets back into liquidity pools to earn their interest payments or obtain loans by borrowing funds without providing collateral. Aave’s governance and fee distribution are significantly driven by its native token, AAVE, enhancing its utility and value within the platform. Having touched its ATH at $666.86 in May 2021, will AAVE reach new heights despite the recent market downturn? Let’s get into the Aave technical analysis and predictions. Overview Cryptocurrency Aave Ticker AAVE Current price $357.04 Market cap $4,946,914,074.14 Trading volume (24-h) $663,843,474.58 Circulating supply 15,032,636.1 AAVE All-time high $666.86 on May 19, 2021 All-time low $26.02 on Nov 5, 2020 24-hour low $321.69 24-hour high $3433.25 Aave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $329.85 (79.91%) Volatility 17.36% 50-day SMA $252.55 14-Day RSI 53.64 Sentiment Neutral Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) Green days 16/30 (%) 200-Day SMA $155.14 Aave 1-day price analysis: AAVE faces significant bearish pressure; buyers to come in soon? Key takeaways: AAVE is down 2.74% in 24 hours. The coin is trading below its 20-day SMA. A breach of $317.96 could indicate further downsides. Aave (AAVE) price analysis for December 30 shows a price decline, with the coin down by over 2% in 24 hours and 12.76% over the last 7 days. Indicators point to increasing selling pressure, but with oversold conditions prevalent, a rebound to the upside could be imminent. Aave 1-day price chart: AAVE faces continued selling pressure AAVE is currently trading at $323.63, marking a 2.74% drop. The token continues to face selling pressure, remaining below the SMA of $346.68, which serves as a key resistance level and signals bearish dominance. AAVE faces continued selling pressure The MACD indicator reflects ongoing downward momentum, with the MACD line lagging behind the signal line and the negative histogram confirming the weak trend. However, the declining intensity of the sell-off could hint at a potential shift if buyers step in. The trading volume indicator highlights a lack of significant buying interest enough to reverse the bearish trend. For AAVE to regain strength, it must break above the $346.68 resistance. Conversely, support at $300 remains critical; a breach here could lead to further downside movement, potentially testing lower support zones. Aave 4-hour price chart: Indicators reflect continued bear pressure The 4-hour chart for AAVE also reflects ongoing bearish momentum. The Bollinger Bands are relatively tight, signaling reduced volatility but a potential for breakout. AAVE indicators reflect continued bear pressure The price is near the basis line at $333.90, and a break above this level could lead to a test of the upper band at $349.83. Failure to do so may push the price closer to the lower band at $317.96. The RSI at 40.48 shows weak momentum, leaning toward oversold territory, suggesting limited buying interest. The Balance of Power (BoP) at -0.42 highlights that sellers maintain control, keeping upward pressure in check.

AAVE is showing bearish momentum across both daily and 4-hour charts, with resistance at $333.90 and support around $317.96. The daily trend remains weak, sitting below the SMA of $346.68, while the RSI hints at oversold conditions, leaving room for a short-term bounce. In the short term, AAVE could consolidate between $317 and $333. A break above resistance may push it toward $346, but failing to hold support could see it drop closer to $300. Is AAVE a good investment? Aave provides the essential infrastructure for lending and borrowing within DeFi, expanding beyond traditional applications into gaming, NFTs, and dApps. Its AAVE token plays a vital role in powering the platform, making it a strong choice for investors due to its proven market success and continuous development. Where to buy AAVE? AAVE tokens can be traded on centralized crypto exchanges. The most popular exchange to buy and trade Aave is Binance , one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, offering a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including AAVE. Coinbase and Bitfinex also offer a variety of trading pairs and support AAVE. Why is AAVE down? Aave (AAVE) is down due to declining network activity, increased selling pressure as more tokens move to exchanges and bearish market sentiment. Despite strong revenue, reduced user engagement and confidence are driving the price lower. Will Aave reach $500? Aave (AAVE) can potentially reach $500 if it breaks through the current resistance levels and gains momentum from positive market sentiment and trends. AAVE had previously reached an ATH of $666.86; attaining $500 should be an achievable feat in the near term if market conditions align. Does Aave have a good long-term future? Aave shows potential for a good long-term future, given its ability to stabilize and recover after significant declines. The consistent support of around $116 indicates resilience and potential for future growth.
