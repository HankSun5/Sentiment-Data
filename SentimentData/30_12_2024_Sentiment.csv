In 2025, Ethereum is anticipated to trade between $7,769.79 and $9,361.58, with an average expected price of $9,199.91. In 2030, ETH could trade between $24,373.71 and $26,740.04, with an average price of $25,417.45. The Ethereum network, launched in 2015, is a decentralized platform that enables developers to create smart contracts and dApps without intermediaries, enhancing security. The Ethereum blockchain is accessible to everyone and built to support scalability, programmability, security, and decentralization, allowing for the creation of any secure digital technology. Its native digital currency, ether (ETH), and its smart contracts have attracted investors’ recognition and interest, while developers appreciate its utility in developing blockchain and decentralized finance applications. It also helps trades to trade Ethereum more easily So, what can traders and investors expect in the coming months and years? “Is ETH likely to go up? What will ETH be worth in 5 years?” Let’s get into the details by exploring Ethereum’s price predictions from 2024 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Token ETH Price $3,333 Market Cap $401.64B Trading Volume $18.58B Circulating Supply 120.46M ETH All-time High $4,891.70 on Nov 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.4209 on Oct 21, 2015 24 High $3,419 24 Low $3,340 Ethereum price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.15% (High) 50-day SMA $ 3,483.34 200-day SMA $ 3,019.55 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (47%) Ethereum price analysis ETH/USD 1-day chart ETH/USD 1-Day price chart On December 29, the 1-day chart for Ethereum (ETH) shows bearish momentum, with the price at $3,355.4, below the 20-SMA at $3,754.4. Resistance is positioned at $4,205.7 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies at $3,303.2 (lower Bollinger Band). The RSI is at 43.06, approaching the oversold territory, signaling weak buying momentum. The declining price and volume suggest fading bullish sentiment as the price trends downward. A breakdown below $3,303.2 could push ETH toward the $3,000 psychological level. Conversely, a reversal above the $3,754.4 SMA may reignite bullish momentum, targeting the $4,205.7 resistance. Market caution is advised amid increasing volatility. ETH/USD 4-hour chart analysis ETH/USD 4-hour price chart xThe 4-hour chart for Ethereum (ETH) indicates bearish momentum, with the price at $3,344.3, trading below the 20-SMA at $3,360. Resistance is at $3,416.4 (upper Bollinger Band), while support lies near $3,303.5 (lower Bollinger Band). The MACD shows a bearish crossover, with the MACD line at -10.0 below the signal line at -11.9, signaling declining momentum. The Balance of Power (BoP) is at -1.00, highlighting strong selling pressure. If ETH drops below $3,303.5, it could lead to further declines, while a rebound above $3,360 may provide a chance for recovery. Momentum remains weak, favoring cautious trading.

Based on the 1-day and 4-hour ETH/USD charts, Ethereum is exhibiting bearish momentum with limited buying strength. On the daily chart, ETH trades at $3,355.4, below the 20-SMA at $3,754.4, with resistance at $4,205.7 and support at $3,303.2. The RSI near 43 suggests weak momentum, with potential for further downside if $3,303.2 is breached. The 4-hour chart reflects a similar trend, with ETH below the 20-SMA at $3,360 and immediate resistance at $3,416.4. MACD and BoP indicate strong selling pressure. A drop below $3,303.2 could lead to further declines, while a recovery above $3,360 might signal stabilization. Is ETH a good investment? Ethereum is the largest DeFi hub with a vibrant layer-two ecosystem in the crypto market. The blockchain constantly develops, making it a go-to choice for many Web3 developers. ETH, its native token, shows promise, and the possibility of an Ethereum ETF approval makes it favorable for day traders. Over the long term, explore our price predictions. But also, the opinions expressed are not investment advice traders should consider doing their own research before investing. Will ETH reach $10,000? Ethereum is projected to exceed $10,000 as early as 2026, with its potential low starting at $10,662.92. Will ETH reach $25,000? Ethereum is predicted to approach the $25,000 level by 2030, with an average price of $25,417.45 and a potential high of $26,740.04.This optimistic outlook is based on Ethereum’s ongoing development, network security, and increasing adoption. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and such long-term projections should be approached with caution. Will ETH reach $40,000? Based on our analysis, Ethereum is unlikely to reach the $40,000 mark. The highest expected price is around $26,740 in 2030. Does Ethereum have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but ETH is trading above its average price of the last two years. However, a positive outbreak can be expected. The ETH/USD pair is expected to reach the $26,740 mark by 2030, so holding it longer can be beneficial.

Pseudonymous analyst Credible Crypto tells his 65,900 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin appears to be in the fifth and final leg of its secular bull market that began about six years ago. The trader practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to witness five-wave rallies with wave five acting as the final leg up prior to a correction. According to Credible, Bitcoin could witness a parabolic surge in the coming months to complete its fifth and final wave. “So we’re in the final leg of the final leg, in my opinion, of the cycle that started back here in 2018 at $3,000 Bitcoin. Within this final fifth wave, again the idea is that if this final fifth leg up has started, which at this point it seems like it has, it should be rather aggressive… The idea is that this fifth wave should generally be a blow-off top.” Source: Credible Crypto/YouTube The trader is also unveiling his bull market price targets for Bitcoin, predicting that BTC could realistically surge by nearly 60% from current levels before transitioning to a new trend. “We could see this move up very aggressively. And the longer that we take down here to move up, that means the higher we’re going to go. So again, I previously said above $100,000… $150,000 is realistic based on what we’ve seen so far. But we could push up to $200,000. We could even push up to $250,000 with my absolute max for this cycle being $300,000. I don’t think we’ll get close to $300,000 but we could see $200,000 to $220,000. It all just depends on how aggressively we move up and the amount of time we take to move up. The longer that we take to finish off this move, the higher we’re going to go.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $95,075.

Optimistic investors now face the reality that Dogecoin’s $1 race will take much longer than expected. Conversely, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , the presale altcoin currently shaking the market, is waxing stronger. Leading analysts now predict the altcoin will cross the $1 mark ahead of Dogecoin in the next three weeks. Dogecoin Price Declines, Pushes $1 Dream Further Away The Dogecoin price has headed south following the current market downtrend. A steady drop in on-chain activities and trading volumes reflects reduced investor interest and engagement, significantly weakening the Dogecoin price. Additionally, with less interest rate cuts than anticipated, a wave of selling-off surges across the crypto market. However, the FOMO created by the bull run following Trump’s election win has begun to die off, resulting in the Dogecoin price’s ongoing correction. Yet, amid this chaos, the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin retains its promise of crossing the $1 mark in three weeks. Currently selling at $0.0243 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surge 4,015%, bringing in gains for investors attentive enough to discern its potential. With a 42% gain recorded across its previous presale stage and an imminent 71% surge, the market is confident that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin will see unprecedented growth. In addition, investors who buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) can now compete for a share of its 20% tokenomics allocated for rewarding early adopters. With their eyes on a 180% APY, investors who buy the altcoin continue to stake it in WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) liquidity pools. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Disrupts The Market With Impressive Presale Run, Set To Cross $1 In 3 Weeks WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to outpace the Dogecoin price in the next three weeks as leading analysts compare the AI altcoin’s fundamentals to Dogecoin. Unlike Dogecoin, which depends on its community sentiment and celebrity endorsements, its revolutionary DeFi wallet, record-breaking presale, and unlimited potential underpin WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) success and massive projections. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has raised over $5 million in its ongoing presale, priced at a mere $0.0243 . The presale is seeing overwhelming support, especially as crypto powerhouses fail to deliver their promise of massive profits. Hence, even Dogecoin price watchers and investors are diversifying massively, buying WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoins in huge tranches of $10,000 and more. WallitIQ (WLTQ), the homonymous DeFi wallet behind the altcoin, is a major factor in the altcoin’s success. Its artificial intelligence and machine learning integration are driving rapid adoption as traders and investors hope to gain the best experience using the DeFi wallet when it launches. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Scan & Pay QR feature , which simplifies DeFi transactions, is one of its most discussed features. Users can simply scan a receiver’s QR code, and the transaction will be completed in seconds, limiting the possibility of sending funds to the wrong wallet address. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also offers a Fully DeFi mode, which allows users to trade their cryptocurrencies in a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer environment. Unarguably, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is the most promising altcoin in the market right now. This powerful altcoin is swiftly taking over the crypto wallet and AI market, enabling investors to trade more than 1,000 cryptocurrencies directly within their wallets. Its smart contract audit by SolidProof , a revered smart contract auditing firm, also strongly fuels the presale’s success. Investors who linger will struggle to keep pace with WallitIQ (WLTQ) as this presale altcoin delivers life-changing 4,015% gains to profit-takers. Conclusion The shifting dynamics of the crypto market underscore the volatility that investors must navigate as the Dogecoin price $1 milestone becomes increasingly elusive. However, the emerging WallitIQ (WLTQ) $0.0243 altcoin offers a compelling narrative of rapid growth. Seasoned and new investors are reconsidering their strategies, competing for the fortunes this altcoin will bring. So gear up; buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin now at $0.0243 and position for generational wealth in 2025 and beyond.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 21:03:00

Total funds from whales have topped a six-month high, spiking sell pressure this week. XRP price has plunged 3% today and 5% over the week, with traders flagging low sentiments. New CryptoQuant data shows over 2.6 billion XRP were deposited on Binance in the last 30 days. This change in dynamics continues as the asset records a sharp decline after soaring to levels not seen in months above a $140 billion market cap. The increased amount of XRP on centralized exchanges ignited major sell-offs, which became the highest whale value since April 2024. Cryptowhale movements to centralized exchanges tend to crash the prices of most assets due to the size of holdings. Exchange flows determine the strength and weakness of the bull cycle, showing trader sentiment. This becomes a bearish phase based on the ease of sale out of exchanges. “ This is the highest amount of XRP deposited by large holders since April 2024, showing a noticeable increase in activity among whales. The large inflows suggest that big XRP holders are actively transferring XRP over the network, and interact with Binance as an exchange. Whale deposits can often signal potential shifts in strategy, as these players have significant amounts of assets at their disposal.” What’s Next For XRP? XRP has lost a significant chunk of gains in the past few weeks after flipping Tether as the third-largest coin by market cap. This led to positive projections as bulls set sights on an all-time high. Recent headwinds have lowered traders’ expectations, although bulls set sights on gains amid institutional activities. Institutional traders are drawn to XRP because of its cross-border payment potential as global crypto adoption soars. Furthermore, Ripple has made significant strides to boost XRP and advance payments globally. This year, Ripple launched RLUSD, joining the stablecoin space with partnerships with multiple exchanges. The company also announced a collaboration to roll out the premier tokenized money fund on the XRP Ledger. Aside from global partnerships, XRP is expected to soar based on a surge in other top assets. Bitcoin’s latest drive above $100K and upward movement since the U.S. elections has sparked altcoins. According to commentators, altcoins are on the verge of a major rally, citing previous cycles.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-29 21:09:47

Under the new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rules , set to take full effect tomorrow, the EU has made it crystal clear that Tether’s $102 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries aren’t good enough for their taste. Instead, they’re demanding that stablecoin issuers back their tokens with at least 60% reserves held in fiat within EU-regulated banks. If that isn’t a loud and flashy rejection of American financial dominance, what is? MiCA rules: Control disguised as compliance MiCA’s framework claims to be about safety, security, and trust. Stablecoin issuers need to jump through hoops like obtaining licenses, ensuring reserves match tokens, and complying with consumer protection measures. All fair enough, right? Except this isn’t about fair play—it’s about control. Let’s be real. By ignoring Tether’s U.S. Treasuries as valid collateral, the EU is effectively saying it doesn’t trust the backbone of the American financial system. Those Treasuries represent some of the most stable assets in the world. But no, the EU wants euros, and it wants them in its banks. It’s not hard to see the politics at play here. Tether hasn’t been officially labeled non-compliant—yet. But with no clear guidance, exchanges like Coinbase are already delisting USDT in anticipation. Binance and Crypto.com are holding out for now, but we all know now that the clock is ticking. If Tether can’t meet these requirements fast, its removal from European platforms could be devastating for crypto liquidity. The EU’s quiet rebellion By demanding a 60% reserve in EU fiat held within its borders, the bloc is effectively rejecting U.S. debt as a trustworthy backing. This is about moving the balance of power. The EU has been desperate to carve out a bigger slice of the global financial system for years, and stablecoins are their latest target. The implications are massive. If Tether decides the cost of compliance is too high and exits the EU market, other stablecoin issuers will likely face the same choice. USDC, for instance, might have gotten ahead of the curve by securing compliance, but it’s no secret that similar regulations could follow elsewhere. Without USDT, liquidity fragmentation becomes a real problem. Markets will slow down, fees will rise, and efficiency will take a hit. The irony? The EU’s power play would backfire spectacularly. By pushing USDT out, they’re also risking their own relevance in the global crypto market. The U.S., under the crypto-friendly Trump administration, is about to become a haven for innovation, pulling talent and capital away from Europe. If that happens, the EU might have won the battle but it’d have lost the war.",OP-ED|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-29 21:20:59

LINK currently hovers around $21 having failed to move past $26 despite recent uptrends. During this price fall, LINK whales have adopted an accumulation approach signaling confidence in the altcoin’s long-term profitability. Related Reading: Chainlink Price Could Crash 30% To $15 — Here’s How Chainlink Whales Acquire 3.58 Million LINK In 3 Days Following a strong bullish performance in early December, the crypto market has undergone a significant correction in the past two weeks attributed to several factors including a flash crash price and potential reductions of Fed rate cuts in 2025. As this corrective market persists, blockchain analytics company Santiment has reported an accumulation spree by LINK whales holding between 1 million-10 million LINK. In an X post on December 28, Santiment states that these large LINK holders have purchased 3.58 million LINK valued at $76.9 million over the past three days. Generally, significant levels of whale accumulation are indicated as bullish signals as these large token holders are confident of future gains. In the case of a price decline such as this, these massive accumulation levels reflect the belief that LINK is currently undervalued with a potential market rebound on the horizon. Related Reading: Chainlink And AAVE Surge After Trump’s Crypto Project Invests In Both Key Resistance Levels For LINK While high levels of whale accumulation are one sign of an impending price rally, analysis platform More Crypto Online has shared another positive insight on the LINK market. According to a recent X post, these market analysts state Chainlink still maintains an uptrend on larger time frames despite’s recent correction with its major support level set at $17.65. Based on the Elliott Wave Theory, If the LINK’s price holds above this level, the altcoin is predicted to rise to $69 in line with the expected third wave of the current market cycle. However, for confirmation of a price uptrend, Chainlink must break through resistance levels at $25.10 and $28.30. A decisive five-wave move above these levels would solidify the bullish case and suggest further price appreciation. In Elliott Wave theory, the five-wave structure is a reliable pattern indicating a strong trend continuation, making the breakthrough of these resistance levels pivotal for the ongoing rally. At the time of writing, Chainlink trades at $21.90 reflecting a 1.44% gain in the past 24 hours. However, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 12.55% and valued at $726.44 million. With a market cap of $13.96 billion, LINK is ranked as the 13th largest cryptocurrency.

This follows a wider market correction that saw over $1.6 billion wiped out of the ecosystem. Sharp declines have lowered trader momentum against previous bullish projections after Bitcoin (BTC) moved past $90K. Cardano slipped the highest among the top 10 crypto assets by market cap over the past 48 hours. The community dubbed ETH killer trades at $0.86, falling 4.7%, with its market cap slightly above $30.4 billion. ADA has decreased 18% in the last seven days, extending losses after previous gains. Despite reduced retail and institutional upward movements, the asset has held on to monthly gains picked up after the United States Presidential elections. Crypto users share conflicting opinions about the wider market’s recovery pace going into the new year. Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hack Spiked Fears Cardano’s downtrend heightened after the hack of the foundation’s X (formerly Twitter) account. The account was compromised on Dec 8 with the bad actors promoting a fake token as well as other false claims. A major point was the fake ADAsol token, which claimed to have ceased support for ADA. The scam token generated $500,000 before it slumped 99%. Malicious actors also claimed to have been slammed by a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Users were advised not to interact with links from the page following the incident. “ The Cardano Foundation regrets to inform our community that we have been served with a lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on December 8, 2024. In light of this unexpected legal action, we have made the difficult decision to immediately cease all support toward the ADA token to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,” the hackers wrote. A Slow Ecosystem The last 48 hours shown multiple crypto assets losing gains recorded in previous weeks. A glance at decentralized finance (DeFi) numbers also shows a similar downward trajectory. The total value locked (TVL) on Cardano plunged 21% from an all-time high of $708 million. As platforms lost numbers, overall transactions plunged, leading to the status quo. The crypto ecosystem has seen about $1.6 billion in liquidations since the last dip. Daily trading volumes are also in the red zone, although slight institutional numbers were recorded.

The European regulators have not expressly stated if USDT meets the new compliance guidelines. MiCA Uncertainty Surrounds USDT However, Coinbase, the U.S. leading crypto exchange, delisted USDT from its European services earlier this month in an anticipatory move. Coinbase cited the MiCA regulatory compliance guidelines as the reason for the delisting. Other major exchanges, such as Binance and Crypto.com, have continued to offer USDT to its users in Europe. This has generated speculation about the true status of one of the world’s dominant stablecoins. With no clear policy statement from the regulators on MiCA and USDT, market participants have been left guessing. The statement from a MiCA Crypto Alliance’s Technical Committee member did little to provide any clear stance. Juan Ignacio Ibañez, while commenting on the situation, maintained that no regulator has proclaimed USDT non-compliant. Ibañez, however, stated that the absence of a clear proclamation does not imply that USDT is compliant. Tether’s Strategic Moves Amid Uncertainty Analysts have warned that Tether’s refusal to comply with the MiCA regulations might affect Europe’s market . Notably, users in the region could experience major disruptions and weaken Europe’s status as a hub for crypto innovation. Additionally, an official ban on USDT might result in soaring costs for traders and impact market liquidity. Interestingly, a financial analyst, Jacob King, observed that Tether had not minted new coins in over two weeks. King believes the impact of this and an official ban could cause significant disruptions. Amid the uncertainty, Tether has invested in European stablecoin company StablR. StablR, licensed in Malta, issues Euro and U.S. dollar stablecoins. The move by Tether suggests a strategic development to maintain a foothold in the EU market. What Lies Ahead for Tether? Meanwhile, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has justified the company’s operational practices, noting that they have not violated any known guidelines. Ardoino emphasized the company remains focused on network collaborations and USDT’s practical uses in the market. The next few hours might unfold new developments and clarify MiCA and the USDT episode.

Cardano’s $1 Dream Crushed? 4.3 Billion ADA Wall Blocks the Way Cardano is struggling to reach the $1 mark due to a large sell wall of 4.3 billion ADA, purchased at an average price of $1.03, according to IntoTheBlock data. Approximately 309,450 addresses holding ADA in the $0.947 to $1.09 range are currently at a loss, which could impede any potential price increases. Currently, Cardano (ADA) is trading around $0.92, down 9.4% over the past week amid ongoing selling pressure in the crypto market. If the price drops further, support is anticipated between $0.659 and $0.834, as 238,860 addresses that bought within this range are likely to step in and buy again. XLM Plunges 16%: Can It Recover? Key Support Level at Risk Stellar (XLM) is currently trading at $0.38, reflecting a 7.9% drop in the past week. However, recent analysis indicates that it might be set for a price increase, according to market analysts. They spotted a potential buy signal on XLM’s daily chart. Nevertheless, there’s a key factor to watch. XLM needs to maintain the $0.33 support to attract more buyers and stabilize the market. A drop below this level could indicate a downward trend, complicating recovery. This uncertainty has led many XLM investors to explore other investment opportunities. ADA and XLM Investors Flocking to RCOF Presale: 600% Gains Predicted As Cardano and Stellar face challenges, RCOF is gaining significant investor interest with its ongoing presale. Having already generated over $9 million in revenue, this RCOF token presale reflects a remarkable surge in demand.

By publicly sharing seed phrases, scammers set up bait wallets that entangle opportunists in a deceptive scheme designed to exploit their attempts to steal funds. According to cybersecurity firm Kaspersky’s latest findings, scammers post crypto wallet seed phrases on YouTube comments using newly created accounts. Initial Bait The scheme begins with a comment under a finance-related video from someone claiming to need help transferring USDT, a stablecoin, to another wallet. They reveal their full seed phrase, essentially sharing the key to their wallet, which seems suspicious at first glance. This act of sharing a seed phrase is a red flag, as it is the gateway to accessing and controlling the funds in a wallet. Kaspersky revealed that the comment looks something like this: “I have a question. I have USDT stored in my wallet, and I have the seed phrase. How to transfer my funds to another wallet?” Upon further investigation, Kaspersky said that similar comments were posted from newly created accounts, each containing identical recovery phrases and requests for assistance. The scam assumes that an unscrupulous person, rather than offering help, might take advantage of the situation. With access to the seed phrase, they can open the wallet, which might contain a significant sum of cryptocurrency – in this case, the equivalent of $8,000 in USDT. However, the scammers have set a trap. The wallet is actually a multi-signature one, requiring multiple approvals to authorize transactions. When a thief attempts to transfer USDT, they discover that the wallet lacks enough TRX to cover the transaction fee. When the thief tries to send TRX from their own wallet, the tokens are rerouted to a completely different wallet. This clever setup ensures that even the most opportunistic thief cannot easily steal the funds. Trap For The Greedy Kaspersky’s investigation reveals that the scam primarily targets other criminals, tricking them into becoming the victims. By impersonating inexperienced crypto users, the scammers deceive thieves into attempting to steal funds that they ultimately cannot access. “So, the scammers are impersonating beginners who foolishly share access to their cryptowallets, tricking equally naive thieves – who end up becoming the victims. In this scenario, the scammers are something like digital Robin Hoods, as the scheme primarily targets other crooked individuals.” The post Crypto Scammers Bait Thieves with Public Seed Phrases in New Scheme: Kaspersky appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Crypto Scams,EN,0,0,TRX|USDT,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-29 22:10:03

Homosexual Pepe (HOMOPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homosexual Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homosexual Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Homosexual Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homosexual Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homosexual Pepe by entering its contract address – 92xPeBxtanptFH9AYsRtwRMq7cWWw9GHfxaspwpNvCTP – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOPEPE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-29 22:11:00

That’s nearly one in three searches, showcasing their meteoric rise as the year’s top crypto narrative. While $DOGE and $SHIB continue to lead with a combined market cap of $113 billion, the ecosystem has expanded to include a wave of innovative projects like $WEPE, $SOLX, and $MEMEX. These coins aren’t just riding the trend – they’re shaping its future. By the Numbers: Meme Coins in 2024 The “main meme coin narrative” alone snagged almost 15% of all crypto interest, up more than six percentage points from 2023. Solana-based meme coins added another 8%, while other offshoot trends like AI-themed meme coins and Coinbase’s Base blockchain projects contributed further. Together, they made 2024 the year of the meme coin renaissance. $DOGE and $SHIB still dominate , but fresh entrants like $WEPE and $SOLX bring new flavors to the meme coin mix. $WEPE captures the wild, humorous spirit of the original meme coin era, creating viral engagement through clever campaigns. Think of $WEPE as that unpredictable friend who’s always the life of the party – and sometimes walks away with the prize. Meanwhile, $SOLX appeals to the tech-savvy and eco-conscious crowd. It’s more than memes. It’s about solving real problems , like decentralizing energy solutions. And $MEMEX? It’s carving out a niche where AI meets meme culture, proof that even memes can innovate. Why Meme Coins Work So why do meme coins attract so much attention ? First, they’re relatable. Unlike abstract DeFi platforms or niche blockchain projects, meme coins speak the language of the internet. They’re funny, creative, and accessible, making them perfect for drawing in first-time crypto enthusiasts. Second, they offer wild swings – something traders love. Meme coins are volatile, sure, but that volatility creates opportunity. Investors love the chance to turn a few dollars into life-changing sums, even if the odds are slim. Lastly, they’re fun. In a space that can sometimes feel dry and overly technical, meme coins bring a breath of fresh air. They’re the comic relief in crypto’s blockbuster drama. A Look at the Broader Trends CoinGecko’s report also highlighted other 2024 narratives, like the rise of AI tokens, which secured 12.58% of interest, and real-world asset (RWA) tokens, which climbed to 8.64%. Solana-related projects combined for 14.3%, with meme coins taking the lion’s share. These numbers reflect a diversified market, but meme coins remain the crowd favorite. What’s Next for Meme Coins? As we close out 2024, the meme coin ecosystem looks stronger than ever. Projects like $WEPE and $SOLX are expanding the narrative, proving that meme coins can be more than fleeting trends. Whether you’re here for the laughs, the community, or the potential profits, meme coins continue to offer something for everyone. It’s clear: Meme coins are no longer just a sideshow – they’re a main act. Keep an eye on this space and promising crypto projects , because the memes aren’t just surviving. They’re thriving.",Altcoin News|Altcoins|altcoins,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-29 22:17:48

What started as a meme in the crypto world has transformed into a multi-billion dollar phenomenon, drawing in investors from all walks of life. But let’s be real, some meme coins seem to be fading out, and others are absolutely blowing up. One of those “blowing up” coins right now is BTFD Coin . While SPX6900 may have had its moment, it’s clear that the ongoing viral meme coin presale of BTFD is making waves like no other. Now, why is BTFD Coin grabbing so much attention? Well, it’s not just your average meme coin. BTFD is bringing something new to the table, like its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, referral program, staking rewards, and a mind-blowing 90% APY on staking. All of these features are creating a perfect storm of hype and potential returns. As SPX6900 seems to have run out of steam, BTFD is clearly picking up the pace, and investors are already seeing gains. In this article, we’re going to take a deeper look at BTFD Coin and SPX6900, examining why the former is taking the meme coin world by storm and why the latter is starting to look like old news. BTFD Coin: Taking Meme Coins to the Next Level BTFD Coin is the meme coin everyone’s talking about, and if you haven’t been paying attention, now’s the time to start. The ongoing viral meme coin presale has already raised over $4.6 million and sold more than 60 billion coins to over 7000 holders. And guess what? The presale isn’t even close to being over yet. In fact, we’re only in Stage 13, and the price has already skyrocketed from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin. That’s a staggering increase, but analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 by the end of the presale. So, yeah, the hype is real. So what makes BTFD Coin so unique compared to other meme coins like SPX6900? It’s the complete ecosystem BTFD is building. First off, BTFD has a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that went live in Stage 10 of the presale. Sure, the beta version of the game doesn’t offer rewards yet, but it’s already a glimpse of what’s coming. When the game is fully live, players will be able to earn rewards while having fun. It’s an innovative approach that’s bringing more utility to the meme coin space. But it doesn’t stop there. BTFD Coin also offers a 90% APY on staking, which is a total game-changer. Staking went live on December 2, and now investors can put their BTFD coins to work and earn passive income. With staking offering a 90% APY, that means your BTFD holdings can grow significantly while you just sit back and watch it happen. No wonder the presale is so popular! Another attractive feature is the BTFD Coin referral program. This allows early investors to earn rewards for bringing new people into the community. It’s a win-win situation that’s helping to spread the word and bring even more attention to the project. And of course, there’s the Bulls Squad —a community of dedicated supporters who are given exclusive updates, rewards, and special access. This gives investors a sense of belonging and makes them feel like they’re part of something bigger. SPX6900: Is It Already Yesterday’s News? SPX6900 had its time in the spotlight, no doubt about it. But lately, it seems like the presale has lost steam. While meme coins like BTFD Coin are racing ahead with innovative features and an engaged community, SPX6900’s presale numbers just aren’t showing the same level of excitement. Sure, it still has some loyal followers, but it’s not drawing the kind of attention that BTFD is. Why is that? Well, the biggest issue here is that SPX6900 doesn’t seem to offer much in terms of long-term value or utility. While meme coins were originally created as jokes, BTFD Coin has taken things to the next level by building an ecosystem that goes beyond just being a meme. With features like the Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and referral programs, BTFD is creating a much more compelling reason for people to invest. SPX6900, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to have the same kind of strategy for future growth. And without that, it’s starting to look like an old news story. When you compare the presale performance, it’s clear that SPX6900 is lagging behind. Investors are looking for projects with potential, and BTFD Coin is delivering on that front, while SPX6900 is left scrambling to keep up. In a world where investors are always searching for the next big thing, BTFD Coin has proven that it’s more than just hype—it’s a legitimate opportunity to make serious gains. While SPX6900 might have had its chance, it’s safe to say that its moment has passed. The Ongoing Viral Meme Coin Presale: Why BTFD Is the One to Watch So why is BTFD Coin’s ongoing viral meme coin presale such a big deal? It’s simple: the potential for massive gains. As mentioned, the presale price has already risen from $0.000004 to $0.000142 per coin, and analysts are predicting it could hit $0.0006 before the presale ends. With four stages still remaining, that’s a huge opportunity for anyone who’s looking to invest. Let’s break this down with an investment example. By investing $25,000 in BTFD coins during Stage 13 at the current price of $0.000142 per coin, you would receive approximately 176,056,338 coins. However, by applying the BIG50 bonus code, you’ll receive 50% more coins, bringing your total to 264,084,507 coins. When the presale concludes and the price increases to $0.0006 per coin, your investment without the BIG50 code would be worth around $105,633.80. With the BIG50 bonus, your investment would grow to a value of approximately $158,450.70, offering an additional $52,816.90 in potential earnings. This presents a great opportunity to enhance your investment as the presale progresses. But the real beauty of the BTFD Coin presale lies in its potential beyond the presale. With its Play-to-Earn game, 90% APY on staking , and referral program, the value of BTFD Coin is only going to increase as the project continues to grow. Analysts are predicting a bright future for BTFD, and early investors are already seeing the benefits. Now is the time to get in on this ongoing viral meme coin presale before it’s too late. BTFD Coin is moving fast, and with analysts predicting a surge in price, you’ll want to be on the winning side of this one. Conclusion: Don’t Miss Out on the BTFD Coin Presale BTFD Coin is a meme coin with real potential, and the ongoing viral meme coin presale is the perfect opportunity to get in early. With features like a Play-to-Earn game, staking rewards, and an engaging referral program, BTFD Coin is setting itself up for long-term success. Meanwhile, SPX6900 seems to be fading into the background, with its presale losing steam and investors looking elsewhere for the next big thing. If you want to be part of the next big wave in the meme coin space, now’s the time to act. With over $4.6 million raised in the presale and the price already on the rise, there’s no better time to jump in. Don’t let this opportunity slip away—join the BTFD Coin presale today and make the most of this wealth-generation opportunity before it’s too late!

In recent years, we have seen huge attention from large corporations towards Bitcoin, the celebrated currency for years as decentralized and peer-to-peer. It was the currency’s ability to function outside of central banks, governments, and large financial institutions that attracted people toward Bitcoin. Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized digital currency owned and used by anyone anywhere in the world without the help of an intermediary. The increasing interest and participation of major corporations in the Bitcoin ecosystem raise concerns about its future in terms of decentralization and freedom.

According to CoinGecko companies like MicroStrategy hold over 444,262 Bitcoins, while Marathon Digital holds over 26,842. Marathon Digital is a Bitcoin mining company and owns 40,435 Bitcoins. Even Tesla holds 11,509 bitcoins. In addition, Galaxy Digital holding companies with over 15,449 Bitcoins, Coinbase holds over 9,183 Bitcoins, Bitcoin mining companies like CleanSpark hold around 6,154 Bitcoins, and Hut 8 also holds 9,102 Bitcoins and many more. This rising corporate involvement is an indicator of how Bitcoin is gaining importance in business strategies-whether as a store of value, hedge against inflation, or financial diversification tool. These companies can hold a big portion of the total supply since they acquire Bitcoin. For the simple fact that the total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, there’s the likelihood that a few companies own a large portion of Bitcoin that could significantly alter what the original intention of Bitcoin is-to be decentralized to everyone. Bitcoin becoming centralized This means that one of the most important concerns with this increase in corporate ownership is the potential centralization of Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Marathon Digital Holdings are buying ever more Bitcoin, and their reserves may eventually comprise a significant percentage of the overall supply. This may give these companies significant market power, which could lead to price manipulation and increased market volatility. If a few entities control large amounts of Bitcoin, they can buy or sell at will, which affects the price and causes fluctuations. Instead of Bitcoin as an open source currency that is free to be traded by any user and is almost a new tool for market control, it could be the means of giving power to a small group of corporate interests. Some corporations not only hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset but also engage actively in the mining process. Domination on Bitcoin mining It requires large quantities of cheap energy, the larger corporations can thus be able to invest heftily in mining, meaning they have the capacity of controlling a large proportion of the network’s mining power. This may have a result of centralization, which was initially what decentralization and accessibility aimed to achieve. The issue of mining centralization has been a long-term worry within the Bitcoin community. Early on, Bitcoin mining was an activity that someone with the right hardware could undertake. This, however, changed quite quickly as mining became challenging and its rewards attractive to professionalize the activity in question. Today, most mining is dominated by big companies that have the requisite resources to invest in more powerful, specialized equipment or secure cheap energy. Consequently, this centralization of power in mining leads to decisions that go into place on the Bitcoin network, as changes to protocol and even the general direction of future development. Staking may centralize Bitcoin control There are even more firms starting to participate in Bitcoin staking, even though Bitcoin does not use a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Some newer platforms support staking of users’ Bitcoin and reward the stakes held by users. If such services become more widespread and dominated by a few large corporate players, then centralization of control over the Bitcoin network will continue. This would allow these companies to decide how Bitcoin is used and to make money from the network, thereby having more control over the entire system. As more companies get involved, it becomes a serious concern for the future freedom of Bitcoin. Threat of Increased Regulatory Control This also increases the possibility of having greater regulatory pressure. Such enormous sums of Bitcoin held by corporations would mean an easy opportunity for governments to bring in strict regulations upon this asset. Such regulations could undermine the decentralized character of Bitcoin by forcing corporate holders to comply with state mandates in the form of KYC and AML requirements . This would make a scenario where Bitcoin is not an asset free from the governmental oversight but one with regulation, which may defeat the very core values for decentralization and freedom. The future of Bitcoin is becoming increasingly intertwined with the interests of large corporations. As the Bitcoin network keeps changing, so too will the community, regulators, and corporations realize that rising concentration of Bitcoin ownership means a lot to it. The potential for centralization, whether through corporate ownership or mining, could shift Bitcoin away from its original mission. If the power over Bitcoin remains in just a few people’s pockets, the dream of financial freedom might go down in flames. Therefore, continued decentralization must be addressed to maintain what Bitcoin was originally brought forth to become a resource for personal freedom and free access rather than corporative manipulation.

That’s a 50% increase from 2024, but still less than the roughly $30 billion “that was invested in 2021 and 2022,” he added. 2023 and 2024 recap Le described 2023 as a challenging year for crypto funding due to the collapse of FTX, erosion of trust, and higher interest rates. However, 2024 started strong with positive momentum driven by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs getting approved. Despite a slowdown mid-year, “we’re probably going to end [2024] at somewhere between $11 [billion] and $12 billion of invested capital, which is still 10 to 20% more than 2023,” he said. You might also like: Polymarket odds of Trump approving strategic Bitcoin reserves fall to 27% 2025 Funding Expectations Le’s projection of $18 billion or more in crypto VC funding is a 50% increase compared to 2024. Several factors bode well for the sector, he says. They include: Generalist investors are regaining interest, signaling potential large-scale investments. Crypto-native funds have significant dry powder but require generalist participation for substantial growth. Financial institutions will play a pivotal role by leveraging their trusted relationships with regulators. Shifting focus Le anticipates a shift in focus toward application-layer investments, moving beyond infrastructure projects. Examples include: Decentralized applications (dApps) targeting non-crypto users with better risk management. Use cases leveraging crypto infrastructure for non-crypto sectors such as mobility and energy data. The analogy of AWS serving as a base for companies like Uber and Airbnb highlights the need for robust applications atop crypto infrastructure to realize its full potential, Le argues. The benefit of ‘nothing’ Le emphasized the importance of regulatory clarity for the crypto industry’s growth. He expressed cautious optimism about the U.S. regulatory environment in 2025, noting: A shift in SEC leadership under the incoming Trump administration could result in fewer enforcement actions. Legislative progress, such as stablecoin bills or crypto-specific rules, would be beneficial but is not guaranteed. Even a lack of new regulatory actions could be an improvement over the past two years of uncertainty. Le concluded that a stable regulatory environment, coupled with growing institutional involvement and application-focused investments, could set the stage for significant advancements in the crypto sector in 2025. But even if the next presidential administration and incoming lawmakers “do nothing,” Le says, “that is already an improvement.” For the full interview, see below.

In the midst of this evolving storyline, a disruptive entity, RCO Finance (RCOF), rises as a strong competitor, presenting a new take on decentralized finance (DeFi) through a combination of inventive features and progressive technology. Stellar Vs Ripple: Rivalry Intensifies As XLM Gears Up For Price Rally Recent examination by cryptocurrency specialist Ali Martinez reveals a positive signal for Stellar, suggesting a possible price turnaround after a significant correction driven by Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The analyst recently pointed out that the Tom Demark (TD) sequential indicator has indicated a buy on XLM’s daily chart, implying that if the $0.33 support level remains intact, a price recovery could be forthcoming. At present, Stellar is priced at $0.37, slightly above this important level. Even with significant losses across different periods—4% in 24 hours, 8% in a week, and 23% in 14 days—Stellar continues to hold nearly 200% gains year-to-date. Conversely, Ripple’s XRP has shown greater strength, experiencing smaller declines of 2% and 4% during comparable times, while achieving an impressive monthly increase of roughly 60% that has brought one of the biggest altcoins in the market nearer to its all-time peaks. Although Stellar has lagged behind Ripple in recent months, the buy signal from the TD sequential indicator may create an opportunity for a comeback, enabling Stellar to narrow the gap with its rival. Moreover, market specialist CW has observed a bullish flag formation for Ripple’s competitor Stellar, predicting a possible target price of $0.82 after a breakout—close to its historical high of $0.87 achieved almost seven years prior. With the increasing positivity regarding Stellar and Ripple, RCO Finance is grabbing attention. Currently in its presale stage, RCO Finance has already secured close to $10 million, garnering interest for its unique strategy in DeFi. Now in the fourth phase of its presale, RCOF is set for considerable expansion, with estimates indicating a rise of almost 200%, anticipating the RCOF price to hit $0.214. So, what distinguishes RCO Finance from well-known entities such as Ripple and Stellar? AI Magic Unleashed To begin with, RCO Finance utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to offer an extensive range of financial products, making both traditional and decentralized finance accessible to all. The platform provides services like staking, yield farming, lending, and token swapping, all within a safe environment. A distinctive aspect of RCO Finance is its Robo Advisor powered by AI. This instrument functions as an automated investment manager, evaluating vast market information to provide customized investment strategies suited to each user’s financial objectives and risk preferences. Additionally, RCO Finance provides support for more than 120,000 digital assets spanning 12,500 asset classes, such as stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and derivatives. This wide access enables regular investors to diversify their portfolios, representing a major change from conventional models that frequently leave retail investors out of high-liquidity assets. RCO Finance’s Bullish Surge Post-Exchange Debut – Get Ready! RCO Finance also prioritizes user privacy by functioning on a Know-Your-Customer (KYC)-free platform, allowing for anonymous transactions. The governance framework promotes community involvement, enabling token holders to impact significant platform modifications and nurturing a feeling of ownership. As RCO Finance gets ready to debut on major exchanges, experts anticipate a spike in its price, possibly hitting between $0.40 and $0.50 soon after its launch. This offers a rare chance for initial investors to take advantage of the present positive market sentiment. Conclusion In summary, although Stellar and Ripple seek to strengthen their stance in the challenging blockchain payment landscape, RCO Finance is poised to challenge the existing norms with its groundbreaking solutions. With the market undergoing its bullish cycle led by Ripple and XRP’s performance, RCO Finance offers fascinating prospects for investors looking for expansion in the ever-changing realm of cryptocurrency.

According to the analyst, technical analysis of the XRP price on the weekly timeframe suggests that XRP is on track to reach a price target of $15 by May 5, 2025. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The analysis, which is rooted in Fibonacci levels and Elliott Wave theory, offers a long-term bullish outlook for the altcoin despite its recent decline over the past week. This is because the XRP price has been on a decline since the past seven days alongside the rest of the crypto market. Fibonacci And Elliott Wave Analysis For XRP According to Egrag Crypto, the Fibonacci 1.618 level indicates that May 5, 2025, could be a pivotal date for XRP’s price trajectory in the long term. His technical analysis uses auto-Fib time zones and trend-based Fibonacci on the weekly XRP timeframe price chart. Interestingly, this timeline aligns closely with the general sentiment surrounding XRP, as many crypto participants are currently looking forward to a surge in the first half of 2025. As such, the analyst also noted that it remains uncertain whether the predicted surge to $15 will occur before or after this predicted date. Speaking of price timeline, the $15 target is based on actual calculations and the Elliot Wave theory. According to the analyst, XRP is currently in Wave 4, which is the second corrective phase in the Elliot Wave theory. Once this phase is completed, Wave 5 is expected to be the next major move. Wave 5 is traditionally known for being the third impulse wave that pushes the asset’s price to new highs. To estimate the magnitude of Wave 5, the analyst examined the performance of the previous impulse waves 1 and 3. Notably, Waves 1 and 3 were highlighted by price increases of 63.39% and 570%, respectively. Using these figures, Egrag Crypto applied a common Elliott Wave principle that suggests Wave 5 often equals 61.8% of the combined gains of Waves 1 and 3. By applying this school of thought and punching in the numbers, Wave 5 is expected to result in an approximate price increase of around 391% for XRP. In terms of a price target, this translates to a price range around $15. Is A Long-Term Bullish Trajectory Still Valid For XRP? Despite XRP’s current decline over the past seven days, mirroring a broader market downturn, this technical analysis provides a counterpoint to the short-term bearish outlook. Particularly, XRP has been on a decline since it peaked at $2.82 on December 3. Related Reading: XRP Forms Bullish Flag Pattern: What’s Next For The Altcoin?

CoinMarketCap data reveals that the total market cap for memecoins was $120.14 billion on Dec. 1. It peaked at $137.06 billion on Dec. 9 before plunging to a low of $92.67 billion on Dec. 23, marking a 32.38% decline within the month. As of now, memecoins’ market capitalization stands at $98.72 billion, down 18% from its value at the start of December. Pepe and Exchange Listings Propel Early December Surge Pepe (PEPE), the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization, mirrored the broader market’s fluctuations. According to Cointelegraph Markets Pro, Pepe’s price climbed to $0.000026 on Dec. 9 before dropping to $0.000017 by Dec. 20. On Dec. 4, Binance.US listed Pepe, driving the token to an all-time high and surpassing Uniswap’s token (UNI) in market capitalization by Dec. 7. Pepe’s market cap grew from $591 million at the start of 2024 to over $11 billion following the listing, representing an 18x increase. Coinbase also listed memecoins such as Moodeng (MOODENG), Mog (MOG), and Dogwifhat (WIF) in December. Traders Profit Big from Pepe’s Rise Throughout 2024, savvy traders capitalized on Pepe’s meteoric rise. In April, a crypto trader who invested $3,000 in Pepe saw their holdings grow to $46 million within a month as the token surged over 15,000 times in value.

Classification of Crypto Set to Change in Japan? The FSA wrote that it wants to start considering cryptoassets as “financial assets” that “the general public can invest in.” Trading volumes on Japan’s bitFlyer crypto exchange over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Currently, Japanese law classifies cryptoassets as “payment instruments” under the terms of the Payment Services Act. The switch to a more “investment”-focused definition would represent something of a legitimization for crypto. But such a change would seemingly be dependant on the stability of the crypto industry. And while the document stops short of calling for crypto tax reform, CoinPost wrote that it suggests “a possibility” that Japan’s controversial crypto tax rules “will be reviewed.” Costly climate disasters created a crisis for Japan's insurance industry.

The move comes days after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) made similar claims in its own tax policy recommendations for FY2025. The LDP wants the crypto industry to incorporate “regulations on accountability and investor protection” that are “equivalent to those in place for stock investment in listed companies.” This would allow the law to start viewing “certain cryptoassets” as “financial products” commonly used in “the general public’s portfolios.” CoinPost wrote that the tone of the FSA’s document suggests that it is “endorsing [the LDP’s]” stance. The FSA, media outlets this year claimed, is readying a “fundamental review” of the way it regulates crypto. However, the FSA’s move appears to suggest it thinks the Payment Services Act offers insufficient protection to crypto investors. Inflation in Japan's capital accelerates, keeps rate hike prospects intact https://t.co/kPji7EHgz9 pic.twitter.com/cbDtZk2VdW — Reuters (@Reuters) December 27, 2024 Differing Views on Tax Reform There is another wrinkle for Japanese crypto traders. While the LDP appears keen to scrap Japan’s current crypto tax system, the FSA seems to have different ideas. Under the current system, crypto traders must declare their profits as “other income” on yearly tax declarations. That means high earners can pay up to 55% tax on their earnings. The LDP favors abolishing this system in favor of a capital gains tax on crypto earnings. The FSA, however, seems instead keen to place crypto “within a more comprehensive framework of income tax integration,” CoinPost explained. There does, though, appear to be a consensus about the need to change the legal classification of crypto in Japan. This is particularly relevant as Japanese companies like Metaplanet and Remixpoint begin to ramp up their Bitcoin-buying strategies.

Prince Elon (ELONPRIN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONPRIN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Prince Elon can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Prince Elon could become the next viral memecoin. Prince Elon launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Prince Elon on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Prince Elon by entering its contract address – 7rAsmWGTtPFY9RFnhd9biard7PrWtw5ZigowwfmaXUQ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONPRIN.

BlockDAG Network launches its innovative $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle, while Ethereum gears up for a potential surge to $12,000. Ethereum’s appeal grows with its scalability improvements and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), while BlockDAG captures the spotlight by mixing crypto bonuses with enticing raffle wins. BlockDAG’s strong presale performance coupled with solid buyer trust provides immediate opportunities and hints at long-term growth. Meanwhile, excitement builds around XRP, forecasting a promising 2025 as BlockDAG’s expanding influence makes it a standout choice for crypto explorers. Usher in 2025 with a Million-Dollar Celebration What better way to greet 2025 than with BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle? This isn’t just a lottery—it’s a festive toast to the new year, offering participants a shot at a life-altering $1 million USDT. BlockDAG makes participation a breeze with three ticket tiers suited to different budgets. The Bronze Ticket, at an accessible 125 USDT, could net you as much as $250,000 USDT. To boost your chances, consider the Silver Ticket at 250 USDT, balancing cost with potential returns. For those dreaming big, the Gold Ticket at 500 USDT offers the best shot at the $1M USDT jackpot, plus a 200% bonus in BDAG coins. This raffle does more than hand out tickets; it boosts your crypto portfolio with bonuses, ensuring that everyone can find a ticket that fits their budget, all while adding a sprinkle of excitement with its grand prize. BlockDAG’s journey in the crypto market has been noteworthy, with presale batch 26 amassing $173.5 million and selling over 17.5 billion BDAG coins—a stunning 2240% growth since its inception. Ethereum’s Price Ascent: Analysts Eye $12,000 Target Ethereum is on the cusp of a significant rise, with predictions aiming for $12,000 in the coming market cycle. This optimism is fueled by Ethereum’s continued tech advancements, especially sharding, which aims to boost network efficiency and speed by splitting the blockchain into smaller segments. Additionally, Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism are reducing network congestion and lowering costs, enhancing Ethereum’s allure. As Ethereum solidifies its lead with growing DeFi and NFT adoption, it must navigate challenges like emerging competitors and potential regulatory changes. XRP’s Price Forecast for 2025: Valuing 1,000 Tokens Anticipation for XRP’s 2025 price is high, spurred by Ripple’s growing adoption and impressive market performance last year. With its price around $3, XRP’s value has nearly quintupled in 2024. Analysts are optimistic, predicting a rise to $5–$7 by mid-2025, potentially boosting the value of 1,000 XRP tokens to $5,000–$7,000. However, the volatile nature of the crypto market calls for cautious optimism. Factors like global regulatory changes and Ripple’s strategies will heavily influence XRP’s trajectory, though its role in cross-border payments and possible integration with central bank digital currencies strengthen its long-term viability. Final Thoughts As 2025 dawns, the crypto sector brims with both potential profits and exciting prospects. BlockDAG’s $1M USDT New Year’s Raffle offers both immediate gratification and the potential for crypto growth, making it one of the best crypto projects for all participants. With Ethereum’s technological strides and XRP’s promising price outlook, the diverse paths of cryptocurrencies are poised to influence the future financial landscape. BlockDAG’s mix of successful presales, significant returns, and broad accessibility highlights its growing importance in the crypto community.

In 2025, Nvidia will face increased competition from AMD, Intel, and tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, who are developing their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia’s products. Nvidia has had a great year in 2024. The ranking has placed the company, without a doubt, at the top of the artificial intelligence market. Innovative AI technologies and strategic investments in cutting-edge hardware have fast-tracked this event’s share price and revenue. Nvidia’s 2024 Dominance NVIDIA became the most valuable publicly traded company worldwide by breaking past Apple and crossing $3 trillion. Jensen Huang, CEO took over this company and steered its growth to the maximum that has ever happened. Nvidia products underpin most AI innovation across industries. Nvidia’s Blackwell chip, designed explicitly for AI applications, will drive the market in 2025, however, this success does not predict an easy future for the company. Nvidia’s fortune can be traced primarily to its early investments in AI software and hardware. Its CUDA software helps developers build applications for chips made by Nvidia. Hyperscalers—which include Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta in the massive cloud computing providers crowd rely on Nvidia for the powerful GPUs that are used for AI model training. The company’s business with data centres generated 87% of revenues during the most recent quarter, one major area driving the firm financially. Currently, Nvidia remains at the head of the AI band, and chips from Blackwell are in very high demand. This is further attested to by customers such as Amazon, who already have the data centres readied in preparation for the immense amount of power and heat expected from the new processors being developed. This signifies how Nvidia is crucial in this AI revolution. 2025 Challenges But, by 2025, challenges are coming up rapidly against Nvidia’s leadership position. AMD and Intel, in particular, continue developing their AI-centric chips; AMD seems better suited than any competitor to cut into Nvidia’s lead in a big way. MI300X from AMD can be directly positioned as the H100 Hopper Nvidia develops. At this time, Intel is still unable to regain its ground, and AMD’s products are much more competitive. Further advanced software development could make its chips more appealing to developers and cloud providers. But now, another emerging risk is the danger of its customers starting to build AI chips themselves. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have started designing their semiconductors, reducing dependence on those semiconductors that would be required from Nvidia. While these companies still have to purchase chips from Nvidia, this would progressively reduce Nvidia’s share of the market in the future. Further, the shift to inferencing by AI models, which involves putting AI models into actual operating environments, may help lower the need for powerhouse chips like the one for which Nvidia is famous because inferencing requires very little computation to perform what’s needed compared to training. Despite all these potential risks, Nvidia is well positioned to remain the AI powerhouse in 2025, having caught the imagination and interest of innovators. Nvidia remains the default choice of chips in training large-scale AI models Traditional chipmakers like AMD and Intel, as well as the customers interested in their own AI solutions, will begin to throw corporate weight behind Nvidia, demanding serious intervention from the company’s management. 2025 is going to be difficult for them.

CryptoQuant CEO Questions US’s Next Move,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-as-a-strategic-asset-cryptoquant-ceo-questions-uss-next-move/,"Since President-elect Donald Trump raised the possibility of establishing a US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, many advocates have pushed for the creation of the crypto stockpile, saying that it would make the country as the leader in the global cryptocurrency landscape. However, not everyone in the crypto community is convinced of the feasibility of the crypto reserve. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju is pessimistic that the prospect of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve would get an approval from the incoming administration. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350K? Kiyosaki Stands Firm Amid BlackRock ETF Drama BTC Reserve Doubtful Young Ju is not convinced that the proposed Bitcoin reserve would push through, saying it is unlikely that Trump would embrace the crypto strategy to protect US dollar dominance because the greenback remains a safe haven currency. Throughout history, whenever the United States perceived a threat to its dominance in the global economy, gold prices surged, and debates around the gold standard gained traction. In the late 1990s, Peter Schiff championed gold as the true form of money, much like today’s… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 28, 2024 The executive of CryptoQuant thinks that the policies of the new government would be much influenced by the apparent strength of the US economy and the predominance of the American currency in international trade. Young Ju said that if there is a perceived threat to the US economic hegemony, gold, Bitcoin or any other store-of-value assets would experience a surge in its price. US Economy Still Dominates Young Ju argued that there is no perceived threat to American dominance since many investors still have great confidence in the US economy or the US dollar. “I personally support the idea of #Bitcoin Standard. However, I question whether the US, while continuing to grow as other economies stagnate, would adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset,” he said in a post. The crypto executive believes the debate on the Bitcoin reserve would only gain serious momentum if the country’s global economic dominance is “genuinely threatened,” adding, “At present, market sentiment suggests confidence in the US’ continued supremacy.” The US processed 37.8% of the world’s Bitcoin in 2022, making it the leader in crypto mining, according to government data. Crypto Stance Could Shift Young Ju said that it is possible that Trump’s stance on Bitcoin may take an unexpected turn depending on the broader political landscape. “If Trump succeeds in showcasing US economic resilience, reinforcing the dollar’s supremacy, and boosting his approval ratings, it’s unclear if he would maintain the strong pro-Bitcoin stance he demonstrated during his campaign,” he explained in a post. Related Reading: CME Gap Threatens Bitcoin With Potential Drop To $77,000 – Analyst The CryptoQuant CEO suggested that more likely, Trump would “step back from his Bitcoin advocacy,” pointing out that he might cite that there has been a change in priorities, “without alienating his voter base.” “At the BTC Conference, was his mention of Bitcoin as a strategic asset a genuine step toward preparing for a Bitcoin Standard, or merely a calculated move to secure votes?” he said. For the crypto executive, it is still unsure which of Trump’s “campaign rhetoric on Bitcoin” will be fulfilled.

Looking at the memecoin Popcat ( POPCAT ), the trader believes that the Solana ( SOL )-based crypto asset may be in the midst of ending its multi-week downtrend. “POPCAT this should be the relative bottom.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, POPCAT is trading for $0.798. Turning to a crypto project dubbed a Solana killer, Altcoin Sherpa says that traders should not underestimate layer-1 protocol Sui ( SUI ) despite its bearish-looking daily chart. “SUI I’d never want to short this chart where it’s currently at but it doesn’t look great. Still this one keeps going higher regardless of how the chart looks, so fade at your own peril.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, SUI is worth $4.18.
