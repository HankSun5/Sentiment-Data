ADA has been stuck in a range, showing no clear breakout, while SUI’s price stagnates around $1 despite solid DEX volumes. This suggests a shift in investor confidence away from established altcoins. Enter BlockDAG . With its token priced at just $0.0018 and over $281 million raised in presale, BlockDAG is quickly emerging as the market’s hottest early-stage crypto. While ADA and SUI wait for their next big move, BlockDAG is already making waves and setting its own pace. Investors are taking note, and capital is flowing in at an unprecedented rate. Cardano Struggles to Break Out Cardano (ADA) has earned its place as a solid project, thanks to its emphasis on research, peer-reviewed development, and steady upgrades. However, in today’s market, these strengths aren’t showing up in its price action. ADA has been stuck around the $0.45–$0.50 range, and sentiment seems to lean more neutral or slightly bearish. While analysts recognize Cardano’s potential with growing on-chain activity and upcoming updates, there’s no clear timeline for when we’ll see a breakout. A recent report suggested that ADA could eventually reach $10, with a multi-phase growth plan, but even the most optimistic projections place that milestone in mid-2026. For investors looking for quicker gains, that’s a long wait. With no immediate catalysts to drive the price up, ADA has shifted from a buy to more of a hold. This lack of clear momentum is pushing investors to look for projects that offer more immediate returns, like BlockDAG, which comes with a more defined and exciting roadmap. SUI Surpasses $14B in DEX Volume SUI, the layer-1 blockchain built with object-based smart contracts, has made significant strides, particularly in the DeFi space. It recently hit a new milestone, surpassing $14.8 billion in monthly decentralized exchange volume, outpacing many of its competitors in terms of on-chain activity. However, despite these solid figures, SUI’s price has been stuck around $1.08, with little movement in recent weeks. This disconnect between the strong network performance and price action has left some investors frustrated. While SUI’s fundamentals are improving, the market seems to have already priced in much of its current value. Without a major catalyst or a shift in narrative, SUI may continue to trade in this consolidation phase. Analysts have pointed out the gap between adoption metrics and price, suggesting that the market may not be fully appreciating SUI’s potential. But they also caution that any upside may depend on broader market enthusiasm picking up. In short, SUI is executing well on the development front, but its price action just isn’t reflecting that right now. BlockDAG Hits $281M as Traders Flock to $0.0018 Presale! As ADA and SUI maintain steady momentum, BlockDAG is speeding ahead, rapidly gaining traction. With over $281 million raised in presale funds and a price set at just $0.0018 per token, it’s drawing serious investor interest. Each passing day, new capital is flowing in, pushing BlockDAG closer to its goal of hitting $300 million in presale commitments. What sets BlockDAG apart? It’s more than just an idea; it’s a project with a concrete vision and deployable tech. By combining blockchain security with the scalability of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), BlockDAG can handle high transaction volumes with minimal delay. It’s also fully EVM-compatible, enabling developers to build or migrate decentralized applications with ease. Plus, the platform’s low-code smart contract builder makes it simple for creators to get started. BlockDAG’s roadmap isn’t just a list of goals, it’s a clear path forward. On June 13, the project will showcase 15 more exchange listings, on top of its five existing ones, including MEXC, LBank, and CoinStore. This will provide the liquidity and market exposure needed for a strong post-launch performance. With an anticipated launch price of $0.05, early investors could see returns as high as 2,677%, with some even projecting a $20 future price. These aren’t just pipe dreams; they’re grounded in real data and solid market engagement. While other projects like ADA and SUI are slow to evolve, BlockDAG is making things happen now, and that’s why investors are lining up. Final Thoughts Cardano and SUI have their merits, but they aren’t catching the market’s attention right now. Cardano’s long-term plans are still a work in progress, and while SUI leads in DeFi, its price has stalled despite solid fundamentals. Investors are starting to look elsewhere. Enter BlockDAG. With a token price of just $0.0018 and over $281 million raised in presale, it’s attracting serious attention. On top of that, a June event will reveal 20 exchange listings, further boosting its market presence. BlockDAG is doing what others aren’t: delivering real growth now, not waiting for future validation. As the hunt for the next big crypto intensifies, BlockDAG is quickly becoming the go-to project to watch.

At the same time, the currency has lost 3.16% of its value in the day. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.615 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.192 over the last 24 hours as bearish momentum rose around immediate resistance channels. Moreover, sellers are currently dominating the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.329854 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by June 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,276.57 DOGE in June; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future?

Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.72 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $0.12260 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered back to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. Near the start of June 2025, Dogecoin is trending near the $0.20 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-01 21:00:39

These often-viral assets are doing more than just making headlines. Meme Coins Spark Broader Crypto Participation According to the latest report titled “State of Crypto” by Winklevoss twins-led crypto exchange Gemini, meme coins are encouraging newcomers to explore the digital asset industry. This was found after conducting a survey of 7,205 consumers in the US, UK, France, Italy, Singapore, and Australia (approximately 1,200) consumers per country. A large majority – a whopping 94% – of meme coin holders also hold other types of cryptocurrencies, suggesting that meme coins act as a bridge into the broader crypto ecosystem. Many users appear to begin their journey with these tokens before branching out. For example, 31% of US investors who own both meme coins and traditional cryptocurrencies say meme coins were their first crypto purchase. That trend is similarly reflected in Australia and the UK, which trailed with 28% each, followed by Singapore with 23%, Italy with 22%, and France with 19%. Interestingly, France also leads in overall meme coin ownership, with 67% of its crypto investors holding at least one. The trend continues across other regions with Singapore at 59%, Italy at 58%, the UK at 57%, the US at 55%, and Australia at 45%. Europe Leads Crypto Ownership Zooming out, crypto ownership has grown steadily across multiple regions following the 2022 market downturn. Europe reported a notable rise. In 2025, 24% of UK respondents said they owned cryptocurrency, up from 18% in 2024. France saw a similar rise, with ownership increasing to 21%, also from 18% the previous year. Analysts attribute this growth in part to a more favorable regulatory climate in Europe, driven by the phased rollout of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework over the last two years. Singapore recorded the highest rate of crypto ownership among the surveyed countries, with 28% of respondents reporting they hold digital assets. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s recent crypto-friendly policies are also influencing public sentiment. After vowing to support digital assets during his campaign, Trump has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, restructured the SEC toward a more innovation-driven stance, and backed legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins and broader crypto markets. Additionally, he introduced a Trump-branded meme coin, which reached nearly $3 billion in market cap this month. These developments appear to be boosting confidence among potential investors. Nearly 23% of non-crypto owners in the US said the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve made them more confident in crypto’s value. Trump’s initiatives are having an international ripple effect on attitudes toward digital asset investment, as 21% of non-crypto owners in the UK and 19% in Singapore echoed a similar sentiment.

Early Buyers Eye Qubetics’ Presale Momentum Alongside Ethereum and GALA’s Proven Leadership,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-to-join-for-2025-early-buyers-eye-qubetics-presale-momentum-alongside-ethereum-and-galas-proven-leadership/,"As blockchain adoption enters a new phase of institutional integration and utility-driven demand, the focus has shifted from short-lived market hype to long-term functional ecosystems. Projects that offer real-world use cases, protocol flexibility, and developer traction are increasingly viewed as core assets by seasoned community participants and blockchain infrastructure backers alike.Among the standout entries in 2025 is Qubetics ($TICS) —a blockchain infrastructure project delivering mission-critical tools like a decentralized VPN while gaining significant traction through its presale. Alongside Qubetics , leading platforms such as Ethereum (ETH) and GALA continue to serve as pillars of decentralized technology, offering foundational services across smart contracts, dApps, and blockchain gaming. Each of these projects represents a compelling case for inclusion among the top cryptos to join for 2025, delivering value at different layers of the Web3 economy. Qubetics (TICS): Securing Web3 Access Through a Decentralized VPN Qubetics is emerging as a leader among the top cryptos to join for 2025, with its ecosystem designed to empower user sovereignty, privacy, and utility across a multi-chain environment. One of its most transformative features is its Decentralized VPN (dVPN)—a permissionless privacy infrastructure allowing users to route traffic through community-powered nodes rather than centralized servers. This innovation serves a critical need for businesses, developers, and individuals concerned about surveillance, data mining, and centralized points of failure. A multinational law firm working across jurisdictions with strict data privacy regulations, for example, can integrate Qubetics’ dVPN to protect sensitive documents and enforce zero-trust architecture internally. Similarly, journalists, developers, and freelancers in restrictive regions can access global internet services securely and anonymously, bypassing firewalls and content censorship. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralized data centers and are subject to geo-political control, Qubetics’ dVPN is community-operated. This means anyone can contribute unused bandwidth to the network, earning passive rewards while decentralizing privacy infrastructure. The model enables a two-sided network economy—driving both adoption and utility growth. Analysts’ Projections for $TICS The performance of the ongoing Qubetics crypto presale is an indicator of strong market confidence. In Stage 36, Qubetics has already sold over 514 million tokens to more than 27,300 participants, raising a total of $17.5 million. The token is currently available at $0.3064, offering a compelling early entry point into a privacy-focused, infrastructure-first ecosystem. Market analysts following the project have highlighted several price trajectories based on adoption and platform usage. A post-presale valuation of $1 would imply a 226% ROI. Mid-range projections of $5 and $6 suggest 1,531% and 1,857% returns. At higher targets, such as $10 and $15, community members could realize 3,163% and 4,794% ROI, respectively. These forecasts underscore why Qubetics is being positioned as a high-utility asset with extraordinary upside among the top cryptos to join for 2025 . Qubetics delivers a unique blend of privacy infrastructure, non-custodial utility, and cross-chain access with early market validation. Its decentralized VPN offering and high-performing presale make it a strategic entry in 2025’s leading blockchain projects. Ethereum (ETH): The Cornerstone of Smart Contracts and On-Chain Innovation Ethereum stands as the original and most widely adopted smart contract platform, serving as the foundational infrastructure for the decentralized application (dApp) economy. Since launching in 2015, Ethereum has evolved into a high-value ecosystem supporting thousands of projects across DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and decentralized identity. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is widely recognized as the industry standard for smart contract execution. It is compatible with multiple Layer 2 networks and sidechains, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and zkSync—enabling scalable, low-fee experiences without compromising on Ethereum’s security and decentralization. Ethereum’s importance is further amplified by its massive developer base and institutional integration. It underpins the majority of token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) and serves as the backbone for DeFi protocols managing billions in total value locked (TVL). Applications ranging from stablecoin protocols to decentralized exchanges, prediction markets, and DAOs all rely on Ethereum for operational integrity. One of Ethereum’s strongest assets is its commitment to ongoing evolution. The transition to proof-of-stake via the Merge has significantly improved energy efficiency and set the stage for additional upgrades like sharding and scalability enhancements under the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap. Ethereum is also viewed as a credible bridge between Web2 and Web3 for enterprises. With growing interest from multinational firms and public institutions, Ethereum’s role as a programmable, open-source layer for financial, identity, and data services is cemented. Ethereum is a necessary inclusion in any serious crypto strategy due to its unmatched infrastructure footprint and role in hosting decentralized applications. It remains a core building block in the conversation around the top cryptos to join for 2025 . GALA: Redefining Entertainment and Gaming Through Blockchain GALA is at the forefront of Web3 gaming and digital entertainment, offering decentralized infrastructure for developers and content creators to build, monetize, and distribute experiences across virtual worlds. As part of the larger Gala Games ecosystem, the GALA token is used to power in-game economies, support governance, and reward ecosystem contributions. What differentiates GALA from traditional gaming platforms is its user-first model. In the Gala ecosystem, players can own in-game items as NFTs, trade them freely, and even earn tokens through gameplay. This approach flips the conventional model where gaming companies retain full control over assets and monetization channels. Gala Games has onboarded a wide variety of gaming titles, including MMORPGs, tower defense games, racing simulators, and even music platforms under Gala Music. These platforms leverage blockchain for asset ownership, royalty distribution, and direct creator-to-fan engagement. Content creators can publish and sell without relying on intermediaries, while players gain access to immersive, transparent reward systems. GALA has positioned itself as an entertainment infrastructure platform rather than just a game publisher. It has expanded into hosting its own nodes, community-driven governance, and partnerships with both legacy studios and independent developers to build out its ecosystem.

The bill, which is expected to pass after the election, has caused great activity in the financial sector. The country's leading financial institutions are rapidly establishing collaborations and continuing technical infrastructure preparations in order to be pioneers in this new market. Tokenized securities are known as digital securities supported by blockchain technology. Thanks to the security and ease of transaction offered by this technology, it is possible to divide low-liquid assets such as real estate, works of art, and even live animals into small shares and offer them to investors. Currently, tokenized securities remain in a gray area due to a lack of regulation. However, both main candidates running in the presidential election, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have made it clear in their campaign promises that tokenized securities will be legalized quickly, making the bill’s passage almost certain. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives Another Bullish Signal That He Will Buy Bitcoin: Here's How Much BTC He Currently Owns The fact that tokenized securities are both based on real assets and have the status of a security has led to a serious consensus among political parties in this area. This makes it easier for the law to pass. According to industry representatives, this digital asset class is seen as “the safest innovation.” With the passing of the law, an increase in tokenized investment products based on familiar assets such as real estate is expected in the short term. In the long term, it is predicted that the market structure will change radically as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds, become tokenized. These blockchain-based digital securities promise to lower transaction costs by reducing dependence on centralized intermediary institutions, while enabling automatic transactions powered by artificial intelligence thanks to their programmability. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, Solana, Cardano and Shiba Inu have begun to stretch their potential to meet up with Remittix , the PayFi sensation. The Solana (SOL) ecosystem is expanding, Cardano (ADA) technical updates are arousing interest, while Shiba Inu coin (SHIB) hype status is fueling excitement for a rebound. Amid these developments, Remittix (RTX) is still at the forefront, proving to be one of the strongest cryptocurrencies in 2025. It has received a lot of attention from investors because of its unique method of making cross-border payments. Let’s delve deeper! Remittix (RTX): The PayFi sensation market giants are catching up to Considering the highly competitive state of the market, generating over $15.4 million in a presale isn’t merely impressive: It’s a signal that Remittix has seized market shares in all the right ways. For investors to commit such a substantial amount of money to a new project, there must be something truly remarkable about it. In Remittix’s case, it is its fundamental ethos to transform the global payment industry. While conventional systems like Stripe and Wise remain tangled in fees, delays and third-party holdups, Remittix offers something simple and easy to use. With its PayFi protocol , it cuts through the noise with fast, low-cost transfers and supports over 100 cryptocurrencies alongside 30 fiat currencies. This kind of range gives users more control and choice, regardless of whether they’re sending money across the world or just next door. Solana ( SOL ): Strong fundamentals as patterns align The Solana ecosystem is showing strong expansion on several fronts that support the growth of its long-term value. The recent launch of the Solana Attestation Service represents a major infrastructural advancement for what the Foundation defines as “internet capital markets.” Using this open-source tool, approved issuers can bind off-chain credentials to wallet addresses. Solana’s latest price action is beginning to align with this growth. Since January, SOL has been technically producing an arresting V-shaped recovery pattern on the weekly chart. Source: TradingView Usually showing great buying activity after a significant loss, this optimistic formation is a pattern completion objective at the $252 neckline resistance. Cardano (ADA) : Whale signals, but waning derivatives The Cardano price has been trading range-bound since March, but the market is gearing up for a breakout above $1. Blockchain data shows that over 21.6 billion ADA were staked recently, showing market expectations. Moreover, large holders are removing ADA from exchanges, pointing to possible supply tightening. Analysts suggest the Cardano price may reach $1.20 if this trend continues, but caution remains with ADA’s derivative reflecting doubt. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass, open interest has dropped 4.42% to $897 million. Meanwhile, options volume has plunged 92% to 6.59K, with open interest in options falling to $374K. Overall, bullish sentiment among traders has weakened, even as whale signals fuel optimism. Shiba Inu coin : Strong social volume, but concerning network realized Profit/Loss ratio Currently, the hype for the Shiba Inu coin is strong even as its price enters deep bearish zones. Santiment data shows that SHIB’s social volume surged by 155%, and industrial experts are optimistic. Meanwhile, SHIB’s Network Realized Profit/Loss plummeted from 104,000 to -652,000, indicating that the majority of SHIB holders are currently in a losing position. Source: Santiment Historically, drops like this have often signaled the formation of a bottom, as Shiba Inu coin prices tend to bounce shortly after. If this pattern repeats itself, then a price rally towards $0.000021 is likely to be imminent. Conclusion These undervalued cryptos represent compelling investment opportunities in the altcoin space. Remittix , in particular, is demonstrating rare potential with an over $15.4 million presale, where its native RTX token is priced at $0.0781.

The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is all set to target the $300 level in the near future as it tries to take control of its destiny. According to popular crypto analyst Don on X (formerly Twitter), technical indicators show that the major digital asset is set to reach this important milestone in the coming months. 14-Day Price Action SOL is changing hands below the $175 level at press time. Here is its price action from the last two weeks: Image Source: TradingView SOL has been relatively steady overall during this period. Still, the bulls could have done much better, because premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin posted a new All-Time High (ATH) of $112,000 about a week ago. The move was expected to kickstart the next altcoin season, but it didn’t as BTC dropped slightly in value and is now hovering around $108,000. A definitive move ahead from the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is likely to create a spark for other digital currencies to follow. SOL has been unable to break free of the $200 price resistance recently, but for these smaller coins, a jump like that doesn’t take much time, especially if the right conditions present themselves. The Solana bulls must wait for the opportune moment before striking. SOL Showing Strong Growth SOL will likely be a major part of this highly anticipated bull market. The programmable digital currency ecosystem remains one of the most sought-after networks for developers because of its immense capability and growing acceptability. The Solana blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is now nearing $10 billion and showing no signs of slowing down. A recent development involves Solana Strategies, a Canadian company specializing in capital raising through the Solana blockchain. The blockchain firm recently filed for a $1 billion preliminary short-form base shelf prospectus to increase financial flexibility and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In simple terms, the move will allow the organization to raise massive funds for various financial instruments it intends to offer via the SOL blockchain. The move indicates the growing acceptance of Solana in the capital markets, which is a significant advantage considering its relatively subdued overall performance in the cryptocurrency market.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 21:59:21

Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) have long dominated conversations as solid picks for long-term growth, supported by strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Meanwhile, emerging coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor attention for its explosive potential and affordability, making them some of the best cryptos to buy now for those seeking outsized gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.03 and gaining serious momentum. Mutuum Finance has reached Presale Phase 5, selling at the price of $0.03. Investor interest is still very high, and there are over 11,500 buyers as well as a total raise of $9.7 million. People joining in at this level can earn up to 100% when the token launches at $0.06. Cardano and Ripple: Solid Coins in the Race to $5 Currently, Cardano (ADA) trades at around $0.74, showing resilience amid recent market dips thanks to growing smart contract adoption and high-profile partnerships like with FC Barcelona. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) sits near $2.25, buoyed by positive regulatory developments and advancements in cross-border payment solutions. Both coins remain favorites among investors looking for long-term growth and stand as strong contenders in the race to hit $5. While they navigate ongoing volatility, emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also attracting attention for their high upside potential.

While the token’s recent performance shows potential, achieving this milestone is no small feat in the volatile cryptocurrency market. On the other hand, smart investors pivoting to emerging projects like Ruvi AI (RUVI) have already enjoyed 50% gains in under a month during its presale. This stark contrast underscores Ruvi AI’s disruptive potential and its ability to outperform even the most established cryptocurrencies. The Challenge for Binance Coin Binance Coin, a cornerstone of the Binance ecosystem, boasts a history of steady growth. Nevertheless, achieving a near 50% surge from its current price levels to $900 is a daunting challenge. Factors such as market volatility, external regulatory scrutiny, and competition in the crypto space make this a steep climb. While Binance Coin remains a solid choice for seasoned investors, its upward trajectory may take significant time and patience. For those seeking quicker, high-yield opportunities, newer projects like Ruvi AI present exciting alternatives. Ruvi AI’s Record-Breaking Performance Ruvi AI’s entrance into the market has been nothing short of astounding. During its presale Phase 1 , Ruvi AI sold 125 million tokens , raising $1.4 million with an entry price as low as $0.015 per token . Early investors experienced 50% gains in this phase alone, highlighting how Ruvi AI rewards those who move quickly. What makes Ruvi AI especially appealing is its projected growth. Analysts forecast that RUVI tokens could reach $1 by Q4 2025 , translating to a 6,566% ROI for initial investors. Such gains demonstrate Ruvi AI’s potential to deliver exponential value faster than many mainstream projects like Binance Coin. Practical Solutions Driving Ruvi AI’s Appeal Unlike projects reliant on speculative hype, Ruvi AI stands out with its focus on solving real-world issues. Its applications span key sectors, making it a utility-driven blockchain venture with broad appeal: Healthcare : Ruvi AI supports medical professionals with AI-powered diagnostics, improving accuracy and speeding up decision-making processes. Logistics : By optimizing supply chain management through advanced AI solutions, Ruvi AI helps companies cut costs and boost efficiency. Finance : Ruvi AI enhances transaction security and fraud detection through state-of-the-art AI algorithms, improving outcomes for financial institutions worldwide. These impactful use cases ensure Ruvi AI isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it is a technology poised to bring meaningful change to multiple industries. Lucrative VIP Investment Options To maximize returns, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers , each with enticing bonuses. Backers have options that cater to various investment budgets: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens allocated: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token = $4,900. Value at $1 per token = $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens allocated: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token = $15,680. Value at $1 per token = $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens allocated: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token = $89,600. Value at $1 per token = $1,280,000. These options offer early investors the potential to reap immense rewards, whether they invest modestly or on a larger scale. Why Ruvi AI is Outpacing Binance Coin What sets Ruvi AI apart from larger projects like Binance Coin is its agility and focus on innovation. While Binance’s ecosystem is well-established, its growth trajectory is relatively slow compared to Ruvi AI’s explosive rise. Ruvi AI’s emphasis on practical solutions, combined with its short-term reward potential and long-term vision, makes it a unique proposition. With a clear roadmap and impressive market performance, Ruvi AI is proving to be a standout project in the blockchain space. Final Thoughts While Binance Coin promises stability and a reliable growth path, projects like Ruvi AI show the incredible opportunities in exploring emerging cryptocurrencies. By delivering 50% gains in presale Phase 1 and providing utilities that address real-world challenges, Ruvi AI is already outperforming more established names. For investors hungry for both short-term and long-term gains, Ruvi AI represents the next big thing. Whether you’re seeking to diversify your portfolio or ride the wave of an innovative project, Ruvi AI offers an unparalleled blend of utility, scalability, and return on investment.

To this end, he noted that the success of the native coin is largely a function of its community’s strength. Hougan reached this conclusion after attending a Ripple event recently in Las Vegas. Bitcoin Success is Not a Threat to XRP The Bitwise CIO posted about his return from the XRP conference event on X, noting that approximately 1000 were in attendance. Reacting to the May 31 post, Vijar Kohli, an X user who doubles as a financier at Golden Door, asked him if there were any good takeaways from the event. Houghan mentioned that members of the Ripple community gradually understand that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple-associated XRP serve different markets. He made sure to establish that the success of Bitcoin is not a threat to XRP. “BTC thriving doesn’t disrupt what XRP aims to achieve,” Hougan clarified. In the wake of the event, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attempted to foster unity between the two blockchains. This led him to say that the Bitcoin community is not an enemy. Ripple Says Bitcoin is Environmentally Friendly Ordinarily, such a statement would be expected to mend the broken fence between both communities. Eventually, it seems like it has achieved little to nothing. As part of the broader effort to appreciate Bitcoin’s progress, Chris Larsen, Ripple co-founder, says he now views Bitcoin as sufficiently environmentally friendly. He took this stance after the share of mining powered by renewable energy topped 50%. It is worth noting that Larsen was backing a Greenpeace campaign targeting Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts think the statement of the Ripple executive is just a tactic to fix reputational damage. Bitwise XRP ETF Awaits SEC Approval In other related matters, Bitwise is still awaiting the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision on its spot XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). It first filed an S-1 registration statement for this offering in October 2024. The proposed ETF was intended to track the value of XRP without direct exposure to crypto risks. Bitwise named BNY Mellon its trust’s administrator and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, the custodian of the XRP ETF. There is still a prospect of approval from the SEC.

The Cardano network has now officially unseated Ethereum in the total number of core development commits over the past year. The newly attained milestone suggests an increase in developer activity over an extended period. Additionally, Cardano is now leading all blockchains by GitHub activity, with a total number of developer commits over the last year sitting at 21258 across 550 core repositories. On the other hand, Cardano’s longstanding competitor, Ethereum, is right behind, occupying the second spot with 20950 total commits over one year. The Cardano ecosystem has continued to thrive, with 38 ongoing projects in the building process and 3888 public GitHub repositories on the network. Over the last week, Cardano-based initiatives recorded a notable spike in engagement, with 245 individual developers engaging with these existing initiatives, a 0.39% change from the previous month. These individual developers have remarkably contributed 1914 commits to the network, representing a 4% decrease compared to the previous month. Notably, GitHub activity for blockchain projects often measures the stages and levels of project development present on a particular blockchain network. The ongoing activities indicate the developer’s commitment to projects and overall health. An increase in network developer activity usually indicates that an ongoing project is experiencing changes or necessary improvements. Conversely, decreased network activity might suggest a lack of interest in a network project. While Cardano might not retain this position the following week, as GitHub development activities on other networks are also high, the new milestone validates positive sentiments for the broader Cardano ecosystem .",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 22:10:44

Woods is quoted as saying ; “It is one of the few protocols that has gone through a full market cycle, including 2021 when Sam Bankman-Fried was a huge supporter of Solana, so everyone thought…that’s that, and here we go; it resurrected.” Woods, who appears to be keeping up with activities within the Solana ecosystem, highlighted a key milestone recorded last year: Solana unseated its long-standing competitor, Ethereum, in the number of network developers. “…On July 24, the number of developers on the Solana network surpassed that of Ethereum and became the highest,” Woods remarked. She maintains that Ethereum appeals to institutions, while Solana caters to and attracts key participants in the consumer market. She cites lower fee charges, network agility, functionality, and speed as factors propelling demand for the protocol. “At Ark, one of the things we look for in a new technology is falling cost and accelerating uptake, and that is certainly Solana.”She concluded. Like Cathie Wood, Financier Anthony Scaramucci is optimistic about Solana’s future . The founder of alternative asset manager SkyBridge Capital envisions Solana bridging the gap between crowdsourcing and crypto projects by tokenizing initial public offerings (IPOs). Scaramucci, who is currently authoring a book on the Solana network, added that Solana could become the operating layer for real-world assets, stocks, bonds, and tokenization.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 22:16:04

As expectations for the coming weeks heighten, price predictions are flying in consistently. Standard Chartered, the British multinational bank, is one notable institution that has doubled down on its previous Bitcoin price forecast, which can be considered one of the boldest price predictions made thus far. According to the international bank, Bitcoin is on track to hit the $500,000 price mark before President Donald Trump exits office. Notably, the current president’s second term, which began on January 20, 2025, will elapse on January 20, 2029. As such, the bank is optimistic that Bitcoin could build enough momentum over four years to attain a 358.926% increase in value. Geoffrey Kendrick, the global head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, points to a rise in institutional interest as a catalyst for a long-term price boom. “The 13F data from the US Securities and Exchange Commission supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before Trump leaves office. Bitcoin is attracting a wide range of institutional players.” Kendrick asserted. According to the SEC , Form 13F is a “statutory directive” created to inform the public about the securities holdings of leading institutional investors. Kendrick explains the significance of the data, stating the following; “The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level.” He added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is kicking off the new week on a lukewarm note, with bulls failing to hold above the $110,000 mark. Although gains sustained over the last 7 days are up 5.70%, hourly losses sit at 0.08% during this report.

According to entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davis, Bitcoin’s recent bullish performance has failed to stimulate excitement within the broader cryptocurrency market. The investor is convinced the missing piece is the highly anticipated altcoin season. “This cycle has been mostly about Bitcoin so far. Even though BTC smashed through all-time highs, there’s no excitement in the market. The reason is simple: Everyone and their dog are sitting in altcoins, and that’s why even though BTC is near ATHs, altcoin index is sitting at 27 (real altseason starts at 75).” He wrote . As the analyst asserts, Bitcoin has outperformed this in this current market cycle, with a continuous bullish milestone recorded monthly. The asset kicked off 2025 hovering above the $90,000 price mark, before hitting $100,000 briefly, in the latter part of January and February. Last week, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $111,970 before returning below the $110,000 level. The big bull is trading at a press time price of $109,795. On the other hand, Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen observed that altcoin and Bitcoin pairs are trading at significantly lower levels. Countering that altcoin season is around the corner, he highlighted the continued downward trend observed within the altcoin market over the last 4 years. “ALT/BTC pairs just put in their lowest weekly close all cycle. Those that call for alt season each week may sound confident and contrarian, but altcoins have been bleeding to Bitcoin almost non-stop since 2021.” Cowen wrote . Where is “altcoin season”? While altcoin season is typically expected to arrive 6-9 months after every Bitcoin halving, the years after the halving year leave analysts gauging, using altcoin season index aggregators designed to analyze the performance of the top 50 altcoins in the market. These aggregators track factors including increased trading volume, increased altcoin dominance, and frequent price breakouts. Altcoin season indexes currently sit at 16, indicating that only 16% of existing altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over 90 days. It is also worth noting that altcoins fail to outperform Bitcoin during some market cycles and continue to trade downward or sideways.",Cryptocurrency|News|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 22:37:40

Markets now favor projects with solid development plans, smart token models, and long-term progress. This is where potential leaders are taking shape, through strong presales, improved blockchain activity, and expanding ecosystems. For anyone tracking the best long-term cryptos, this list outlines four that are gaining strong attention. These include platforms using AI, those attracting institutions, and coins with upcoming catalysts. Whether you’re searching for early presale entries or looking at breakout charts, this guide covers what’s important: product plans, market moves, and future momentum. Let’s begin with Web3 ai, a presale that’s gaining serious interest. Web3 ai: Connecting AI With Real-Time Blockchain Tools Web3 ai is creating a wide range of AI-based crypto tools to help users make smart decisions, track live market data, and avoid risky moves. Its strength lies in how all its tools are connected. The AI pulls data from blockchains, social platforms, and exchanges to support its many features, like scam checkers, risk tools, and portfolio support systems. Web3 ai runs on multiple platforms, including web, mobile, and browser apps, and it supports networks like Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and Polygon. The $WAI token powers access to premium tools, voting rights, and is built on a deflationary model with revenue sharing and upcoming AI upgrades. Its presale has already raised more than $6.8 million. The project is in Stage 7 of 50, with a current price of $0.000402. The final presale stage price is $0.003267, and the listing price is set at $0.005242. Based on these numbers, early participants could see a 1747% return. Web3 ai remains one of the best long-term cryptos for those looking at high-potential projects with real functionality. Solana: Big Players and New Features Boost Outlook Solana is trading close to $170.34, with an $88.1 billion market value. Despite minor drops recently, the chain remains active with new developments. A recent highlight is its integration with MetaMask desktop, which improves access for users and expands Solana’s reach. Meanwhile, big banks such as HSBC and Bank of America are looking at Solana via partnerships with R3, suggesting increasing institutional interest. Forecasts show Solana could touch $275 by the end of 2025, with some long-term targets pointing to $500. With its fast speeds and growing adoption beyond memecoins, Solana is becoming a core platform for finance-related apps. It firmly earns its place on the list of best long-term cryptos to consider. Binance Coin: Closing in on $700 BNB is currently priced around $681.94 and has a $96.5 billion market cap. Its next key resistance level is $700, and if passed, analysts expect a fast move toward $750. But BNB’s strength isn’t only in the charts. It lies in Binance’s constant push to expand its products. Recent efforts include launching a real-world asset reward program on BNB Chain and supporting large token events through its wallet. Binance is also adding new listings like Sophon and boosting user reward campaigns. This continues to bring attention and usage back to BNB. With some projections pointing to $2,775 by 2029, BNB remains one of the best long-term cryptos thanks to its utility within the world’s top exchange system. Cardano: Gearing Up for ETF-Driven Gains Cardano is valued at $0.737, backed by a $26.5 billion market cap. Though slightly down in the last 24 hours, it’s supported by an active community and increasing usage. Daily activity crossed 50,000 transactions in May, and there is talk that the SEC might soon approve an ADA ETF. If approved, this could open the door for bigger investments. Price targets from analysts range between $1.30 and $2.60, depending on volume and momentum. ADA also ranks second in bullish votes on CoinMarketCap, with 87% of users believing in its growth. Even more cautious estimates place it at $0.949 by late 2025. That makes Cardano one of the best long-term cryptos for those looking at coins with technical strength and the possibility of ETF impact. Summing Up! The future of crypto growth is being built on real solutions, not just price spikes or memecoins. Web3 ai is building a network where blockchain and AI come together to give users real value. Its presale numbers and expected ROI make it an early mover worth attention. Solana is winning with developers and finance partners. Binance Coin keeps its spot with constant new features. Cardano brings structure, community support, and the ETF potential. For those choosing the best long-term cryptos , these four have the qualities that matter: strong products, plans for growth, and current prices that don’t yet reflect full potential. Whether you’re entering during the presale or planning for future listings, these are assets to watch closely.

45389895,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69326,1748818848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for June 30, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-shiba-inu-shib-price-for-june-30-2025/,"The cryptocurrency landscape, particularly the world of meme coins, continues to draw attention from traders, investors, and enthusiasts eager to decipher short-term price trends. Among these speculative digital assets, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has remained a top favorite, captivating the crypto community with its vibrant ecosystem, strong community backing, and meme-driven hype. As June 2025 begins, many are eager to understand where SHIB might head by month’s end. In this analysis, we delve into Google Gemini’s AI-generated price predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) by June 30, 2025, and explore the underlying market conditions that could influence these outcomes. Current Market Snapshot As of report time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001297. SHIB’s price movement over the past few weeks has been largely sideways, with occasional dips reflecting the prevailing bearish sentiment. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dictate general market momentum, meme coins like SHIB are especially vulnerable to sharp swings in sentiment, often reacting intensely to social media trends, whale activity, and ecosystem announcements. Google Gemini’s price predictions for June 30, 2025, acknowledge these dynamics and offer three distinct scenarios: modest, moderate, and bullish. Each scenario is grounded in current price action and potential short-term developments, avoiding heavy reliance on third-party analyst forecasts. Modest Scenario In the modest outlook, Google Gemini suggests that if current bearish pressures persist or if the market remains largely stagnant, SHIB is likely to hover near its present levels or experience a minor decline. This places the expected price range between $0.000012 and $0.000013 by the end of June. Such a scenario assumes that no major catalysts emerge to drive fresh buying momentum. Without news of ecosystem upgrades, major partnerships, or substantial improvements in Shiba Inu’s DeFi, gaming, or metaverse initiatives, the token may simply follow the broader crypto market’s consolidation pattern. Moderate Scenario The moderate prediction envisions a more optimistic, albeit restrained, trajectory for SHIB. If minor positive developments occur, such as incremental upgrades in the Shibarium layer-2 network, enhanced staking mechanisms, or small but impactful partnership announcements, the token could experience a slight boost. Google Gemini forecasts that under these circumstances, SHIB might trade between $0.0000135 and $0.0000145 by June 30. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This outcome also hinges on a mild shift in investor sentiment. Even a subtle change in the risk appetite of retail traders or a temporary uptick in meme coin enthusiasm on platforms like X could propel SHIB modestly higher. While not indicative of a full-fledged bull run, this middle-ground scenario suggests that SHIB retains some room for short-term growth if supported by favorable, albeit limited, catalysts. Bullish Outlook For the bullish scenario, Google Gemini emphasizes the need for a significant uptick in buying pressure, which could push SHIB into the $0.000015 to $0.000017 range by the end of June. Achieving this bullish outcome would require a combination of factors, including a reversal in the broader crypto market’s risk sentiment and substantial, SHIB-specific catalysts. Potential triggers might include a surprise rally in Bitcoin or Ethereum, which often lifts altcoins alongside it, or headline-making developments within the SHIB ecosystem. For example, large-scale Shibarium adoption, accelerated token burns, or the introduction of a highly anticipated project within the SHIB metaverse could ignite fresh investor excitement. Notably, given the bearish tone characterizing early June, achieving such a rapid turnaround would demand not just incremental news but a compelling, confidence-restoring event. The Unpredictable Nature of Meme Coins While these predictions provide structured estimates, it’s essential to underscore the speculative nature of meme coins like Shiba Inu. Unlike blue-chip assets with strong institutional backing and clear utility, meme coins are particularly susceptible to sudden shifts driven by social media trends, influencer commentary, and retail trading frenzies. Even AI-generated forecasts, no matter how sophisticated, cannot fully account for the unpredictable emotional surges that often define the meme coin market. While the modest and moderate scenarios appear more likely in the absence of dramatic market shifts, the crypto market’s inherently unpredictable nature leaves the door open for a surprise bullish surge. Traders and investors are reminded to approach meme coins with caution, balancing enthusiasm with sound risk management.

If Avalanche’s explosive growth taught investors anything, it’s this: missing out on high-potential early-stage projects can be painfully costly. Avalanche turned early skeptics into overnight millionaires, and now it serves as a textbook case of what happens when you wait too long. As the crypto space braces for the next wave of disruptive projects, Qubetics ($TICS) is rising rapidly—and those in the know are already taking notice. Qubetics is not just another token—it’s a full-scale, interoperable blockchain ecosystem positioned to be a major player in the 2025 cycle. While many projects are still refining their roadmaps, Qubetics is already executing with precision. Its live presale offers investors a rare chance to get in at a strategic time—before full-scale adoption and before the price takes its next leap. With the 2025 mainnet launch approaching fast and stages closing weekly, Qubetics is one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025. Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in May 2025 If you regret missing out on Qubetics when the presale quietly launched in September 2024, you’re not alone. Early believers picked up $TICS at just $0.01 during those initial phases. Multiple stages have since closed, each offering investors high ROI potential—but not without urgency. The presale is now in its 36th stage at $0.3064 per token. Despite the price rise, this top crypto presale of 2025 is still accessible. With over $17.5 million raised, more than 514 million $TICS tokens sold, and 27,300+ token holders already on board, Qubetics is quickly transforming from a promising newcomer to a formidable force in crypto. It’s one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 not just because of hype, but because it delivers measurable returns and forward-facing innovation. The ROI projections from this point are still astonishing. At $1 post-presale, that’s a 226.32% ROI. Should $TICS hit $5, you’re looking at 1,531.58%. But the real reward is at $10 or $15 after mainnet—where the ROI hits 3,163.16% and 4,794.74%, respectively. For instance, an investment of $2,000 today yields 6,528 tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 post-mainnet, that investment becomes $65,280. This is not just speculation—it’s backed by community-driven growth, a limited token supply, and consistent presale stage performance. Investors seeking substantial returns with managed risk are calling it a “top crypto presale” for a reason. And with each 7-day stage adding a 10% price hike, the urgency cannot be overstated. Qubetics excels where others falter—interoperability. Its core mission is solving blockchain’s fragmented nature. Imagine a supply chain firm using Solana, a payment partner operating on Ethereum, and logistics data secured on Bitcoin. Typically, these ecosystems don’t talk. Qubetics removes that limitation by allowing frictionless transactions and data exchanges between them, offering streamlined, real-time functionality across chains. For small businesses and corporations alike, this is transformative—no need to reconfigure systems or migrate platforms. Just seamless, efficient integration. This approach doesn’t just attract retail investors; it’s drawing enterprise-level attention and solidifying its place among the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 . Avalanche: From Missed Opportunity to Market Titan Avalanche’s story is one of momentum and missed chances. Launched with an ICO price of just $0.50, many disregarded its long-term vision. Yet, as the market matured, Avalanche proved its mettle, hitting an all-time high of $146.22. That’s over 29,000% growth—an unignorable figure for any serious investor. Those early few who backed Avalanche when it was still under a dollar have enjoyed extraordinary gains, setting a benchmark for what’s possible with smart early positioning. Today, it is regarded as one of the major blockchains in the DeFi, gaming, and enterprise spheres. Its success has been driven by real-world scalability, ultra-fast transaction finality, and a well-structured developer ecosystem. Avalanche’s unique consensus mechanism and sub-netting features gave it an edge in user adoption. While the masses waited for validation, early adopters were stacking profits. The takeaway? By the time the mainstream enters, the real money has already been made. As of May 2025, Avalanche stands as proof that belief in the right tech at the right time pays dividends. It’s why investors are now actively scanning the market for what could be the next Avalanche—and many believe Qubetics fits the profile. Conclusion: Your Next Move in the Crypto Race The difference between regret and reward in crypto is timing. While Avalanche had its breakout and proved the value of early conviction, the market now shifts its gaze toward newer, scalable, and highly interoperable solutions. Qubetics is leading that charge. For those looking to make a calculated move this month, it’s not just an option—it’s a standout. It’s one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 for both ROI potential and technological edge. The Qubetics presale won’t stay accessible for long. With the current presale ticking through its final stages, you still have a viable entry point before mainnet launch in Q2. This is your chance to join this top crypto presale and align with a project poised to become a foundational layer in the next generation of Web3 infrastructure. Don’t watch another breakout happen from the sidelines. Act now—because the next Avalanche might already be here, and it’s called Qubetics.

Last week, Nvidia gave a strong sales outlook for large technology firms, even though Washington still blocks the sale of its most advanced chips to China. Bloomberg reported that shares in Nvidia and Microsoft Corp. are close to their record highs, helping many traders expect that the group will continue to lift the whole market upward. “I feel really good about tech coming out of this earnings season,” said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. “There’s still more gas in this tank.” The S&P 500 now stands roughly 4% below its February peak. Much of the recovery reflects eased trade talks between the United States and its partners as well as quarterly results that showed steady demand for cloud services, software, devices, and digital ads despite the threat of fresh tariffs. Since the index low on 8th April, Tesla Inc. has surged 56%. Nvidia has increased by 40%, and Microsoft is up by 30%. Big Tech Stocks that played a role in S&P 500’s gain. Source: Bloomberg Moreover, Bloomberg’s “Magnificent Seven” index shows Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. outperformed the broader S&P 500 during the last eight weeks. The shift matters because the seven companies together make up about one-third of the benchmark. Bloomberg data show they have added nearly half of the S&P 500’s 19% climb from its April low. Risks that could stall the rally have not disappeared Even though those seven big tech stocks did well over the past couple of months, they’ve still earned less than the S&P 500 since the start of the year. That’s rare because the “Magnificent Seven” usually outperform the broader market over a full year. Apple and Amazon are the main reasons as both import many finished products and have been hurt by higher tariffs, which has held the group back. “Buying the tech dip will be a theme throughout the year,” Ewing added. “There’s still a lot of money on the sidelines, and it has to be put to work.” Tariffs and other trade measures advanced during Donald Trump’s presidency still cloud the outlook. On Friday, the S&P 500 dropped more than 1% after the president accused China of violating an agreement to ease duties. In a separate report, the United States was said to be preparing tougher limits on China’s technology sector. By the end of trading, the index had recovered most of its losses, but the drop showed how quickly investor sentiment can shift. Another challenge is the high price of Big Tech shares. Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven index trades at about 30 times expected profits for the next year, while the S&P 500 as a whole trades at roughly 21 times. In April, the overall market’s price-to-earnings ratio was near 18, and it has since climbed above its ten-year average of 18.6. Big tech stocks are trading at high prices. Source: Bloomberg Not every strategist fears that high valuations will halt the advance. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, expects big technology firms to steer the broader market higher in the second half of 2025, aided by ongoing spending on artificial-intelligence computing. Meta Platforms has lifted its estimate for capital expenditures this year, and Microsoft says it will boost spending in its next fiscal year. Those pledges ease concerns that the companies might trim investments after two years of heavy invesment. “Our view is that earnings could still be maybe flatter but likely have less downside than what we would have thought heading into the earnings season,” Lerner said. Bloomberg Intelligence data show profit forecasts for the Magnificent Seven in 2025 have held steady during the past two months. Analysts still expect the group to deliver about 15% earnings growth, roughly twice the rate projected for the S&P 500. “Investors are going to be drawn back toward these names with secular growth,” Lerner added. “Tech could be that catalyst later on to actually see the market re-accelerate later in the year.” For now, optimism about cloud demand, artificial-intelligence chips, and digital services has pushed tech stocks back into favor and cut the index’s losses since early spring. But because tariff risks persist and valuations are high, this rally still feels fragile. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The TON developers team has guaranteed users that the outage did not impact any funds and that transactions made while the system was down were safe from loss. TON recovers its functionality after suffering a brief outage Blockchain network outages are usually common in high-throughput, high-speed blockchains because of the chains’ high technical complexity. As blockchain networks grow more complex, brief outages may become increasingly common, potentially hindering broader consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies and undermining public trust in the technology. Following the recent brief outage, the developers’ team reported the problem at 12:51:00 UTC and managed to restore network functionality about 40 minutes after they discovered the outage. In an update, the TON developers said they released a quick fix and updated just a few master chain validators, allowing the blockchain to start block production again. According to the team, the issue was caused by a mistake in handling the masterchain dispatch queue. The team also revealed that a full technical report will be published soon to address exactly what caused the issue. Blockchain users have revealed their growing worries as quick-growing blockchain networks processing significant amounts of data experience brief outages frequently. In this instance, TON’s flash reaction helped minimize the damage. As Telegram depends more on TON for its cryptocurrency plans, the network will face greater pressure to remain stable. Everything is back to normal, but concerns about its long-term reliability are expected to arise. TON gains increased institutional investments despite suffering several brief outages Notably, this is not the first brief outage incident. In August 2024, TON suffered several brief outages due to high demand for the DOGS meme coin , which congested the network and caused a chain to stop. The initial outage occurred on August 27 when block production was suspended at workchain block 45,341,899. Network downtime lasted several hours until validators reset their nodes at 4:00 UTC to re-establish network-wide consensus. At 5:30 am UTC, the functionality was briefly restored, and users were allowed to access the network again before the network crashed again hours later. The reason behind the sudden crash was due to excessive users transferring DOGS memecoins on the TON blockchain. The next outage incident occurred on August 28. On that day, TON faced a brief outage, which caused block production to stop at workchain block 45,350,522. This second outage lasted about six hours until it was resolved, with block production resuming on the same day. Even after the brief network outages, TON is gaining retail attention and institutional investment from big digital asset names in the crypto space. Telegram Open Network received $400 million from venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital, Draper Associates, CoinFund, and SkyBridge in March 2025.

NBC News reports that at least three companies that provide insurance and security services for cryptocurrency investors and firms are preparing to offer kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance policies for those with security concerns stemming from their crypto holdings. According to Rebecca Rubenfeld, chief operating officer at the crypto insurance firm AnchorWatch, the fear of violence was a big topic at the annual Bitcoin Conference that was held in Las Vegas last week. “They’re tense. I’m not saying that because I’m trying to sell insurance, but overall, the mood is a very good environment for me.” AnchorWatch is considering offering kidnapping and ransom protection in the coming months. The news comes after a string of reports emerged about the kidnapping of crypto investors. Last month, armed assailants reportedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noiza, the CEO of the French crypto exchange platform Paymium, in Paris. In another incident, three teenagers allegedly stole $4 million worth of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from a man who hosted a crypto-related event in Las Vegas and left him stranded at White Hills, Arizona. And last week in New York City, a kidnapper allegedly tortured and threatened a crypto investor for three weeks to gain access to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading above $105K as Asia begins its business week. The world's largest digital asset remained relatively stable over the weekend, with a 0.4% movement, and trading volume was compressed. While overall market conditions remain bullish, a new report from CryptoQuant suggests that certain metrics indicate the BTC market is “overheating.” The report shows bitcoin demand has climbed to 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days, approaching the December 2024 peak of 279,000 BTC. At the same time, whale-held balances have risen by 2.8 percent, a pace that often signals slowing accumulation. These indicators suggest the current rally, which pushed prices to a record $112,000, may be nearing a short-term top. The report highlights $120,000 as the next major resistance level, tied to the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, where unrealized profits would hit 40 percent, a threshold that has historically marked local tops. While CryptoQuant’s ""Bull Score Index"" remains strong at 80, signaling continued bullish momentum, rising profit margins, and peaking demand growth suggest traders may face a period of consolidation before the next leg higher. News Roundup: James Wynn Gets Liquidated, But Says He'll 'Run it All Back' James Wynn, a trader renowned for his aggressive, high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid, has been fully liquidated, leaving him with just $23 in his account after sustaining losses totaling more than $17 million, CoinDesk previously reported. Wynn, who attracted significant attention with trades involving bitcoin, memecoins like PEPE, and even obscure tokens such as FARTCOIN, first faced steep declines from a massive $1.25 billion long position on BTC, resulting in a loss exceeding $37 million after prices dipped below $105,000 amid geopolitical turmoil. Throughout the volatile month, Wynn rapidly cycled through trades, briefly netting an unrealized gain of $85 million before market swings wiped him out completely. An account associated with Wynn downplayed the dramatic liquidation, defiantly stating on X: ""I'll run it back, I always do. And I'll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game. I took a large and calculated bet at making billions."" Brazil's Méliuz Shares Sink 8% After Announcing $78M Equity Raise to Buy Bitcoin Brazilian fintech Méliuz plans to raise up to $78 million through a public equity offering, intending to allocate all proceeds to purchasing Bitcoin and positioning the cryptocurrency as a primary strategic asset in its treasury, CoinDesk previously reported . However, Méliuz’s strategy hasn't impressed the market yet, as shares dropped more than 8% following the announcement. The initial offering includes 17 million common shares, with the potential to expand up to 51 million, and investors will receive subscription warrants allowing future stock purchases at set prices. Known for its cashback and financial services platform serving over 30 million users, Méliuz currently holds 320.2 BTC, having previously committed 10% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in March. Trading for the subscription warrants is expected to commence on June 16, with share settlement and warrant issuance finalized by June 18. NYC Comptroller Rejects Mayor Adams' 'BitBond', Warns Deviating from Dollar Could Undermine City's Credit Reputation New York City's Comptroller Brad Lander sharply criticized Mayor Eric Adams' plan to issue municipal bonds backed by bitcoin, labeling the proposed ""BitBond"" as ""legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,"" CoinDesk previously reported. Lander rejected the idea just days after Adams introduced it at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, emphasizing that cryptocurrency's instability makes it unsuitable to reliably fund critical city projects such as infrastructure and affordable housing. Mayor Adams has actively promoted cryptocurrency initiatives since entering office, including converting his own paychecks into digital assets and establishing a digital asset advisory council. However, Comptroller Lander highlighted serious practical concerns with the BitBond proposal, noting federal tax laws and city financial regulations would make the proposal unworkable, and warned that deviating from the dollar-based municipal borrowing system could undermine investor confidence and New York City's credit reputation. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin showed resilience, staging a V-shaped recovery between $103,813.37 and $105,305.75 amid notable volume spikes. ETH: Ethereum formed a bullish reversal pattern, rebounding from strong support at $2,472.84 to $2,527.53 amid high-volume buying momentum, according to CoinDesk's Market Insight Bot. Gold: Gold climbed 0.6% to $3,311.66, as traders weighed its recent retreat from record highs against ongoing investor and central bank appetite driven by uncertainty over US tariffs and broader economic risks. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.89% as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed following Trump's announcement of increased steel tariffs. S&P 500 Futures: Stock futures dipped Sunday to start June after the S&P 500's strongest month since November 2023, amid uncertainty over President Trump's tariffs following recent contradictory court rulings.

Both leading candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have made crypto a central part of their campaigns. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential race, has proposed legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds and even allowing the nation’s $884 billion pension fund to invest in crypto. The ETF push is backed by his conservative rival, suggesting rare bipartisan alignment on the potential digital-asset policy. His opponent, Kim Moon-soo from the conservative People Power Party, has also voiced support for the digital asset industry. Kim has vowed to remove barriers so banks can work with crypto exchanges. He also advocates lowering taxes for small investors and entrepreneurs profiting from their crypto. Such bipartisan agreement is uncommon in South Korean politics. But it speaks to the increasing power of crypto in the country. With over 18 million people, over a third of the population, who engage in digital asset trading, it is clear that crypto is now a serious political force. South Korean regulators tighten crypto rules to protect investors The South Korean crypto scene has seen both highs and lows. The greatest blow arrived in 2022 when the TerraUSD stablecoin project imploded. Led by South Korean developer Do Kwon, the failure wiped out more than $40 billion in value, devastating retail investors and fueling a public outcry. In retaliation, the Virtual Asset User Identity Protection Act was passed and came into force in July 2024 with razing provisions for crypto exchanges. Under the law, operators are required to hold at least 80% of user deposits in offline cold wallets, maintain insurance, and develop a plan for possible hacks or system crashes. Exchanges themselves are also subject to tough penalties for fraud, with executives facing life sentences. Meanwhile, regulators are preparing new rules to oversee the stablecoin market, driven by concerns over capital flight through foreign-pegged assets like USDT and USDC. South Korea’s exchanges had outflows of 56.81 trillion won in the first three months of 2025, almost half of which were in dollar-backed stablecoins. Lee Jae-Myung suggested launching a won-backed stablecoin. He said it could modernize South Korea’s financial system and help keep money from leaving the country. But the idea is encountering pushback. The central bank says that only regulated institutions — not private companies — should be able to issue stablecoins pegged to the won. South Korea expands crypto opportunities South Korea is already one of the world’s most active crypto markets . On some days, trading at local crypto exchanges exceeds that on the country’s main stock indices, Kospi and Kosdaq. The trend underscores the high profile of digital assets, especially for young investors who believe they are being left behind by traditional finance. The backing of both presidential candidates has renewed optimism in the industry, drawing the attention of venture capitalists, startups, and blockchain developers. Simon Seojoon Kim, chief executive of Seoul-based Hashed Ventures, said that since all major candidates support pro-crypto policies, crypto investors in South Korea are set to benefit regardless of who wins the election. The global backdrop is also giving momentum. Recently, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, signed an executive order to promote cryptocurrencies as dollar-backed stablecoins, Terming it as a mechanism handy to uphold the US financial System. That’s prompted Asian lawmakers, including those in South Korea, to move fast so they don’t get left behind. In selecting pro-crypto leadership, irrespective of party, South Koreans are sending the message: The future of finance is digital. And the country is poised to lead.

According to sources familiar with the plan, store operators are expected to make a gross margin on Switch 2 of about 5% per sale, compared to an informal industry norm of around 2%. Nintendo’s bold retail strategy fuels a strong push for Switch 2 success Nintendo is making a strong push to ensure the success of its next flagship console in its home market. While the Switch 2 will launch globally on June 5 with a price tag of $450 in most regions, the Japan-exclusive version —featuring the Japanese language and intended solely for domestic sale—will be priced at ¥49,980 (roughly $350). The company’s retail strategy aligns with this focus on a strong Japanese launch. Game consoles are typically priced to yield very thin gross margins. Stores make money instead by selling more lucrative bundles with software and add-on peripherals. However, that model is under threat as players increasingly favor buying games online, and accessory makers are paying less for retail distribution as costs rise. Retailers have expressed frustration over shrinking margins, compounded by the fact that newer devices demand more shelf and storage space, increasing operational costs. Yodobashi Camera Co., one of Japan’s largest electronics chains, welcomes video game products as a draw to boost foot traffic. A spokesperson from Bic Camera Inc. declined to comment, while Yamada Denki did not respond to inquiries. Nintendo stated it does not typically discuss its distribution agreements publicly. The improved margin is especially beneficial for brick-and-mortar stores with higher fixed expenses. Sources say this could encourage Japanese retailers to allocate more floor space to the Switch 2 and actively promote it throughout the year. The sources added that this is the first major new console in over a decade to offer retailers a meaningful profit on the hardware itself. Ahead of the launch, retailers have requested that Nintendo ship large quantities to meet what they expect to be overwhelming demand on day one, exceeding current stock levels. Physical game stores have long been a vital part of Nintendo’s business philosophy, forming an integral component of the company’s broader strategy to engage consumers across multiple touchpoints—including amusement parks and game-specific download cards sold at convenience stores in Japan. Nintendo sets ambitious sales targets as Switch 2 pre-orders surge Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million Switch 2 units by the end of March next year, with potential sales exceeding 20 million units depending on production capacity. The multinational video game company released the estimate weeks after pre-orders of the gaming console began. Nintendo postponed pre-sales of the Switch 2 in early April to evaluate the impact of new US import tariffs. When pre-orders eventually launched late last month, gamers reported that retailer websites were overwhelmed by traffic, and many stores sold out of the second-generation console almost immediately. The company’s forecast of selling 15 million Switch 2 units by March next year is based on the assumption that US tariffs remain at April 10 levels. Demand for earlier Switch models has declined, with Nintendo selling 10.8 million units in fiscal year 2025, down from 15.7 million the previous year, according to its latest earnings report. Looking ahead, Nintendo expects to sell 45 million games made specifically for the Switch 2 and 105 million legacy titles. The combined total of 150 million is slightly below the 155 million games sold in fiscal 2025. In its latest fiscal year, Nintendo’s sales dropped 30.3% to 1.16 trillion yen ($8 billion). The company reported that profits also fell 43.2% to 278.8 billion yen ($1.91 billion). Looking ahead, Nintendo expects a strong recovery, forecasting 1.9 trillion yen ($13 billion) in sales and 300 billion yen ($2.06 billion) in profit for fiscal year 2026.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) have got plenty of attention before, their growth seems to be weakening. Consequently, most attention is now on new and revitalized projects that show greater potential for growth. Cardano (ADA) continues to develop its smart contracts and DeFi. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has everyone’s attention with its low prices and strong growth outlook, making it one of the best cryptos to buy before prices rise in 2025. Crypto Market Update: SHIB, XRP, and ADA Face Pressure Amid Market Volatility The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has fallen slightly to $0.00001411. Although whale transactions have sharply decreased over recent weeks, analysts indicate that increased ecosystem development and upcoming burns might create some upside potential. The price of Ripple (XRP) has fallen slightly to $2.26 at the time of writing. Since the SEC considered the WisdomTree XRP ETF, hype and predictions for a 48% swift gain in XRP have grown. At this time, Cardano (ADA) is at $0.739, having dropped about 3.35% from its previous close. ADA and other coins are currently down as bears have taken over the market, a recent analysis shows. Even though well-known cryptocurrencies are dealing with the current challenges of the crypto market, altcoins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are getting noticed for their attractive earning prospects. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The Mutuum Finance presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06. Early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns when MUTM goes live. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.7 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. The token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency Delivered: Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is not only innovating, it is establishing trust. The platform’s open-source smart contracts have undergone a rigorous, officially completed audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that is engineered to steer clear of pitfalls that have toppled algorithmic stablecoins. Security and transparency are always primary pillars of the ecosystem. Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and especially Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as top cryptos to watch in 2025. MUTM has raised over $9.7 million with 11,500+ investors and offers early buyers up to 100% ROI at its $0.03 presale price before launching at $0.06. Backed by a Certik audit, a hybrid DeFi model, and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM is built for growth. Join now before the next price jump.

With major updates like Pectra and Danksharding in development, the network is working toward faster throughput and deeper utility by 2040. These changes could redefine how developers and users interact with Ethereum. At the same time, Kaspa is gaining traction. Trading at $0.1107, the coin is holding above key support and flashing signs of a potential June rally. Its chart structure points toward upward movement backed by strong technicals. But while Ethereum and Kaspa focus on what is coming, Unstaked ($UNSD) is already delivering. Now in Stage 17 at $0.01043, with a projected launch price of $0.1819 and up to a 2,700% ROI, it is not waiting to create value. Its AI agents are already set to convert engagement into growth. Ethereum’s Scaling Overhaul Could Redefine Its 2040 Potential Ethereum’s future may rest on its ability to balance scalability, decentralization, and security. With upgrades like Pectra on the horizon by late 2025 or early 2026, Ethereum plans to integrate EIP-7702. This would allow regular wallets to function like smart contracts, a shift that could expand how users interact with the network. Further updates, such as PeerDAS and full Danksharding, promise major improvements to transaction throughput. By reducing data costs and enhancing Layer-2 efficiency, Ethereum could one day handle millions of transactions per second. These changes may reduce fees and elevate ETH’s appeal across both developers and institutions. Kaspa Readies for Potential June Surge Above $0.115 Kaspa is flashing bullish signals after rebounding from $0.103 and reclaiming support near $0.1107. The price is currently riding its 200-day moving average on the 4-hour chart while forming consistent higher lows, suggesting upward pressure is building just below the $0.115 resistance level. If Kaspa breaks past this key barrier, the next targets could lie between $0.13 and $0.145, mirroring its late April highs. However, any pullback below $0.103 may see support retested near $0.096. With technicals favoring a push upward, June could mark a critical turning point for KAS momentum. Unstaked’s AI Agents Are the Growth Hack Web3 Has Been Waiting For In the crypto space, catching eyes is easy. Getting those eyes to take action is the real challenge. That is where Unstaked stands apart. This AI-powered platform deploys smart agents that do more than just automate posts. They guide followers into communities, content, and campaigns based on live sentiment and user behavior across Telegram, X, and Discord. These are full-service funnels that never sleep. For solo creators or lean marketing teams, Unstaked turns complex outreach into plug-and-play campaigns. AI agents craft tailored messages, adjust tone in real time, and respond to users in ways that feel personal and timely. The result is hands-free conversion that feels anything but robotic. Currently priced at $0.01043 in Stage 17 of its AI crypto presale , Unstaked presents one of the highest ROI setups in crypto. The projected launch price sits at $0.1819, giving early buyers a potential 2,700% return. Over $8.5 million has already been raised, a signal that serious attention is coming early. These AI agents will only go live after the presale ends and the platform officially launches. Once active, they will be the engine behind scalable, intelligent engagement across Web3. This is more than automation. It is performance without friction. Final Thoughts Ethereum may shape future infrastructure, and Kaspa could be nearing a breakout, but neither offers immediate, live-facing tools like Unstaked. Its AI agents are already streamlining user engagement by transforming passive followers into active community members through smart, behavior-based automation. Now in Stage 17 for $0.01043, Unstaked has raised over $8.5 million and is targeting a 2,700% ROI by launch. While others build toward potential, Unstaked is already delivering. It is not just promising results. It is producing them. And at this price, the window to access that value is still wide open.

They also seek a small amount of equity in the two companies, which are leaders in using generative AI to create music. People familiar with the negotiation, who preferred to stay anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the talks, explained the reasons behind the discussions. They said that major music companies want to let AI startups Udio and Suno use their music, and this deal could set a precedent for how AI firms compensate recording artists for their work. AI companies raise conflict with media companies on copyrighted content Udio and Suno help future music creators by allowing them to enter a description of a sound or song, such as “a modern country ballad about unrequited love,” and then get an audio recording back. To make this happen, the companies must teach their software using large datasets filled with millions of information. This requires a lot of music. The intention raised by AI companies to train their large language models on copyrighted work has sparked a war between AI and media companies. AI companies have fought with major media companies over whether they must pay to train their large language models on copyrighted work. They have argued that the training is permitted under fair use, while rights holders say they need to be paid. The New York Times Co. sued OpenAI, which has struck licensing deals with companies like News Corp., the Associated Press, and Vox Media. To solve this, the music companies and the AI startups are negotiating to find common ground and try to avoid fighting it in court. The talks are unfolding on parallel tracks, providing a race to see whether a label or an AI company will strike a deal first. Complicating the talks is that the labels are pushing for more control over how their work is used. Udio and Suno are looking for a range of flexibility to experiment and look forward to affordable deals suitable for startup companies. Udio and Suno did not respond to requests for comment. The music companies also did not immediately comment. Streaming platforms to end the war between record companies and new technology The music industry has struggled to find the best way to deal with the rise of AI technology. Over the past ten years, sales have increased, but they have not fully bounced back from the harm done in the early days of the Internet when file-sharing sites and piracy severely hurt sales. Record companies have fought against every new technology, including file-sharing, user-generated content, and streaming. For instance, big music companies sued Udio and Suno last year for copyright infringement. The Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group for the major record labels, had sought as much as $150,000 per work infringed in a claim potentially totaling billions of dollars. Streaming platforms like Spotify Technology SA have helped bring life back to the industry. The industry wants to protect its copyrights while also embracing new technologies. Following this, Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA, revealed that the music community has welcomed AI. Glazier further stated that they were already teaming up with responsible developers to create sustainable AI tools that focus on human creativity and allow artists and songwriters to take charge. However, based on his argument, they can only be successful if developers are open to collaborating with them.

After recently hitting a high near $2.47, XRP has struggled to hold steady and has been stuck in a downtrend. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.17, slightly recovering after dipping to a low of $2.13 earlier. The price is battling to stay above the important average level of $2.15, but it hasn’t been easy. Important Levels To Watch Right now, XRP is retesting an important Fibonacci support zone between $2.10 and $2.15. This level has provided strong support in the past, and bulls will need to defend it to prevent further losses. If the price drops below $2.10 and confirms with a daily candle close, things could get worse. In that case, the next support levels to watch would be around $2.05 and then possibly closer to $2.00. A break below $2.00 could be bad news for XRP, with the risk of a fall towards $1.80–$1.70. Resistance on the Way Up On the upside, there’s tough resistance waiting between $2.30 and $2.34, with more sellers likely around $2.44 and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Unless XRP can break through these zones, it’s unlikely to see any strong bullish moves soon. XRP’s recent drop follows broader market weakness. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies also fell and tested key support levels after uncertainty over U.S. tariff news weighed on investor sentiment. However, there’s a silver lining for XRP holders. Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the SEC might be nearing its end, and if the outcome is favorable, it could reshape XRP’s regulatory status. This would be a positive for the token and might give its price a much-needed boost in the near future.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 01:42:21

Perplexity’s advanced AI search and assistant capabilities will be integrated across the tech company’s popular devices as part of the deal. The deal would see Perplexity’s AI assistant app and AI-powered search features preloaded onto Samsung’s handsets and integrated into the tech company’s internet browser. People familiar with the discussion say the two companies also discuss integrating Perplexity’s technology with Samsung’s in-house Bixby virtual assistant. The South Korean firm aims to announce such integrations before the end of 2025 for its Galaxy S26 line of phones, which is expected to go on sale in early 2026. It would play into the trend of bundling Perplexity AI, which would be included as a default assistant choice for Samsung’s high-end mobile devices. While discussions are advanced, some technical and contract details are incomplete. If developed, this collaboration would be one of the most significant AI alliances the phone company has made for device software. Samsung backs Perplexity with major investment Samsung is also a major investor in Perplexity’s existing funding round. Perplexity is nearing the close of its latest financing, which would value the company at about $14 billion and raise about $500 million. The investment will allow the tech firm to reduce its reliance on Google’s services, which have underpinned some of the most important features it’s devices have relied on for years. It will also allow it to work with a wider range of AI partners. Perplexity has just signed a deal with Motorola to put its AI assistant on the new Razr foldable phone, representing the small startup’s first big mobile partnership. Samsung’s participation in Perplexity may drive its audience to millions of devices worldwide. Samsung powers up AI assistants with Perplexity integration If finalized, the deal could alter how millions of people use their Samsung devices. The tech firm’s AI assistant, Bixby, has failed to outshine its rivals, Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri. It would also mean potentially adding Perplexity’s powerful AI to Bixby, which would give Bixby smarter, more comprehensive responses, better search results, and the ability to engage in more human-like conversations. The partnership is also a new sign of a wider trend in the tech industry: Companies are racing to turn consumer electronics and digital experiences into smarter wares with powerful AI assistants. Perplexity has also attracted speculation from Apple, Samsung’s arch-rival. Apple pitched Perplexity as a substitute for or supplement to Google Search or to the AI that underpins Siri. Samsung’s approach mirrors Apple’s, which has built many developer connections for flexible new services. At the same time, buying up Perplexity and incorporating its tech could help the tech company cut dependence on a single AI supplier and offer multiple user options. With the rise of increasingly powerful AI, collaborations like Perplexity and Samsung could define the future of mobile tech. In the next few years, our devices will get smarter, more intuitive, and more personal.

With Cronos integrating Google Cloud AI and Tron amassing serious total value locked, both chains are starting to roar back to life. But it’s Qubetics and its under-the-radar presale expansion that might actually be the story no one’s prepared for. Qubetics has been carving out its place by solving one of the internet’s most basic but unresolved needs: private and decentralized browsing. The project is now entering its 37th presale stage, with over $17.5 million already raised and 514 million tokens sold. It’s part of a new wave of infrastructure-focused platforms pushing past hype and into real-world utility. Among the best altcoins to invest in now, this trio may be offering something beyond speculation: a shot at transformation. A Game-Changing VPN Solution That Earns Its Spot Among the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now Qubetics isn’t following the crowd. Instead, it’s building the Web3 version of what millions already rely on—virtual private networks. Its Decentralized VPN application bridges the gap between user anonymity and blockchain infrastructure, giving users and businesses a robust, censorship-resistant browsing experience. What makes Qubetics especially compelling is that it’s not just about privacy—it’s about composability and control across chains. Take a startup in Eastern Europe launching an NFT marketplace—traditional VPNs may be blocked, data may be logged, and regional firewalls can cripple cross-border partnerships. With Qubetics’ decentralized VPN, that same company can operate freely, connecting via multi-chain protocols without leaving sensitive metadata exposed. Similarly, a freelance dev in Southeast Asia working on DeFi tools for Western protocols can now browse securely and access all development layers without relying on centralized ISPs. What elevates Qubetics to the list of the best altcoins to invest in now isn’t just its application—it’s its role as a full-stack aggregator. As the first Web3 aggregator designed to unite leading blockchains under a single framework, it supports real-time privacy, decentralized identity, and layered routing with minimal latency. This isn’t a rehash of old privacy tools; it’s a next-gen protocol for the cross-chain era. $17.5M Raised and Counting: Why the Qubetics Presale Is One of the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now Stage 37 of the Qubetics presale has officially begun, priced at $0.3370. So far, the platform has raised over $17.5 million, drawing in more than 27,300 token holders and selling 514 million $TICS tokens. Every stage of the presale lasts just 7 days, with the price increasing by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM—a built-in momentum mechanic that continues to boost early traction. Community participants jumping in at this stage could see substantial returns. If $TICS reaches $1 after presale, the current entry yields 196.65% ROI. At $5, the return rockets to 1,383.25%, and at $6, it hits 1,679.90%. For longer-term holders waiting on the Qubetics mainnet launch in Q2 2025, the projections become even more jaw-dropping. A $10 valuation yields 2,866.51% ROI, and at $15, early adopters are looking at 4,349.76%. Here’s what that means for a simple $100 entry at today’s presale price: At $1, that $100 becomes $296.65. At $5, it becomes $1,483.25. And if the token hits $15 post-mainnet, $100 balloons to $4,449.76. That’s why the Qubetics presale continues to attract buzz across blockchain communities and is repeatedly being tagged as the best crypto pre sale opportunity of Q2 2025. In a market driven by hype cycles and short attention spans, Qubetics is setting the tempo with consistent presale mechanics and a sharp focus on actual utility. That’s not noise—it’s a blueprint for breakout momentum. Cronos Taps Into AI With Google Cloud—Is It Quietly Gaining Ground? Cronos has been pushing boundaries again, this time by integrating Google Cloud’s artificial intelligence tools into its developer suite. This move is expected to supercharge its application ecosystem, particularly around gaming and DeFi. According to the Cronos Labs team, AI will be embedded into smart contract deployment tools, providing new levels of automation and reducing time-to-market for dApps. The collaboration doesn’t stop there. Cronos Labs also unveiled support for Generative AI, enabling developers to build adaptive interfaces and chatbot layers for DeFi protocols. This strategy aligns with its larger plan to be the go-to chain for Web3 gaming—a niche that’s rapidly maturing. Combined with a rising number of daily active users and an expanding developer base, Cronos is reclaiming territory lost during the last bear cycle. For participants looking beyond the hype, Cronos’ shift into AI-infused infrastructure shows it’s not sleeping on innovation. It’s positioning itself as a utility-first chain in a market craving smarter execution. While it hasn’t dominated headlines like Solana or Ethereum recently, its focused pivot could be exactly what gives it the staying power needed to rise back up the rankings. Tron Quietly Builds On Its $8 Billion DeFi Empire Tron has long been underestimated, often labeled as a legacy Layer 1 with fading influence. But that narrative is beginning to crumble. As of this month, Tron boasts over $8 billion in total value locked (TVL), making it one of the most entrenched ecosystems in decentralized finance. What’s especially impressive is that this figure was achieved with minimal institutional hype or retail-driven rallies. The real kicker? Tron now leads in stablecoin dominance, particularly with USDT on-chain transfers, which surpass even Ethereum in volume. The chain’s reliability, low fees, and deep liquidity pools have made it the backbone for stablecoin transactions across Asia, Latin America, and parts of the Middle East. And with BitTorrent Chain expanding interoperability, Tron is widening its network effect without altering its core thesis. For those tracking the best altcoins to invest in now, Tron deserves renewed attention—not for a flashy new feature, but for its relentless consistency. It’s become a quiet cornerstone for many cross-border, dollar-denominated DeFi operations. And in crypto, consistency often beats charisma when the next bull run comes calling. Final Verdict: The Best Altcoins to Invest in Now Aren’t Always the Loudest So where do things stand? Qubetics is building toward utility dominance with a decentralized VPN that could transform how people access the internet. Cronos is going all-in on AI integration with Google Cloud, expanding its ecosystem’s depth and use cases. Meanwhile, Tron continues to be the dark horse of DeFi, anchoring global stablecoin liquidity and building long-term. Each has its strengths. But Qubetics’ momentum—from its Sunday price hikes to a $17.5 million presale—puts it in a unique lane. Its approach to decentralized infrastructure and Web3 aggregation positions it as more than a token—it’s a toolkit. And with real ROI potential, it’s hard to ignore what it offers compared to other crypto presale contenders. For early adopters scanning the horizon, Qubetics may well be the best crypto pre sale out there. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics one of the best altcoins to invest in now? Its decentralized VPN, presale structure, and high ROI potential make Qubetics a standout utility-driven altcoin. How does Cronos’ Google Cloud partnership impact its growth? It brings AI-powered tools to developers, enhancing dApp deployment, UX, and scalability. Why is Tron still relevant in the 2025 crypto market? With $8B TVL and dominance in USDT transfers, Tron remains essential to global DeFi transactions.

Recently, Pi Network has become the talk of the crypto space after getting listed on MEXC, one of the popular crypto exchanges. But while the listing was big news, the coin’s price has been on a wild roller coaster, leaving investors unsure about what comes next. Right now, Pi Network’s price is stuck around $0.64. Even with all the recent excitement, it hasn’t managed to break past the strong resistance level at $1. Many experts believe that until it crosses this barrier, it’ll be tough for the coin to attract fresh investor confidence. But if it manages to stay above that mark and climb past $0.85, there’s a chance it could rally toward $1 or even $1.15. Wil Pi Network Price Hit $0.40? According to analyst Dr Altcoin, the price of Pi is likely to keep dropping until the end of August. The analyst believes that unless the Pi Core Team changes its approach and becomes more transparent, things may get worse before they get better. Dr Altcoin has been warning about Pi Network’s price situation for a while. In his latest comment, he mentioned that the token could possibly fall as low as $0.40 in the coming weeks. He said that one of the biggest problems holding Pi Network back is the lack of openness from the team behind the project. “No investor wants to put their money into something where the founders refuse to be transparent,” said Dr Altcoin. The price of Pi will likely continue to decline until the end of August, after which it may slowly start to recover. I previously predicted it could drop to $0.40—unless the Pi Core Team becomes transparent. No investor wants to put money into something where the founders refuse… pic.twitter.com/KEvAwOyhX9 — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) May 28, 2025 Despite these short-term struggles, Pi Network seems focused on building for the future. The project recently launched a $100 million Pi Network Ventures Fund aimed at supporting startups in AI, gaming, fintech, and e-commerce. The goal is to create real-world applications that use Pi cryptocurrency, which could eventually increase the coin’s value if it gains traction.",Uncategorized|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 02:20:53
