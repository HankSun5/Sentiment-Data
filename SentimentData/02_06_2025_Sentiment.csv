ADA has been stuck in a range, showing no clear breakout, while SUI’s price stagnates around $1 despite solid DEX volumes. This suggests a shift in investor confidence away from established altcoins. Enter BlockDAG . With its token priced at just $0.0018 and over $281 million raised in presale, BlockDAG is quickly emerging as the market’s hottest early-stage crypto. While ADA and SUI wait for their next big move, BlockDAG is already making waves and setting its own pace. Investors are taking note, and capital is flowing in at an unprecedented rate. Cardano Struggles to Break Out Cardano (ADA) has earned its place as a solid project, thanks to its emphasis on research, peer-reviewed development, and steady upgrades. However, in today’s market, these strengths aren’t showing up in its price action. ADA has been stuck around the $0.45–$0.50 range, and sentiment seems to lean more neutral or slightly bearish. While analysts recognize Cardano’s potential with growing on-chain activity and upcoming updates, there’s no clear timeline for when we’ll see a breakout. A recent report suggested that ADA could eventually reach $10, with a multi-phase growth plan, but even the most optimistic projections place that milestone in mid-2026. For investors looking for quicker gains, that’s a long wait. With no immediate catalysts to drive the price up, ADA has shifted from a buy to more of a hold. This lack of clear momentum is pushing investors to look for projects that offer more immediate returns, like BlockDAG, which comes with a more defined and exciting roadmap. SUI Surpasses $14B in DEX Volume SUI, the layer-1 blockchain built with object-based smart contracts, has made significant strides, particularly in the DeFi space. It recently hit a new milestone, surpassing $14.8 billion in monthly decentralized exchange volume, outpacing many of its competitors in terms of on-chain activity. However, despite these solid figures, SUI’s price has been stuck around $1.08, with little movement in recent weeks. This disconnect between the strong network performance and price action has left some investors frustrated. While SUI’s fundamentals are improving, the market seems to have already priced in much of its current value. Without a major catalyst or a shift in narrative, SUI may continue to trade in this consolidation phase. Analysts have pointed out the gap between adoption metrics and price, suggesting that the market may not be fully appreciating SUI’s potential. But they also caution that any upside may depend on broader market enthusiasm picking up. In short, SUI is executing well on the development front, but its price action just isn’t reflecting that right now. BlockDAG Hits $281M as Traders Flock to $0.0018 Presale! As ADA and SUI maintain steady momentum, BlockDAG is speeding ahead, rapidly gaining traction. With over $281 million raised in presale funds and a price set at just $0.0018 per token, it’s drawing serious investor interest. Each passing day, new capital is flowing in, pushing BlockDAG closer to its goal of hitting $300 million in presale commitments. What sets BlockDAG apart? It’s more than just an idea; it’s a project with a concrete vision and deployable tech. By combining blockchain security with the scalability of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), BlockDAG can handle high transaction volumes with minimal delay. It’s also fully EVM-compatible, enabling developers to build or migrate decentralized applications with ease. Plus, the platform’s low-code smart contract builder makes it simple for creators to get started. BlockDAG’s roadmap isn’t just a list of goals, it’s a clear path forward. On June 13, the project will showcase 15 more exchange listings, on top of its five existing ones, including MEXC, LBank, and CoinStore. This will provide the liquidity and market exposure needed for a strong post-launch performance. With an anticipated launch price of $0.05, early investors could see returns as high as 2,677%, with some even projecting a $20 future price. These aren’t just pipe dreams; they’re grounded in real data and solid market engagement. While other projects like ADA and SUI are slow to evolve, BlockDAG is making things happen now, and that’s why investors are lining up. Final Thoughts Cardano and SUI have their merits, but they aren’t catching the market’s attention right now. Cardano’s long-term plans are still a work in progress, and while SUI leads in DeFi, its price has stalled despite solid fundamentals. Investors are starting to look elsewhere. Enter BlockDAG. With a token price of just $0.0018 and over $281 million raised in presale, it’s attracting serious attention. On top of that, a June event will reveal 20 exchange listings, further boosting its market presence. BlockDAG is doing what others aren’t: delivering real growth now, not waiting for future validation. As the hunt for the next big crypto intensifies, BlockDAG is quickly becoming the go-to project to watch.

At the same time, the currency has lost 3.16% of its value in the day. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to project a bearish market scenario. Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.615 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.192 over the last 24 hours as bearish momentum rose around immediate resistance channels. Moreover, sellers are currently dominating the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.329854 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by June 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,276.57 DOGE in June; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future?

Currently, the coin is trading below the year’s peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.72 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $0.12260 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered back to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. Near the start of June 2025, Dogecoin is trending near the $0.20 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-01 21:00:39

These often-viral assets are doing more than just making headlines. Meme Coins Spark Broader Crypto Participation According to the latest report titled “State of Crypto” by Winklevoss twins-led crypto exchange Gemini, meme coins are encouraging newcomers to explore the digital asset industry. This was found after conducting a survey of 7,205 consumers in the US, UK, France, Italy, Singapore, and Australia (approximately 1,200) consumers per country. A large majority – a whopping 94% – of meme coin holders also hold other types of cryptocurrencies, suggesting that meme coins act as a bridge into the broader crypto ecosystem. Many users appear to begin their journey with these tokens before branching out. For example, 31% of US investors who own both meme coins and traditional cryptocurrencies say meme coins were their first crypto purchase. That trend is similarly reflected in Australia and the UK, which trailed with 28% each, followed by Singapore with 23%, Italy with 22%, and France with 19%. Interestingly, France also leads in overall meme coin ownership, with 67% of its crypto investors holding at least one. The trend continues across other regions with Singapore at 59%, Italy at 58%, the UK at 57%, the US at 55%, and Australia at 45%. Europe Leads Crypto Ownership Zooming out, crypto ownership has grown steadily across multiple regions following the 2022 market downturn. Europe reported a notable rise. In 2025, 24% of UK respondents said they owned cryptocurrency, up from 18% in 2024. France saw a similar rise, with ownership increasing to 21%, also from 18% the previous year. Analysts attribute this growth in part to a more favorable regulatory climate in Europe, driven by the phased rollout of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework over the last two years. Singapore recorded the highest rate of crypto ownership among the surveyed countries, with 28% of respondents reporting they hold digital assets. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s recent crypto-friendly policies are also influencing public sentiment. After vowing to support digital assets during his campaign, Trump has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, restructured the SEC toward a more innovation-driven stance, and backed legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins and broader crypto markets. Additionally, he introduced a Trump-branded meme coin, which reached nearly $3 billion in market cap this month. These developments appear to be boosting confidence among potential investors. Nearly 23% of non-crypto owners in the US said the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve made them more confident in crypto’s value. Trump’s initiatives are having an international ripple effect on attitudes toward digital asset investment, as 21% of non-crypto owners in the UK and 19% in Singapore echoed a similar sentiment.

Early Buyers Eye Qubetics’ Presale Momentum Alongside Ethereum and GALA’s Proven Leadership,https://thecoinrise.com/top-cryptos-to-join-for-2025-early-buyers-eye-qubetics-presale-momentum-alongside-ethereum-and-galas-proven-leadership/,"As blockchain adoption enters a new phase of institutional integration and utility-driven demand, the focus has shifted from short-lived market hype to long-term functional ecosystems. Projects that offer real-world use cases, protocol flexibility, and developer traction are increasingly viewed as core assets by seasoned community participants and blockchain infrastructure backers alike.Among the standout entries in 2025 is Qubetics ($TICS) —a blockchain infrastructure project delivering mission-critical tools like a decentralized VPN while gaining significant traction through its presale. Alongside Qubetics , leading platforms such as Ethereum (ETH) and GALA continue to serve as pillars of decentralized technology, offering foundational services across smart contracts, dApps, and blockchain gaming. Each of these projects represents a compelling case for inclusion among the top cryptos to join for 2025, delivering value at different layers of the Web3 economy. Qubetics (TICS): Securing Web3 Access Through a Decentralized VPN Qubetics is emerging as a leader among the top cryptos to join for 2025, with its ecosystem designed to empower user sovereignty, privacy, and utility across a multi-chain environment. One of its most transformative features is its Decentralized VPN (dVPN)—a permissionless privacy infrastructure allowing users to route traffic through community-powered nodes rather than centralized servers. This innovation serves a critical need for businesses, developers, and individuals concerned about surveillance, data mining, and centralized points of failure. A multinational law firm working across jurisdictions with strict data privacy regulations, for example, can integrate Qubetics’ dVPN to protect sensitive documents and enforce zero-trust architecture internally. Similarly, journalists, developers, and freelancers in restrictive regions can access global internet services securely and anonymously, bypassing firewalls and content censorship. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on centralized data centers and are subject to geo-political control, Qubetics’ dVPN is community-operated. This means anyone can contribute unused bandwidth to the network, earning passive rewards while decentralizing privacy infrastructure. The model enables a two-sided network economy—driving both adoption and utility growth. Analysts’ Projections for $TICS The performance of the ongoing Qubetics crypto presale is an indicator of strong market confidence. In Stage 36, Qubetics has already sold over 514 million tokens to more than 27,300 participants, raising a total of $17.5 million. The token is currently available at $0.3064, offering a compelling early entry point into a privacy-focused, infrastructure-first ecosystem. Market analysts following the project have highlighted several price trajectories based on adoption and platform usage. A post-presale valuation of $1 would imply a 226% ROI. Mid-range projections of $5 and $6 suggest 1,531% and 1,857% returns. At higher targets, such as $10 and $15, community members could realize 3,163% and 4,794% ROI, respectively. These forecasts underscore why Qubetics is being positioned as a high-utility asset with extraordinary upside among the top cryptos to join for 2025 . Qubetics delivers a unique blend of privacy infrastructure, non-custodial utility, and cross-chain access with early market validation. Its decentralized VPN offering and high-performing presale make it a strategic entry in 2025’s leading blockchain projects. Ethereum (ETH): The Cornerstone of Smart Contracts and On-Chain Innovation Ethereum stands as the original and most widely adopted smart contract platform, serving as the foundational infrastructure for the decentralized application (dApp) economy. Since launching in 2015, Ethereum has evolved into a high-value ecosystem supporting thousands of projects across DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and decentralized identity. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is widely recognized as the industry standard for smart contract execution. It is compatible with multiple Layer 2 networks and sidechains, including Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and zkSync—enabling scalable, low-fee experiences without compromising on Ethereum’s security and decentralization. Ethereum’s importance is further amplified by its massive developer base and institutional integration. It underpins the majority of token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, etc.) and serves as the backbone for DeFi protocols managing billions in total value locked (TVL). Applications ranging from stablecoin protocols to decentralized exchanges, prediction markets, and DAOs all rely on Ethereum for operational integrity. One of Ethereum’s strongest assets is its commitment to ongoing evolution. The transition to proof-of-stake via the Merge has significantly improved energy efficiency and set the stage for additional upgrades like sharding and scalability enhancements under the Ethereum 2.0 roadmap. Ethereum is also viewed as a credible bridge between Web2 and Web3 for enterprises. With growing interest from multinational firms and public institutions, Ethereum’s role as a programmable, open-source layer for financial, identity, and data services is cemented. Ethereum is a necessary inclusion in any serious crypto strategy due to its unmatched infrastructure footprint and role in hosting decentralized applications. It remains a core building block in the conversation around the top cryptos to join for 2025 . GALA: Redefining Entertainment and Gaming Through Blockchain GALA is at the forefront of Web3 gaming and digital entertainment, offering decentralized infrastructure for developers and content creators to build, monetize, and distribute experiences across virtual worlds. As part of the larger Gala Games ecosystem, the GALA token is used to power in-game economies, support governance, and reward ecosystem contributions. What differentiates GALA from traditional gaming platforms is its user-first model. In the Gala ecosystem, players can own in-game items as NFTs, trade them freely, and even earn tokens through gameplay. This approach flips the conventional model where gaming companies retain full control over assets and monetization channels. Gala Games has onboarded a wide variety of gaming titles, including MMORPGs, tower defense games, racing simulators, and even music platforms under Gala Music. These platforms leverage blockchain for asset ownership, royalty distribution, and direct creator-to-fan engagement. Content creators can publish and sell without relying on intermediaries, while players gain access to immersive, transparent reward systems. GALA has positioned itself as an entertainment infrastructure platform rather than just a game publisher. It has expanded into hosting its own nodes, community-driven governance, and partnerships with both legacy studios and independent developers to build out its ecosystem.

The bill, which is expected to pass after the election, has caused great activity in the financial sector. The country's leading financial institutions are rapidly establishing collaborations and continuing technical infrastructure preparations in order to be pioneers in this new market. Tokenized securities are known as digital securities supported by blockchain technology. Thanks to the security and ease of transaction offered by this technology, it is possible to divide low-liquid assets such as real estate, works of art, and even live animals into small shares and offer them to investors. Currently, tokenized securities remain in a gray area due to a lack of regulation. However, both main candidates running in the presidential election, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have made it clear in their campaign promises that tokenized securities will be legalized quickly, making the bill’s passage almost certain. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives Another Bullish Signal That He Will Buy Bitcoin: Here's How Much BTC He Currently Owns The fact that tokenized securities are both based on real assets and have the status of a security has led to a serious consensus among political parties in this area. This makes it easier for the law to pass. According to industry representatives, this digital asset class is seen as “the safest innovation.” With the passing of the law, an increase in tokenized investment products based on familiar assets such as real estate is expected in the short term. In the long term, it is predicted that the market structure will change radically as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds, become tokenized. These blockchain-based digital securities promise to lower transaction costs by reducing dependence on centralized intermediary institutions, while enabling automatic transactions powered by artificial intelligence thanks to their programmability. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, Solana, Cardano and Shiba Inu have begun to stretch their potential to meet up with Remittix , the PayFi sensation. The Solana (SOL) ecosystem is expanding, Cardano (ADA) technical updates are arousing interest, while Shiba Inu coin (SHIB) hype status is fueling excitement for a rebound. Amid these developments, Remittix (RTX) is still at the forefront, proving to be one of the strongest cryptocurrencies in 2025. It has received a lot of attention from investors because of its unique method of making cross-border payments. Let’s delve deeper! Remittix (RTX): The PayFi sensation market giants are catching up to Considering the highly competitive state of the market, generating over $15.4 million in a presale isn’t merely impressive: It’s a signal that Remittix has seized market shares in all the right ways. For investors to commit such a substantial amount of money to a new project, there must be something truly remarkable about it. In Remittix’s case, it is its fundamental ethos to transform the global payment industry. While conventional systems like Stripe and Wise remain tangled in fees, delays and third-party holdups, Remittix offers something simple and easy to use. With its PayFi protocol , it cuts through the noise with fast, low-cost transfers and supports over 100 cryptocurrencies alongside 30 fiat currencies. This kind of range gives users more control and choice, regardless of whether they’re sending money across the world or just next door. Solana ( SOL ): Strong fundamentals as patterns align The Solana ecosystem is showing strong expansion on several fronts that support the growth of its long-term value. The recent launch of the Solana Attestation Service represents a major infrastructural advancement for what the Foundation defines as “internet capital markets.” Using this open-source tool, approved issuers can bind off-chain credentials to wallet addresses. Solana’s latest price action is beginning to align with this growth. Since January, SOL has been technically producing an arresting V-shaped recovery pattern on the weekly chart. Source: TradingView Usually showing great buying activity after a significant loss, this optimistic formation is a pattern completion objective at the $252 neckline resistance. Cardano (ADA) : Whale signals, but waning derivatives The Cardano price has been trading range-bound since March, but the market is gearing up for a breakout above $1. Blockchain data shows that over 21.6 billion ADA were staked recently, showing market expectations. Moreover, large holders are removing ADA from exchanges, pointing to possible supply tightening. Analysts suggest the Cardano price may reach $1.20 if this trend continues, but caution remains with ADA’s derivative reflecting doubt. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass, open interest has dropped 4.42% to $897 million. Meanwhile, options volume has plunged 92% to 6.59K, with open interest in options falling to $374K. Overall, bullish sentiment among traders has weakened, even as whale signals fuel optimism. Shiba Inu coin : Strong social volume, but concerning network realized Profit/Loss ratio Currently, the hype for the Shiba Inu coin is strong even as its price enters deep bearish zones. Santiment data shows that SHIB’s social volume surged by 155%, and industrial experts are optimistic. Meanwhile, SHIB’s Network Realized Profit/Loss plummeted from 104,000 to -652,000, indicating that the majority of SHIB holders are currently in a losing position. Source: Santiment Historically, drops like this have often signaled the formation of a bottom, as Shiba Inu coin prices tend to bounce shortly after. If this pattern repeats itself, then a price rally towards $0.000021 is likely to be imminent. Conclusion These undervalued cryptos represent compelling investment opportunities in the altcoin space. Remittix , in particular, is demonstrating rare potential with an over $15.4 million presale, where its native RTX token is priced at $0.0781.

The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is all set to target the $300 level in the near future as it tries to take control of its destiny. According to popular crypto analyst Don on X (formerly Twitter), technical indicators show that the major digital asset is set to reach this important milestone in the coming months. 14-Day Price Action SOL is changing hands below the $175 level at press time. Here is its price action from the last two weeks: Image Source: TradingView SOL has been relatively steady overall during this period. Still, the bulls could have done much better, because premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin posted a new All-Time High (ATH) of $112,000 about a week ago. The move was expected to kickstart the next altcoin season, but it didn’t as BTC dropped slightly in value and is now hovering around $108,000. A definitive move ahead from the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is likely to create a spark for other digital currencies to follow. SOL has been unable to break free of the $200 price resistance recently, but for these smaller coins, a jump like that doesn’t take much time, especially if the right conditions present themselves. The Solana bulls must wait for the opportune moment before striking. SOL Showing Strong Growth SOL will likely be a major part of this highly anticipated bull market. The programmable digital currency ecosystem remains one of the most sought-after networks for developers because of its immense capability and growing acceptability. The Solana blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is now nearing $10 billion and showing no signs of slowing down. A recent development involves Solana Strategies, a Canadian company specializing in capital raising through the Solana blockchain. The blockchain firm recently filed for a $1 billion preliminary short-form base shelf prospectus to increase financial flexibility and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In simple terms, the move will allow the organization to raise massive funds for various financial instruments it intends to offer via the SOL blockchain. The move indicates the growing acceptance of Solana in the capital markets, which is a significant advantage considering its relatively subdued overall performance in the cryptocurrency market.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 21:59:21

Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) have long dominated conversations as solid picks for long-term growth, supported by strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Meanwhile, emerging coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor attention for its explosive potential and affordability, making them some of the best cryptos to buy now for those seeking outsized gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently priced at $0.03 and gaining serious momentum. Mutuum Finance has reached Presale Phase 5, selling at the price of $0.03. Investor interest is still very high, and there are over 11,500 buyers as well as a total raise of $9.7 million. People joining in at this level can earn up to 100% when the token launches at $0.06. Cardano and Ripple: Solid Coins in the Race to $5 Currently, Cardano (ADA) trades at around $0.74, showing resilience amid recent market dips thanks to growing smart contract adoption and high-profile partnerships like with FC Barcelona. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) sits near $2.25, buoyed by positive regulatory developments and advancements in cross-border payment solutions. Both coins remain favorites among investors looking for long-term growth and stand as strong contenders in the race to hit $5. While they navigate ongoing volatility, emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also attracting attention for their high upside potential.

While the token’s recent performance shows potential, achieving this milestone is no small feat in the volatile cryptocurrency market. On the other hand, smart investors pivoting to emerging projects like Ruvi AI (RUVI) have already enjoyed 50% gains in under a month during its presale. This stark contrast underscores Ruvi AI’s disruptive potential and its ability to outperform even the most established cryptocurrencies. The Challenge for Binance Coin Binance Coin, a cornerstone of the Binance ecosystem, boasts a history of steady growth. Nevertheless, achieving a near 50% surge from its current price levels to $900 is a daunting challenge. Factors such as market volatility, external regulatory scrutiny, and competition in the crypto space make this a steep climb. While Binance Coin remains a solid choice for seasoned investors, its upward trajectory may take significant time and patience. For those seeking quicker, high-yield opportunities, newer projects like Ruvi AI present exciting alternatives. Ruvi AI’s Record-Breaking Performance Ruvi AI’s entrance into the market has been nothing short of astounding. During its presale Phase 1 , Ruvi AI sold 125 million tokens , raising $1.4 million with an entry price as low as $0.015 per token . Early investors experienced 50% gains in this phase alone, highlighting how Ruvi AI rewards those who move quickly. What makes Ruvi AI especially appealing is its projected growth. Analysts forecast that RUVI tokens could reach $1 by Q4 2025 , translating to a 6,566% ROI for initial investors. Such gains demonstrate Ruvi AI’s potential to deliver exponential value faster than many mainstream projects like Binance Coin. Practical Solutions Driving Ruvi AI’s Appeal Unlike projects reliant on speculative hype, Ruvi AI stands out with its focus on solving real-world issues. Its applications span key sectors, making it a utility-driven blockchain venture with broad appeal: Healthcare : Ruvi AI supports medical professionals with AI-powered diagnostics, improving accuracy and speeding up decision-making processes. Logistics : By optimizing supply chain management through advanced AI solutions, Ruvi AI helps companies cut costs and boost efficiency. Finance : Ruvi AI enhances transaction security and fraud detection through state-of-the-art AI algorithms, improving outcomes for financial institutions worldwide. These impactful use cases ensure Ruvi AI isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it is a technology poised to bring meaningful change to multiple industries. Lucrative VIP Investment Options To maximize returns, Ruvi AI offers VIP investment tiers , each with enticing bonuses. Backers have options that cater to various investment budgets: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens allocated: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token = $4,900. Value at $1 per token = $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens allocated: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token = $15,680. Value at $1 per token = $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens allocated: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token = $89,600. Value at $1 per token = $1,280,000. These options offer early investors the potential to reap immense rewards, whether they invest modestly or on a larger scale. Why Ruvi AI is Outpacing Binance Coin What sets Ruvi AI apart from larger projects like Binance Coin is its agility and focus on innovation. While Binance’s ecosystem is well-established, its growth trajectory is relatively slow compared to Ruvi AI’s explosive rise. Ruvi AI’s emphasis on practical solutions, combined with its short-term reward potential and long-term vision, makes it a unique proposition. With a clear roadmap and impressive market performance, Ruvi AI is proving to be a standout project in the blockchain space. Final Thoughts While Binance Coin promises stability and a reliable growth path, projects like Ruvi AI show the incredible opportunities in exploring emerging cryptocurrencies. By delivering 50% gains in presale Phase 1 and providing utilities that address real-world challenges, Ruvi AI is already outperforming more established names. For investors hungry for both short-term and long-term gains, Ruvi AI represents the next big thing. Whether you’re seeking to diversify your portfolio or ride the wave of an innovative project, Ruvi AI offers an unparalleled blend of utility, scalability, and return on investment.

To this end, he noted that the success of the native coin is largely a function of its community’s strength. Hougan reached this conclusion after attending a Ripple event recently in Las Vegas. Bitcoin Success is Not a Threat to XRP The Bitwise CIO posted about his return from the XRP conference event on X, noting that approximately 1000 were in attendance. Reacting to the May 31 post, Vijar Kohli, an X user who doubles as a financier at Golden Door, asked him if there were any good takeaways from the event. Houghan mentioned that members of the Ripple community gradually understand that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple-associated XRP serve different markets. He made sure to establish that the success of Bitcoin is not a threat to XRP. “BTC thriving doesn’t disrupt what XRP aims to achieve,” Hougan clarified. In the wake of the event, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attempted to foster unity between the two blockchains. This led him to say that the Bitcoin community is not an enemy. Ripple Says Bitcoin is Environmentally Friendly Ordinarily, such a statement would be expected to mend the broken fence between both communities. Eventually, it seems like it has achieved little to nothing. As part of the broader effort to appreciate Bitcoin’s progress, Chris Larsen, Ripple co-founder, says he now views Bitcoin as sufficiently environmentally friendly. He took this stance after the share of mining powered by renewable energy topped 50%. It is worth noting that Larsen was backing a Greenpeace campaign targeting Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts think the statement of the Ripple executive is just a tactic to fix reputational damage. Bitwise XRP ETF Awaits SEC Approval In other related matters, Bitwise is still awaiting the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision on its spot XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). It first filed an S-1 registration statement for this offering in October 2024. The proposed ETF was intended to track the value of XRP without direct exposure to crypto risks. Bitwise named BNY Mellon its trust’s administrator and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, the custodian of the XRP ETF. There is still a prospect of approval from the SEC.

The Cardano network has now officially unseated Ethereum in the total number of core development commits over the past year. The newly attained milestone suggests an increase in developer activity over an extended period. Additionally, Cardano is now leading all blockchains by GitHub activity, with a total number of developer commits over the last year sitting at 21258 across 550 core repositories. On the other hand, Cardano’s longstanding competitor, Ethereum, is right behind, occupying the second spot with 20950 total commits over one year. The Cardano ecosystem has continued to thrive, with 38 ongoing projects in the building process and 3888 public GitHub repositories on the network. Over the last week, Cardano-based initiatives recorded a notable spike in engagement, with 245 individual developers engaging with these existing initiatives, a 0.39% change from the previous month. These individual developers have remarkably contributed 1914 commits to the network, representing a 4% decrease compared to the previous month. Notably, GitHub activity for blockchain projects often measures the stages and levels of project development present on a particular blockchain network. The ongoing activities indicate the developer’s commitment to projects and overall health. An increase in network developer activity usually indicates that an ongoing project is experiencing changes or necessary improvements. Conversely, decreased network activity might suggest a lack of interest in a network project. While Cardano might not retain this position the following week, as GitHub development activities on other networks are also high, the new milestone validates positive sentiments for the broader Cardano ecosystem .",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 22:10:44

Woods is quoted as saying ; “It is one of the few protocols that has gone through a full market cycle, including 2021 when Sam Bankman-Fried was a huge supporter of Solana, so everyone thought…that’s that, and here we go; it resurrected.” Woods, who appears to be keeping up with activities within the Solana ecosystem, highlighted a key milestone recorded last year: Solana unseated its long-standing competitor, Ethereum, in the number of network developers. “…On July 24, the number of developers on the Solana network surpassed that of Ethereum and became the highest,” Woods remarked. She maintains that Ethereum appeals to institutions, while Solana caters to and attracts key participants in the consumer market. She cites lower fee charges, network agility, functionality, and speed as factors propelling demand for the protocol. “At Ark, one of the things we look for in a new technology is falling cost and accelerating uptake, and that is certainly Solana.”She concluded. Like Cathie Wood, Financier Anthony Scaramucci is optimistic about Solana’s future . The founder of alternative asset manager SkyBridge Capital envisions Solana bridging the gap between crowdsourcing and crypto projects by tokenizing initial public offerings (IPOs). Scaramucci, who is currently authoring a book on the Solana network, added that Solana could become the operating layer for real-world assets, stocks, bonds, and tokenization.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 22:16:04

As expectations for the coming weeks heighten, price predictions are flying in consistently. Standard Chartered, the British multinational bank, is one notable institution that has doubled down on its previous Bitcoin price forecast, which can be considered one of the boldest price predictions made thus far. According to the international bank, Bitcoin is on track to hit the $500,000 price mark before President Donald Trump exits office. Notably, the current president’s second term, which began on January 20, 2025, will elapse on January 20, 2029. As such, the bank is optimistic that Bitcoin could build enough momentum over four years to attain a 358.926% increase in value. Geoffrey Kendrick, the global head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, points to a rise in institutional interest as a catalyst for a long-term price boom. “The 13F data from the US Securities and Exchange Commission supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before Trump leaves office. Bitcoin is attracting a wide range of institutional players.” Kendrick asserted. According to the SEC , Form 13F is a “statutory directive” created to inform the public about the securities holdings of leading institutional investors. Kendrick explains the significance of the data, stating the following; “The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level.” He added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is kicking off the new week on a lukewarm note, with bulls failing to hold above the $110,000 mark. Although gains sustained over the last 7 days are up 5.70%, hourly losses sit at 0.08% during this report.

According to entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davis, Bitcoin’s recent bullish performance has failed to stimulate excitement within the broader cryptocurrency market. The investor is convinced the missing piece is the highly anticipated altcoin season. “This cycle has been mostly about Bitcoin so far. Even though BTC smashed through all-time highs, there’s no excitement in the market. The reason is simple: Everyone and their dog are sitting in altcoins, and that’s why even though BTC is near ATHs, altcoin index is sitting at 27 (real altseason starts at 75).” He wrote . As the analyst asserts, Bitcoin has outperformed this in this current market cycle, with a continuous bullish milestone recorded monthly. The asset kicked off 2025 hovering above the $90,000 price mark, before hitting $100,000 briefly, in the latter part of January and February. Last week, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $111,970 before returning below the $110,000 level. The big bull is trading at a press time price of $109,795. On the other hand, Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen observed that altcoin and Bitcoin pairs are trading at significantly lower levels. Countering that altcoin season is around the corner, he highlighted the continued downward trend observed within the altcoin market over the last 4 years. “ALT/BTC pairs just put in their lowest weekly close all cycle. Those that call for alt season each week may sound confident and contrarian, but altcoins have been bleeding to Bitcoin almost non-stop since 2021.” Cowen wrote . Where is “altcoin season”? While altcoin season is typically expected to arrive 6-9 months after every Bitcoin halving, the years after the halving year leave analysts gauging, using altcoin season index aggregators designed to analyze the performance of the top 50 altcoins in the market. These aggregators track factors including increased trading volume, increased altcoin dominance, and frequent price breakouts. Altcoin season indexes currently sit at 16, indicating that only 16% of existing altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over 90 days. It is also worth noting that altcoins fail to outperform Bitcoin during some market cycles and continue to trade downward or sideways.",Cryptocurrency|News|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 22:37:40

Markets now favor projects with solid development plans, smart token models, and long-term progress. This is where potential leaders are taking shape, through strong presales, improved blockchain activity, and expanding ecosystems. For anyone tracking the best long-term cryptos, this list outlines four that are gaining strong attention. These include platforms using AI, those attracting institutions, and coins with upcoming catalysts. Whether you’re searching for early presale entries or looking at breakout charts, this guide covers what’s important: product plans, market moves, and future momentum. Let’s begin with Web3 ai, a presale that’s gaining serious interest. Web3 ai: Connecting AI With Real-Time Blockchain Tools Web3 ai is creating a wide range of AI-based crypto tools to help users make smart decisions, track live market data, and avoid risky moves. Its strength lies in how all its tools are connected. The AI pulls data from blockchains, social platforms, and exchanges to support its many features, like scam checkers, risk tools, and portfolio support systems. Web3 ai runs on multiple platforms, including web, mobile, and browser apps, and it supports networks like Ethereum, BNB, Solana, and Polygon. The $WAI token powers access to premium tools, voting rights, and is built on a deflationary model with revenue sharing and upcoming AI upgrades. Its presale has already raised more than $6.8 million. The project is in Stage 7 of 50, with a current price of $0.000402. The final presale stage price is $0.003267, and the listing price is set at $0.005242. Based on these numbers, early participants could see a 1747% return. Web3 ai remains one of the best long-term cryptos for those looking at high-potential projects with real functionality. Solana: Big Players and New Features Boost Outlook Solana is trading close to $170.34, with an $88.1 billion market value. Despite minor drops recently, the chain remains active with new developments. A recent highlight is its integration with MetaMask desktop, which improves access for users and expands Solana’s reach. Meanwhile, big banks such as HSBC and Bank of America are looking at Solana via partnerships with R3, suggesting increasing institutional interest. Forecasts show Solana could touch $275 by the end of 2025, with some long-term targets pointing to $500. With its fast speeds and growing adoption beyond memecoins, Solana is becoming a core platform for finance-related apps. It firmly earns its place on the list of best long-term cryptos to consider. Binance Coin: Closing in on $700 BNB is currently priced around $681.94 and has a $96.5 billion market cap. Its next key resistance level is $700, and if passed, analysts expect a fast move toward $750. But BNB’s strength isn’t only in the charts. It lies in Binance’s constant push to expand its products. Recent efforts include launching a real-world asset reward program on BNB Chain and supporting large token events through its wallet. Binance is also adding new listings like Sophon and boosting user reward campaigns. This continues to bring attention and usage back to BNB. With some projections pointing to $2,775 by 2029, BNB remains one of the best long-term cryptos thanks to its utility within the world’s top exchange system. Cardano: Gearing Up for ETF-Driven Gains Cardano is valued at $0.737, backed by a $26.5 billion market cap. Though slightly down in the last 24 hours, it’s supported by an active community and increasing usage. Daily activity crossed 50,000 transactions in May, and there is talk that the SEC might soon approve an ADA ETF. If approved, this could open the door for bigger investments. Price targets from analysts range between $1.30 and $2.60, depending on volume and momentum. ADA also ranks second in bullish votes on CoinMarketCap, with 87% of users believing in its growth. Even more cautious estimates place it at $0.949 by late 2025. That makes Cardano one of the best long-term cryptos for those looking at coins with technical strength and the possibility of ETF impact. Summing Up! The future of crypto growth is being built on real solutions, not just price spikes or memecoins. Web3 ai is building a network where blockchain and AI come together to give users real value. Its presale numbers and expected ROI make it an early mover worth attention. Solana is winning with developers and finance partners. Binance Coin keeps its spot with constant new features. Cardano brings structure, community support, and the ETF potential. For those choosing the best long-term cryptos , these four have the qualities that matter: strong products, plans for growth, and current prices that don’t yet reflect full potential. Whether you’re entering during the presale or planning for future listings, these are assets to watch closely.

45389895,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69326,1748818848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for June 30, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-predicts-shiba-inu-shib-price-for-june-30-2025/,"The cryptocurrency landscape, particularly the world of meme coins, continues to draw attention from traders, investors, and enthusiasts eager to decipher short-term price trends. Among these speculative digital assets, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has remained a top favorite, captivating the crypto community with its vibrant ecosystem, strong community backing, and meme-driven hype. As June 2025 begins, many are eager to understand where SHIB might head by month’s end. In this analysis, we delve into Google Gemini’s AI-generated price predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) by June 30, 2025, and explore the underlying market conditions that could influence these outcomes. Current Market Snapshot As of report time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001297. SHIB’s price movement over the past few weeks has been largely sideways, with occasional dips reflecting the prevailing bearish sentiment. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dictate general market momentum, meme coins like SHIB are especially vulnerable to sharp swings in sentiment, often reacting intensely to social media trends, whale activity, and ecosystem announcements. Google Gemini’s price predictions for June 30, 2025, acknowledge these dynamics and offer three distinct scenarios: modest, moderate, and bullish. Each scenario is grounded in current price action and potential short-term developments, avoiding heavy reliance on third-party analyst forecasts. Modest Scenario In the modest outlook, Google Gemini suggests that if current bearish pressures persist or if the market remains largely stagnant, SHIB is likely to hover near its present levels or experience a minor decline. This places the expected price range between $0.000012 and $0.000013 by the end of June. Such a scenario assumes that no major catalysts emerge to drive fresh buying momentum. Without news of ecosystem upgrades, major partnerships, or substantial improvements in Shiba Inu’s DeFi, gaming, or metaverse initiatives, the token may simply follow the broader crypto market’s consolidation pattern. Moderate Scenario The moderate prediction envisions a more optimistic, albeit restrained, trajectory for SHIB. If minor positive developments occur, such as incremental upgrades in the Shibarium layer-2 network, enhanced staking mechanisms, or small but impactful partnership announcements, the token could experience a slight boost. Google Gemini forecasts that under these circumstances, SHIB might trade between $0.0000135 and $0.0000145 by June 30. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This outcome also hinges on a mild shift in investor sentiment. Even a subtle change in the risk appetite of retail traders or a temporary uptick in meme coin enthusiasm on platforms like X could propel SHIB modestly higher. While not indicative of a full-fledged bull run, this middle-ground scenario suggests that SHIB retains some room for short-term growth if supported by favorable, albeit limited, catalysts. Bullish Outlook For the bullish scenario, Google Gemini emphasizes the need for a significant uptick in buying pressure, which could push SHIB into the $0.000015 to $0.000017 range by the end of June. Achieving this bullish outcome would require a combination of factors, including a reversal in the broader crypto market’s risk sentiment and substantial, SHIB-specific catalysts. Potential triggers might include a surprise rally in Bitcoin or Ethereum, which often lifts altcoins alongside it, or headline-making developments within the SHIB ecosystem. For example, large-scale Shibarium adoption, accelerated token burns, or the introduction of a highly anticipated project within the SHIB metaverse could ignite fresh investor excitement. Notably, given the bearish tone characterizing early June, achieving such a rapid turnaround would demand not just incremental news but a compelling, confidence-restoring event. The Unpredictable Nature of Meme Coins While these predictions provide structured estimates, it’s essential to underscore the speculative nature of meme coins like Shiba Inu. Unlike blue-chip assets with strong institutional backing and clear utility, meme coins are particularly susceptible to sudden shifts driven by social media trends, influencer commentary, and retail trading frenzies. Even AI-generated forecasts, no matter how sophisticated, cannot fully account for the unpredictable emotional surges that often define the meme coin market. While the modest and moderate scenarios appear more likely in the absence of dramatic market shifts, the crypto market’s inherently unpredictable nature leaves the door open for a surprise bullish surge. Traders and investors are reminded to approach meme coins with caution, balancing enthusiasm with sound risk management.

If Avalanche’s explosive growth taught investors anything, it’s this: missing out on high-potential early-stage projects can be painfully costly. Avalanche turned early skeptics into overnight millionaires, and now it serves as a textbook case of what happens when you wait too long. As the crypto space braces for the next wave of disruptive projects, Qubetics ($TICS) is rising rapidly—and those in the know are already taking notice. Qubetics is not just another token—it’s a full-scale, interoperable blockchain ecosystem positioned to be a major player in the 2025 cycle. While many projects are still refining their roadmaps, Qubetics is already executing with precision. Its live presale offers investors a rare chance to get in at a strategic time—before full-scale adoption and before the price takes its next leap. With the 2025 mainnet launch approaching fast and stages closing weekly, Qubetics is one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025. Qubetics Is One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in May 2025 If you regret missing out on Qubetics when the presale quietly launched in September 2024, you’re not alone. Early believers picked up $TICS at just $0.01 during those initial phases. Multiple stages have since closed, each offering investors high ROI potential—but not without urgency. The presale is now in its 36th stage at $0.3064 per token. Despite the price rise, this top crypto presale of 2025 is still accessible. With over $17.5 million raised, more than 514 million $TICS tokens sold, and 27,300+ token holders already on board, Qubetics is quickly transforming from a promising newcomer to a formidable force in crypto. It’s one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 not just because of hype, but because it delivers measurable returns and forward-facing innovation. The ROI projections from this point are still astonishing. At $1 post-presale, that’s a 226.32% ROI. Should $TICS hit $5, you’re looking at 1,531.58%. But the real reward is at $10 or $15 after mainnet—where the ROI hits 3,163.16% and 4,794.74%, respectively. For instance, an investment of $2,000 today yields 6,528 tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 post-mainnet, that investment becomes $65,280. This is not just speculation—it’s backed by community-driven growth, a limited token supply, and consistent presale stage performance. Investors seeking substantial returns with managed risk are calling it a “top crypto presale” for a reason. And with each 7-day stage adding a 10% price hike, the urgency cannot be overstated. Qubetics excels where others falter—interoperability. Its core mission is solving blockchain’s fragmented nature. Imagine a supply chain firm using Solana, a payment partner operating on Ethereum, and logistics data secured on Bitcoin. Typically, these ecosystems don’t talk. Qubetics removes that limitation by allowing frictionless transactions and data exchanges between them, offering streamlined, real-time functionality across chains. For small businesses and corporations alike, this is transformative—no need to reconfigure systems or migrate platforms. Just seamless, efficient integration. This approach doesn’t just attract retail investors; it’s drawing enterprise-level attention and solidifying its place among the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 . Avalanche: From Missed Opportunity to Market Titan Avalanche’s story is one of momentum and missed chances. Launched with an ICO price of just $0.50, many disregarded its long-term vision. Yet, as the market matured, Avalanche proved its mettle, hitting an all-time high of $146.22. That’s over 29,000% growth—an unignorable figure for any serious investor. Those early few who backed Avalanche when it was still under a dollar have enjoyed extraordinary gains, setting a benchmark for what’s possible with smart early positioning. Today, it is regarded as one of the major blockchains in the DeFi, gaming, and enterprise spheres. Its success has been driven by real-world scalability, ultra-fast transaction finality, and a well-structured developer ecosystem. Avalanche’s unique consensus mechanism and sub-netting features gave it an edge in user adoption. While the masses waited for validation, early adopters were stacking profits. The takeaway? By the time the mainstream enters, the real money has already been made. As of May 2025, Avalanche stands as proof that belief in the right tech at the right time pays dividends. It’s why investors are now actively scanning the market for what could be the next Avalanche—and many believe Qubetics fits the profile. Conclusion: Your Next Move in the Crypto Race The difference between regret and reward in crypto is timing. While Avalanche had its breakout and proved the value of early conviction, the market now shifts its gaze toward newer, scalable, and highly interoperable solutions. Qubetics is leading that charge. For those looking to make a calculated move this month, it’s not just an option—it’s a standout. It’s one of the top cryptos to invest in May 2025 for both ROI potential and technological edge. The Qubetics presale won’t stay accessible for long. With the current presale ticking through its final stages, you still have a viable entry point before mainnet launch in Q2. This is your chance to join this top crypto presale and align with a project poised to become a foundational layer in the next generation of Web3 infrastructure. Don’t watch another breakout happen from the sidelines. Act now—because the next Avalanche might already be here, and it’s called Qubetics.

45391288,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=739016,1748821161,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45391288.jpeg,Big Tech moves significantly in S&P 500 rally,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/big-tech-reclaims-market-lead-in-sp-500-rally/,"Big tech stocks pushed the S&P 500 near a bear market in early April, but now they are pulling it back up. Last week, Nvidia gave a strong sales outlook for large technology firms, even though Washington still blocks the sale of its most advanced chips to China. Bloomberg reported that shares in Nvidia and Microsoft Corp. are close to their record highs, helping many traders expect that the group will continue to lift the whole market upward. “I feel really good about tech coming out of this earnings season,” said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. “There’s still more gas in this tank.” The S&P 500 now stands roughly 4% below its February peak. Much of the recovery reflects eased trade talks between the United States and its partners as well as quarterly results that showed steady demand for cloud services, software, devices, and digital ads despite the threat of fresh tariffs. Since the index low on 8th April, Tesla Inc. has surged 56%. Nvidia has increased by 40%, and Microsoft is up by 30%. Big Tech Stocks that played a role in S&P 500’s gain. Source: Bloomberg Moreover, Bloomberg’s “Magnificent Seven” index shows Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla, Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. outperformed the broader S&P 500 during the last eight weeks. The shift matters because the seven companies together make up about one-third of the benchmark. Bloomberg data show they have added nearly half of the S&P 500’s 19% climb from its April low. Risks that could stall the rally have not disappeared Even though those seven big tech stocks did well over the past couple of months, they’ve still earned less than the S&P 500 since the start of the year. That’s rare because the “Magnificent Seven” usually outperform the broader market over a full year. Apple and Amazon are the main reasons as both import many finished products and have been hurt by higher tariffs, which has held the group back. “Buying the tech dip will be a theme throughout the year,” Ewing added. “There’s still a lot of money on the sidelines, and it has to be put to work.” Tariffs and other trade measures advanced during Donald Trump’s presidency still cloud the outlook. On Friday, the S&P 500 dropped more than 1% after the president accused China of violating an agreement to ease duties. In a separate report, the United States was said to be preparing tougher limits on China’s technology sector. By the end of trading, the index had recovered most of its losses, but the drop showed how quickly investor sentiment can shift. Another challenge is the high price of Big Tech shares. Bloomberg’s Magnificent Seven index trades at about 30 times expected profits for the next year, while the S&P 500 as a whole trades at roughly 21 times. In April, the overall market’s price-to-earnings ratio was near 18, and it has since climbed above its ten-year average of 18.6. Big tech stocks are trading at high prices. Source: Bloomberg Not every strategist fears that high valuations will halt the advance. Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, expects big technology firms to steer the broader market higher in the second half of 2025, aided by ongoing spending on artificial-intelligence computing. Meta Platforms has lifted its estimate for capital expenditures this year, and Microsoft says it will boost spending in its next fiscal year. Those pledges ease concerns that the companies might trim investments after two years of heavy invesment. “Our view is that earnings could still be maybe flatter but likely have less downside than what we would have thought heading into the earnings season,” Lerner said. Bloomberg Intelligence data show profit forecasts for the Magnificent Seven in 2025 have held steady during the past two months. Analysts still expect the group to deliver about 15% earnings growth, roughly twice the rate projected for the S&P 500. “Investors are going to be drawn back toward these names with secular growth,” Lerner added. “Tech could be that catalyst later on to actually see the market re-accelerate later in the year.” For now, optimism about cloud demand, artificial-intelligence chips, and digital services has pushed tech stocks back into favor and cut the index’s losses since early spring. But because tariff risks persist and valuations are high, this rally still feels fragile. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The TON developers team has guaranteed users that the outage did not impact any funds and that transactions made while the system was down were safe from loss. TON recovers its functionality after suffering a brief outage Blockchain network outages are usually common in high-throughput, high-speed blockchains because of the chains’ high technical complexity. As blockchain networks grow more complex, brief outages may become increasingly common, potentially hindering broader consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies and undermining public trust in the technology. Following the recent brief outage, the developers’ team reported the problem at 12:51:00 UTC and managed to restore network functionality about 40 minutes after they discovered the outage. In an update, the TON developers said they released a quick fix and updated just a few master chain validators, allowing the blockchain to start block production again. According to the team, the issue was caused by a mistake in handling the masterchain dispatch queue. The team also revealed that a full technical report will be published soon to address exactly what caused the issue. Blockchain users have revealed their growing worries as quick-growing blockchain networks processing significant amounts of data experience brief outages frequently. In this instance, TON’s flash reaction helped minimize the damage. As Telegram depends more on TON for its cryptocurrency plans, the network will face greater pressure to remain stable. Everything is back to normal, but concerns about its long-term reliability are expected to arise. TON gains increased institutional investments despite suffering several brief outages Notably, this is not the first brief outage incident. In August 2024, TON suffered several brief outages due to high demand for the DOGS meme coin , which congested the network and caused a chain to stop. The initial outage occurred on August 27 when block production was suspended at workchain block 45,341,899. Network downtime lasted several hours until validators reset their nodes at 4:00 UTC to re-establish network-wide consensus. At 5:30 am UTC, the functionality was briefly restored, and users were allowed to access the network again before the network crashed again hours later. The reason behind the sudden crash was due to excessive users transferring DOGS memecoins on the TON blockchain. The next outage incident occurred on August 28. On that day, TON faced a brief outage, which caused block production to stop at workchain block 45,350,522. This second outage lasted about six hours until it was resolved, with block production resuming on the same day. Even after the brief network outages, TON is gaining retail attention and institutional investment from big digital asset names in the crypto space. Telegram Open Network received $400 million from venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital, Draper Associates, CoinFund, and SkyBridge in March 2025.

NBC News reports that at least three companies that provide insurance and security services for cryptocurrency investors and firms are preparing to offer kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance policies for those with security concerns stemming from their crypto holdings. According to Rebecca Rubenfeld, chief operating officer at the crypto insurance firm AnchorWatch, the fear of violence was a big topic at the annual Bitcoin Conference that was held in Las Vegas last week. “They’re tense. I’m not saying that because I’m trying to sell insurance, but overall, the mood is a very good environment for me.” AnchorWatch is considering offering kidnapping and ransom protection in the coming months. The news comes after a string of reports emerged about the kidnapping of crypto investors. Last month, armed assailants reportedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noiza, the CEO of the French crypto exchange platform Paymium, in Paris. In another incident, three teenagers allegedly stole $4 million worth of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from a man who hosted a crypto-related event in Las Vegas and left him stranded at White Hills, Arizona. And last week in New York City, a kidnapper allegedly tortured and threatened a crypto investor for three weeks to gain access to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet.

Bitcoin’s price held steady above $105,000, while Ethereum’s price was above $2,500. This article provides forecasts for the top three coins like Flare (FLR), Horizen (ZEN), and Cookie DAO (COOKIE). Flare price forecast ahead of a big unlock FLR price chart | Source: TradingView Flare token rose as traders focused on the upcoming token unlock later this week. It will unlock tokens worth over $39 million , equivalent to 3% of the total tokens in circulation. Token unlocks are usually bearish since they introduce new coins in the market, boosting supplies. The daily chart shows that the Flare token price was trading at $0.020 on Monday, a few points higher than the weekend low of $0.01623. It is also about 80% above the lowest point this year. ZEN price has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls remains in control for now. It also formed a hammer candlestick on Friday, which explains why it has risen in the past two days. A hammer comprises of a small body and a long lower wick. Flare price has also formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely rebound, with the next point to watch being at $0.02240, its highest point in May. Horizen price prediction as a wedge forms ZEN price chart | Source: TradingView Horizen token price was trading at $9.955 on Monday morning, up by 55% from its lowest point in April. This recovery is because of the ongoing crypto market rally and demand for privacy coins. Horizen price was hovering between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It has also formed a rising wedge, comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. A wedge is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. This breakdown normally happens when the two lines are about to converge. In ZEN’s case, the two lines have a long way to converge, meaning that the consolidation will continue. The key support and resistance levels are $9 and $12.5. Cookie DAO price forecast Read more: Bitcoin price prediction for June: Will BTC rise or fall in June? Cookie price chart | Source: TradingView Cookie price has done well in the past few weeks as it jumped by 260% from the lowest point in April. This surge has brought the market cap to over $130 million, making it a top player in the BSC Chain network. The eight-hour chart shows that the Cookie price formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation sign. The lower side of this cup is at $0.070, while the upper side is at $0.30. This means that the cup has a depth of about 75%. The recent retreat was part of the formation of the handle section of the cup. Therefore, by measuring 75% from the cup’s upper side, we can estimate the most likely Cookie price prediction at $0.54, which is about 112% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.2100 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading above $105K as Asia begins its business week. The world's largest digital asset remained relatively stable over the weekend, with a 0.4% movement, and trading volume was compressed. While overall market conditions remain bullish, a new report from CryptoQuant suggests that certain metrics indicate the BTC market is “overheating.” The report shows bitcoin demand has climbed to 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days, approaching the December 2024 peak of 279,000 BTC. At the same time, whale-held balances have risen by 2.8 percent, a pace that often signals slowing accumulation. These indicators suggest the current rally, which pushed prices to a record $112,000, may be nearing a short-term top. The report highlights $120,000 as the next major resistance level, tied to the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, where unrealized profits would hit 40 percent, a threshold that has historically marked local tops. While CryptoQuant’s ""Bull Score Index"" remains strong at 80, signaling continued bullish momentum, rising profit margins, and peaking demand growth suggest traders may face a period of consolidation before the next leg higher. News Roundup: James Wynn Gets Liquidated, But Says He'll 'Run it All Back' James Wynn, a trader renowned for his aggressive, high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid, has been fully liquidated, leaving him with just $23 in his account after sustaining losses totaling more than $17 million, CoinDesk previously reported. Wynn, who attracted significant attention with trades involving bitcoin, memecoins like PEPE, and even obscure tokens such as FARTCOIN, first faced steep declines from a massive $1.25 billion long position on BTC, resulting in a loss exceeding $37 million after prices dipped below $105,000 amid geopolitical turmoil. Throughout the volatile month, Wynn rapidly cycled through trades, briefly netting an unrealized gain of $85 million before market swings wiped him out completely. An account associated with Wynn downplayed the dramatic liquidation, defiantly stating on X: ""I'll run it back, I always do. And I'll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game. I took a large and calculated bet at making billions."" Brazil's Méliuz Shares Sink 8% After Announcing $78M Equity Raise to Buy Bitcoin Brazilian fintech Méliuz plans to raise up to $78 million through a public equity offering, intending to allocate all proceeds to purchasing Bitcoin and positioning the cryptocurrency as a primary strategic asset in its treasury, CoinDesk previously reported . However, Méliuz’s strategy hasn't impressed the market yet, as shares dropped more than 8% following the announcement. The initial offering includes 17 million common shares, with the potential to expand up to 51 million, and investors will receive subscription warrants allowing future stock purchases at set prices. Known for its cashback and financial services platform serving over 30 million users, Méliuz currently holds 320.2 BTC, having previously committed 10% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in March. Trading for the subscription warrants is expected to commence on June 16, with share settlement and warrant issuance finalized by June 18. NYC Comptroller Rejects Mayor Adams' 'BitBond', Warns Deviating from Dollar Could Undermine City's Credit Reputation New York City's Comptroller Brad Lander sharply criticized Mayor Eric Adams' plan to issue municipal bonds backed by bitcoin, labeling the proposed ""BitBond"" as ""legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,"" CoinDesk previously reported. Lander rejected the idea just days after Adams introduced it at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, emphasizing that cryptocurrency's instability makes it unsuitable to reliably fund critical city projects such as infrastructure and affordable housing. Mayor Adams has actively promoted cryptocurrency initiatives since entering office, including converting his own paychecks into digital assets and establishing a digital asset advisory council. However, Comptroller Lander highlighted serious practical concerns with the BitBond proposal, noting federal tax laws and city financial regulations would make the proposal unworkable, and warned that deviating from the dollar-based municipal borrowing system could undermine investor confidence and New York City's credit reputation. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin showed resilience, staging a V-shaped recovery between $103,813.37 and $105,305.75 amid notable volume spikes. ETH: Ethereum formed a bullish reversal pattern, rebounding from strong support at $2,472.84 to $2,527.53 amid high-volume buying momentum, according to CoinDesk's Market Insight Bot. Gold: Gold climbed 0.6% to $3,311.66, as traders weighed its recent retreat from record highs against ongoing investor and central bank appetite driven by uncertainty over US tariffs and broader economic risks. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.89% as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed following Trump's announcement of increased steel tariffs.

Both leading candidates, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have made crypto a central part of their campaigns. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential race, has proposed legalizing spot crypto exchange-traded funds and even allowing the nation’s $884 billion pension fund to invest in crypto. The ETF push is backed by his conservative rival, suggesting rare bipartisan alignment on the potential digital-asset policy. His opponent, Kim Moon-soo from the conservative People Power Party, has also voiced support for the digital asset industry. Kim has vowed to remove barriers so banks can work with crypto exchanges. He also advocates lowering taxes for small investors and entrepreneurs profiting from their crypto. Such bipartisan agreement is uncommon in South Korean politics. But it speaks to the increasing power of crypto in the country. With over 18 million people, over a third of the population, who engage in digital asset trading, it is clear that crypto is now a serious political force. South Korean regulators tighten crypto rules to protect investors The South Korean crypto scene has seen both highs and lows. The greatest blow arrived in 2022 when the TerraUSD stablecoin project imploded. Led by South Korean developer Do Kwon, the failure wiped out more than $40 billion in value, devastating retail investors and fueling a public outcry. In retaliation, the Virtual Asset User Identity Protection Act was passed and came into force in July 2024 with razing provisions for crypto exchanges. Under the law, operators are required to hold at least 80% of user deposits in offline cold wallets, maintain insurance, and develop a plan for possible hacks or system crashes. Exchanges themselves are also subject to tough penalties for fraud, with executives facing life sentences. Meanwhile, regulators are preparing new rules to oversee the stablecoin market, driven by concerns over capital flight through foreign-pegged assets like USDT and USDC. South Korea’s exchanges had outflows of 56.81 trillion won in the first three months of 2025, almost half of which were in dollar-backed stablecoins. Lee Jae-Myung suggested launching a won-backed stablecoin. He said it could modernize South Korea’s financial system and help keep money from leaving the country. But the idea is encountering pushback. The central bank says that only regulated institutions — not private companies — should be able to issue stablecoins pegged to the won. South Korea expands crypto opportunities South Korea is already one of the world’s most active crypto markets . On some days, trading at local crypto exchanges exceeds that on the country’s main stock indices, Kospi and Kosdaq. The trend underscores the high profile of digital assets, especially for young investors who believe they are being left behind by traditional finance. The backing of both presidential candidates has renewed optimism in the industry, drawing the attention of venture capitalists, startups, and blockchain developers. Simon Seojoon Kim, chief executive of Seoul-based Hashed Ventures, said that since all major candidates support pro-crypto policies, crypto investors in South Korea are set to benefit regardless of who wins the election. The global backdrop is also giving momentum. Recently, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, signed an executive order to promote cryptocurrencies as dollar-backed stablecoins, Terming it as a mechanism handy to uphold the US financial System. That’s prompted Asian lawmakers, including those in South Korea, to move fast so they don’t get left behind. In selecting pro-crypto leadership, irrespective of party, South Koreans are sending the message: The future of finance is digital. And the country is poised to lead.

45392708,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=739037,1748824383,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45392708.jpeg,Nintendo’s bold retail strategy fuels a strong push for Switch 2 success,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nintendo-ups-switch-2-margins/,"Nintendo Co. is taking an uncommon approach with the distribution of its Switch 2 console in Japan by setting wholesale prices that allow retailers to earn higher profits per unit. According to sources familiar with the plan, store operators are expected to make a gross margin on Switch 2 of about 5% per sale, compared to an informal industry norm of around 2%. Nintendo’s bold retail strategy fuels a strong push for Switch 2 success Nintendo is making a strong push to ensure the success of its next flagship console in its home market. While the Switch 2 will launch globally on June 5 with a price tag of $450 in most regions, the Japan-exclusive version —featuring the Japanese language and intended solely for domestic sale—will be priced at ¥49,980 (roughly $350). The company’s retail strategy aligns with this focus on a strong Japanese launch. Game consoles are typically priced to yield very thin gross margins. Stores make money instead by selling more lucrative bundles with software and add-on peripherals. However, that model is under threat as players increasingly favor buying games online, and accessory makers are paying less for retail distribution as costs rise. Retailers have expressed frustration over shrinking margins, compounded by the fact that newer devices demand more shelf and storage space, increasing operational costs. Yodobashi Camera Co., one of Japan’s largest electronics chains, welcomes video game products as a draw to boost foot traffic. A spokesperson from Bic Camera Inc. declined to comment, while Yamada Denki did not respond to inquiries. Nintendo stated it does not typically discuss its distribution agreements publicly. The improved margin is especially beneficial for brick-and-mortar stores with higher fixed expenses. Sources say this could encourage Japanese retailers to allocate more floor space to the Switch 2 and actively promote it throughout the year. The sources added that this is the first major new console in over a decade to offer retailers a meaningful profit on the hardware itself. Ahead of the launch, retailers have requested that Nintendo ship large quantities to meet what they expect to be overwhelming demand on day one, exceeding current stock levels. Physical game stores have long been a vital part of Nintendo’s business philosophy, forming an integral component of the company’s broader strategy to engage consumers across multiple touchpoints—including amusement parks and game-specific download cards sold at convenience stores in Japan. Nintendo sets ambitious sales targets as Switch 2 pre-orders surge Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million Switch 2 units by the end of March next year, with potential sales exceeding 20 million units depending on production capacity. The multinational video game company released the estimate weeks after pre-orders of the gaming console began. Nintendo postponed pre-sales of the Switch 2 in early April to evaluate the impact of new US import tariffs. When pre-orders eventually launched late last month, gamers reported that retailer websites were overwhelmed by traffic, and many stores sold out of the second-generation console almost immediately. The company’s forecast of selling 15 million Switch 2 units by March next year is based on the assumption that US tariffs remain at April 10 levels. Demand for earlier Switch models has declined, with Nintendo selling 10.8 million units in fiscal year 2025, down from 15.7 million the previous year, according to its latest earnings report. Looking ahead, Nintendo expects to sell 45 million games made specifically for the Switch 2 and 105 million legacy titles. The combined total of 150 million is slightly below the 155 million games sold in fiscal 2025. In its latest fiscal year, Nintendo’s sales dropped 30.3% to 1.16 trillion yen ($8 billion). The company reported that profits also fell 43.2% to 278.8 billion yen ($1.91 billion). Looking ahead, Nintendo expects a strong recovery, forecasting 1.9 trillion yen ($13 billion) in sales and 300 billion yen ($2.06 billion) in profit for fiscal year 2026.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) have got plenty of attention before, their growth seems to be weakening. Consequently, most attention is now on new and revitalized projects that show greater potential for growth. Cardano (ADA) continues to develop its smart contracts and DeFi. However, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has everyone’s attention with its low prices and strong growth outlook, making it one of the best cryptos to buy before prices rise in 2025. Crypto Market Update: SHIB, XRP, and ADA Face Pressure Amid Market Volatility The price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has fallen slightly to $0.00001411. Although whale transactions have sharply decreased over recent weeks, analysts indicate that increased ecosystem development and upcoming burns might create some upside potential. The price of Ripple (XRP) has fallen slightly to $2.26 at the time of writing. Since the SEC considered the WisdomTree XRP ETF, hype and predictions for a 48% swift gain in XRP have grown. At this time, Cardano (ADA) is at $0.739, having dropped about 3.35% from its previous close. ADA and other coins are currently down as bears have taken over the market, a recent analysis shows. Even though well-known cryptocurrencies are dealing with the current challenges of the crypto market, altcoins such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are getting noticed for their attractive earning prospects. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The Mutuum Finance presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06. Early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns when MUTM goes live. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.7 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. The token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency Delivered: Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is not only innovating, it is establishing trust. The platform’s open-source smart contracts have undergone a rigorous, officially completed audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that is engineered to steer clear of pitfalls that have toppled algorithmic stablecoins. Security and transparency are always primary pillars of the ecosystem. Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and especially Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as top cryptos to watch in 2025. MUTM has raised over $9.7 million with 11,500+ investors and offers early buyers up to 100% ROI at its $0.03 presale price before launching at $0.06. Backed by a Certik audit, a hybrid DeFi model, and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM is built for growth. Join now before the next price jump.

With major updates like Pectra and Danksharding in development, the network is working toward faster throughput and deeper utility by 2040. These changes could redefine how developers and users interact with Ethereum. At the same time, Kaspa is gaining traction. Trading at $0.1107, the coin is holding above key support and flashing signs of a potential June rally. Its chart structure points toward upward movement backed by strong technicals. But while Ethereum and Kaspa focus on what is coming, Unstaked ($UNSD) is already delivering. Now in Stage 17 at $0.01043, with a projected launch price of $0.1819 and up to a 2,700% ROI, it is not waiting to create value. Its AI agents are already set to convert engagement into growth. Ethereum’s Scaling Overhaul Could Redefine Its 2040 Potential Ethereum’s future may rest on its ability to balance scalability, decentralization, and security. With upgrades like Pectra on the horizon by late 2025 or early 2026, Ethereum plans to integrate EIP-7702. This would allow regular wallets to function like smart contracts, a shift that could expand how users interact with the network. Further updates, such as PeerDAS and full Danksharding, promise major improvements to transaction throughput. By reducing data costs and enhancing Layer-2 efficiency, Ethereum could one day handle millions of transactions per second. These changes may reduce fees and elevate ETH’s appeal across both developers and institutions. Kaspa Readies for Potential June Surge Above $0.115 Kaspa is flashing bullish signals after rebounding from $0.103 and reclaiming support near $0.1107. The price is currently riding its 200-day moving average on the 4-hour chart while forming consistent higher lows, suggesting upward pressure is building just below the $0.115 resistance level. If Kaspa breaks past this key barrier, the next targets could lie between $0.13 and $0.145, mirroring its late April highs. However, any pullback below $0.103 may see support retested near $0.096. With technicals favoring a push upward, June could mark a critical turning point for KAS momentum. Unstaked’s AI Agents Are the Growth Hack Web3 Has Been Waiting For In the crypto space, catching eyes is easy. Getting those eyes to take action is the real challenge. That is where Unstaked stands apart. This AI-powered platform deploys smart agents that do more than just automate posts. They guide followers into communities, content, and campaigns based on live sentiment and user behavior across Telegram, X, and Discord. These are full-service funnels that never sleep. For solo creators or lean marketing teams, Unstaked turns complex outreach into plug-and-play campaigns. AI agents craft tailored messages, adjust tone in real time, and respond to users in ways that feel personal and timely. The result is hands-free conversion that feels anything but robotic. Currently priced at $0.01043 in Stage 17 of its AI crypto presale , Unstaked presents one of the highest ROI setups in crypto. The projected launch price sits at $0.1819, giving early buyers a potential 2,700% return. Over $8.5 million has already been raised, a signal that serious attention is coming early. These AI agents will only go live after the presale ends and the platform officially launches. Once active, they will be the engine behind scalable, intelligent engagement across Web3. This is more than automation. It is performance without friction. Final Thoughts Ethereum may shape future infrastructure, and Kaspa could be nearing a breakout, but neither offers immediate, live-facing tools like Unstaked. Its AI agents are already streamlining user engagement by transforming passive followers into active community members through smart, behavior-based automation. Now in Stage 17 for $0.01043, Unstaked has raised over $8.5 million and is targeting a 2,700% ROI by launch. While others build toward potential, Unstaked is already delivering. It is not just promising results. It is producing them. And at this price, the window to access that value is still wide open.

They also seek a small amount of equity in the two companies, which are leaders in using generative AI to create music. People familiar with the negotiation, who preferred to stay anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the talks, explained the reasons behind the discussions. They said that major music companies want to let AI startups Udio and Suno use their music, and this deal could set a precedent for how AI firms compensate recording artists for their work. AI companies raise conflict with media companies on copyrighted content Udio and Suno help future music creators by allowing them to enter a description of a sound or song, such as “a modern country ballad about unrequited love,” and then get an audio recording back. To make this happen, the companies must teach their software using large datasets filled with millions of information. This requires a lot of music. The intention raised by AI companies to train their large language models on copyrighted work has sparked a war between AI and media companies. AI companies have fought with major media companies over whether they must pay to train their large language models on copyrighted work. They have argued that the training is permitted under fair use, while rights holders say they need to be paid. The New York Times Co. sued OpenAI, which has struck licensing deals with companies like News Corp., the Associated Press, and Vox Media. To solve this, the music companies and the AI startups are negotiating to find common ground and try to avoid fighting it in court. The talks are unfolding on parallel tracks, providing a race to see whether a label or an AI company will strike a deal first. Complicating the talks is that the labels are pushing for more control over how their work is used. Udio and Suno are looking for a range of flexibility to experiment and look forward to affordable deals suitable for startup companies. Udio and Suno did not respond to requests for comment. The music companies also did not immediately comment. Streaming platforms to end the war between record companies and new technology The music industry has struggled to find the best way to deal with the rise of AI technology. Over the past ten years, sales have increased, but they have not fully bounced back from the harm done in the early days of the Internet when file-sharing sites and piracy severely hurt sales. Record companies have fought against every new technology, including file-sharing, user-generated content, and streaming. For instance, big music companies sued Udio and Suno last year for copyright infringement. The Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group for the major record labels, had sought as much as $150,000 per work infringed in a claim potentially totaling billions of dollars. Streaming platforms like Spotify Technology SA have helped bring life back to the industry. The industry wants to protect its copyrights while also embracing new technologies. Following this, Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA, revealed that the music community has welcomed AI. Glazier further stated that they were already teaming up with responsible developers to create sustainable AI tools that focus on human creativity and allow artists and songwriters to take charge. However, based on his argument, they can only be successful if developers are open to collaborating with them.

After recently hitting a high near $2.47, XRP has struggled to hold steady and has been stuck in a downtrend. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.17, slightly recovering after dipping to a low of $2.13 earlier. The price is battling to stay above the important average level of $2.15, but it hasn’t been easy. Important Levels To Watch Right now, XRP is retesting an important Fibonacci support zone between $2.10 and $2.15. This level has provided strong support in the past, and bulls will need to defend it to prevent further losses. If the price drops below $2.10 and confirms with a daily candle close, things could get worse. In that case, the next support levels to watch would be around $2.05 and then possibly closer to $2.00. A break below $2.00 could be bad news for XRP, with the risk of a fall towards $1.80–$1.70. Resistance on the Way Up On the upside, there’s tough resistance waiting between $2.30 and $2.34, with more sellers likely around $2.44 and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Unless XRP can break through these zones, it’s unlikely to see any strong bullish moves soon. XRP’s recent drop follows broader market weakness. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies also fell and tested key support levels after uncertainty over U.S. tariff news weighed on investor sentiment. However, there’s a silver lining for XRP holders. Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the SEC might be nearing its end, and if the outcome is favorable, it could reshape XRP’s regulatory status. This would be a positive for the token and might give its price a much-needed boost in the near future.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 01:42:21

Perplexity’s advanced AI search and assistant capabilities will be integrated across the tech company’s popular devices as part of the deal. The deal would see Perplexity’s AI assistant app and AI-powered search features preloaded onto Samsung’s handsets and integrated into the tech company’s internet browser. People familiar with the discussion say the two companies also discuss integrating Perplexity’s technology with Samsung’s in-house Bixby virtual assistant. The South Korean firm aims to announce such integrations before the end of 2025 for its Galaxy S26 line of phones, which is expected to go on sale in early 2026. It would play into the trend of bundling Perplexity AI, which would be included as a default assistant choice for Samsung’s high-end mobile devices. While discussions are advanced, some technical and contract details are incomplete. If developed, this collaboration would be one of the most significant AI alliances the phone company has made for device software. Samsung backs Perplexity with major investment Samsung is also a major investor in Perplexity’s existing funding round. Perplexity is nearing the close of its latest financing, which would value the company at about $14 billion and raise about $500 million. The investment will allow the tech firm to reduce its reliance on Google’s services, which have underpinned some of the most important features it’s devices have relied on for years. It will also allow it to work with a wider range of AI partners. Perplexity has just signed a deal with Motorola to put its AI assistant on the new Razr foldable phone, representing the small startup’s first big mobile partnership. Samsung’s participation in Perplexity may drive its audience to millions of devices worldwide. Samsung powers up AI assistants with Perplexity integration If finalized, the deal could alter how millions of people use their Samsung devices. The tech firm’s AI assistant, Bixby, has failed to outshine its rivals, Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri. It would also mean potentially adding Perplexity’s powerful AI to Bixby, which would give Bixby smarter, more comprehensive responses, better search results, and the ability to engage in more human-like conversations. The partnership is also a new sign of a wider trend in the tech industry: Companies are racing to turn consumer electronics and digital experiences into smarter wares with powerful AI assistants. Perplexity has also attracted speculation from Apple, Samsung’s arch-rival. Apple pitched Perplexity as a substitute for or supplement to Google Search or to the AI that underpins Siri. Samsung’s approach mirrors Apple’s, which has built many developer connections for flexible new services. At the same time, buying up Perplexity and incorporating its tech could help the tech company cut dependence on a single AI supplier and offer multiple user options. With the rise of increasingly powerful AI, collaborations like Perplexity and Samsung could define the future of mobile tech. In the next few years, our devices will get smarter, more intuitive, and more personal.

With Cronos integrating Google Cloud AI and Tron amassing serious total value locked, both chains are starting to roar back to life. But it’s Qubetics and its under-the-radar presale expansion that might actually be the story no one’s prepared for. Qubetics has been carving out its place by solving one of the internet’s most basic but unresolved needs: private and decentralized browsing. The project is now entering its 37th presale stage, with over $17.5 million already raised and 514 million tokens sold. It’s part of a new wave of infrastructure-focused platforms pushing past hype and into real-world utility. Among the best altcoins to invest in now, this trio may be offering something beyond speculation: a shot at transformation. A Game-Changing VPN Solution That Earns Its Spot Among the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now Qubetics isn’t following the crowd. Instead, it’s building the Web3 version of what millions already rely on—virtual private networks. Its Decentralized VPN application bridges the gap between user anonymity and blockchain infrastructure, giving users and businesses a robust, censorship-resistant browsing experience. What makes Qubetics especially compelling is that it’s not just about privacy—it’s about composability and control across chains. Take a startup in Eastern Europe launching an NFT marketplace—traditional VPNs may be blocked, data may be logged, and regional firewalls can cripple cross-border partnerships. With Qubetics’ decentralized VPN, that same company can operate freely, connecting via multi-chain protocols without leaving sensitive metadata exposed. Similarly, a freelance dev in Southeast Asia working on DeFi tools for Western protocols can now browse securely and access all development layers without relying on centralized ISPs. What elevates Qubetics to the list of the best altcoins to invest in now isn’t just its application—it’s its role as a full-stack aggregator. As the first Web3 aggregator designed to unite leading blockchains under a single framework, it supports real-time privacy, decentralized identity, and layered routing with minimal latency. This isn’t a rehash of old privacy tools; it’s a next-gen protocol for the cross-chain era. $17.5M Raised and Counting: Why the Qubetics Presale Is One of the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now Stage 37 of the Qubetics presale has officially begun, priced at $0.3370. So far, the platform has raised over $17.5 million, drawing in more than 27,300 token holders and selling 514 million $TICS tokens. Every stage of the presale lasts just 7 days, with the price increasing by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM—a built-in momentum mechanic that continues to boost early traction. Community participants jumping in at this stage could see substantial returns. If $TICS reaches $1 after presale, the current entry yields 196.65% ROI. At $5, the return rockets to 1,383.25%, and at $6, it hits 1,679.90%. For longer-term holders waiting on the Qubetics mainnet launch in Q2 2025, the projections become even more jaw-dropping. A $10 valuation yields 2,866.51% ROI, and at $15, early adopters are looking at 4,349.76%. Here’s what that means for a simple $100 entry at today’s presale price: At $1, that $100 becomes $296.65. At $5, it becomes $1,483.25. And if the token hits $15 post-mainnet, $100 balloons to $4,449.76. That’s why the Qubetics presale continues to attract buzz across blockchain communities and is repeatedly being tagged as the best crypto pre sale opportunity of Q2 2025. In a market driven by hype cycles and short attention spans, Qubetics is setting the tempo with consistent presale mechanics and a sharp focus on actual utility. That’s not noise—it’s a blueprint for breakout momentum. Cronos Taps Into AI With Google Cloud—Is It Quietly Gaining Ground? Cronos has been pushing boundaries again, this time by integrating Google Cloud’s artificial intelligence tools into its developer suite. This move is expected to supercharge its application ecosystem, particularly around gaming and DeFi. According to the Cronos Labs team, AI will be embedded into smart contract deployment tools, providing new levels of automation and reducing time-to-market for dApps. The collaboration doesn’t stop there. Cronos Labs also unveiled support for Generative AI, enabling developers to build adaptive interfaces and chatbot layers for DeFi protocols. This strategy aligns with its larger plan to be the go-to chain for Web3 gaming—a niche that’s rapidly maturing. Combined with a rising number of daily active users and an expanding developer base, Cronos is reclaiming territory lost during the last bear cycle. For participants looking beyond the hype, Cronos’ shift into AI-infused infrastructure shows it’s not sleeping on innovation. It’s positioning itself as a utility-first chain in a market craving smarter execution. While it hasn’t dominated headlines like Solana or Ethereum recently, its focused pivot could be exactly what gives it the staying power needed to rise back up the rankings. Tron Quietly Builds On Its $8 Billion DeFi Empire Tron has long been underestimated, often labeled as a legacy Layer 1 with fading influence. But that narrative is beginning to crumble. As of this month, Tron boasts over $8 billion in total value locked (TVL), making it one of the most entrenched ecosystems in decentralized finance. What’s especially impressive is that this figure was achieved with minimal institutional hype or retail-driven rallies. The real kicker? Tron now leads in stablecoin dominance, particularly with USDT on-chain transfers, which surpass even Ethereum in volume. The chain’s reliability, low fees, and deep liquidity pools have made it the backbone for stablecoin transactions across Asia, Latin America, and parts of the Middle East. And with BitTorrent Chain expanding interoperability, Tron is widening its network effect without altering its core thesis. For those tracking the best altcoins to invest in now, Tron deserves renewed attention—not for a flashy new feature, but for its relentless consistency. It’s become a quiet cornerstone for many cross-border, dollar-denominated DeFi operations. And in crypto, consistency often beats charisma when the next bull run comes calling. Final Verdict: The Best Altcoins to Invest in Now Aren’t Always the Loudest So where do things stand? Qubetics is building toward utility dominance with a decentralized VPN that could transform how people access the internet. Cronos is going all-in on AI integration with Google Cloud, expanding its ecosystem’s depth and use cases. Meanwhile, Tron continues to be the dark horse of DeFi, anchoring global stablecoin liquidity and building long-term. Each has its strengths. But Qubetics’ momentum—from its Sunday price hikes to a $17.5 million presale—puts it in a unique lane. Its approach to decentralized infrastructure and Web3 aggregation positions it as more than a token—it’s a toolkit. And with real ROI potential, it’s hard to ignore what it offers compared to other crypto presale contenders. For early adopters scanning the horizon, Qubetics may well be the best crypto pre sale out there. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics one of the best altcoins to invest in now? Its decentralized VPN, presale structure, and high ROI potential make Qubetics a standout utility-driven altcoin. How does Cronos’ Google Cloud partnership impact its growth? It brings AI-powered tools to developers, enhancing dApp deployment, UX, and scalability. Why is Tron still relevant in the 2025 crypto market? With $8B TVL and dominance in USDT transfers, Tron remains essential to global DeFi transactions.

Recently, Pi Network has become the talk of the crypto space after getting listed on MEXC, one of the popular crypto exchanges. But while the listing was big news, the coin’s price has been on a wild roller coaster, leaving investors unsure about what comes next. Right now, Pi Network’s price is stuck around $0.64. Even with all the recent excitement, it hasn’t managed to break past the strong resistance level at $1. Many experts believe that until it crosses this barrier, it’ll be tough for the coin to attract fresh investor confidence. But if it manages to stay above that mark and climb past $0.85, there’s a chance it could rally toward $1 or even $1.15. Wil Pi Network Price Hit $0.40? According to analyst Dr Altcoin, the price of Pi is likely to keep dropping until the end of August. The analyst believes that unless the Pi Core Team changes its approach and becomes more transparent, things may get worse before they get better. Dr Altcoin has been warning about Pi Network’s price situation for a while. In his latest comment, he mentioned that the token could possibly fall as low as $0.40 in the coming weeks. He said that one of the biggest problems holding Pi Network back is the lack of openness from the team behind the project. “No investor wants to put their money into something where the founders refuse to be transparent,” said Dr Altcoin. The price of Pi will likely continue to decline until the end of August, after which it may slowly start to recover. I previously predicted it could drop to $0.40—unless the Pi Core Team becomes transparent. No investor wants to put money into something where the founders refuse… pic.twitter.com/KEvAwOyhX9 — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) May 28, 2025 Despite these short-term struggles, Pi Network seems focused on building for the future.

The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.40. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.220 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.1250 level. The next major support is near the $2.080 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.080 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.050 support. The next major support sits near the $2.00 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

Judge Analisa Torres, who has been overseeing the case, has rejected a joint request from both Ripple and the SEC that aimed to wrap up the lawsuit once and for all. This latest move means the fight isn’t over yet. The rejected filing was meant to adjust the penalty terms against Ripple and then clear the way for both sides to pull back their appeals. But Judge Torres wasn’t having it. Does XRP Have Legal Clarity? To add to the drama, there’s been a fresh claim doing the rounds online suggesting “XRP has no legal clarity” and lacks institutional backing. The post claimed no major CBDCs run on XRPL, and that only Bitcoin is part of the U.S. reserve. This didn’t sit well with pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who fired back hard. He called it “the biggest lie I’ve seen in crypto this year,” reminding everyone that Judge Torres already ruled XRP itself is not a security. And importantly — the SEC didn’t appeal that part of the decision. This is a lie. XRP has been found by a judge not itself to be a security. The SEC Appeal did not challenge that finding. To say XRP has no legal clarity is the biggest lie I have seen in crypto this year. https://t.co/6x1AycUxja — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 1, 2025 When someone argued that the judge’s comments were only dicta (a legal term for remarks not legally binding), Bill Morgan responded firmly, saying that even a dicta provides a degree of legal clarity. He explained that the reasoning used by Judge Torres is persuasive authority in court — and said that no court has found XRP to be a security, adding, “It has more judicial clarity than Bitcoin, which has none.” What’s Next for XRP? Despite the legal tussles, most experts believe a final resolution is still on the horizon. The rejected filing doesn’t impact XRP’s existing legal clarity or standing, and while the SEC and Ripple will have to revisit their penalty talks, the case’s key outcomes remain unchanged.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 03:43:16

The price is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $160 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $160 resistance zone. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price failed to continue higher above the $172 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace and traded below the $160 support level. The price even traded below the $155 level. A low was formed near $150 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $155 level. It surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $180 swing high to the $150 low. Solana is now trading below $160 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $160 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $165 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $180 swing high to the $150 low. The main resistance could be $170. A successful close above the $170 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $172. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $155 zone. The first major support is near the $152 level. A break below the $152 level might send the price toward the $145 zone.

Neither the bitcoin BTC market nor the tech community is impressed. One of the key features of the new offering is that it's built on a programming language called Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption. While it sounds exciting, the crypto community is not particularly psyched, raising doubts about what exactly it means. ""Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption. This is like saying, we decided to run our rocket on water, since NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen,"" Ian Miers, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, said on X . Encryption refers to the process of scrambling data so that only authorised parties with the correct keys can unscramble and read it. However, transactions executed on the Bitcoin blockchain aren't encrypted but are signed. In fact, all data shared between Bitcoin nodes is unencrypted, allowing total strangers to interact with the network. ""Needless to say ""Bitcoin style"" and ""Rust"" are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app. Also, unless encrypted DMs are only in app, odds are they aren't just in Rust,"" Miers said . Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat near $105,000, having dropped over 3% last week, according to CoinDesk data. Other key features of the new offering include end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and the ability to send any type of file, including audio and video files, without a phone number across all platforms.",Tech|Bitcoin|Elon Musk|Encryption|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-02 03:54:34

At the time of writing, XRP ( XRP ) is trading at $2.17, down 1.2% over the past 24 hours and 6% over the past week. Over the previous seven days, the token has traded between a narrow range of $2.11 and $2.35, indicating that the market is uncertain of its next course. Volume data supports the caution. With $1.51 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours, XRP has seen a nearly 37% decrease in activity compared to the previous day, indicating a slowdown in spot market activity. The derivatives market also saw declining volumes. According to Coinglass data , XRP futures volume fell 37.85% to $2.97 billion, while open interest dipped 3.39% to $3.90 billion. While short-term sentiment cools, institutional interest in XRP is quietly accelerating. On May 29, Coinbase Institutional announced it will launch 24/7 trading access to XRP and Solana ( SOL ) futures for U.S. investors starting June 13. https://twitter.com/coinbaseinsto/status/1928219019045191811?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The move follows the company’s April rollout of CFTC-regulated XRP futures through Coinbase Derivatives. Coinbase described the product as a capital-efficient method for gaining exposure to “one of the most liquid digital assets” and is now building toward continuous market access to match crypto’s round-the-clock rhythm.

Also on May 29, the firm announced a Q3 rollout of an institutional XRP lending platform aimed at public companies listed on the New York Sock Exchange and Nasdaq. The platform will provide futures-hedged, asset-backed loans, with all contracts tracked on-chain through the XRP Ledger. ACG will buy up to $10 million worth of XRP to support the initiative and manage volatility with Chicago Mercentile Exchange futures. Despite this institutional backdrop, technicals remain cautious. The token hovers just above the lower Bollinger Band near $2.12, with the midline at $2.34 now acting as resistance. At 40.82, the relative strength index is getting close to oversold territory without yet indicating a reversal. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Except for the 200 estimated moving average, which is still supportive, moving averages across all major timeframes flash sell signals. This indicates that although XRP is still above its long-term trend floor, it’s currently in a medium-term correction phase. The moving average convergence divergence, which is below the signal line with a negative value of -0.027, supports the short-term bearish bias. Immediate support lies at $2.12. A breakdown below this level could open the way to test the psychological $2.00 level, with stronger structural support near $1.91–$1.95 based on historical consolidation. On the upside, the first resistance is at the 20-day simple moving average around $2.34, followed by the upper Bollinger Band at $2.56.

However, many X Users have dismissed these claims as baseless, as there is no official evidence to back them. Massive Market Crash To Follow? Some experts believe that the crypto market will see a parabolic run if the Fed Chair resigns, but any such event is unlikely as of now. However, if it were to happen, the financial markets would see a massive crash. This is because a sudden loss of leadership at the Federal Reserve would damage confidence in both the U.S. dollar and the broader economy.

Polymarket betters are also not buying the Powell resignation rumors. Despite the discussion on X, the odds on the Polymarket contract “Will Trump remove Jerome Powell in 2025?” held steady at 12%. Just recently, Trump summoned Powell to the White House and criticised him for not cutting the interest rates. But Powell was firm on his decision, saying that the policy decisions will be based on economic data and not politics. The Fed has held rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50% for a third straight meeting. Although Trump continues to push for rate cuts , in a recent interview, he said he has no plans to fire Powell, noting he’ll be able to replace him soon anyway, saying, “it’s in a very short period of time.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Supreme Court Says Donald Trump Can’t Fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell , Bitcoin Shows Resilience Recently, the US Dollar crashed to a three-year low, and Wall Street was trading in red.

The total spend for the purchase came to 16.89b yen, equivalent to roughly $118m, pushing its cumulative Bitcoin holdings to 8,888 BTC. The latest acquisition, disclosed on Monday, is part of Metaplanet’s aggressive shift from its origins as a budget hotel operator to a Bitcoin-first corporate treasury model. That strategy, launched in 2024, has fueled both a meteoric rise in its share price and heightened scrutiny from hedge funds. CEO Simon Gerovich recently remarked that Metaplanet had become Japan’s most shorted stock , warning that betting against Metaplanet is like betting against Bitcoin. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC* pic.twitter.com/X2clAIKNbR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 Aggressive Bond Issuances Fuel Metaplanet’s Rapid BTC Accumulation To fund its crypto purchases, the company has been tapping capital markets at speed. On May 29, Metaplanet issued $21m through its 17th series of zero-coupon, non-interest-bearing bonds. This followed a $50m bond issuance slightly earlier. Proceeds from both have gone directly into Bitcoin acquisitions. Metaplanet now holds Bitcoin acquired at an average price of 13.76m yen per coin, or about $96,300, totaling 122.27b yen, which translates to about $856m. In just over two months, its holdings have soared from 4,046 BTC at the end of March to 8,888 BTC by early June, more than doubling its position. Metaplanet Cements Its Bitcoin-Centric Strategy With BTC Yield Up 66% The company tracks performance using a proprietary metric called BTC Yield. This measures Bitcoin accumulation per fully diluted share. Between April and June, BTC Yield rose 66.3%. This followed a sharp 95.6% jump in the previous quarter. When converted to yen, and then to dollars, the gains show the impact of Metaplanet’s strategy on shareholder value. This comes despite the dilutive effect of new equity issuance. In Dec. 2024, Bitcoin was formally made a core business vertical. Since then, Metaplanet has steadily pursued its vision through aggressive capital deployment. Now, as one of Asia’s boldest corporate adopters of Bitcoin, the company shows no signs of slowing down.

That development comes as the global crypto industry recorded a sharp decline in losses from digital hacks during May, with a single $223 million breach on decentralized exchange Cetus accounting for the vast majority of thefts. Crypto Crime Wave Hits France as 25 Charged Over String of Kidnapping Attempts French prosecutors have charged 25 individuals, six of them minors, in connection with a wave of attempted kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and their families, marking one of the most alarming crackdowns yet on crypto-related crime in Europe. The charges stem from multiple coordinated plots to abduct prominent figures in France’s digital asset sector, according to a May 31 statement by the Paris public prosecutor’s office. The group, aged between 16 and 23, faces serious charges including attempted kidnapping, assault, and organized criminal conspiracy. Le Monde first reported the development, citing sources familiar with the sprawling investigation that spans multiple cities and countries of origin. Failed Paris Kidnapping Sparks Major Probe The investigation was catalyzed by a high-profile kidnapping attempt on May 13 in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. The targets were the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of the longstanding French crypto exchange Paymium. In disturbing scenes caught on widely circulated video, four masked assailants violently attacked Noizat’s daughter, her husband, and their young child. All three victims sustained minor injuries and received treatment in hospital. Police believe the attackers aimed to use the victims as leverage to extract private keys or access to significant cryptocurrency holdings. This attack followed an earlier failed attempt on May 12 and was swiftly followed by another foiled plot outside Nantes, underscoring what officials now say is a coordinated campaign. According to officials, the 25 suspects hail from a wide array of regions, including the Paris area, Châtellerault, Senegal, Angola, and Russia. While some have been described as opportunistic criminals, others are believed to have acted under the direction of a still-unidentified leadership structure. Eighteen of the accused are currently in pre-trial detention. Three have requested a deferred hearing, while four remain under strict judicial supervision. The alarming rise in crypto-targeted kidnappings has put the industry on edge. The failed May attacks are the latest in a series of high-stakes criminal operations targeting crypto figures across France. In January, Ledger co-founder David Balland and his partner were abducted in an attack that drew national outrage. On May 1, another case made headlines when the father of a known crypto millionaire was kidnapped. Investigators now believe this event is directly linked to the same network behind the Noizat family attacks. Although authorities have apprehended several low-level operatives and logistics coordinators, the masterminds of these plots remain at large. Crypto Industry Rallies for Protection The escalating threat has triggered swift government and industry responses. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with key crypto stakeholders in mid-May to discuss national security implications and public safety strategies. Following the meeting, the Interior Ministry announced a series of enhanced protective measures, including collaboration between police, gendarmerie units, and crypto firms to perform residential security audits for high-risk individuals. The surge in violence has created a niche for specialized services in the crypto industry. According to a report by NBC News, at least three insurance firms are developing kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies specifically for crypto holders, aiming to mitigate the unique risks faced by wealthy investors in the sector. Meanwhile, private security companies are also seeing a spike in demand. Infinite Risks International, a Netherlands-based security firm, recently reported a significant increase in contracts from crypto executives and investors seeking personal protection. A Global Pattern Emerges Though France is currently in the spotlight, the pattern of targeted physical attacks on crypto figures is not isolated. Similar incidents have been reported in the United States, the United Kingdom, and various parts of Asia. Analysts warn that as digital wealth becomes more common—and more easily tracked via blockchain forensics—criminals may increasingly resort to physical coercion, bypassing traditional cybersecurity barriers. In France, the crypto community is on high alert as the investigations continue. Prosecutors, meanwhile, are racing to uncover the full extent of the conspiracy and determine who is truly pulling the strings. Crypto Hack Losses Fall Sharply in May as Industry Tightens Security Meanwhile, after a turbulent start to the year marked by billion-dollar breaches, May 2025 delivered a rare moment of relief for the crypto sector. Losses from crypto hacks fell significantly during the month, even though a single devastating incident accounted for nearly 90% of the total amount stolen. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, approximately 20 major hacking events were recorded in May, with combined losses amounting to $244.1 million. This figure marks a 39.29% drop from April and shows the ongoing efforts by exchanges, decentralized protocols, and cybersecurity providers to shore up vulnerabilities across the industry. Feb 2025 recorded the largest crypto hack losses this year (Source: PeckShield ) Cetus DEX Breach Dominates May’s Crypto Theft Landscape The most consequential incident of the month occurred on May 22, when decentralized exchange Cetus, which operates on the Sui Network, was exploited in a sophisticated attack resulting in user losses of approximately $223 million within a single day. According to blockchain analysis firm Dedaub, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in the most significant bits (MSB) check of the protocol. The exploit allowed bad actors to inflate the value of liquidity pool parameters by several magnitudes, creating disproportionately large positions with minimal input, effectively gaming the protocol’s mechanics in their favor. Fortunately, the response from Cetus and the Sui Network was swift. PeckShield confirmed that $157 million of the stolen funds — roughly 71% — have since been frozen, offering hope that some portion of user losses may be recoverable. While the Cetus breach dominated headlines, several smaller but still significant attacks were also recorded in May. The second-largest incident targeted the DeFi platform Cork Protocol, where attackers siphoned off around 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH) — valued at about $12 million — by exploiting a vulnerability in the platform’s smart contract infrastructure. Cybersecurity firm Cyvers, which tracked the attack, said the stolen wstETH was rapidly converted into regular Ether (ETH), potentially complicating recovery efforts. Other notable attacks during the month included: A suspected North Korean (DPRK)-linked breach resulting in $5.2 million in losses. An MBU token exploit that drained $2.2 million. A MapleStory Universe breach costing $1.2 million. These incidents brought May’s total tally to just under a quarter-billion dollars. Despite the scale of individual attacks, especially Cetus, the overall downward trend offers a glimmer of optimism for the embattled crypto security space. January to May: A Year of High-Stakes Crypto Crime Even with the recent decline, 2025 remains on track to be one of the most damaging years for crypto security breaches. According to PeckShield data, more than $1.63 billion was stolen in Q1 alone. The most devastating incident to date was the Bybit exploit in February, which accounted for over $1.5 billion in losses and remains one of the most costly crypto hacks in history. January saw comparatively modest losses of $87 million, but the sharp spike in February served as a wake-up call for the entire industry, prompting new risk protocols, security audits, and inter-agency collaboration. As attackers grow more sophisticated, the crypto industry is also evolving. Exchanges and DeFi platforms have increasingly turned to on-chain monitoring, automated alerts, and proactive protocol hardening to mitigate damage and respond in real time. On May 31, BitMEX’s internal security team successfully uncovered operational flaws within the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-linked hacking syndicate believed to be behind numerous crypto heists. The BitMEX counter-operations reportedly exposed IP addresses, databases, and even tracking algorithms used by the group, a breakthrough that could aid future takedowns or defensive strategies. In addition, more security collaborations are forming between blockchain firms and traditional insurers. As crypto becomes increasingly mainstream, insurance companies are now rushing to develop tailored kidnap-and-ransom (K&R) policies and theft protection for digital asset holders and platforms. Cautious Optimism for the Months Ahead While May’s sharp drop in total theft may offer a temporary reprieve, cybersecurity experts caution against complacency. Still, the rapid freezing of funds in the Cetus case and the visible clampdown on state-linked actors suggest that the crypto industry’s security infrastructure is beginning to mature — albeit under heavy pressure. With billions in assets at stake and an evolving threat landscape, the coming months will test whether these new strategies can meaningfully tilt the balance away from cybercriminals.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-02 05:00:00

According to data from CryptoQuant, the total amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) held across all centralized exchanges decreased to just under 2.5 million BTC as of late May 2025. This steady drop has been accompanied by a strong price rally, with Bitcoin most recently reaching a new all-time high above $111,500. The data indicates a significant divergence between exchange reserves and prices. While the quantity of Bitcoin held on exchanges has been declining, its value has increased. On the CryptoQuant chart, this is illustrated by a white line moving upward for price, and a blue line sloping downward for reserves. Bitcoin price vs. exchange reserves. Credit: CryptoQuant Historically, a declining supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has driven up prices, particularly when demand is high. This is seen by many analysts as an indication that the market may be about to enter a new phase, where sharper moves in either direction are fueled by limited supply.

From a technical perspective, Bitcoin appears to be in a wait-and-see phase. Momentum indicators are mixed. The relative strength index stands at 52, showing neutral momentum, while the moving average convergence divergenc has turned slightly bearish.

The rally may continue toward $110,000 or higher if Bitcoin is able to recover its short-term moving average of around $106,000.

He calls it a “whole new architecture.” On Sunday, Musk teased the launch of XChat, an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform. The feature would include disappearing messages and audio/video calling “without a phone number across all platforms.” “All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file,” he wrote to his 220 million followers. “Also, audio/video calling.” All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file.

This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2025 Rust is a programming language known for its speed, memory safety and concurrency. The new architecture applies encryption methods similar to those used in Bitcoin. XChat: Enhances Privacy, Aligns With Musk’s Vision X (formerly Twitter) initially added its encrypted messaging feature in May 2023 for paid users. To X’s credit, it accompanied the new feature with an article on its help centre , breaking down the new feature’s strengths and weaknesses with unusual transparency. “We’re not quite there yet, but we’re working on it,” Musk said at the time. However, X paused the feature last week in order to focus on “making some improvements,” perhaps linked to the launch of XChat. Further, the feature aligns with Musk’s ambitious “ everything app ” vision, similar to China’s WeChat. With the launch, Musk appears to push for a more decentralized version. XChat is already accessible to some paid users on X. “It’s been a few days since Elon Musk is back in the office and we see that XChat is being rolled out to some users,” Nima Owji, an independent app researcher and web developer, wrote on X.

The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against six major peers, is currently trading at 99.15 (a 0.11% drop) at the time of publication. The greenback has been fluctuating for weeks following Trump’s heightened trade war, dropping when an increase in tensions sparks concerns of a potential U.S. recession. The dollar started the week lower after Trump mentioned late on Friday that he plans to double tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to 50% from Wednesday.

The dip is steady since… pic.twitter.com/elInPDQ8k7 — Anti-Catturd (@AntiCatturd) June 2, 2025 The dollar dropped 0.3% to 143.57 yen at the time of publication, giving some of its more than 1% gains from last week. The euro jumped 0.2% to $1.1372, and sterling gained 0.3% to $1.3489. The Australian dollar also added 0.3% to $0.6454, while the dollar dropped 0.2% on the Canadian dollar to 1.3727. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.4% and Nasdaq futures lost 0.5%. The S&P 500 increased by 6.2% in May, while the Nasdaq added 9.6%, hoping the final import levies would be lower than the initial high levels. “The greenback remains near the lower end of its post-2022 range and considerably weaker than interest rate differentials would imply. Sentiment around the greenback remains negative, and it continues to look vulnerable to further bad news on the fiscal and trade policy fronts.” -Jonas Goltermann, Deputy Chief Markets Economist at Capital Economics. The U.S. dollar has had weekly drops of 3% against major peers in the days after the April 2 Liberation Day tariffs and 1.9% two weeks ago, when Trump threatened 50% tariffs on Europe. The President changed course last week and pushed his deadline on the bloc from June 1 to July 9 following talks with the EU’s President Ursula von der Leyen. The greenback rose 0.3% last week after the talks with the European Union resumed, and a U.S. trade court blocked Trump’s levies because he overstepped his authority. An appeals court later reinstated the tariffs a day later as it considered the case, and Trump’s administration said it had other avenues to implement the duties if it lost in court. Trump’s tariffs face rejection from U.S. court and Senate I just reintroduced H.R. 899, a one sentence bill to TERMINATE the federal department of education and return power back to teachers and parents. This is it, the entire bill: pic.twitter.com/2dLYVE9Iwn — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) January 31, 2025 Bruce Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan , argued that the court ruling would implicate the path ahead in trade policy. He also believes an ample set of provisions remains available to the administration to deliver its desired results. Kasman revealed a commitment to maintaining a minimum U.S. tariff rate of at least 10% and imposing further sector tariff increases. He noted that an increase in ASEAN to discourage transshipment looks likely, and the bias for higher tariffs on U.S.-EU trade persists. The greenback has also faced fiscal concerns in recent weeks in the wake of a broad selloff theme that has seen dollar assets from stocks to Treasury bonds plummeting. The worries gained interest this week as the Senate began considering Trump’s sweeping tax cut and spending bill, adding an estimated $3.8 trillion to the federal government’s $36.2 trillion debt over the next decade. Many senators are considering major revisions to the bill, and Trump said he welcomes changes. Barclays analysts also believe that the fate of section 899 of the bill could be crucial. They said in a research report that S899 would give the U.S. free rein to tax companies. The analysts also believe that investors from countries deemed to have unfair foreign taxes could be considered a tax on U.S. capital accounts when investor nervousness towards U.S. assets has grown. The bank added that actively reducing foreigners’ total return on their U.S. investments would dent inflow and weigh the dollar.

In a video captioning “XRP PRICE PREDICTION (Everything Just Changed!!!),” Steph closely examined XRP’s multi-year price patterns and indicated that the asset may be nearing the end of a prolonged consolidation phase. The analysis points to technical parallels between the current XRP market structure and the price activity observed during the 2017 bull run. In the video, Steph analyzed the monthly XRP chart, indicating that each candlestick represented a full month of price action. While short-term volatility was acknowledged, the focus was placed on the broader trends visible on higher timeframes. Steph noted that XRP has traded within a relatively narrow range between $1.60 and $3.40 for approximately 175 days. The current price, as mentioned in the video, stood at $2.19 at the time of recording. #XRP PRICE PREDICTION (Everything Just Changed!!!) pic.twitter.com/C9T4P2NkY3 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 31, 2025 Consolidation Pattern Mirrors Historical Setups Highlighting a key technical observation, Steph identified that XRP has remained in a sideways movement since December 2024. This stagnation follows a long period of similarly indecisive market behavior. According to the analysis, XRP has exhibited a trend of establishing higher lows since bottoming out during the bear market in June 2022. This pattern of higher lows aligns with previous bullish setups in the asset’s history. Steph then drew a detailed comparison between the current cycle and the 2017 bull market. During that earlier period, XRP experienced a large initial move upward, followed by a lengthy sideways range lasting 203 days. That phase concluded with a sharp upward breakout, resulting in an approximately 15-fold increase in value. By comparison, the current consolidation phase has lasted 175 days so far, raising the possibility of a similar breakout occurring within the next few weeks if historical patterns hold. Elliott Wave Structure Suggests One Final Leg Up The analysis further explored the full-time structure of prior cycles. From June 2022, XRP has spent roughly 750 days in what Steph called a “choppy, strange” trading pattern. A similar prolonged sideways trend preceded the 2017 surge, which lasted 931 days before the price experienced a dramatic rise. These similarities, according to Steph, suggest a strong probability that XRP is in the final stages of accumulation before a move higher. An Elliott Wave count was also applied to both the current price structure and that of the 2017 cycle. Steph explained that XRP appears to be in wave four of a five-wave impulse move, with one final wave remaining. In 2017, the fifth wave concluded with a substantial peak. Based on this model, the current chart could be poised for a fifth wave that aligns with a broader market top. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bull Run Projection Targets $26 to $30 Range If a move similar to the one in 2017 occurs, a 15x increase from the current range could place XRP around the $26 level. Steph noted that this estimate aligns closely with their broader bull run target of approximately $30 for XRP. Although no prediction was stated as certain, the analysis suggested that multiple technical indicators point to the likelihood of another upward leg in XRP’s market cycle. The video also covered the state of the broader crypto market. According to Steph, the crypto fear and greed index remained in “greed” territory, but could reset slightly in the short term. A brief dip or further sideways movement may occur before any potential upward move. However, Steph’s view remains optimistic in the long term. Final Observations and Market Outlook Closing the analysis, Steph emphasized that XRP is approaching a key inflection point. A breakout, while not guaranteed, is described as probable based on historical technical signals. While acknowledging that market interest has diminished in recent months, the analyst maintained that the current phase could represent a final opportunity before a potential major move.

Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges keeps dropping, hinting that a supply squeeze could be on the way. Meanwhile, Bitcoin dominance is easing, and Ethereum is holding firm around $2,700 — both signs that altcoins might rally next. After grabbing headlines with a record-breaking surge above $111,000, Bitcoin has cooled off to around $105,000. This pullback could open the door for altcoins to step up. Altcoin Golden Cross Could Trigger a Massive Rally Analysts have observed that the Altcoin Golden Cross has appeared again – a bullish signal that happens when a short-term moving average (like the 50-day) crosses above a long-term moving average (like the 200-day). In 2021, this pattern led to a massive altcoin rally. So, an explosive altcoin run could be starting soon. ALTCOIN GOLDEN CROSS HAPPENED AGAIN In 2021, it triggered a 5,000% alts rally.

So, I'm going all-in on these 7 alts with 1000x potential pic.twitter.com/Flrydo1cfl — Pepesso (@0xPepesso) May 31, 2025 One popular analyst has said that the altcoin bear market is ending, and the biggest crypto bull run ever is coming. This cycle is completely different and could last 1–3 years. The message is to stay patient and hold, as the real altcoin rally hasn’t started yet. Analysts at Altcoin Buzz have listed four altcoins that could rally in June: Altcoin 1: Toncoin The biggest catalyst for TON is that it is a headline sponsor at the NFC conference in Lisbon (June 4–6), and so, major announcements could be expected. But the token has an unlimited token supply, which could concern some investors. Analyst Ali Martinez recently shared that TON is forming a triangle pattern, setting the stage for a 40% breakout. Altcoin 2: Virtual Protocol Next up is Virtual Protocol. It is a rising star in the AI launchpad space, up 60% over the past month and nearly 2000% over the past year. To access launches, users stake VIRTUAL, earn points, and pledge them to new projects. Its momentum is strong, and interest is rising. The platform can be a bit complex, but the team plans to release tutorials soon. Altcoin 3: Quant Network Quant Network is solving one of crypto’s biggest problems: blockchain interoperability. QNT has solid tokenomics with all its tokens in circulation, and is up 50% in the past month. With a market cap of $1.5 billion, it has a lot of room to grow. Altcoin 4: Near Protocol Lastly, Near Protocol. Near is an AI-focused Layer 1 blockchain that’s fast, scalable, and developer-friendly. It uses Nightshade sharding to speed up performance and has a unique MPC network that allows cross-chain transactions with no bridges or wallet switching needed. Currently priced at $2.60, it has a $3.17 billion market cap.

The transaction, flagged by blockchain analysts and tracked by platforms such as Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence, has sparked a wave of speculation across the crypto community. The funds appear to have passed through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service, rather than more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that two dormant addresses, active as far back as 2014 and 2019, deposited large sums into Jambler between April and May. These deposits coincided with the transfer to Ulbricht’s wallet, casting doubt on theories that the donation was a self-transfer from hidden pre-arrest funds. Update: Few entities regularly use Jambler in size so I found a potential demix for the donation. 1Mp5hH originates from late 2014 exchange activity. 1CNDW has 2019 exchange activity and was previously flagged in compliance tools. 1Mp5hH & 1CNDW were depositing in size to… — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 2, 2025 ZachXBT Links Ross Ulbricht Donation to Flagged Bitcoin Address According to ZachXBT, the donation likely was not a self-transfer as some had speculated, though it appears to have originated from a “questionable source.” The unusually large size of the gift, coupled with its obscure origin, has raised eyebrows. One of the addresses linked to the transaction, 1CNDW, had previously been flagged in compliance tools, adding to the concerns. Ulbricht Reflects on Prison and Freedom Ulbricht walked free in Jan. 2025 after serving 12 years of a double life sentence. His release followed a controversial pardon issued by US President Donald Trump . Since then, Ulbricht has re-entered public life, speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Nashville and auctioning personal memorabilia, including prison-era art and possessions. The donation arrived shortly after Ulbricht’s auction concluded, which had raised over $1.3m in Bitcoin. However, despite the timing, the 300 BTC transfer was not connected to the sale. This disconnect has only deepened the mystery surrounding its origin. The donation wallet, managed by the FreeRoss.org campaign, funds legal advocacy and public education around sentencing reform. While the money greatly supports these causes, its unclear path, especially through a centralized mixer, has cast a shadow over what might have been a celebratory moment. Meanwhile, Ulbricht addressed a packed audience in Nashville. He reflected on the dramatic shift in his life, recalling moments when he thought he might die in that “awful cage.” Still, he said he fought to find joy, even in the darkest times.

The selloff followed renewed U.S.-China trade tensions after Beijing today accused Washington of “seriously violating” a truce reached in May and vowed “strong and resolute measures” in response. This came after President Trump claimed Friday that China had “totally violated” the agreement, pointing to reduced rare earth exports. On the Geopolitical front, Ukraine launched drone attacks on four military airports inside Russia, destroying over 40 warplanes, while Russia pounded Ukraine with missiles and drones. All this comes as the two sides prepare to meet in Istanbul for a second round of peace talks later today. Gold prices rose above $3,310 per ounce on Monday. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.29% to below 37,500 while the broader Topix Index lost 0.9% to 2,777 on Monday, declining for the second consecutive session as renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump rattled markets. The Japanese yen strengthened to around 143.5 per dollar on Monday, marking its third consecutive session of gains. The au Jibun Bank Japan Manufacturing PMI was revised higher to 49.4 in May 2025, from 49.0 in the preliminary estimate and up from 48.7 in the previous month, though it was the softest decline since last December, as the downturn in new orders eased while output shrank modestly. Separately, capital expenditure by Japanese companies rose sharply in the first quarter of 2025, climbing 6.4% year-on-year On Friday, US President Trump threatened to double steel and aluminum import tariffs to 50% starting June 4, causing pressure on Japanese steelmakers JFE Holdings and Kobe Steel, while Nippon Steel was less affected by Trump's positive remarks on its planned merger with US Steel. China ( SHCOMP ) market closed, the offshore yuan fell to around 7.21 per dollar on Monday, marking its second straight session of losses as trade tensions resurfaced. The latest Chinese PMI data indicates stabilization, but recovery remains fragile due to weak domestic demand and ongoing trade tensions. China's PMI data showed manufacturing rose to 49.5 from 49.0 and the composite index edged up slightly to 50.4, while services slipped to a four-month low of 50.3. Separately, trade tensions escalated after China accused the US of violating a May truce, and Trump accused China of breaching a Geneva agreement. Trump's adviser suggested a talk with Xi could happen this week, but no timeline is confirmed.

The comment was made in a video clip attached to the tweet and has drawn attention within both the Cardano and Bitcoin development communities due to its implications for cross-chain compatibility and infrastructure development. In the video, Hoskinson stated that “Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script,” referencing recent technical advancements made under the BitVMX initiative. He emphasized that Cardano’s platform could serve as the initial entry point for developers working with Bitcoin script. According to Hoskinson, BitVMX will continue to evolve and improve, becoming more capable, more efficient, and supported by a growing ecosystem over time. Hoskinson remarked, “What Cardano has effectively done, because of this work, Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script, if you think about that. And that’s an amazing thing. “So, if you’re a Bitcoin developer now, your first entry point can be through BitVMX, and what you know is that over time that platform is going to get more capable, it’s going to get faster, it’s going to get cheaper to utilize, and ultimately it’s going to have a larger ecosystem around it.” JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script. If you're a $BTC dev, your first entry point can be via BitVMX. That platform will get more capable, faster, cheaper to utilize, and have a larger ecosystem."" pic.twitter.com/PIMYl4iAvJ — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) May 31, 2025 BitVMX Connects Bitcoin Developers to Cardano’s Capabilities The integration of BitVMX into Cardano’s infrastructure is designed to support Bitcoin script capabilities by utilizing Cardano’s extended unspent transaction output (EUTXO) model. This model offers deterministic behavior and concurrency advantages that are significant for developers building complex applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin script is known for its simplicity and security, it is also limited in functionality. BitVMX appears to address these limitations by enabling Bitcoin-aligned development within Cardano’s more expressive and scalable environment. Community Endorsement of the Multichain Vision The tweet gained support from members of the crypto developers community. One user, posting under the name T, commented that the cooperation between Bitcoin and Cardano is a meaningful technical innovation. He stated that BitVMX leverages Cardano’s architecture while preserving Bitcoin’s foundational principles. T noted that Cardano’s EUTXO model positions it well for this kind of cross-chain functionality and described the approach as a practical bridge between networks. According to them, BitVMX represents only the initial phase of what could become a broader development trend focused on combining Bitcoin’s security with Cardano’s programmability. Hoskinson Reaffirms Support for Interoperable Infrastructure Charles Hoskinson has previously advocated for multichain cooperation and modular infrastructure in blockchain ecosystems. The remarks regarding BitVMX reinforce that position, suggesting that future development efforts may increasingly focus on interoperability and shared resources between networks, rather than on siloed or isolated ecosystems. As the development of BitVMX progresses and more capabilities are introduced, further interest from Bitcoin developers may follow. The potential for faster and more cost-effective smart contract execution via Cardano’s infrastructure could open up new avenues for Bitcoin-script-based innovation.

45402847,https://coinpaper.com/9392/czech-justice-minister-resigns-over-bitcoin-scandal,1748844554,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Czech Justice Minister Resigns Over Bitcoin Scandal,https://coinpaper.com/9392/czech-justice-minister-resigns-over-bitcoin-scandal,"This led to an investigation and political fallout just months after the country passed a major pro-crypto law aligned with the EU’s MiCA framework. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser questioned the staying power of new Bitcoin treasury adopters, like Strive and Trump Media. He believes they lack the discipline shown by Strategy's Michael Saylor during bear markets, and warned of potential unsustainable equity premiums. Across the globe, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, which raised concerns about energy policy and regulatory oversight amid ongoing IMF loan negotiations. Bitcoin Donation Forces Czech Minister to Step Down Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned after widespread criticism over his acceptance and subsequent sale of Bitcoin that was donated by a convicted drug trafficker. The controversy began on May 28 when the Justice Ministry announced via social media that it raised close to 1 billion Czech koruna (or approximately $45 million) by auctioning off close to 500 Bitcoin. These funds were intended to support justice system improvements, including digitization, prison reform, and staff housing. Post from the Justice Ministry However, local media soon revealed that the Bitcoin originated from Tomas Jirikovsky, a criminal that was convicted in 2017 for his role in operating Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform used for trading illegal goods. In March, Jirikovsky’s lawyer approached Blazek with an offer to donate one-third of the Bitcoin he retained after his release from prison in 2021. Blazek accepted the offer without investigating the source of the cryptocurrency, and claimed during a press conference that he had no means to verify the origin and believed the gesture was motivated by a desire to repent. Pavel Blazek The revelation sparked public outcry and drew a lot of criticism from opposition leaders, who accused Blazek of gross negligence. The Czech police also launched an investigation into the origin of the donated Bitcoin. During his trial, authorities already suspected that Jirikovsky’s crypto holdings were connected to another dark web platform, Nucleus, though Jirikovsky insisted the Bitcoin was legally obtained. This allowed him to keep a portion after serving his sentence. Due to the growing political pressure and with national elections on the horizon, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, which ultimately prompted the minister’s resignation on May 30. Blazek held firm that he committed no wrongdoing but stated he stepped down to avoid damaging the government’s reputation. The scandal happened against the backdrop of a new pro-crypto legislative shift in Czechia. On Feb. 6, President Petr Pavel signed a landmark law regulating digital assets, which aligned the country’s crypto framework with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The legislation aims to simplify taxation and encourage innovation in the digital asset sector. Max Keiser Questions Bitcoin Treasury Boom Bitcoin also stirred some doubt from maximalist Max Keiser . He voiced skepticism over the durability of newly emerging Bitcoin treasury companies, and questioned whether they can actually maintain the same level of financial discipline as Michael Saylor’s Strategy during a sustained bear market. In a May 30 post on X , Keiser argued that while Saylor famously continued to accumulate Bitcoin through downturns without selling, these newer firms have yet to be tested under similar conditions. He warned that it is “foolish” to assume these so-called Strategy clones will show comparable conviction, and suggested instead that “Strategy is the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays.” Saylor’s company serves as a model for crypto-aligned treasury management, and attracted a lot of investor interest from both crypto-native and traditional finance circles. Its stock surged to an all-time high of around $543 on Nov. 21, which ended up pushing a wave of companies to mimic its Bitcoin-centric reserve strategy in hopes of achieving similar financial performance and share price appreciation. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Analysts now warn that this proliferation of Bitcoin treasury adopters could result in corporations collectively controlling more than half of Bitcoin’s total supply. Among the most recent entrants, asset management firm Strive announced its Bitcoin treasury transition on May 7. Just weeks later, the Trump Media and Technology Group, which is a media firm partially owned by US President Donald Trump, disclosed a massive $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. Another Strategy-inspired company, Metaplanet, saw its shares trade at an implied Bitcoin premium of $600,000, meaning investors are paying nearly six times more for exposure through equity markets than they would by purchasing Bitcoin directly. This growing premium trend is causing concern among market analysts, who warn that such elevated valuations may be unsustainable if market sentiment shifts or if Bitcoin enters a prolonged correction. IMF Flags Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Power Plan Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is concerned about Pakistan’s recent decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers. The move is part of Pakistan’s broader digital asset strategy, and was made at a time when the country is engaged in sensitive negotiations for an extended financial assistance program with the IMF. According to local news outlet Samaa, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from Pakistan’s Finance Ministry regarding the legality of cryptocurrency mining, the specifics of the electricity allocation, and the broader implications for energy tariffs and national power distribution. Officials suggest that the IMF’s concerns may complicate the ongoing talks, and sources even pointed out that the economic team is already facing intense scrutiny. The IMF delegation currently in virtual discussions with Pakistani officials is expected to convene a separate session to address the country’s plan to power crypto mining and AI operations. Pakistan’s strategy is anchored by the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), which was approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. This authority will oversee regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, DeFi platforms, and the tokenization of national assets, aligning its mandate with international compliance frameworks like those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Bilal Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin 2025 conference The announcement also followed Pakistan’s recent unveiling of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, introduced a national Bitcoin wallet.

According to local media, the charges follow a string of high-profile abduction plots that have shaken France’s growing digital asset community. The suspects, aged between 16 and 23, are believed to be linked to coordinated efforts to kidnap individuals with ties to cryptocurrency wealth, often using stolen vehicles and fake courier branding to carry out the attacks. Central to the latest indictments is the widely reported May 13 kidnapping attempt in Paris, where masked assailants attacked the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. The attack took place in the 11th arrondissement in broad daylight and was caught on video, which later circulated online. All three victims sustained minor injuries and were treated at a hospital. Authorities say this incident was part of a wider conspiracy involving other unsuccessful attempts, including a similar plot the day prior and a separate operation near Nantes shortly thereafter. Of the 25 charged, 18 are now in pre-trial detention, four are under judicial supervision, and three have requested delayed hearings.

Defence lawyers have characterized some of the accused as vulnerable youths drawn into criminal activity with promises of quick money, unaware of the severity of the crimes. The investigation gained momentum following mass arrests on 27 May, when French police conducted coordinated raids across Île-de-France and Loire-Atlantique. The operations were led by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme, France’s specialized anti-gang unit, and focused on dismantling a network allegedly behind multiple crypto-related abduction schemes. French officials believe these incidents may be connected to a criminal organization that recruits operatives via social media to carry out high-risk abductions. Investigators say those arrested so far appear to be foot soldiers and logistics handlers, with the masterminds still at large. As previously reported by crypto.news, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with digital asset industry stakeholders in mid-May to discuss security measures.

By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $5,190.17 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis.

This creates unfavorable circumstances for the investors, as the cryptocurrency is losing value as the selling pressure has taken over the market. BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of Binance Coin confirmed a downward trend in the market. The cryptocurrency value has depreciated to $658.5, the low for the day. A red candlestick on the price chart signifies a rising selling pressure. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is high, leading to increased volatility. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $690.3. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $635.1. BNB/USDT shows domination between sellers The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present within the neutral area. The indicator’s value has decreased to index 51.84 in the past 24 hours. This decline confirms a rising selling activity in the market. The ongoing downside marks a relatively imbalanced trading setup for the investors. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Binance Coin confirmed a decreasing trend for the cryptocurrency. The BNB/USD value has dipped to $658 in the past few hours. Despite the upswing in the early hours, currently, the bulls are in the lead. The Bollinger Bands are contracting, resulting in declining volatility. The decreasing volatility signifies a lower chance of an upcoming reversal. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $676.6, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $644.6, marking yet another resistance. Binance Coin descends to $658 The RSI indicator is present within the neutral area for now. The indicator’s value has deteriorated to index 44.31 in the past few hours. This descent is being reflected by a downward RSI curve.

Binance Coin price analysis gives out a highly bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has deteriorated to $658.5 in the past 24 hours. Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.35 percent of its value today. Technical indicators give out a bullish signal, whereas the price charts project a bearish market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price faced strong selling pressure toward $658.5. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 0.35 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,190.17 by 2031.

It is important to consider that the predictions are not investment advice. Professional consultation is suggested before investing in the volatile market. Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into June, BNB is trading approximately $666.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-02 07:00:00

The issue, which was swiftly identified and addressed by the TON development team, saw the network’s functionality restored within approximately 40 minutes of the disruption being reported. This incident, while quickly resolved, highlights the technical intricacies inherent in high-throughput blockchain networks and their potential susceptibility to brief interruptions. Developers Confirm the Quick Fix The TON developers promptly communicated the problem at 12:51:00 UTC and provided an update once the network was back online. Their statement clarified the nature of the disruption: “A quick fix was released, and updating only a few master chain validators was sufficient to resume block production. The incident was related to an error in the processing of the masterchain dispatch queue.” Interestingly, the team assured users that no funds were compromised during the downtime and that all transactions submitted within that period were secure and not at risk of loss. Such reassurances are also vital for maintaining user trust in the stability and reliability of decentralized networks , especially as blockchain technology continues to evolve and integrate further into mainstream applications. Previous TON Outages Notably, TON has faced similar challenges in the past. In August 2024, the network experienced several brief outages, largely attributed to overwhelming demand for the DOGS memecoin. This surge in activity created significant network congestion, ultimately leading to a chain halt. The first of these 2024 outages, occurring on August 27, brought block production to a standstill at workchain block 45,341,899. This particular downtime extended further for several hours, requiring validators to reset their nodes to restore network consensus. Although functionality was briefly regained, the network subsequently crashed again hours later, once more succumbing to the high traffic generated by users minting DOGS memecoins on the TON blockchain .

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain , Ulbricht received 300 BTC, worth about $31.4 million, to his donation wallet early on Sunday. Arkham data suggests that most of the coins were eventually sent to crypto exchange Kraken within a few hours of receiving the donation. Ulbricht, who was released from prison earlier this year on a pardon from President Trump, made a speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference over the weekend, which was his first appearance in public since being freed. Coinbase director Conor Grogan says Bitcoin wallets left behind by Ross Ulbricht when he was imprisoned for his role in Silk Road are still holding tens of millions of dollars worth of BTC. The US government seized tens of thousands of Bitcoin tied to Silk Road, but Grogan says they weren’t able to get their hands on 100% of the coins. “I found ~430 BTC across dozens of wallets associated with Ross Ulbricht that were not confiscated by the US government and have been untouched for 13-plus years Back then, these were probably dust wallets, now, collectively, they are worth about $47 million. Welcome back, Ross.” However, Grogan casts doubt on whether Ulbricht can gain access to the Bitcoin in the wallets. “Unlikely if he has the keys still stored down anywhere, I guess we will know soon enough!” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This turn in the tide was expected as the rally put Bitcoin holders in massive profit, showing a risk of profit-taking that could tank the price. So far, the price is already down by 6% % from its all-time high and trending at $104,000 at the time of this writing. But as bears take control, it is likely that the decline is far from over, and the cryptocurrency could fall below 6-figures again. The Pathology Of The Bitcoin All-Time High A pseudonymous analyst who goes by Youriverse on the TradingView website has explained the movement of the Bitcoin price over the past few weeks and why the market has been moving the way it has. As he explains, Bitcoin has been exhibiting what is known as a textbook accumulation since the uptrend began in the second week of May. This accumulation was part of the reason why the cryptocurrency rallied to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight At this time, the crypto analyst revealed that the Bitcoin price had seen more compression as it reached higher lows and resistance remained relatively flat. Additionally, the selling pressure that had rocked the Bitcoin price through the last few months due to the Donald Trump tariff wars had also waned at this time, putting the buyers in control of the price. The result of this is a possible ‘Power of 3’, which the analyst explains includes Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution. These three together were part of the reason that the Bitcoin price started moving upward. The resultant rally saw an initial push toward previous all-time high levels, and then subsequently, there was a push to a new all-time high above $111,000. However, the price action waned before Bitcoin could break $112,000. As a result of the dwindling upward pressure, a reversal was inevitable, and the Bitcoin price suffered a decline toward previous support levels at $106,000. However, this support has not held as it has since broken below this level, signaling “a notable shift in market structure.” Why A Decline To $92,000 Is Possible The analyst explained that the ‘Power of 3’ could be playing out right now, and this could see the price go further downward as larger investors dump on the lesser informed retail crowd. Furthermore, as the Bitcoin price continues to trend below the $106,000 support for longer, it increases the likelihood that the price could fall further. “The rejection above the ATH and the subsequent breakdown below $106K has introduced significant overhead supply, which may act as resistance in the near term,” the analyst said.

According to Adler, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges continue to decline, institutional buying continues to put pressure on supply, and long-term investors are increasing their purchases, building a “buffer support” under the market. On the macroeconomic front, mixed signals prevail. While the slowdown in Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation in the US has eased policy pressure on the Fed to some extent, rising bond yields and uncertain tariffs have strengthened the “risk aversion” sentiment in the markets and suppressed growth appetite. Related News: Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea - Expected to Pass Easily Adler stated that the basic scenario for the coming week is for Bitcoin to trend sideways between $103,000 and $110,000. However, if there is a 20% breakout due to momentum and an increase in trading volume and the $110,000 level is exceeded, he added that a strong signal could be formed that the market is ready to test the $115,000-$120,000 band. On the other hand, if net inflows turn negative and prices fall below $100,000, it could be a sign of a deeper correction. *This is not investment advice.

In a new video update on the Fundstrat Capital YouTube channel, Tom Lee says that court rulings against Trump’s tariffs suggest that the White House is losing leverage. “In our view, the tariff war and concerns have a bark worse than the bite. Let me explain, for instance… on May 28th, the international trade court ruled against the Trump tariffs. Now it didn’t remove all of them, but it ruled against them and on Thursday, May 29th, the DC District Court Judge Contreras ruled that [the] tariffs are illegal. So it’s two cases ruling against White House tariffs, but on the same day, the Federal Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay which reinstates the tariffs – at least through June 9th – but you can see this is getting quite complicated and the White House is insisting nothing has changed after the tariff rulings. And in fact, Goldman Sachs highlights that there’s many measures the White House can take to implement or re-implement tariffs. But ultimately, the White House is losing leverage, and it’s taking us closer to the endgame.” Lee also says that due to the rulings, Trump will struggle to revamp the trade war, and that the White House will be looking for an exit strategy on the matter soon. Lee goes on to note that tariff visibility and other factors have led to a better investment outlook for stocks now compared to earlier this year. “The investment outlook is better for stocks now arguably than it was in February 2025 because you’ve got tariff visibility, you have tax and deregulation visibility, [and] the companies survived [a] fifth major stress test… and the Fed is arguably more dovish next year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The whole issue is tied to the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-7702 , part of the Pectra upgrade that went live early last month. It allows regular Ethereum addresses, secured by private keys, to temporarily operate as smart contracts, facilitating batched transactions, password authentication and spending limits. The regular Ethereum addresses delegate control of their wallets to smart contracts, granting them permission to manage or move their funds. While it has simplified the user experience, it has also created a risk of malicious contracts draining funds. As of Friday, more than 80% of delegations made through EIP-7702 involved reused, copy-and-paste contracts designed to automatically scan and identify weak wallets for potential theft. ""Our Research team found that over 97% of all EIP-7702 delegations were authorized to multiple contracts using the same exact code . These are sweepers , used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised addresses,"" Wintermute said on X . ""The CrimeEnjoyor contract is short, simple, and widely reused. This copy-pasted bytecode now represents the majority of all EIP-7702 delegations. It’s funny, dark, and fascinating all at once,"" the market maker added. Notable cases include a wallet that lost nearly $150,000 through malicious batched transactions in a fishing attack, as anti-scam tracker Scam Sniffer noted . Still, the large-scale money drain has not been profitable for the attackers. The CrimeEnjoyors spent approximately 2.88 ETH to authorize around 79,000 addresses. One particular address –0x89383882fc2d0cd4d7952a3267a3b6dae967e704 – handled more than half of these authorizations, with 52,000 permissions granted to it. Per Wintermute's researcher , the stolen ether can be traced by analyzing the code of these contracts. For the above example, the ETH is destined to flow the address –0x6f6Bd3907428ae93BC58Aca9Ec25AE3a80110428. However, as of Friday, it had no inbound ETH transfers.

For those invested in the digital future, understanding how major players handle critical functions like safety and privacy is key. A significant development has emerged regarding Meta’s approach to product risk assessment, signaling a major shift towards leveraging artificial intelligence. What is Meta’s AI Risk Assessment Plan? According to reports citing internal documents, Meta is planning to automate a large portion of its product risk assessments. This involves using an AI-powered system to evaluate the potential harms and privacy risks associated with updates to its popular applications, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. The goal is reportedly to have this system handle up to 90% of these reviews. The process under this new system would involve product teams completing a questionnaire about their proposed changes. The AI system would then provide an “instant decision,” identifying potential risks and outlining requirements that must be met before the update can be launched. This represents a substantial departure from the current method, which relies heavily on human evaluators. Why Embrace Automation in Tech for Risk Reviews? The primary motivation behind this move towards automation in tech is speed. By replacing lengthy human review processes with near-instantaneous AI evaluations, Meta could potentially accelerate the pace at which it develops and deploys new features and updates across its platforms. In a competitive digital landscape, faster iteration cycles can be a significant advantage. This drive for efficiency is a common theme in large tech companies constantly seeking ways to streamline operations and reduce time-to-market for innovations. How Does This Impact Product Risk Management and Tech Privacy? This shift in product risk management is particularly notable given Meta’s history. A 2012 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires the company, then Facebook, to conduct privacy reviews of its products and assess the risks of updates. Until now, fulfilling this requirement has largely fallen to human reviewers tasked with safeguarding tech privacy. While the potential for faster updates is clear, concerns have been raised. One former executive reportedly told NPR that this AI-centric approach could create “higher risks.” The worry is that the AI system might be less effective at identifying subtle or unforeseen negative externalities of product changes before they cause problems in the real world, potentially impacting user tech privacy and overall platform safety. Meta’s Stance on AI Risk Assessment and Human Oversight In response to the reports, Meta has reportedly confirmed changes to its review system but offered clarification. The company insisted that only “low-risk decisions” would be automated. Complex, novel, or high-stakes issues would still undergo review involving “human expertise.” This suggests Meta aims for a hybrid approach, leveraging AI for routine assessments while retaining human oversight for situations where nuanced judgment and a deeper understanding of potential societal impacts are critical for effective product risk management and protecting tech privacy. What Are the Implications of This Automation in Tech? The move towards significant automation in tech for risk assessment highlights the ongoing tension between innovation speed and robust safety protocols. If successful, the AI system could indeed make Meta’s development process more agile. However, the effectiveness of this system in truly identifying and mitigating risks, especially novel ones, remains a key question. The reliance on AI for such a critical function in product risk management underscores the growing importance of AI safety and ethics. Ensuring the AI is trained on comprehensive data and is capable of identifying a wide range of potential harms is paramount for maintaining user trust and upholding commitments to tech privacy and safety. Conclusion Meta’s reported plan to automate a significant portion of its product risk assessments using AI marks a notable evolution in how large tech companies approach safety and compliance. While promising potential benefits in terms of speed and efficiency through automation in tech, it also brings into focus critical questions about the limitations of AI in identifying complex risks and the ongoing need for human judgment in safeguarding product risk management and user tech privacy. The implementation and performance of this system will be closely watched as a case study in balancing rapid development with responsible technological stewardship.

The directive comes as part of Singapore’s broader effort to tighten regulatory oversight and protect its growing pool of retail crypto users. According to the Monetary Authority of Singapore , only DTSP license applicants that have received formal approval under the Payment Services Act are permitted to serve overseas clients. Entities that have not obtained such approvals must cease these activities entirely. Singapore’s MAS has mandated that all local crypto firms without a DTSP license must stop serving overseas clients by June 30, 2025, with no transitional period allowed. Non-compliance will lead to penalties. https://t.co/wnQc0pMDqq — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 2, 2025 Singapore Warns Against Overseas Workarounds by Unlicensed Firms In its official response to industry feedback, MAS said that cross-border services offered without regulatory clearance could expose users to unfair practices and raise the risk of financial misconduct. It rejected calls for a phased transition, noting that firms have been aware of these requirements since the consultation process began and should already be in position to comply. MAS added that its approach balances consumer protection with the aim of fostering a safe digital asset ecosystem. MAS also clarified that the prohibition applies regardless of whether overseas services are provided directly or through intermediaries. It warned that attempts to circumvent the rules by relocating parts of operations abroad while continuing to manage them from Singapore would be considered non-compliant. Singapore Sees Uptick in Digital Asset Use While Tightening Rules To reinforce accountability, MAS stated it will actively monitor and investigate suspicious setups that appear designed to bypass licensing. This regulatory crackdown unfolds as more Singaporeans embrace digital assets . A Straits Times report published in April found that 26% of Singaporeans owned digital assets in 2024, up from 24.4% the year before. Adoption is highest among younger generations, with nearly 40% of Gen Z and millennials holding cryptocurrencies. Among crypto holders, 52% have used digital tokens for payments, and 67% plan to do so in future. The most common uses include online shopping, bill payments and in-store purchases. Older users tend to favor peer-to-peer transfers to friends and family, particularly across borders. Despite increasing usage, concerns remain. More than 60% of respondents in the survey said crypto is still too complex to use, while 54% cited limited merchant acceptance as a major barrier.

While the focus is typically on groundbreaking algorithms or new crypto applications leveraging AI, the physical footprint and energy demands of the necessary computing power are significant. This brings us to a developing situation in Memphis, Tennessee, where a major civil rights organization is raising serious alarms about one such facility: Elon Musk’s xAI data center. NAACP xAI Conflict Escalates Over ‘Dirty Data Center’ The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has directly challenged local officials in Memphis, urging them to stop operations at Colossus, the large-scale computing facility run by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. The conflict centers on environmental concerns surrounding the facility’s power generation. According to reports, NAACP leaders sent a letter to the Shelby County Health Department and Memphis Light Gas and Water (MLGW), criticizing what they described as a “lackadaisical approach” to overseeing the operation of this facility, which they labeled a “dirty data center.” The civil rights group’s demand is stark: issue an emergency order for xAI to cease operations completely. Failing that, they call for authorities to at least cite the company and prevent alleged violations of clean air regulations. Focus on the xAI Data Center and Its Power Needs The facility in question, known as Colossus, is described as a “supercomputer.” Building and operating an AI supercomputer requires immense electrical power, not just to run the processors but also for the extensive cooling systems needed to prevent overheating. While connecting to the local grid is standard, some large facilities, particularly those needing significant or highly reliable power, may supplement or primarily rely on on-site power generation, often using gas turbines. The NAACP’s concerns specifically target the gas turbines xAI is using at the Colossus site. The company has reportedly applied for a permit to operate 15 such turbines. However, the NAACP’s letter alleges that authorities have permitted xAI to operate at least 35 gas turbines without any necessary permitting over the past year. City officials have previously stated that permits were not required for the turbines’ initial year of operation, a point of contention for the NAACP. Environmental Pollution and Health Risks The core of the NAACP’s complaint revolves around the potential for environmental pollution emanating from these gas turbines. Such turbines can emit various hazardous air pollutants. The NAACP’s letter highlighted specific concerns: Emissions reportedly include formaldehyde at levels potentially exceeding EPA limits. Concerns were also raised about nitrogen-oxide emissions. These pollutants are known to have adverse health effects. The NAACP’s letter connects these emissions directly to existing health vulnerabilities in the community near the facility. The Memphis Data Center Location and Environmental Justice The location of the Memphis data center is a critical factor in the NAACP’s advocacy. The Colossus facility is situated near the Boxtown neighborhood in South Memphis. The NAACP described Boxtown as a “historically Black community.” This geographical context frames the issue as one of environmental justice. The NAACP argues that placing polluting industries near communities that are already vulnerable or historically marginalized perpetuates a trend where those who contribute least to environmental problems bear the brunt of the pollution’s impact. Their letter starkly points out that the area already faces significant health challenges, noting that cancer risks are reportedly four times the national average. They argue that instead of working to reduce these existing health issues, the Shelby County Health Department has allegedly allowed xAI to operate in a manner that could exacerbate them. What Happens Next? The NAACP’s letter puts pressure on local authorities, specifically the Shelby County Health Department and MLGW commissioners. The response from these entities will determine the immediate future of the xAI facility’s operations and potentially set precedents for how large, power-hungry AI infrastructure projects are regulated in the future. As of recent reports, a spokesperson for Memphis Light Gas and Water indicated they had not yet received the NAACP’s letter. Bitcoin World has reportedly reached out to both the NAACP and xAI for comment on the situation. The outcome of this conflict could have implications not only for xAI and the Memphis community but also for the broader conversation around the environmental footprint of artificial intelligence development and the siting of the massive data centers required to power the next generation of AI and potentially, the infrastructure supporting crypto technologies. Summary: A Growing Concern for AI Infrastructure The dispute between the NAACP and xAI over the Memphis data center highlights a growing area of concern: the environmental impact of the physical infrastructure needed for advanced AI computing. The allegations of operating numerous gas turbines without permits and potentially exceeding pollution limits raise serious questions about regulatory oversight and corporate responsibility. For the nearby Boxtown community, this is not just a technical issue but one with direct implications for public health and environmental equity. The NAACP’s call for an immediate halt underscores the urgency with which they view the potential risks posed by the facility’s current operations.

The trend suggests resilient domestic demand and business confidence despite trade tensions worldwide. Capital spending , excluding software, rose 6.4% from a year ago, the Ministry of Finance of Japan said. That was bigger than the 3.8% increase that had been expected and marked a sharp acceleration from a 0.2% decline in the previous quarter. When the more volatile software category was included, capital investment rose, an encouraging sign of broad-based investment throughout the economy. Corporate sales grew a better-than-expected 4.3% , and profits were up 3.8%. That pair of numbers suggests a healthy business environment where companies are willing to spend on technology and new capacity to boost productivity and ease labor shortages. Japanese exporters express concerns over rising US tariffs Domestic investment is robust, and the economy keeps growing, yet Japanese exporters are facing mounting uncertainty and challenges due to Washington’s accelerating tariff actions. Those tariffs, which could go into effect as early as July if there is no progress in the trade talks between the two nations, have sparked a shiver of fear among Japan’s export-driven industries. These punitive duties will most adversely affec t st eel and car industries – a significant component of Japan’s exports to the US. Cost of production, product pricing, and level of access to the market worldwide influenc e pr oduction and pricing of goods. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is mulling making a trip to Washington for high-level diplomacy to ease the trade tension. The planned journey, anticipated before the next G7 summit, is intended to open direct lines to negotiate a bilateral trade agreement to prevent the looming tariffs. Ishiba’s motivating principle stresses that Japan’s policy ensures that the country will continue to have a robust economic relationship with the United States and protect Japanese exporters from the negative effects. Japan’s chief negotiator on trade, Ryosei Akazawa, is also due to return to the USA this week to step up talks. Such talks are intended to clarify the timetable of imposing tariffs, discuss possible exceptions to the measures, and seek common ground of possible compromise to avoid trade hostilities. Government urges increased investment to drive economic growth Japan’s government is already actively promoting continued capital spending as a foundation for growth and industrial stability over the long haul. A panel of experts recently assembled by METI called for businesses to focus on spending extra “corporate funding”—above and beyond “necessary” investment in plants and equipment—on more productive capital investment, not share buybacks. This strategic new approach will strengthen the national industrial backbone and foster innovation in key fields. In addition to these recommendations, the Bank of Japan is bullish on the future of investment growth, especially in innovation-heavy areas like digitalization and decarbonization. The sectors are considered crucial to future-proofing Japan’s economy in the face of growing external pressures, such as disruptions to global supply chains and changes in trade. Government-led measures to shore up Japan’s industrial base, improve productivity, and remain globally competitive are also noteworthy. Early 2025 data point to robust capital spending, underscoring the strength of the domestic economy in the face of external uncertainties. Even as new US trade policy moves, like tariffs and open negotiations, threaten to undermine Japan’s export cornerstone, the government’s help and diplomatic assistance are working to soften the blow.

Under the new South Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) guidelines, non-profits are allowed to sell crypto that they receive through donations and sponsorships. On Sunday, the NGO made the sale of 0.55 Ethereum (ETH), equivalent to approximately 1.98 million won ($1,431). The initial sale by World Vision took place on Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit. The NGO linked its Kbank account to Upbit to sell the Ethereum that it received through donations, the exchange noted . To prevent money laundering, the FSC has strengthened the verification of transaction purposes and sources of funds for non-profits. Additionally, it only allows donations through domestic won exchange accounts. Upbit Operator to Establish Crypto Donation Culture Dunamu, the parent company of crypto exchange Upbit, is looking to aid non-governmental organizations in the country to help sell their crypto donations. The company aims to establish a platform that aligns with the guidelines established by financial authorities and the industry. “Dunamu is currently discussing ways to revitalize the virtual asset sharing culture with the Community Chest of Korea, Love Fruit, etc,” the release read. In March, Dunamu and Upbit carried out a crypto sponsorship campaign exclusively for users to aid underprivileged youth who have difficulty purchasing school uniforms and books. The recent World Vision’s sale of crypto is the result of that “cheer up campaign,” Upbit noted. S. Korea to Allow Public Firms to Trade Crypto Later This Year Further, the FSC unveiled a controlled rollout plan for publicly listed firms and entities to trade crypto in H2, 2025. Under the plan, about 3,500 listed companies and professional investment corporations registered under Korea’s Capital Markets Act will be permitted to trade virtual assets. The Korean government’s most permissive stand towards digital assets comes at a time when other jurisdictions like the US are moving to embrace crypto into national reserves. Additionally, South Korean investors are increasingly looking for the upcoming presidential election on Tuesday. All three leading candidates have pledged to grow the local crypto sector, including spot crypto ETF approvals.

According to experts Michael Howell and Raoul Pal, this shift could trigger the next major bull run in digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Michael Howell, a global liquidity analyst, sees signs of a structural liquidity wave forming. This trend is fueled by the U.S. Treasury’s drawdown of its cash reserves and China’s aggressive monetary easing , which includes yuan devaluation—especially against gold. Howell argues this isn’t just a temporary boost but a long-term shift supported by growing fiscal pressures and rising debt levels. Raoul Pal agrees, but zooms in on crypto. He believes crypto assets are highly sensitive to liquidity changes, acting as ""high beta"" investments that react strongly to money flowing into global markets. Pal predicts we are entering the so-called “banana zone,” a period of exponential crypto gains sparked by liquidity, shifting narratives, and returning retail investors. His models suggest crypto market cap could more than triple by 2026, potentially surpassing $10 trillion. Still, both experts warn that this bull case depends on liquidity continuing to grow. If inflation returns or the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy too quickly, it could stall the momentum. Volatility is also expected to remain high. For now, the signs are aligning. Liquidity is rising, and crypto may once again become the top-performing asset class riding that wave.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-06-02 07:25:54

33767162,[object Object],1748849425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Elon Musk’s New XChat Uses ‘Bitcoin-Like’ Encryption—What It Means,https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-new-xchat-bitcoin-like-encryption/,"Late Sunday, Elon Musk broke the news directly on X: “All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file. Also, audio/video calling. This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. You can do audio/video calls without a phone number across all platforms.” By Monday morning X engineers had begun pushing the first builds to Premium subscribers. A company memo seen by Business Insider says early versions lock each chat behind a four-digit pass-code until the rollout stabilises, after which the feature set will “cascade to all tiers.” What “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption Could Mean While Musk did not specify what “Bitcoin-style” encryption means, it can be speculated. Bitcoin’s blockchain data is not encrypted, but the network is authenticated and permission-less thanks to a tight suite of cryptographic primitives—most notably the secp256k1 elliptic-curve and ECDSA/ Schnorr signatures . Those same primitives form the backbone of BIP 324, an opt-in transport layer that encrypts peer-to-peer traffic with an Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman handshake, then secures packets with ChaCha20-Poly1305. The proposal is now partially merged into Bitcoin Core. Rust implementations of those libraries—rust-secp256k1 and related crates—have been audited for years inside the BTC ecosystem. In practice, they enable a stateless, low-latency channel that retains forward secrecy once the ephemeral key material is discarded. That architecture maps neatly onto Musk’s requirements: encrypted payloads, vanishing messages, and identity decoupled from phone numbers. Core contributor James O’Beirne has long argued that without transport-layer encryption, “the claim of ‘censorship resistance’ is sort of a bluff while P2P traffic happens in the clear.” Lightning Labs co-founder Olaoluwa Osuntokun told the Bitcoin Optech podcast that BIP 324 “is a pretty big bump” because it finally hides link-level metadata for light clients. If XChat ultimately adopts the secp256k1-based handshake outlined in BIP 324, it would deliver forward secrecy and low-latency performance comparable to Lightning-network transports. As of press time, no independent audit of XChat’s source code has been published, and the precise cryptographic design therefore remains unverified. A Deeper Musk-Bitcoin Nexus Musk’s decision to badge the upgrade as “Bitcoin-style” is not merely rhetorical. In February 2021 Tesla disclosed a $1.5 billion BTC purchase in its 10-K filing, calling it a reserve-management strategy. Although the automaker sold roughly 75% of those holdings in Q2 2022, Tesla continues to hold approximately 10,725 BTC on its balance sheet, according to the latest shareholder letter. Beyond treasury activity, Musk has periodically lent public support to the ecosystem, and initiated a short-lived “Bitcoin Mining Council” in 2021 to discuss renewable energy data. At press time, BTC traded at $104,879.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|Elon Musk|X|XChat,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-02 07:30:25

A new biography, “The Optimist: Sam Altman, OpenAI, and the Race to Invent the Future,” offers a deep dive into one of the most influential figures in this space, Sam Altman. Written by Wall Street Journal reporter Keach Hagey, the book explores Altman’s journey and provides insights into why he might be uniquely positioned for the current AI moment. Who is Sam Altman and Why Does He Matter? Keach Hagey’s biography traces Sam Altman’s path from his Midwest roots through his ventures at Loopt, Y Combinator, and ultimately, OpenAI. The book positions Altman as a central figure in the current AI revolution. Hagey argues that understanding Altman, the individual, is essential because the broad project of AI is inherently a moral one, and OpenAI’s existence is built on this foundation. While some argue it’s too early to assess AI’s full impact, Hagey contends that OpenAI has already significantly altered the business and stock market narrative, making an examination of its leader timely. Navigating OpenAI’s Unstable AI Governance Structure A significant portion of the book and Hagey’s insights focus on the dramatic events of late 2023, often referred to internally at OpenAI as “the Blip.” Altman’s temporary firing and rapid reinstatement revealed critical vulnerabilities in OpenAI’s unique structure: a for-profit entity governed by a nonprofit board. Hagey describes this arrangement as “not stable.” The structure creates a conflict where investors in the for-profit side have significant financial stakes but little formal governance control. The “Blip” demonstrated that despite formal structures, power dynamics dictated the outcome, with the threat of mass employee departure to Microsoft forcing Altman’s return. OpenAI’s subsequent steps, backing away from a full for-profit conversion, underscore the challenges of this model. Hagey predicts this “fundamentally unstable arrangement” will continue to raise concerns for potential investors, potentially impacting OpenAI’s ability to secure necessary capital. Challenges and Opportunities in OpenAI Funding The capital-intensive nature of AI development means OpenAI requires substantial funding to continue its work. Hagey suggests that the instability highlighted by the “Blip” could “absolutely” make it harder for OpenAI to raise money moving forward. While the planned public benefit corporation structure might be slightly more investor-friendly, the core issue of limited investor control persists. Despite these challenges, Hagey notes that her research suggests Sam Altman “might well be up to that challenge.” His history demonstrates a remarkable talent for fundraising and deal-making, skills that are crucial for securing the resources needed for ambitious AI projects. However, Hagey cautions that “success is not guaranteed.” Why Keach Hagey Believes Altman Was ‘Born for This Moment’ Hagey points to Sam Altman’s deal-making ability as a key reason he is particularly suited for the current landscape. She highlights his surprising success in striking massive infrastructure deals with backing from the Trump administration, despite Altman’s self-described “pretty traditionally progressive” politics. Hagey sees a parallel between Altman and figures like Trump in their shared focus on large-scale deals. “Trump respects nothing so much as a big deal with a big price tag on it, and that is what Sam Altman is really great at,” she explains. This unique skill set allows Altman to navigate complex political and financial environments to advance his vision for AI infrastructure, aligning with his long-held belief that government should play a significant role in funding and guiding AI research, reminiscent of mid-20th-century labs like Bell Labs. Understanding Altman’s Perspective on the AI Future Hagey’s research into Altman’s background, including the influence of his idealistic father and ambitious mother, sheds light on his perspective. She notes his belief in government-backed infrastructure projects and his long-standing vision for how AI research should be funded and guided. Hagey also touches on the often hyperbolic discourse surrounding AI, with its wildly utopian and doomsday predictions. She views these extremes as part of the same “hype universe,” where both sides emphasize AI’s transformative importance. As a journalist, she doesn’t take a definitive stance but admits her own skepticism about AI’s economic power has decreased as she uses the technology more frequently. Altman’s own optimism, forged in part by witnessing societal progress on issues like LGBTQ+ rights, also shapes his view of the potential AI future. Keach Hagey’s biography offers a compelling look at Sam Altman, providing context for his leadership at OpenAI and the challenges the organization faces. The book highlights the inherent instability of OpenAI’s governance, the crucial need for funding, and Altman’s particular talents as a deal-maker uniquely suited for the current AI landscape. While Altman’s ability to navigate these complexities is noted, the book serves as a reminder that the path forward for OpenAI and the broader AI future remains uncertain.

While the $300 million XRP acquisition by the AI mobility firm gains headlines, a trio of altcoins: Shiba Inu (SHIB), PEPE, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are growing in momentum. AI Mobility Firm Adds $300M XRP To Holdings AI mobility firm provider Webus International Limited has announced a strategic financing initiative of up to $300 million, aimed at integrating XRP ledger technology into its operations. The XRP holdings announcement comes alongside a renewed national partnership with another AI mobility firm, Toncheng Travel. The financing plan marks a significant step in aligning Webus with Ripple’s blockchain ecosystem, as the AI mobility firm eyes XRP’s potential for better cross-border payments. Analysts note this development could serve as a trigger for further adoption of XRP within enterprise mobility systems, especially as the AI mobility firm expands its reach through strategic alliances. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI Meme Coin To Transform Investor Portfolios FloppyPepe (FPPE) may be the undiscovered treasure of 2025 due to its distinctive utility. The altcoin is transforming the way meme coins are used in the digital landscape. It merges the widespread appeal of memes with cutting-edge AI technology. The altcoin’s ecosystem features Floppy AI , a bot that converts real-time market information into memes; Meme-o-matic , which generates and personalizes memes based on user preferences; and FloppyX , an AI-powered video creation tool. With its presale priced at just $0.00000035 , backed by a strong community and enticing bonuses such as “ FLOPPY80 ,” FloppyPepe (FPPE) presents significant growth potential for early investors who are ready to take a calculated risk. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Reacts To Market Inflows With A Bullish Bounce Shiba Inu (SHIB) appears to be gearing up for a significant price shift as technical indicators suggest an imminent breakout. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading within a symmetrical triangle formation, often a precursor to a decisive move. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that the Shiba Inu (SHIB) price pattern is in a consolidation pattern, which suggests a potential 17% swing. However, whether this move breaks upward or downward depends on broader liquidity trends. Recent capital inflows into the memecoin sector have positioned Shiba Inu (SHIB) favorably, with buying pressure quietly building across exchanges. PEPE Sees Explosive Uptick As Fresh Liquidity Ignites Meme Market Revival Despite market fluctuations, PEPE has maintained its bullish structure, signaling strength and discipline in price action. A crypto analyst has shared that PEPE has continued to command attention as it clings tightly to a key trendline, an indicator many analysts view as a launchpad for the next breakout. The broader memecoin market has recently been reinvigorated by a fresh wave of liquidity inflows, and PEPE is emerging as a clear beneficiary. PEPE’s sustained trendline respect suggests traders are positioning in anticipation of an explosive rally once momentum accelerates. Investors Are Increasingly Favoring FloppyPepe (FPPE) Over Other Meme Giants FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) dynamic ecosystem, emphasis on creative contributions, and development guided by the community give it an edge over meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE. The SolidProof audit has boosted its reliability and mission, merging meme culture with functionality, which sets it apart from other superficial meme tokens. With the first stage of its presale recording investments of over $2 million, the altcoin is poised for remarkable growth as it attracts more retail and institutional investors eager to get in early. Analysts suggest that this momentum could yield 100x returns in the coming months, making it one of the hottest altcoins in the memecoin space. Secure A Spot In This Once-In-A-Lifetime Opportunity Today While AI mobility firms are making strategic moves in the XRP market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers a distinct opportunity to capitalize on the upcoming wave of liquidity and wealth creation in the cryptocurrency sector. By making wise investments across these promising altcoins, particularly FloppyPepe (FPPE) , turning a few thousand dollars into a million-dollar portfolio is more feasible than ever. Act quickly, as success in crypto typically favors those who take early action and think ambitiously.

Technical signals show selling pressure, but despite short-term weakness, there are some bullish signals. XRP’s Technicals Show Bearish Picture XRP slipped below its key support at $2.23 on Friday, dropping 4.65%, and is now hovering around $2.15. If the price fails to climb above $2.23, then it could further fall to $1.96. Technical indicators show that XRP is under pressure. The 24-hour trading volume dropped by 37% to $1.51 billion, showing cooling interest in the spot market. Futures activity also slowed, with volume down 37.85% and open interest dipping to $3.9 billion, as per data from Coinglass. The RSI is at 40.82 is close to oversold levels, but no signs of reversal yet. Most moving averages signal sell, except the 200-day EMA, which still supports the long-term trend. The MACD also remains bearish. If XRP bounces back, it could retest the 50-day EMA near $2.27. XRP has shown market indecision with a “doji” candlestick, indicating that the recent rally might be losing steam. Despite this, the bullish bets remain high on Deribit, with many traders holding call options between $2.60 and $3+, which shows confidence in a price rise. The most popular call is at $4, with big upside expectations. XRP Long-Term Prediction Analyst Dark Defender recently shared that XRP is building a new weekly wave pattern, pointing to a surge toward $18.22–$23.20 soon. The $5.85 level is a key mid target. This follows the same pattern from November 2024. Some analysts say XRP could jump to $25–$75 by mid-2025 thanks to new projects, legal updates, and ETFs creating supply shortages.

While legacy chains make headlines, Lightchain AI has already raised over $20.8 million in its presale at a fixed token price of $0.007, drawing attention for its long-term utility and smart infrastructure. Built for scalable, intelligent blockchain execution, the project is positioning itself for what many early buyers believe could be a 100x surge in real-world application value. As Ethereum moves on price momentum, Lightchain AI is attracting those looking for foundational growth—and a smarter layer for the next generation of dApps. Ethereum Eyes $4K Breakout as Market Sentiment Builds Ethereum (ETH), is flirting with the $4,000 level, riding on a series of bullish technical patterns and on growing optimism on market sentiment. Priced at about $2,513 at press time, ETH has created a “bull flag” on its daily chart, a pattern usually indicating an upward continuation. So if momentum persists, then something like a 56% rally from here could be in the cards. On-chain indicators are pointing to a significant drop in ETH being stashed on exchanges, with the metric falling to a historic low. This is a strong confidence investor trend and also a lack of selling pressure. What’s also worth noting is that Ethereum’s recent Pectra upgrade improvements scalability and UX, which has brought even more investors to the table.

Over 97% of EIP-7702 delegations are being used in wallet-draining attacks. An Ethereum user recently lost $146K by signing malicious EIP-7702 transactions. Crypto market maker Wintermute has developed a tool that injects on-chain warnings into malicious wallet-draining contracts to alert users. The new tool comes as Ethereum users face a new wallet-draining threat that exploits a feature in the network’s latest upgrade. On May 30, Wintermute revealed it had developed “CrimeEnjoyor,” a code that injects visible warnings into verified malicious Ethereum contracts. The move targets contracts designed to auto-drain wallets when private keys are compromised. ‘Do Not Send ETH’ Warning The injected message clearly states that the contract “is used by bad guys to automatically sweep all incoming ETH” and prominently advises users to “NOT SEND ANY ETH.” The malicious contracts exploit Ethereum Improvement Proposal-7702 (EIP-7702), a feature introduced in the recent Pectra upgrade. EIP-7702 allows wallet owners to temporarily delegate control of their wallets to smart contracts—an opt-in feature meant to expand Ethereum’s capabilities. However, Wintermute’s research team found troubling patterns. According to their analysis, over 97% of EIP-7702 delegations were being used in identical sweeping contracts designed to automatically drain ETH from compromised addresses. “These are sweepers, used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised addresses,” Wintermute said in a post on X. While EIP-7702 brings new convenience, it also introduces new risks Our Research team found that over 97% of all EIP-7702 delegations were authorized to multiple contracts using the same exact code. These are sweepers, used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised… pic.twitter.com/xHp7zr4hC9 — Wintermute (@wintermute_t) May 30, 2025 To inject warnings, the team reverse-engineered the contracts’ Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into readable Solidity code and then publicly verified it. As a result, the modified warning now appears inside most of the malicious contracts. “This one copy-pasted bytecode now accounts for the majority of all EIP-7702 delegations,” Wintermute added. “It’s funny, bleak, and fascinating at the same time.” While EIP-7702 was designed to offer greater wallet flexibility, its lack of verification features has made it difficult for users—especially newcomers—to distinguish between legitimate and malicious contracts. Wintermute hopes that tagging compromised contracts will help surface suspicious activity and better protect the ecosystem. Ethereum User Loses $146K The risks are real. On May 23, one Ethereum user lost $146,550 after unknowingly signing a batch of malicious EIP-7702 transactions, according to blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer. ALERT: An address upgraded to EIP-7702 lost $146,551 through malicious batched transactions in phishing attack. pic.twitter.com/7GbamqOZVI — Scam Sniffer | Web3 Anti-Scam (@realScamSniffer) May 24, 2025 Since Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live on May 7, users have executed 12,329 EIP-7702 transactions. Pectra also introduced other significant changes: EIP-725 raised the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, and EIP-7691 increased data blob capacity to improve scalability and lower fees on Ethereum layer-2 networks. Last month, Vitalik Buterin unveiled a new proposal aimed at making it significantly easier for everyday users to run Ethereum nodes, by reducing the hardware and storage requirements currently needed to sync with the network. The Ethereum mastermind suggested a shift in how nodes store and retrieve data, moving from full data replication to a more flexible, user-centric model. Under this approach, nodes would store only the data relevant to the user, rather than Ethereum’s entire global state, which currently exceeds 1.3 terabytes, according to Etherscan.

Metaplanet’s founder Simon Gerovich announced a slightly lower acquisition price, the equivalent of $107,771 per BTC. The company has achieved an estimated average price of $93,354 per BTC, on track to build a 10,000 BTC treasury by the end of the year. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC* pic.twitter.com/X2clAIKNbR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 The recent addition to the treasury arrived just days after Metaplanet arranged another $21M bond funding round with the goal of new acquisitions. The acquisitions added to last week’s BTC hype, but failed to keep the current price above $105,000. BTC still traded at $104,850 in the new week, expecting more news of corporate buying. As usual, the recent BTC purchase announcement had an effect on the Metaplanet market price. Recently, Metaplanet drew enough attention to become the go-to stock for indirect exposure to BTC for Japanese investors. The company aims for the effect of Strategy (MSTR) for the Japanese market. After the announcement, the Metaplanet market price rose to 1,142 JPY ($7.97), close to the recent monthly peak at 1,222 JPY. The shares recently became Japan’s most volatile stock, as interest shifted rapidly for the company during its latest series of BTC purchases. The stock effect repeats the behavior of other BTC treasury companies, which often gain in the short term following acquisition announcements. The effect has spread to public mining companies , which retained some of their net gains in the past month. Metaplanet has been one of the most regular buyers, among a trend to accumulate BTC in corporate treasuries. The latest reported purchases increased the total amount of stored BTC to 3.38M coins. A total of 116 public companies already hold treasuries, with accelerated additions in May. Metaplanet gains general attention Metaplanet is breaking the containment of Japanese investments. In the past few days, the company has increased its search volumes, originating from other developed crypto markets. Searches for ‘Metaplanet Inc.’ are up 300%, originating from the USA, Canada, and top crypto markets in the Euro area. Metaplanet is also getting close to building a $1B treasury, within a small price hike or another acquisition. The company also aims to retain a favorable ratio of assets to liabilities, by paying back older bonds. Metaplanet holds close to $1B in BTC, after the recent expansion to 8,888 coins. | Source: Arkham Intelligence Recently, the stock price saw rapid increase on the German market, sparking a new round of investor and social media interest. Metaplanet has continued buying even when other treasury companies had a pause due to market volatility. Metaplanet has kept a high-visibility profile on social media, often planning its acquisitions close to the schedule of Strategy. Despite the efforts, Metaplanet is still outside the top 10 of public company treasuries, as other new buyers hold larger legacy reserves from mining or previous acquisitions.

Elad Gil, a name synonymous with early, successful bets on transformative technologies like AI, is now turning his attention to a groundbreaking approach: leveraging artificial intelligence to acquire and scale traditional, people-intensive businesses. This AI Investment strategy could reshape how we think about private equity and operational efficiency. Understanding Elad Gil’s Vision for AI Elad Gil has a proven track record of spotting trends before they become mainstream. His early backing of AI pioneers like Perplexity, Character.AI, and Harvey demonstrates his foresight. Now, as the initial wave of AI adoption clarifies market leaders, Gil sees a significant opportunity not just in building new AI companies, but in applying AI to fundamentally change existing business models. His core insight revolves around the power of generative AI to handle language and text-based tasks. As Gil notes, AI is exceptionally good at understanding, manipulating, and producing text, audio, and video. This capability extends to coding, sales outreach, and critical back-office functions that are common in many traditional service businesses. The Power of the AI-Powered Rollup Strategy The concept is straightforward yet potentially transformative. Identify established businesses that rely heavily on human labor for repetitive, language-based tasks – think law firms, consulting practices, or other professional services. Acquire these businesses, then deploy AI to automate or significantly enhance these tasks. This process dramatically increases operational efficiency and, crucially, improves profit margins. Here’s where the ‘rollup’ part of the Rollup Strategy comes in: with the boosted margins and increased cash flow, the acquiring entity is in a stronger position to acquire other similar businesses. By repeating this process, they can build a larger, more efficient group of companies faster and potentially at a better price than competitors who haven’t achieved the same level of AI-driven margin improvement. Gil emphasizes the advantage of outright ownership in this model. Owning the asset allows for much faster and deeper integration of AI technology compared to simply selling software to these businesses as a vendor. This control is key to rapidly realizing the margin improvements that fuel the acquisition cycle. Why This Investment Focus is Different While ‘technology-enabled rollups’ have existed before, Gil believes the current generation of AI offers a step change. Past attempts often used technology as a thin layer primarily to boost valuation rather than fundamentally altering the cost structure. Modern AI, however, has the potential to truly redefine how these businesses operate, leading to radical changes in efficiency and profitability. Challenges in Executing the Strategy Despite the compelling potential, executing this Investment strategy isn’t without its hurdles. A significant challenge lies in assembling the right team. Success requires a rare combination: individuals with deep technological expertise, particularly in AI implementation, alongside those highly skilled in private equity and business operations. Gil notes that finding teams that seamlessly blend these two distinct skill sets is difficult. Furthermore, as the potential of this approach becomes clearer, competition from other sophisticated Venture Capital firms and investment outfits is likely to increase, potentially driving up acquisition costs. Examples and Early Indicators Elad Gil has already backed companies exploring this path. While specifics on private deals are limited, reports suggest investments like Enam Co., focused on worker productivity, align with this theme. Beyond direct rollup plays, Gil’s portfolio includes significant AI bets in verticals he sees as crystallizing, such as Harvey (legal AI), Abridge (healthcare AI), and Sierra AI (customer service AI). These companies demonstrate the types of AI applications that could be instrumental in the rollup strategy within specific sectors. Beyond the Money: A Passion for Progress For Gil, this focus appears driven by more than just financial returns. His deep-seated love for technology and progress fuels his ability to spot trends early. He recounts experimenting with early AI models like GPT-2, which allowed him to extrapolate the potential trajectory when GPT-3 arrived. This hands-on approach, involving his small team of engineering experts constantly testing and evaluating AI tools, provides a unique vantage point on where the technology is heading and how it can be applied. This constant engagement has led Gil to observe a recent shift in the AI market. While previously dynamic and uncertain, he now sees certain verticals, like legal, healthcare, and customer support, showing clear signs of market leaders emerging. This solidification provides clearer targets and potential partners for the AI-powered rollup model. Conclusion: A New Frontier for AI and Business Elad Gil’s focus on AI-powered rollups represents an exciting evolution in how artificial intelligence can be applied beyond consumer applications and foundational models. By targeting traditional, people-intensive businesses, this strategy aims to unlock significant value through operational efficiency gains, fueled by AI’s growing capabilities in handling language and repetitive tasks. While challenges remain, particularly in team building and potential competition, the rationale is compelling. It’s a strategy that doesn’t just invest in AI; it uses AI to fundamentally reshape and scale established industries, potentially creating a new class of highly efficient, technology-driven enterprises. This intersection of AI, Investment , and traditional business offers a fascinating glimpse into the future of economic transformation.

This occurred through two separate transactions, one locking 470 million XRP and another locking 200 million XRP, deviating sharply from the company’s long-standing monthly routine of unlocking 1 billion XRP at the start of each month. The June escrow unlock, typically expected on June 1st, has not yet occurred, amplifying speculation across the XRP Army and the broader crypto markets. Source: Whale Alert Ripple’s Established Escrow Pattern Over the years, Ripple has employed a systematic monthly escrow mechanism to manage the release of XRP into the market. Each month, the company unlocks 1 billion XRP , uses a portion for operational expenses, liquidity support, or institutional sales, and then locks back any unused amount into new escrows. Historically, Ripple has returned a significant share, sometimes as high as 700 million XRP, of the unlocked tokens back into escrow, demonstrating its efforts to maintain a controlled supply and reduce inflationary pressure on the XRP price. However, this month’s activity departs significantly from that pattern. As of June 2nd, Ripple has not conducted the expected 1 billion XRP unlock. Instead, the company locks 670 million XRP, a move that has fueled intrigue and speculation within the XRP community. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market and Community Reactions The XRP Army, the passionate and vocal community of XRP supporters, has responded to the news with a mix of surprise, excitement, and speculation. Some view the lockback as a bullish signal, suggesting that Ripple has no immediate need for liquidity and is prioritizing long-term tokenomics over short-term gains. Others wonder whether the company is preparing for a major announcement or business shift that will require a more conservative supply stance. While the community awaits further details, one thing is clear: Ripple’s surprise escrow move has reignited interest and debate around one of the crypto market’s most closely followed tokens. All eyes will now be on Ripple’s next steps. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin witnessed an unstoppable and steady ascent. This recovery was fueled by easing tensions from the trade tariff war, pushing BTC to a new all-time high of $112K. However, by the final week of May, the price dipped to $103,500 — a key support area that had formed during the month. Now, in the early days of June, Bitcoin is attempting to hold this support level after pulling back from its all-time high. Yet, it continues to face resistance from the 20-day EMA band. If bearish pressure increases again, this support zone becomes crucial. A breakdown below it could lead to a further decline toward the $100K to $95K range in the short term. Additionally, market sentiment has shifted from optimism to pessimism over the past 24 hours. The BTC long/short ratio has dropped from 1.0141 to 0.9399, signaling a weakening bullish grip. This indicates that bullish momentum has stalled, and bears are no longer on the sidelines—they are actively pushing the price lower. On the flip side, if bearish pressure fades and sentiment improves, Bitcoin would need to break past its newly formed all-time high to resume upward momentum. If this happens, BTC will enter price discovery mode, targeting a near-term level of $120,000, with the potential for even higher gains in the months ahead. On-chain data shows that a significant amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, has recently become active. This type of movement is often viewed as a bearish signal, indicating that short-term holders (those holding for less than two years) may be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

As the weekly divergence has been locked in, a potential bearish retest seems to be forming finely. Despite the price trying to overcome the bearish pullback, the BTC price failed to secure a crucial range, which keeps the bearish hopes alive. Hence, the upcoming price action in June could witness a roller coaster ride in either direction, but the question is whether the token will be able to reclaim $110K. Investors Remain Sceptical on the Next Price Action The Bitcoin bulls have been holding the rally above an important support level at $102,153 ever since the price surged above the range in May. The recent bounce also substantiates the bullish claim to some extent, but the traders seem to be more interested in the current price range between $103,000 and $107,000, as they have been placing huge bets within the range. This suggests the traders are preparing for both scenarios, and as a result, liquidity is piling up on either side. The data from Coinglass suggests the short liquidation after the price rose above $105,500, while the longs have remained untouched at around $103,500. Hence, there are more possibilities of the price testing the price range, which could offer a significant bullish push towards the higher range, which is limited to $106,200. However, a rise above this range could require huge liquidity; meanwhile, the volume has dropped since the start of the month, but the bulls have maintained some dominance. Will BTC Price Mark a New ATH in June 2025 Considering the recent price action, it is quite obvious that the BTC price is expected to consolidate along the local highs for a while. However, the price action that could follow may certainly not be in favour of the bulls. If the price follows the historical price action, the star crypto is feared to undergo a steep correction soon. A popular analyst, anonymously known as AlphaBTC , shares the similarities in the recent price action of Bitcoin, which raises the possibility of a pullback to $90,000 or slightly below. However, the analyst is quite sure of the bullish reversal, which may lead the Bitcoin price to new highs, probably to $125,000. But before this, a correction appears imminent as the indicators like RSI, MACD, CMF, and DMI are about to undergo a bearish reversal. Regardless of the horizontal consolidation, El Salvador, Metaplanet, BlackRock, and Strategy continue to stack Bitcoin. Moreover, some are raising funds to buy more Bitcoin, which should be considered a huge bullish signal, as the real bull run is yet to begin.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 07:49:58

Then you know that Ethereum scaling has been one of the network’s biggest challenges. High transaction fees and network congestion during peak times can make interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) costly and slow. But what if that’s about to change significantly? Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently shared some optimistic insights that suggest a dramatic improvement is on the horizon. What Did Vitalik Buterin Say About ETH Scalability? Speaking at the ETHGlobal Prague event, held from May 30 to June 1, Vitalik Buterin offered a compelling vision for the near future of the network. According to a report by Cointelegraph on X, Buterin stated that Ethereum could experience a roughly tenfold improvement in scalability within the next year. This isn’t just a minor tweak; a 10x increase in capacity and speed would be a significant leap forward for ETH scalability . He also added an interesting detail about the network’s development pace following this predicted surge. Buterin expects that after achieving this substantial scaling milestone, the network would likely take a “breather” or a period of consolidation before embarking on its next major phase of advancement. This suggests a focused effort on delivering the current scaling roadmap before moving onto more complex future upgrades like full sharding. Why is Ethereum Scaling So Important for Blockchain Technology? To understand the significance of Vitalik’s prediction, we need to look at the fundamental challenges faced by early blockchain technology , especially those designed for smart contracts like Ethereum. Blockchains, by their nature, prioritize security and decentralization. Every transaction is processed and validated by numerous nodes across the network, ensuring robustness and trustlessness. However, this distributed consensus mechanism limits the number of operations the network can handle per second compared to centralized systems like Visa or Mastercard. This limitation is often referred to as the ‘blockchain trilemma,’ where it’s difficult to simultaneously achieve high levels of decentralization, security, and scalability without compromise. As Ethereum’s popularity grew, so did the demand for blockspace, leading to: High gas fees (transaction costs) Slow transaction confirmation times Limited capacity for complex dApps Barriers to entry for users in regions with lower economic capacity Improving Ethereum scaling is crucial for it to become a truly global, mainstream platform for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, gaming, and other applications. Without better scalability, the network risks pricing out users and hindering innovation. How Will Ethereum Achieve This 10x Scaling Using Layer 2 Solutions? Vitalik’s prediction is primarily based on the ongoing advancements and increasing adoption of Layer 2 solutions . While future upgrades like Danksharding are part of Ethereum’s long-term plan to scale the base Layer 1, the most immediate and impactful scaling is happening on Layer 2 networks built on top of Ethereum. Layer 2 solutions process transactions off the main Ethereum chain (Layer 1) but inherit its security guarantees. Think of Layer 1 as the main highway (secure but congested) and Layer 2s as parallel express lanes (faster, cheaper, but still connected to the main highway). The most prominent types of Layer 2 solutions are rollups: Optimistic Rollups: Assume transactions are valid by default and run computation off-chain. They require a ‘challenge period’ where anyone can dispute a transaction if they believe it’s fraudulent. Examples include Optimism and Arbitrum. ZK-Rollups (Zero-Knowledge Rollups): Run computation and state storage off-chain but generate a cryptographic proof (a SNARK or STARK) that verifies the correctness of transactions. This proof is then posted to Layer 1. ZK-rollups offer faster finality than Optimistic rollups because they don’t require a challenge period. Examples include zkSync, StarkNet, and Polygon zkEVM. The predicted 10x scaling is expected to come from the maturation, optimization, and wider adoption of these rollup technologies. As more users and dApps migrate to Layer 2s, the overall transaction throughput of the Ethereum ecosystem increases dramatically, while the burden on the Layer 1 is reduced. What Are the Benefits of Improved ETH Scalability for Users? The benefits of enhanced ETH scalability powered by Layer 2 solutions are numerous and directly impact the user experience: Significantly Lower Transaction Fees: This is perhaps the most immediate and tangible benefit. Fees on Layer 2s are often fractions of a cent, making micro-transactions and frequent interactions with dApps economically viable. Faster Transaction Confirmation: Transactions are processed and finalized much quicker on Layer 2s compared to waiting for confirmation on the congested Layer 1. Enhanced User Experience: The combination of lower fees and faster speeds makes dApps feel more responsive and user-friendly, akin to traditional web applications. New Possibilities for DApps: Lower costs enable new types of dApps that were previously too expensive to run on Layer 1, such as complex games, high-frequency trading platforms, and social networks. Increased Accessibility: Reduced costs open up the Ethereum ecosystem to a global audience, including users in developing countries where high gas fees were a major barrier. This scaling progress isn’t just about technical metrics; it’s about making blockchain technology accessible and practical for everyday use. Are There Any Challenges Remaining for Ethereum Scaling? While the outlook is positive, achieving and fully realizing the benefits of 10x Ethereum scaling isn’t without its challenges: User Adoption and Education: Users need to understand how to bridge assets to Layer 2s and interact with dApps on these networks. The user experience, while improving, is still more complex than using Layer 1 directly for many. Liquidity Fragmentation: Assets and users are spread across multiple Layer 2 networks, which can fragment liquidity and make it harder for users to move between different dApps and chains. Cross-rollup communication and bridging solutions are key areas of development. Bridging Risks: Moving assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2 (and between different Layer 2s) relies on bridges, which have historically been targets for exploits. While security is improving, it remains a point of attention. Decentralization of Layer 2s: While Layer 2s inherit Layer 1 security, the sequencer (the entity that orders and batches transactions on a Layer 2) can be centralized in some implementations. Efforts are underway to decentralize sequencers. Data Availability: Ensuring the data for transactions processed on Layer 2s is available for anyone to verify (e.g., during a challenge period for Optimistic rollups) requires posting data back to Layer 1. Future upgrades like EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) aim to make this data posting cheaper and more efficient. These are active areas of development within the Ethereum community, and progress on these fronts will be crucial for the long-term success of Layer 2 solutions and overall ETH scalability . What Does This Mean for the Future of Blockchain Technology? Vitalik Buterin’s prediction is not just about Ethereum; it has implications for the broader landscape of blockchain technology . As Ethereum, the largest smart contract platform, demonstrates scalable and cost-effective operation, it sets a precedent and raises the bar for other blockchain networks. Successful scaling on Ethereum validates the rollup-centric roadmap and provides a blueprint for others. It reinforces the idea that different layers are needed for different functions within a blockchain ecosystem – a secure, decentralized base layer (Layer 1) and highly scalable execution layers (Layer 2s). This architectural pattern is likely to influence the design of future blockchain systems. Furthermore, improved ETH scalability makes decentralized applications more competitive with their centralized counterparts. This is essential for driving mainstream adoption and fulfilling the promise of web3 – a decentralized internet where users have more control over their data and digital interactions. Conclusion: A Scaled Ethereum on the Horizon? Vitalik Buterin’s forecast of a roughly 10x improvement in Ethereum scaling within a year, primarily driven by the maturity and adoption of Layer 2 solutions , is a significant piece of news for the crypto world. It signals that the years of research and development into scaling technologies are beginning to yield tangible results. While challenges related to adoption, liquidity, and infrastructure remain, the path towards a more scalable, affordable, and user-friendly Ethereum is becoming clearer. This advancement in ETH scalability is crucial for Ethereum’s continued growth and its role as a foundational layer for the future of decentralized blockchain technology . As the network approaches this milestone and potentially takes a ‘breather,’ the focus will likely shift towards refining the Layer 2 ecosystem and preparing for the next wave of innovation on a more robust and accessible platform.

On June 1, TON developers announced that a fix was deployed 40 minutes after the issue was identified. According to TON’s official update, the incident stemmed from an error in the processing of the masterchain dispatch queue, temporarily disrupting block production. The development team successfully isolated the problem and quickly implemented a corrective patch, as updating only a few masterchain validators was sufficient to resume block production and restore network consensus. Developers have also confirmed that no user assets were affected by the disruption, and a post-mortem of the incident will be published in the coming days. Outages like these are not limited to just TON and have also affected other high-throughput blockchains such as Solana and Sui , among others, over the past year. These outages typically occur when validator nodes lose consensus or encounter software bugs, often triggered by sudden surges in network activity or flawed code logic. For TON, this is not the first time it has experienced service interruptions. In August 2024, the network faced two major outages due to overwhelming traffic from the launch of the DOGS memecoin. You might also like: Toncoin jumps 6% as BlackRock reportedly eyes Telegram’s $1.5b bond offering On August 27, block production halted at workchain block 45,341,899 and resumed only after a coordinated node reset by validators. A second outage followed on August 28, lasting around six hours, with block 45,350,522 marking the pause. Another incident occurred in December 2023, when a surge in TON20 transactions led to a drastic drop in transaction speed. TPS fell from 100,000 to under one due to validators operating on underpowered hardware. TON developers issued a patch and encouraged hardware upgrades while promising penalties for network participants who failed to meet performance standards. Despite these technical setbacks, interest in the TON ecosystem has remained strong. In March 2025, the project secured $400 million in funding from major firms, including Sequoia Capital, Draper Associates, CoinFund, and SkyBridge.

Throughout the rest of May, it dipped below a high-volume profile level. In the early days of June, XRP is attempting to hold above last month’s swing low of $2.10. If XRP manages to rebound and break through the strong resistance at $2.40, it could pave the way for a rally toward $2.80 and potentially retest its all-time high at $3.40. However, a continued drop below the $2.10 support zone could push the price further down toward $1.88 and $1.63. Additionally, rising volatility indicates that XRP’s previously dull and consolidative price action may soon give way to significant movement. Still, low trading volume remains a concern, as it reflects weak market participation—an essential ingredient for sustaining any strong momentum. However, if both volatility and volume begin to rise along with strong buying conviction, XRP could witness a significant price surge in June. XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026.

Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00.

Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin (BTC) Detail Attracts Attention!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-announces-new-feature-for-x-bitcoin-btc-detail-attracts-attention/,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of the most influential names in the cryptocurrency market with his posts and statements, made a new post from his X account. Elon Musk said that the social media platform's new messaging feature, XChat, is now live, will use Bitcoin (BTC)-style encryption, and will support all file types. Musk announced that XChat has been released with Bitcoin-style encryption, end-to-end security, disappearing messages, voice and video calling, and support for all file types. All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file. Also, audio/video calling. This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2025 Musk's statement that this feature is built on Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption and has a completely new architecture has sparked a backlash from Bitcoin developers and cryptography experts. Bitcoin Core developer and OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr responded to Musk's post by saying, “Bitcoin doesn't even use encryption.” JAN3 CEO and Bitcoin supporter Samson Mow echoed the same sentiment, saying, “Bitcoin is not encrypted.” Musk’s statement comes after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov last week claimed that Telegram had entered into a year-long partnership with Musk’s xAI, including a $300 million payments and app integration deal. Musk responded by saying, “No agreements have been signed.” Related News: Elon Musk Denies News! Toncoin (TON) Price Dropped as Fast as It Rises! *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck pushed the plan, arguing it would hedge against inflation. More public companies, including GameStop and Tesla, continue adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly voted down a proposal to explore adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet, according to a May 28 regulatory filing. The so-called “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal received just 3.92 million votes in favor — representing only 0.08% of the total — while nearly 5 billion shares voted against the measure. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who holds 61% of the company’s voting power, likely voted against it. Bitcoin Advocate Urged Meta to Invest Part of $72B Cash in BTC The proposal originated from Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who in January urged Meta to allocate a portion of its $72 billion cash reserves into Bitcoin, calling it a potential hedge against inflation. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28% of Meta’s total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value,” Peck argued in his supporting statement. He also pointed to BlackRock’s guidance suggesting a 2% Bitcoin allocation as reasonable. Peck, who submitted the proposal on behalf of his family’s Meta shares, serves as Bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive.

THIS WILL GO DOWN AS A HISTORIC MISTAKE pic.twitter.com/pWU1uC6kli — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 31, 2025 He has launched similar campaigns at other tech giants, including Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft shareholders voted against Peck’s proposal in December . Amazon shareholders are expected to vote on a related measure — proposing a 5% Bitcoin allocation — in the coming months. Analysts note that while some Big Tech firms remain cautious about adding volatile crypto assets to their balance sheets, the landscape is shifting globally. Public Companies Continue to Invest in Bitcoin Meanwhile, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. Last week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy.

As of June 2, the PSG token is trading at $2.21, up 10.56% on the day, according to CoinMarketCap data. The spike follows a brief dip post-final, when the token failed to move meaningfully despite the club capturing its first-ever UCL title. Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold At its intraday high, PSG touched $2.36 before retreating slightly pushing the token’s market cap from $18.2 million to over $20.5 million, reclaiming levels lost in the days leading up to the final. Interestingly, trading volume has dropped 15.7% to $35.27 million, indicating the price movement is likely being driven by fewer, but more decisive, buyers. Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token price action before UCL final In the days before the match, the token had climbed as high as $2.79 amid fan speculation and bullish sentiment. However, after the win, the token inexplicably slid down over 20% in a week leading crypto analyst Devchart (200k followers on X) to post : “Bro wth, PSG finally wins the Champions League and the fan token didn’t even move???” That sentiment echoed widely among traders expecting the kind of sustained rally that typically follows major sporting achievements. But the token’s delayed response may reflect broader disillusionment around the utility of fan tokens, or a simple case of “sell the news” after anticipation had already been priced in. Still, today’s bounce shows that there may yet be value in PSG’s crypto asset, especially with the club now basking in global spotlight and likely to drive further fan engagement.

According to a new report by NBC News, former Goldman Sachs employee Tim Leissner has been sentenced to two years behind bars for paying a part in the multibillion-dollar heist. Prosecutors say that Leissner and others who worked for the banking giant aided Malaysia in raising $6.5 billion for the nation’s investment fund through bond sales. However, $4.5 billion of those funds were stolen, laundered via bribes and kickbacks, and used to purchase luxury goods and fund extravagant lifestyles. The report says the scandal was far-reaching and led to the downfall of then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2018, who was later convicted of crimes connected to the scheme and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Leissner is due to report to prison on September 15th. He pleaded guilty in 2018 to bribing officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. Says Leissner, “The funds raised more than a decade ago could have profoundly benefited the nation and its citizens. Instead, due to my greed – and the greed of those involved alongside me – they were misappropriated. What we did was unequivocally wrong, and I take full responsibility for my role. I deeply regret my actions, and if I could turn back time, I would undo them without hesitation.” Leissner’s sentence includes two years of supervised release after prison and a forfeiture of nearly $44 million.

The value of the donation in question reaches approximately 45 million dollars (one billion Czech crowns). At the center of the scandal is Tomáš Jiřikovský, known as the founder of Sheep Marketplace, the Czech Republic’s largest dark web illegal marketplace to date, who was released in 2021. Jiřikovský was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2017 for embezzlement and drug dealing. More than eleven thousand Bitcoin transactions were made through Sheep Marketplace in 2013 alone, with Jiřikovský taking a commission on each transaction. Related News: Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea - Expected to Pass Easily Following Jiřikovský’s release, the court ruled to return electronic devices previously seized by police at the beginning of the year. These devices included a Bitcoin wallet and access codes. At the time of Jiřikovský’s arrest, the cryptocurrency was worth around 20 million kronor (around $800,000), and with the rise in Bitcoin prices, it has now exceeded three billion kronor (around $130 million). The ministry has taken back around one billion kronor from this wallet. However, the National Center for Combating Organized Crime (NCOZ) has opened an investigation to see if the transfer was money laundering. While detectives arrived at the Justice Ministry building to collect documents, Blažek publicly stated that the transaction was “very legal” and “could not be any more legal.” Following growing backlash in public and political circles, Blažek announced his resignation from his position. *This is not investment advice.

The thread offers a concise explanation of what these sales involved, why Ripple used them, and how their impact on XRP’s price and adoption has often been misunderstood. This information comes at a crucial time, as Hidden Road, a primo brokerage firm that Ripple recently acquired , has launched OTC crypto swaps for institutions, and many believe quiet accumulation is now possible for these institutions. According to JDNomax, OTC sales are a strategic mechanism that allowed Ripple to place XRP into institutional hands without disrupting public markets. He explained that OTC transactions were private agreements made directly between Ripple and institutional partners. These transactions avoided public exchanges, allowing Ripple to distribute large amounts of XRP without affecting its market price. This approach served three primary goals: promoting real-world utility , preserving price stability, and enabling targeted distribution to institutions actively integrating XRP into financial infrastructure. Ripple’s Escrow Releases and Strategic Distribution JDNomax also drew attention to Ripple’s escrow system. Each month, the company unlocks 1 billion XRP . He clarified that the company sells only a portion of it, typically via OTC agreements, with the rest returned to escrow. Importantly, he emphasized that the buyers of XRP in these transactions are not speculators but partners who use the asset for On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), custody solutions, and cross-border payments, integrating the digital asset into financial flows. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 JDNomax also noted that OTC sales do not affect prices in the same way as public exchange activity would. He clarified that the transactions are pre-negotiated and do not hit public order books. This separation from market-facing platforms meant less volatility and greater price stability. However, the longer-term effect of these sales is more impactful than often understood, as the tokens distributed through OTC deals are effectively removed from open circulation. A Potential Return to OTC Sales JDNomax also highlighted a critical shift in Ripple’s distribution model. While OTC sales were once a defining feature of Ripple’s approach, he noted that the company stopped OTC sales in 2023. XRP distribution is now solely tied to ODL transactions, meaning the asset is deployed directly in real-time liquidity corridors to support cross-border settlements. However, with Hidden Road’s recent launch of OTC swaps, OTC sales might become a crucial part of the ecosystem once again.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As memecoins dominate headlines again, investors are eyeing XYZVerse alongside Dogecoin and Shiba Inu to see which could deliver the next big breakout. Table of Contents Can XYZVerse surge 30x? Price forecast and key drivers Dogecoin fluctuates Shiba Inu remains volatile Conclusion Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have made waves in the cryptocurrency market, capturing the interest of investors worldwide. Now, XYZVerse enters the spotlight as a potential game-changer. With speculation mounting, the big question is: which of these digital currencies is primed for explosive growth? Experts weigh in on which crypto could be the next to surge. Can XYZVerse surge 30x? Price forecast and key drivers XYZVerse has entered the memecoin arena at a pivotal moment. With speculative tokens like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk capturing the spotlight, it’s clear that community-driven projects, fueled by bold branding and viral appeal, can deliver explosive returns. As the market gears up for another altcoin season, investor interest is shifting toward low-cap memecoins with high upside. Still in its presale phase, XYZVerse could ride this wave if it locks in key exchange listings and sustains momentum through launch. What sets XYZVerse apart? Sports-backed branding and influencer ties: Expands appeal across crypto and mainstream audiences Deflationary tokenomics: 17.13% token burn reduces total supply, driving scarcity Post-launch Liquidity (15%): Ensures smoother price action and confidence Community rewards (10%): Encourages user retention and engagement XYZ price forecast Presale price: $0.003333 Post-presale target: $0.10 (based on project roadmap) Short-term peak (1–2 Weeks): $0.15–$0.25 if major listings and FOMO align Long-term projection (6–12 Months): $0.20–$0.40 with continued marketing and ecosystem growth Could XYZ realistically reach $0.10? A 30x gain is ambitious, but not out of reach. Here’s what would need to happen: Top-tier listings: Launching on CEXs like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance would drastically boost visibility and demand. Viral growth: If sports influencer campaigns hit the mark, XYZVerse could trend fast across crypto communities. Favorable market: In a bullish environment, memecoins historically outperform due to high retail engagement. XYZVerse has the core elements of a high-flying memecoin. With smart execution, targeted hype, and strong exchange support, the token could exceed the $0.10 mark. But as always, long-term success will hinge on community trust, transparency, and post-launch delivery.

In the past week, its value dropped by nearly 15%, settling between $0.21 and $0.25. Despite this recent dip, the coin experienced a surge of close to 20% over the last month. However, looking back six months, DOGE’s price has declined by about half. Technical levels show that the nearest resistance is at $0.27, with the next hurdle around $0.31. On the downside, immediate support lies at $0.19, and a further drop could see it approach $0.15. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, hovering around $0.21 and $0.22 respectively, suggesting a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index is at 36.25, and the Stochastic indicator reads 34.69, both nearing levels that could be considered oversold. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0039, indicating bearish momentum. These factors might play a role in DOGE’s upcoming price movements as traders watch for potential shifts in the trend. Shiba Inu remains volatile Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) has had a mixed performance lately. In the past week, its price dropped by 12.74%. Over the last month, it gained 1.11%. However, in the past six months, SHIB has fallen by 49.28%. This shows that the coin has been quite volatile. Right now, SHIB is trading between $0.00001356 and $0.00001573. The closest support level is at $0.00001263. If the price drops to this point, it might bounce back up. The nearest resistance level is at $0.00001697. If SHIB can break above this price, it might continue to rise. The Relative Strength Index is at 34.41, which suggests SHIB may be nearing oversold levels. The 10-day average price is $0.00001375, and the 100-day average is $0.00001432. Based on these numbers, SHIB might be ready to move higher. If it stays above the support level and gains momentum, the price could rise. If it breaks past the resistance at $0.00001697, it might reach the next target at $0.00001914. However, the negative MACD level shows there is still some downward pressure. Traders will be watching to see if SHIB can overcome these hurdles. Conclusion Although DOGE and SHIB have performed well, XYZVerse’s innovative all-sport memecoin could be the next crypto to explode, aiming for remarkable growth with its unique approach.

Southeast Asia’s digital economy is booming—but so is its illicit underground. Findings from a recent UN report estimate that scam networks across East and Southeast Asia now generate nearly $40 billion annually. These criminal syndicates exploit weak infrastructure, regulatory fragmentation, and gaps in digital verification, scaling faster than law enforcement can keep up. You might also like: Verifiable credentials: The antidote to AI-driven scams | Opinion However, the challenge isn’t just economic loss; it’s about the erosion of trust in digital systems. As digital replicas become indistinguishable from reality and AI-generated content further blurs the line between authentic and artificial, existing systems are ill-equipped to anchor verification in increasingly fluid digital spaces. No longer just confined to a region, this crisis now transcends Southeast Asia and into Africa, Latin America, and beyond, exploiting an inherent fragility of incumbent infrastructure built on passwords, static identifiers, and centralized verification. The rapid adoption of digital technologies has outpaced the development of secure and verifiable systems, leading to an environment where trust is continuously eroded. To counter this, future-proofing the architecture of digital trust is more critical than ever to rebuild legitimacy and reclaim confidence in the digital space. The dissolving boundaries of digital trust As our existence increasingly straddles physical and digital realms, more than 70% of consumers in Asia-Pacific are now concerned about privacy and data sharing. The rise of cybercrime targeting vulnerable populations has created a new form of disenfranchisement: those without secure identity systems become prey in the digital realm that privileges the technologically sophisticated. Malaysia alone lost a staggering $12.8 billion to scams in 2024, equivalent to 3% of the nation’s GDP. These losses demonstrate that secure digital identity verification isn’t just a convenience; it has become an essential economic infrastructure that protects citizens from exploitation. Yet as digital adoption rises, public trust continues to decline, eroding system legitimacy and putting long-term adoption at risk. The lack of a coordinated, verifiable “trust layer” across economies is more than just a technical shortcoming, and it’s become a systemic vulnerability. Governments and institutions must prioritize building interoperable systems that can ensure identity authenticity and transactional integrity. Without a robust digital trust framework, progress in the digital economy will remain vulnerable to exploitation. The sovereignty paradox in borderless spaces While the internet was conceived as a borderless commons, the proliferation of digital crime forces us to reconsider the role of sovereign boundaries in cyberspace. National digital infrastructure initiatives like the Malaysia MyDigital ID SuperApp, powered by Zetrix, a public permissioned layer-1 blockchain, provide a compelling middle path: one that respects sovereign authority while establishing protocols for cross-border verification. The collaboration between Malaysia’s blockchain infrastructure and China’s Xinghuo BIF through Zetrix demonstrates how nations can maintain digital sovereignty while creating interoperable systems that facilitate cross-border communication. Malaysia’s leadership in launching the Malaysia Blockchain Infrastructure (MBI) , a state-backed initiative that supports interoperability across Ethereum ( ETH ) and enterprise systems, exemplifies a new paradigm where digital infrastructure not only protects national interests but also fosters regional connectivity. This model of sovereign interoperability provides a template for addressing borderless crime while respecting national digital autonomy. Moreover, this approach elevates blockchain from a financial tool to a core component of sovereign digital infrastructure, aligning it with long-term national strategies to secure economic and social stability. Rebuilding digital legitimacy: Prioritizing interoperability beyond decentralization The Malaysia Blockchain Infrastructure represents a hybrid model merging democratic access with sovereign assurance. This third path demonstrates how sovereign backing can provide an essential trust layer, while blockchain technology delivers the verification systems needed to support it. It acknowledges that while purely private blockchain solutions lack sufficient authority for mass adoption, completely centralized systems sacrifice the transparency and resilience that make blockchain valuable. As Malaysia assumes the ASEAN Chairmanship in 2025, it has a unique opportunity to elevate digital trust as a regional priority. Through discussions and forums, Malaysia can position blockchain not as hype, but as a foundational layer for ASEAN’s digital economy ambitions. Establishing sovereign blockchain as common ground The digital future of Southeast Asia hinges not on how fast the region innovates, but on whether it can build systems that people trust. Fragmented infrastructure, regulatory gaps, and rising cybercrime require a nimble solution that coalesces piecemeal innovation into coordinated, sovereign-backed digital infrastructure. Blockchain, when deployed at a national level with public interest in mind, offers a pathway to rebuild legitimacy in the digital age. It moves beyond financial speculation and into the realm of essential public infrastructure, which becomes a tool for economic resilience, societal stability, and digital trust.

The regulator also said no transitional period will be allowed, and non-compliance will lead to penalties. The MAS announced on May 30 that it will publish the commencement notification for the FSM Act and all finalized versions of the guidelines at least four weeks before the date of the start of the DTSP Provisions. The regulator also described situations where a DTSP (Digital Token Service Provider) license would lapse in the FSM regulations. MAS proposes regulatory guidelines for digital token service providers On 4 October 2024, the MAS proposed regulatory guidelines for digital token service providers issued under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2022. Under the proposal, the regulator argued that DTSPs may be more susceptible to money laundering or terrorism financing risks due to the internet-based and cross-border nature of crypto services. The MAS published on 2 April 2024 requirements for digital payment token service providers on anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism. According to the MAS, the regulator will take into account whether the firm can demonstrate it has valid reasons for not providing DT services in Singapore despite operating in Singapore. The agency will also consider an applicant that does not operate in a manner of concern to MAS. The applicant had to be already regulated and supervised for its compliance with relevant internationally agreed standards established by the Financial Stability Board, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, and FATF by all relevant supervisions in countries in which they provide DT services outside of Singapore. According to MAS, several applicants raised concerns that the proposed four-week commencement notification period is insufficient for applicants to prepare a license application for review. The respondents suggested that the regulator consider a transitional period, a temporary exemption to allow applicants to continue providing DT services while their license applications are under review. Other respondents also suggested the MAS adopt a tiered fee structure of license application fees and annual DTSP license fees, depending on an applicant’s size and scope of business operations. MAS said the proposed DTSP license would be structured similarly to the license application fees and annual license fees applied to firms that provide digital payment token services. According to the regulator, another respondent sought clarification on whether the annual license fee payable by licensees would differ based on the number of DT services provided. MAS said the fees will remain fixed regardless of the size and scope of the DTSP’s business operations. The regulator also announced that all licenses would be subject to an annual license fee of $10,000, regardless of the number of DT services it provides. MAS also proposed minimal initial and ongoing financial requirements for licensees to demonstrate their commitment to maintaining a meaningful presence in Singapore. The regulator revealed it will maintain the minimum initial and ongoing financial requirements of $250,000 in base capital, total capital contribution, and cash deposit. Singapore regulator issues competency requirements on its expectations The response to the consultation initiated on Oct 2024 and released on May 30 – https://t.co/QIIh2qKaJZ — Priya Karnik(priyak.eth) (@karnik_priya) June 2, 2025 Singapore’s regulator also set out guidelines on the competencies of the CEOs, directors, partners, and managers of the licensee for DTSPs. Competency requirements include having sufficient experience in operating a DTSP business as well as having a sufficient understanding of the regulatory framework for DTSPs in Singapore. Guidelines on licensing for DTSPs will also include MAS expectations of firms in managing key risks associated with their business activities, which MAS will consider when processing license applications. MAS requires licensees to conduct independent audits of the transactions related to the DT services provided and submit the audit report to the regulator annually. The regulator said it would take into consideration the findings of the audit report and may require an auditor to carry out additional duties, such as enlarging the scope of the audit. According to MAS, a firm needs a licensing requirement if it’s located in Singapore and is carrying on a business of providing DT services to individuals outside the country. The regulator also noted that an employee of a foreign-incorporated company that provides DT services outside Singapore as part of employment would not attract a licensing requirement.

The coin is on an upward surge already, and a bullish Bitcoin will only boost its potential returns. Analysts envisage a 100x ROI, but given Remittix’s massive potential, the actual profits could be higher. How will a Bitcoin boom affect Dogecoin? The biggest beneficiaries of a Bitcoin boom, perhaps, are memes like Dogecoin. That’s because the resulting bullish atmosphere would seriously whet investors’ appetite and they’ll go for lowly priced tokens like DOGE. Dogecoin struggled to break $0.24 in May. Source: Coinmarketcap Dogecoin hasn’t performed well over the last month, with DOGE struggling to break $0.24 throughout May. The turbocharged atmosphere created by a surging Bitcoin would definitely make DOGE go viral once more and possibly push it to a new ATH. A Litecoin price revival might be on the horizon According to crypto analyst VipRoseTR , Litecoin is showing signs of a bullish reversal, after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern. This puts Litecoin price predictions in the $100 to $200 range, which is a 95% jump from current levels. Source: Twitter/VipRoseTR Furthermore, Litecoin is widely regarded as a lighter version of Bitcoin. Should BTC clock $200K, the sentiment will definitely spill over to LTC. This could see Litecoin become relevant again and reclaim highs that haven’t been visited for years. Can a Bitcoin spike put an end to Pi Network’s struggles? Founded in 2019 by Stanford PhDs, Pi Network’s major goal is to make mining accessible via smartphones. Unlike energy-intensive blockchains, Pi allows users to “mine” simply by verifying their presence on a mobile app. This approach eliminates hardware barriers and has enabled Pi Network to snowball registered users into the 60+ million range. However, things didn’t go as planned after PI launched officially in Q1 2025. The token enjoyed a brief moment of upward bliss before crashing down hard . PI fell from a high of $3 and is barely worth $1. A Bitcoin spike is probably the only event that can inject life back into the PI project. It could revive PI’s bull run and push it to new highs, especially if the blockchain firm works hard at keeping it relevant. Conclusion A Bitcoin surge to $200K would definitely rejig PI, LTC, DOGE and RTX. However, of all these tokens, RTX is expected to appreciate more. That’s because it only just launched, has a more attractive entry point and sports immense potential. This makes it the ideal token for investors looking to maximize their crypto profits in 2025 and beyond.

Cardano, currently trading around $0.70, continues to build on its smart contract capabilities and ecosystem upgrades, maintaining its place among the top cryptocurrencies. At the same time, fresh altcoin Mutuum Finance, in presale, is trending as investors question whether it has potential to be the next crypto to blow up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already, more than $9.7 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 11,500 people participating, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. With ADA set to regain $1 and MUTM targeting doing it for the first time, competition has commenced and the crypto community is watching in anticipation. For those considering what to invest in as far as crypto goes, this fight may be one of the most thrilling options of the year. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors through its Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending platform which is gaining significant momentum in the market. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.7 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its launch price of $0.06. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Position in DeFi with Certik Audit The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while consolidating its market position. A Certik smart contract audit has now been officially completed, boosting investor confidence in the project. With this milestone, Mutuum Finance stands out as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today. Gamified Leaderboard Engages the Community In addition to securing community ties, Mutuum Finance has established a leaderboard feature which displays the top 50 token holders in real-time. Bonus tokens will be received by the top 50 ranks, a game-like incentive for users to move up and hold their positions. It is a smart merge of DeFi mechanics and community involvement. Rewarding Early Investors & Expanding the Community Mutuum Finance continues to acquire more users and provides financial benefits to its growing investor community. To award early investors Mutuum Finance platform provides ten lucky winners a total of $100,000 distributed in equal amounts of $10,000 value MUTM tokens. One of the revolutionary aspects of the Mutuum Finance model is its Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. The mechanism is to purchase tokens in the open market and redistribute them to stakers, which ensures frequent user engagement and sustains the tokenomics of the project. By matching supply and rewarding users on a regular basis, the strategy entices committed, long-term investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.03, is quickly gaining ground with over $9.7M raised from 11,500+ investors. As Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.70 and eyes $1 again, many are asking if MUTM could reach that milestone first. With a completed Certik audit, dual lending system, and strong community features, MUTM is shaping up as one of 2025’s top altcoins to watch.

May was a blockbuster month for the crypto sector, headlined by unprecedented institutional investment, key legal developments, and heightened adoption by both private and public entities. Bitcoin BTC reached new all-time highs of $112,000 as corporate giants like Strategy (MSTR) purchased $2.7 billion worth of BTC in four tranches, while BTC spot ETFs absorbed $5.2 billion in inflows reflecting rising mainstream demand. Companies such as Trump Media & Technology Group and Twenty One Capital joined the wave, committing billions collectively to bitcoin treasury strategies. Notably, David Bailey’s Nakamoto Holdings raised $710 million to pursue a similar strategy following a reverse merger. Public firms like SharpLink Gaming and VivoPower announced significant private placements to launch Ethereum and XRP treasury strategies, signaling diversification beyond Bitcoin. At the state level, New Hampshire and Arizona became the first to pass strategic bitcoin reserve bills, underlining growing political endorsement. Regulatory clarity advanced, with the GENIUS Stablecoin Bill moving forward in the Senate, the SEC confirming that staking isn’t a security, and the OCC affirming that U.S. banks can legally buy, sell, and custody Bitcoin. Coinbase’s $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit strengthened its derivatives position, even amid a major user data breach. Kraken’s move to launch tokenized stocks on Solana and the SUI network’s $200 million Cetus protocol funding further showcased Web3 innovation. Meanwhile, international players like Japan’s Metaplanet and France’s “The Blockchain Group” raised hundreds of millions to build bitcoin positions. The Nasdaq rose 9%, just 4% off its own ATH, indicating strong risk appetite across markets. Stripe’s move to integrate stablecoin accounts capped off a month of acceleration, institutionalization, and structural maturation for crypto markets.",Markets|Coinbase|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-02 09:32:30

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/will-bitcoin-btc-lose-its-shine-to-gold-again-price-analysis,"With Bitcoin (BTC) still losing ground after its surge up to the $112,000 all-time high, gold is currently breaking out of a bull flag. The two soundest money assets are interchanging as the go-to flight to safety, and it looks like it might be gold’s turn again. $BTC attempts breakout from falling wedge Source: TradingView In the short-term chart for $BTC might have just started looking up. The falling wedge chart pattern isn’t the most perfect, but if it is legitimate, a breakout could be taking place. If the bulls can now push the price up and beyond the $105,500 resistance, a return to more bullish price action could be the result. A failure to breakout could mean $BTC coming down to the $102,000 major support. $BTC cause for concern in weekly timeframe Source: TradingView The fly in the ointment for $BTC is the breakdown below the ascending trendline on the weekly timeframe which has just been confirmed. Add to this the cross down of the indicators in the Stochastic RSI, leaving plenty of cause for concern. On the positive side of things, the price is holding above the strong supports at $104,000 and $102,000. If this support can hold, and there is a strong surge, perhaps due to some catalyst, the price can quickly get back to the all-time high and turn the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators back around. Gold is staging a breakout Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the gold price is also staging a breakout. Since gold hit the all-time high on 22 April at $3,500, the price has chopped sideways and has formed a bull flag. Monday is witnessing the breakout of this flag. The measured move out of the flag is to around $3,700. BTC/XAU has started to reverse in favour of gold Source: TradingView The Bitcoin/Gold chart on the weekly timeframe is suggesting that it’s possibly time for gold to take back the reins from Bitcoin. The 38% rise for $BTC against gold foundered at the 32 ounce resistance, and this week’s candle falling below the ascending trendline is a sign that gold is going to come back into the limelight. The weekly Stochastic RSI is another factor in gold’s favour. The indicator lines look to be crossing back down, bringing upside price momentum on the side of gold. Looking ahead, what will be important is how far down this potential correction for $BTC against gold will go. If the correction goes below the previous swing low, this will signify that $BTC would be changing to a downtrend against gold. However, if BTC/XAU can hold the 25 ounce support and bounce from there, the trend would continue higher in Bitcoin’s favour. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Even though Bitcoin had an 11% jump last month , the market is taking a break for now. As the new month begins, investors are turning their focus to important US economic reports that could affect the crypto market. Let’s see what these reports are! 2nd June: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Speech Today, June 2 , all eyes are on Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve. He’ll speak in Washington at 1 pm, sharing his thoughts on how the economy is doing and what the Fed might do next with interest rates. His speech will likely influence market sentiment and could give clues on what lies ahead for Bitcoin. 3rd June: US Job Openings (JOLTS) On June 3, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for April will be released. In March, job openings fell to 7.192 million, the lowest since September 2024. This came before the new tariffs announced by President Trump. Experts think these policies have slowed down hiring. If job openings keep falling, the Fed might consider lowering interest rates, which could boost Bitcoin. 4th June: ADP Non-Farm Employment Wednesday, June 4, will bring the ADP Non-Farm Employment report for May. In April, private companies added only 62,000 jobs, down sharply from 147,000 in March. Economists now expect 112,000 new jobs in May. If the figure falls short, it might show that the economy is slowing, which could boost Bitcoin as an alternative to the dollar. 5th June: Initial Jobless Claims Thursday, June 5, brings the weekly jobless claims report. For the week ending May 24, claims rose to 240,000, up from 226,000. This was the highest since November 2021, showing signs of a softer labor market. Renowned economists expect 232,000 claims for the week ending May 31. More claims could mean the Fed will try to support the economy, which might be good for Bitcoin. 6th June: Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate Finally, June 6 will bring the Non-Farm Payrolls report and the unemployment rate. In April, 177,000 new jobs were added, keeping the unemployment rate steady at 4.2%. Economists now expect 130,000 new jobs in May. If job growth slows because of the tariffs, the Fed might change its approach. A weaker dollar could push investors towards Bitcoin as a safe place to put their money.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 09:33:29

But as it cools off in a consolidation phase, new players are grabbing the spotlight. Jupiter coin is gaining traction fast, but Unilabs is quietly building a stronger case. UNIL, priced at just $0.0051, is more than just hype. It offers real value through a passive income system that shares 30% of revenue with token holders. This setup is drawing in investors looking for long-term growth, not just short-term pumps. Momentum is building. With smart features, real rewards, and a growing user base, many now wonder if Unilabs could hit $1 before Jupiter coin. Solana Price Prediction: Will SOL Go Below $160? Solana is under pressure. The token fell nearly 7% this week, closing Friday at $162.72 – its third straight daily drop. Geopolitical tensions and renewed US tariff fears are hitting market sentiment, dragging Solana to a two-week low. Source | TradingView Technical signs look weak for Solana’s price prediction. The RSI slipped to 46, below the neutral 50 line, showing growing selling pressure. It’s also diverging from price action – a red flag. The MACD is trending down, with red histogram bars deepening, often a signal of a trend shift. Solana couldn’t break above the 50% Fibonacci retracement from its January high to April low, showing strong resistance. If it can’t reclaim $165, support at $140.32 could come into play. Derivatives data support this bearish shift. Solana’s Futures Open Interest dropped 3.23% to $7.11B. Long liquidations hit $18.98M – much higher than shorts – while funding flipped negative at -0.0013%. To bounce back, Solana must hold $165. Until then, bears have the upper hand, and many traders say $140 is the next Solana price prediction. Jupiter Coin Jumps 18% On Monday But Loses Steam During the Week Jupiter is on a roll, jumping 18% in 24 hours to hit its highest price since March. Trading volume has topped $100 million, showing strong market interest. On-chain data confirms it – wallets holding over 10,000 Jupiter coin have edged up from 12,233 to 12,251. That slow but steady rise signals growing confidence from large holders. The futures market backs it up. Jupiter coin’s Open Interest has jumped from under $60 million to nearly $100 million. This kind of rise in both price and OI suggests the rally is backed by strong conviction, not just hype. Source | CoinGlass On the charts, Jupiter coin is forming higher highs and higher lows. The Money Flow Index shows steady buying, and the Supertrend remains bullish with support well below the current price. A breakout above $0.67 could clear a path to $0.90 and possibly $1. But if the price slips below the ascending channel, Jupiter coin could dip under $0.50. For now, momentum and accumulation favour the bulls. Unilabs Takes DeFi to Another Level With Impressive Set of Tools Unilabs is making waves in DeFi with a broader vision than projects like Jupiter. While Jupiter focused on Solana, Unilabs is building tools that work across the entire blockchain space. Its goal is simple: make DeFi easy for everyone. For active traders, the Cross-Chain Trading Hub solves a major problem – blockchain fragmentation. It lets users trade across multiple chains without using risky bridges. Transactions stay fast, simple, and secure. For those who prefer steady gains, the Stablecoin Savings Account (SSA) offers a safer path. Users can deposit stablecoins and earn reliable interest without dealing with crypto volatility. It’s perfect for anyone who wants passive income without stress. Then there’s the Flash Loan Accelerator. This tool gives advanced traders access to large, no-collateral loans – as long as they repay in one transaction. It opens doors to powerful strategies that were once out of reach. The response has been strong. Over 25,000 investors have joined the UNIL presale, raising more than $1.6 million in weeks. As interest in AI and DeFi grows, Unilabs stands out – not just as another project, but as a real challenger to Web3 giants like Jupiter coin.

Recent reports indicate that Solana's price has dropped substantially, failing to maintain its upward trajectory amid broader market uncertainties, including geopolitical strains and economic policies affecting cryptocurrencies globally. Investors and analysts have noted a decline in key indicators like the RSI and MACD, suggesting that Solana could face further downside if it fails to maintain crucial support levels. The recent dip below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level further validates these concerns, highlighting resistance that has capped Solana’s price gains. Source | TradingView Jupiter’s Recent Market Surge Jupiter has recently seen a remarkable 18% surge in its value, signaling a robust entry in the cryptocurrency market. This uptick was supported by a significant increase in trading volume and a subtle yet consistent increase in wallet activities, suggesting a growing trust among large-scale investors. Source | CoinGlass Despite a strong start to the week, Jupiter's momentum seems to be waning, which may suggest a need for cautious optimism. Investors are closely watching if it can maintain its current support levels to avoid a price correction similar to Solana. Unilabs: A Rising Contender in DeFi While Jupiter has its eyes set on the altcoin market, Unilabs is pioneering innovative solutions in the DeFi sector. Unilabs is not only attracting investors with its low entry price but is also cementing its place as a formidable player through a novel passive income system. This feature allocates 30% of revenues to its token holders, fostering a sustainable investment model. Their offering includes a suite of tools aimed at enhancing the DeFi experience across various blockchain environments. The Cross-Chain Trading Hub, for instance, addresses the pain point of blockchain fragmentation by enabling secure, multi-chain transactions without the need for complex bridges.

The dollar index, which tracks the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, has dropped nearly 9% to 99.74 this year, as President Donald Trump's tariff war triggered a shift away from U.S. assets . Bank of America expects continued data-driven drubbing over the Summer. Weakness in the U.S. dollar is widely seen as positive for dollar-denominated assets, such as gold and bitcoin BTC. The global FX research team led by Athanasios Vamvakidis stated in a report to clients Friday that tariffs are more detrimental to the U.S. economy as the country trades more with the rest of the world than perhaps any other nation. The report acknowledged recent resilience in the U.S. economy and growth-supportive developments, such as President Donald Trump's tax cuts and the abandonment of extreme fiscal spending cuts, but stated that ""negatives dominate."" ""Policy uncertainty on multiple fronts remains. Companies may pause hiring and investment plans until there is greater clarity. In most scenarios, we see tariffs much higher than the starting point, with current levels being the minimum,"" the report said. It added that the market is reacting negatively to the loosening of fiscal policy at a time when debt levels are at record highs, leading to higher borrowing costs. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is unable to take significant action due to rising inflation expectations. ""Migration flows have collapsed. Demand increased in Q1 [front running] ahead of tariffs but may be about to fall,"" strategists noted, pointing to weakness in high-frequency indicators such as the ISM data and weekly Dallas Fed economic index. The weekly Dallas Fed economic index has resumed the downtrend following the brief spike in early April and hit the lowest since December, according to data source TradingView.

This is a 50% depreciation from XRP’s January peak, which is quite telling since Bitcoin’s rally to new highs was followed by crypto price booms. At the same time, a new payment token named Remittix (RTX) is rising up the ranks. By taking a disruptive approach to crypto payments, Remittix has quickly gained traction and is destined to fetch early investors humongous profits when it hits the spotlight. Remittix keeps shining brighter Remittix is a new crypto project that has its sights set on taking cross-border transactions to the next level. It enables instant crypto-to-fiat conversions for bank transfers, which is quite outstanding. Anyone can use Remittix to send fiat to bank accounts, using crypto, right from their wallets. Its seamless API lets businesses accept crypto payments settled in fiat, bypassing traditional intermediaries like Wise and Stripe. Furthermore, it’s got support for 40+ cryptocurrencies and over 30 different fiat currencies. This groundbreaking utility has attracted a crowd to its burgeoning presale, which has been wildly successful. Over $15.4 million has been raised with more than half a billion tokens sold. But more importantly, Remittix has appreciated by 400% since its launch and is currently on a roll. With an entry price of $0.0781, Remittix promises to be an outstanding option for investment portfolios. It is expected to explode and usher in a 300% profit before its presale concludes. Once RTX gets listed on exchanges, one can only imagine how high it is going to soar. Institutional interest in Ripple soars The SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple last March 2025, clearing XRP’s path to mainstream adoption. Even though there’s been a hiccup and Ripple’s legal issues are far from over, it bolstered institutional interest in XRP. VivoPower became the first Nasdaq-listed firm to launch an XRP-focused treasury, raising $121 million from Saudi royalty and ex-Ripple board members. CME Group has also rolled out XRP futures , positioning Ripple alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum as “blue-chip” crypto assets. Source: Polymarket The possibility of a Ripple ETF approval is also increasing, according to bets on Polymarket. This adds to multiple signals of an impending XRP price boom. But in the meantime XRP is not doing too well. XRP price prediction: a short-term pullback to kickstart a monster rally? Towards the end of May, XRP price suffered a dip and is currently struggling to hold the $2.4 support level. This is a dangerous zone for the token, as a continued pullback could see Ripple drop below $1.9. Source: Egrag_Crypto/X But according to crypto analysts, things are about to change. Egrag_crypto has identified a massive “W” pattern on the XRP price chart. A neckline breakout could propel XRP price to $25 and fetch investors handsome profits. Don’t miss out on Remittix While XRP price keeps failing to hold key support levels, Remittix keeps shining brighter. It embodies payment innovation’s next wave: direct, decentralized and democratized. There’s no doubt it will soar in the near future and fetch early adopters life-changing profits. That’s why it is the ideal investment option for those seeking the next big thing in crypto.

These 3 Coins Already Did,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/can-pi-network-create-overnight-millionaires-these-3-coins-already-did,"In the ever-volatile crypto market, investors are always on the hunt for the next big opportunity, the kind that can deliver massive returns, just like FloppyPepe (FPPE) , Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). As buzz around Pi Network (PI) continues to grow, many are wondering: can it follow in the footsteps of these breakout tokens, FloppyPepe (FPPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB), and deliver life-changing gains? FloppyPepe (FPPE): Rising In The Ranks With Million Dollar Investments The FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem has enjoyed a meteoric rise since its launch. Now in stage 2 of its presale, the token has raised over $3 million in investments. All thanks to its engaging community, Floppynomics, and AI capabilities. As part of the $66 billion AI agent industry, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) participation has given it a large share in the market, causing it to rise above the ranks in investments. It’s futuristic AI tools; the FloppyX, FloppyAI , and Meme-O-Matic allow users to generate and speedily share memes. These tools not only keep the community engaged but also offer creators a way to earn passive income. This growth is pushed by its tokenomics and robust security, having already been audited by Solidproof. At its core is “Floppynomics”, a cleverly engineered model that does more than just boost hype. It rewards loyal holders with passive income, and maintains long-term value through a built-in 1% token burn mechanism that steadily reduces supply and fuels scarcity. Pi Network (PI): Hype Or Hidden Gem? Launched with a vision to make crypto mining accessible to everyone via a simple mobile app, Pi Network (PI) has amassed tens of millions of users worldwide. Despite its large community, Pi Network (PI) is yet to go fully live on major exchanges, and its actual market value remains speculative. Pi Network (PI) is currently holding above a key support level. According to crypto analyst Moon Jeff, a break below this zone could send the Pi Network (PI) to a new all-time low of $0.40, a make-or-break point for bullish momentum. With a strong user base and a promise of decentralized accessibility, investors believe Pi Network (PI) can create overnight millionaires once it officially hits the market. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Dogecoin Killer That Delivered Branded as the “Dogecoin (DOGE) Killer,” Shiba Inu (SHIB) took the meme coin momentum even further, delivering gains that seemed impossible. At its peak, Shiba Inu (SHIB) turned little investments into millions for early participants. Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) success solidified the notion that community-driven projects could shake up the crypto landscape. Despite recent market corrections, Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a key player in the meme coin space and continues to be a watchlist favorite among retail investors. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently eyeing a possible 17% growth as an analyst highlights a symmetrical triangle pattern formed on the charts, indicating a possible breakout. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme That Made History Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke, and ended up rewriting crypto history. Fueled by social media virality and Elon Musk’s endorsements, Dogecoin (DOGE) surged from fractions of a cent to over $0.70 during its 2021 peak, turning small early investments into millionaire-making windfalls. Today, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) trades around $0.188 and remains one of the most recognized and traded meme coins in the market. According to analysts , Dogecoin (DOGE) is on the verge of another breakout to new ATHs. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Most Explosive Opportunity Of The Year Selling for just $0.00000035 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers early participants an 80% advantage when they use the promo code “FLOPPY80” to buy. Even better, with each new presale stage, the token value nearly doubles, enabling investors to lock in significant profits even before official listings. Unlike the Pi Network (PI) which is yet to fully go live on major exchanges, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is preparing for full listings on both the Binance Smart Chain and the Solana network. These integrations could bring massive exposure, drive market volume, and position the token for a powerful launch that will create millionaires overnight. For investors looking to get in early on what might become the next millionaire-making crypto asset, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers a compelling mix of utility, community, and exponential upside potential.

This marks IG's first offering of crypto exposure through spot trading of bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and a range of smaller tokens. The company's crypto service has previously been confined to derivatives products in the form contracts for difference (CFD). IG has teamed up with U.S.-based crypto-focused fintech firm Uphold to build crypto trading into its existing platforms that customers currently use for dealing shares, FX, commodities and derivatives. This may demonstrate the increasing integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and digital assets that investors and traders now expect to see. The London-based firm's move also coincides with the ongoing development of the U.K.'s plans to establish a regulatory regime for the crypto industry. The government published two consultation papers in April on draft legislation for activities such as crypto trading and stablecoin issuance. IG shares are around 0.25% higher on the day at the time of writing, compared to the FTSE 100 index which is unchanged.

However, it is believed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's controlling stake ensured the proposal’s defeat. Despite this, interest in corporate Bitcoin holdings is still rising globally. Meanwhile, Meta is still laser focused on artificial intelligence and defense applications. The company recently partnered with defense firm Anduril to develop AI-driven AR gear for US soldiers, repurposing metaverse technologies for military use. On the other hand, Meta’s AI research also faces internal struggles, with key talent departing and its Llama models trailing competitors. AI chief Yann LeCun is calling for a paradigm shift when it comes to training methods to build more intelligent systems. Bitcoin Proposal Crushed in Meta Vote Meta shareholders decisively voted against a proposal to explore adding Bitcoin to the tech giant’s balance sheet. The “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal was submitted earlier this year by Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, but it received just 3.92 million votes in favor. This accounts for about 0.08% of the total votes. Nearly 5 billion shareholders rejected the measure, according to a May 28 regulatory filing . It is assumed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who controls 61% of the company's voting power, voted against the proposal, which effectively sealed its defeat. (Source: SEC ) Peck’s proposal argued that a portion of Meta’s $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents should be converted into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. In his supporting statement, Peck claimed that 28% of Meta’s total assets are “consistently diminishing shareholder value” due to currency debasement and bond yields that fail to outpace inflation. He also pointed to BlackRock’s stance that a 2% allocation into Bitcoin is considered reasonable. Peck is the Bitcoin director at Strive, and submitted the proposal on behalf of his family’s Meta shares. He previously made similar pitches to Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft shareholders ultimately rejected the idea in December, while Amazon investors are still due to vote on a similar proposal. Despite these high-profile rejections, corporate interest in Bitcoin is still gaining momentum. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET , 116 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Some of the more recent entrants include GameStop and Swedish health tech firm H100, both of which made their first Bitcoin purchases last month. Holders of Bitcoin (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Strategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, each with over $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings. For now, the stark rejection at Meta suggests that shareholder appetite for crypto diversification is limited among large-cap tech firms, even as more companies globally are beginning to see Bitcoin as a viable corporate reserve asset. Meta Steps Into Combat While Bitcoin may not be a top priority at Meta, AI certainly is. The social media giant recently partnered with defense contractor Anduril to create artificial intelligence-powered augmented and virtual reality gear for the US military. The main goal of the collaboration is to equip soldiers with advanced headsets that incorporate Anduril’s AI-driven Lattice command and control system. This platform aggregates and interprets data from thousands of sources to deliver real-time battlefield intelligence. According to Anduril, the gear will enhance soldiers' situational awareness and enable more intuitive control over autonomous systems. This will provide a new layer of immersion and decision-making capability during combat missions. The project is privately funded and forms part of the growing trend of repurposing consumer technologies for military applications. Meta has invested $40 billion into virtual and augmented reality technologies since pivoting to its metaverse ambitions in 2021, and is now leveraging its expertise in immersive tech for defense purposes. Anduril’s co-founder Palmer Luckey , who also founded Oculus VR, said the joint project is part of his vision to turn US troops into “technomancers” by using cutting-edge tech to dominate the battlefield. He revealed on X that their first public collaboration will be a system called EagleEye, which is intended to evolve into the Army’s next Soldier Borne Mission Command platform. This new partnership comes after Microsoft initially held a similar AR contract under the same military program using its HoloLens headset. However, Microsoft confirmed in February that Anduril took over the lead, though Microsoft will still provide cloud infrastructure. It is becoming clear that the ties between Silicon Valley and the US defense establishment are deepening. Last November, Meta revised its acceptable use policies to allow its Llama language models to be used in military and national security applications. Around the same time, Anthropic made its Claude AI models available to US defense agencies through Palantir’s AI platform, hosted on AWS. Meta’s AI Vision Diverges On the other hand, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is concerned that current artificial intelligence models fall short of truly replicating human intelligence, and suggested that a fundamental shift in training methods is required to close the gap. At the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year, LeCun shared four key traits that define intelligent behavior in animals and humans: understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, reasoning ability, and the capacity for hierarchical planning. He said that today’s large language models, which power popular AI chatbots, lack these essential capabilities and that simply adding new features to existing architectures isn’t enough. Instead, LeCun advocates for a much more sophisticated approach by using what he calls “world-based models,” which will enable AI systems to simulate actions and predict how the world would change as a result. He argues that these models should learn through abstraction, much like humans do, in order to operate in an unpredictable and complex physical environment. Meta started exploring new directions, including retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to enhance model outputs with external data, and its February release of V-JEPA, a non-generative model that learns by predicting missing parts of video sequences. Still, LeCun says the industry needs to move beyond pattern-matching and embrace deeper cognitive modeling. However, Meta is also grappling with internal challenges as its AI division experiences a talent drain . Business Insider reports that only three of the original 14 researchers who developed the company’s first Llama model remain after many moved to Mistral. The exodus took place amid a lukewarm response to Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, which struggled to keep pace with offerings from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. These competitors have rolled out models that are praised for more advanced reasoning and user experience. According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta also delayed the release of its next-generation Llama model, code-named “Behemoth.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|AR,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-02 09:40:08

Currently, the spotlight turns to Pi Network (PI), with many crypto enthusiasts questioning whether it can achieve similar success. Analysis of Past Crypto Success Stories FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a rising star within the cryptocurrency sector. It has garnered substantial funding and attention due to its innovative approach to integrating AI with digital currencies. During its stage 2 presale, FPPE raised impressive funds, reflecting its growing credibility and market potential. This is evidenced by its enlistment in the $66 billion AI agent industry, where it draws strength from features like FloppyX, FloppyAI , and Meme-O-Matic. Such tools have not only enhanced user engagement but also provided monetization avenues through meme generation. The robust security measures and unique economic model of FloppyPepe, or ""Floppynomics,"" have been meticulously crafted to enhance its market standing and investor appeal, with strategies including token burns to enhance value over time. The project has been audited by Solidproof, ensuring investor confidence in its transparency and security protocols. The Potential of Pi Network (PI) Pi Network aims to democratize cryptocurrency mining through its mobile-based platform, presenting an easy-to-use interface that has attracted millions of users globally. Despite its popularity, the Pi Network's value is speculative until its expected launch on prominent exchanges. According to crypto analyst Moon Jeff , Pi's performance in the market could be pivotal for its future valuation and the potential to replicate the success of earlier meme coins such as DOGE and SHIB. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin: A Quick Recap Shiba Inu, often called the ""Dogecoin Killer,"" has made a significant impact with its dramatic price surge, cementing its position as a formidable player in the meme coin arena. Despite market fluctuations, it continues to hold a substantial community and market interest. Dogecoin's journey from a mere joke to a heavy hitter in the cryptocurrency world is nothing short of remarkable. It's a testament to the power of community support and popular media influence. Join the FloppyPepe Community Investors interested in tapping into the next big opportunity may consider looking into FloppyPepe.

That’s the fascinating perspective recently shared by SkyBridge Capital founder, Anthony Scaramucci. He argues that Stablecoins US Dollar pegged assets are not a threat, but rather a reinforcement of the greenback’s global dominance. This viewpoint challenges the common narrative and opens up an important conversation about the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the crypto world. Stablecoins US Dollar: A Digital Extension? Anthony Scaramucci took to social media platform X to address a pertinent question: Does the U.S. President have a duty to protect the dollar’s value, and do cryptocurrencies, including the often-volatile memecoins, pose a risk to this value? His response was clear and insightful, suggesting that stablecoins, specifically those pegged to the U.S. dollar, actually serve to bolster the dollar’s strength and its critical role as the global reserve currency. But how exactly do these digital tokens achieve this? At their core, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged 1:1 with a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. This stability is crucial because it bridges the gap between the volatile crypto market and the traditional financial system. When someone holds a USD-pegged stablecoin like USDT or USDC, they are essentially holding a digital representation of a U.S. dollar claim. This increases the overall demand and utility for the U.S. dollar in the digital economy. How Stablecoins Bolster the Dollar: Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins make the U.S. dollar easily transferable and accessible globally, 24/7, without relying on traditional banking hours or infrastructure. Global Trading Pairs: A vast majority of cryptocurrency trading pairs involve a USD-pegged stablecoin. This means that to participate in the crypto market, traders often need to acquire and hold these dollar-denominated digital assets. Remittance and Payments: Stablecoins offer a faster and cheaper way to send value across borders compared to traditional methods, often denominated in USD, further promoting its use internationally. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The burgeoning DeFi ecosystem heavily relies on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and trading. This creates significant demand for USD-pegged assets within this innovative financial space. US Dollar Reserve Currency: Why Stablecoins Matter The US Dollar Reserve Currency status is a cornerstone of American economic power. It means that governments and institutions worldwide hold dollars as a primary reserve asset and use it for international trade and finance. This status provides significant advantages to the U.S., including lower borrowing costs and greater influence in global financial affairs. For decades, this reserve status has been maintained through traditional banking channels, government bonds, and international agreements. However, as the global economy becomes increasingly digitized, the mechanisms by which currencies maintain relevance are also evolving. Stablecoins, by extending the reach and usability of the U.S. dollar into the digital realm, can be seen as a modern tool for reinforcing this status. Stablecoins vs. Other Digital Currencies: It’s important to distinguish USD-pegged stablecoins from other digital currencies like Bitcoin or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Feature USD-Pegged Stablecoin Bitcoin (BTC) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Value Stability Pegged to USD (aims for stability) Highly Volatile Pegged to Fiat Currency (aims for stability) Issuance Private companies/entities Decentralized mining Central Bank Purpose Bridge crypto/fiat, payments, trading, DeFi Store of value, speculative asset, peer-to-peer cash Digital form of fiat currency, potentially for payments, reserves Impact on USD Increases digital demand/utility Alternative asset (potential competition) Direct digital form of USD (if US issues one) While Bitcoin offers an alternative store of value outside the traditional system, and CBDCs represent a potential government-issued digital dollar, stablecoins offer a way for the *existing* U.S. dollar to thrive in the digital economy, driven by private innovation and market demand. Anthony Scaramucci: A Voice from Traditional Finance Why does Anthony Scaramucci ‘s opinion carry weight in this discussion? As the founder of SkyBridge Capital, a global investment firm, Scaramucci is a figure deeply rooted in traditional finance who has also embraced the potential of digital assets. SkyBridge has invested significantly in the crypto space, including Bitcoin funds. His perspective, therefore, comes from someone who understands both the mechanics of global finance and the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies. His view that stablecoins are beneficial for the dollar contrasts with some policymakers who see *all* forms of crypto as potentially undermining sovereign currencies. Scaramucci’s argument is nuanced: while speculative assets like memecoins might be volatile and pose different questions, stablecoins, by their very design and utility, can act as digital ambassadors for the U.S. dollar on the global stage. Crypto and USD: Is it Conflict or Coexistence? The relationship between Crypto and USD is complex and often debated. Critics argue that the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies could lead people to abandon fiat currencies, including the dollar. They point to concerns about illicit finance, tax evasion, and the potential for capital flight. However, Scaramucci’s point, focused specifically on stablecoins, highlights a different dynamic. Instead of competing directly as a store of value or medium of exchange in the same way Bitcoin might, USD-pegged stablecoins act more like digital infrastructure built *on top of* the dollar. They facilitate transactions and activities that might not otherwise happen as easily or efficiently using traditional dollar rails, thereby increasing the dollar’s footprint in the digital world. Even memecoins, while speculative and often lacking fundamental value, are typically traded against stablecoins (like USDT or USDC). This indirect link means that even participation in the most speculative corners of the crypto market often involves the use of a dollar-denominated digital asset, further embedding the dollar within the crypto ecosystem. Exploring Stablecoin Benefits Beyond the USD Link While their peg to the U.S. dollar is their defining characteristic in this context, it’s worth exploring other Stablecoin Benefits that contribute to their growing adoption and, consequently, their role in promoting the dollar digitally: Speed and Cost: Transactions using stablecoins on blockchain networks are typically much faster and cheaper than international wire transfers. Programmability: Stablecoins can be used in smart contracts, enabling automated financial operations like escrow, payroll, or complex derivatives in DeFi. Financial Inclusion: For individuals and businesses in regions with unstable local currencies or limited access to traditional banking, USD-pegged stablecoins offer a relatively stable digital store of value and medium of exchange. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on public blockchains, offering a degree of transparency (though privacy varies) not always present in traditional systems. These advantages make USD-pegged stablecoins attractive for a wide range of uses, from trading and yield farming to cross-border payments and online commerce, all of which increase the digital utility of the U.S. dollar. The National Debt Context Scaramucci also touched upon the national debt, noting that while addressing it is possible, it’s unlikely with the current political climate in Washington, D.C. While seemingly separate, this point adds context to the broader economic discussion. A strong U.S. dollar, potentially bolstered by its digital presence via stablecoins, can help manage the burden of national debt by maintaining confidence in U.S. assets and potentially attracting foreign investment. However, Scaramucci’s skepticism highlights the significant fiscal challenges the U.S. faces, which stablecoins alone cannot solve. Challenges and the Path Forward Despite the potential benefits, the stablecoin landscape is not without challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major hurdle. Policymakers are grappling with how to regulate stablecoin issuers to ensure reserves are adequately backed and consumer protection is in place. The collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in 2022 served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with poorly designed or unbacked stablecoins. Ensuring the stability and integrity of USD-pegged stablecoins is paramount for them to truly act as reliable digital extensions of the dollar. This requires clear regulation, robust auditing of reserves, and technological resilience. Conclusion: A Surprising Alliance? Anthony Scaramucci’s remarks offer a compelling perspective: far from undermining the U.S. dollar, stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the greenback, can act as powerful digital tools that extend its reach, utility, and ultimately, reinforce its status as the dominant global reserve currency. By providing a stable, accessible, and efficient digital form of the dollar, stablecoins integrate the traditional financial powerhouse with the innovative world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. While challenges, especially regulatory ones, need to be addressed, the potential for a symbiotic relationship between stablecoins and the U.S. dollar reserve currency role is significant. Scaramucci’s view encourages us to look beyond the surface volatility of the crypto market and recognize how certain innovations within it might actually serve to strengthen the foundations of the traditional financial system.

The launch comes as UK crypto ownership grows and new regulations take shape. From 2026, UK crypto firms must report detailed customer data on all trades. UK-listed trading firm IG Group will become the first company on the London Stock Exchange to allow retail investors to buy and sell individual cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), as part of a new digital assets service. “This is a major milestone in the UK’s crypto journey,” Michael Healy, managing director of IG’s UK business, told The Times . “Customer demand is reaching a tipping point.” Under the new offering, IG retail clients will be able to trade 38 cryptocurrencies through a partnership with Uphold, a digital assets platform. IG Group to Offer BTC, ETH, XRP, and Memecoins The selection will include popular tokens such as BTC, ETH, and XRP, as well as smaller assets like memecoin Dogwifhat. Custody of the assets will be provided by Uphold. However, holdings will not be protected under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The expansion moves IG beyond its traditional core of leveraged trading and stockbroking. It also positions the FTSE 250 firm as a more trusted alternative to existing UK-based crypto services, such as Revolut, which is not listed. Being a listed company helps to “bolster client trust,” Healy said. Interest in crypto among UK consumers is rising. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) estimated that 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency — up from just 4.4% in 2021. The move comes as the UK government finalizes new crypto regulations, aimed at providing long-awaited clarity and addressing risks in the market. However, regulators remain cautious. The FCA has repeatedly warned retail investors that cryptocurrencies lack inherent value and carry high volatility risks. In 2022, the collapse of FTX and the conviction of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, further rattled the sector. Despite these concerns, institutional interest in crypto is growing. Hedge funds and other professional investors have moved into the space in recent years, while political winds may also be shifting. In the US, President Trump has positioned himself as a crypto supporter, raising hopes for a friendlier regulatory stance. UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

Rather than framing the case as a straightforward regulatory action regarding securities law, the tweet asserts that the legal action was strategically timed to delay or obscure the development of Ripple’s private ledger, an institutional-grade blockchain system that could potentially alter the global financial landscape. According to the tweet, the real focus of the SEC lawsuit was not on protecting retail investors or establishing legal clarity around XRP, but on buying time. Time, the author suggests, for the United States and other global institutions to catch up with the infrastructure Ripple was quietly building under the radar. (1/ ) Ripple’s Private Ledger: The Real Reason the SEC Lawsuit Had to Happen You think the SEC sued Ripple to protect retail investors? Think again. This wasn’t about securities. This was about a private financial network being built under everyone’s noses… pic.twitter.com/ohP8JeGjNT — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) May 30, 2025 Capabilities and Purpose of the Private Ledger Central to this argument is Ripple’s announcement in 2021 of a private version of the XRP Ledger, which Stellar Rippler describes as being specifically designed for use by central banks and major financial institutions. This private ledger, unlike the public XRP Ledger (XRPL), is not accessible for public transaction tracking or speculative trading. It reportedly supports central bank digital currency (CBDC) issuance, offers privacy and transaction control, and is capable of processing over 10,000 transactions per second, significantly more than most existing blockchain networks. The tweet states that this private infrastructure was never meant for public hype or mass speculation. Rather, it was engineered to facilitate institutional settlement at scale, enabling central banks to conduct secure and efficient digital asset transfers with sovereignty and control. Key features, such as enhanced privacy, scalability, and customizable monetary frameworks, make it an attractive solution for governments and financial regulators. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Timing of the SEC Lawsuit and Global Financial Implications Stellar Rippler links the timing of the SEC lawsuit to this development. He said the enforcement action came just months before Ripple made its private ledger announcement. The tweet implies that regulators, and possibly influential financial entities, were already aware of the ledger’s capabilities and sought to delay its rollout. The idea is that the U.S. was unprepared to cede control of financial infrastructure that Ripple’s technology could impact, particularly systems like SWIFT , Fedwire, and other interbank settlement mechanisms. The tweet also mentions several institutions that have interacted with Ripple or shown interest in digital currency infrastructure, including the Bank of England, Saudi Central Bank, Bank of France, the BIS Innovation Hub, and organizations such as the IMF and World Economic Forum. It further notes Ripple’s stated work with over 20 central banks by 2022, although details remain undisclosed due to the private nature of the testing environments. Secrecy, Testing, and Alleged Settlement Values A key claim in the thread is that the private ledger operates entirely outside of public visibility. It is not tracked on blockchain explorers, its transaction data is not public, and its presence is mostly limited to non-public discussions, such as those that take place at closed-door financial summits. Stellar Rippler concludes that the SEC’s legal action served to keep public attention focused on less consequential aspects of the crypto market, like NFTs and meme tokens, while institutional actors quietly advanced the infrastructure needed for a monetary transition. Perhaps the most controversial assertion made is that in these private test environments, XRP has been used for settlement at values exceeding $1,000, not for speculative trading, but as part of trial scenarios involving large-scale financial institutions. There is no publicly verifiable data supporting this claim, and Ripple has not confirmed these figures. Stellar Rippler’s broader argument is that the SEC lawsuit was not meant to determine the legal status of XRP or dismantle Ripple’s operations. Instead, it was allegedly a calculated move to delay the deployment of a financial system that could shift the global balance of monetary control. While much of this remains unverified and speculative, the tweet outlines a cohesive theory that places Ripple’s private ledger at the center of a larger geopolitical and financial strategy. As the legal case between Ripple and the SEC nears resolution, public attention may shift toward what comes next, particularly regarding Ripple’s relationships with central banks and the future role of its private ledger in the evolving digital economy.

This isn’t just another chat function; according to Musk, it’s launching with robust security measures designed to protect user conversations, including end-to-end security and what he described as “Bitcoin-style encryption.” For anyone concerned about Messaging App Privacy in the digital age, this announcement from the X platform leadership is certainly attention-grabbing. What is XChat and Why is End-to-End Encryption Crucial? XChat represents X’s effort to build a comprehensive messaging system directly into the social media platform. While X (formerly Twitter) has had direct messages (DMs) for years, this new feature appears to be a significant upgrade, aiming to compete with dedicated messaging apps. At the heart of modern secure messaging is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). This is a method of secure communication that prevents third parties from reading data while it’s being transferred from one point to another. In essence, only the sender and the intended recipient can read the message. Even the service provider facilitating the communication cannot access the content. Think of it like sending a message in a locked box that only you and your friend have the key to. The postal service (the messaging platform) can carry the box, but they can’t open it to read the message inside. This is fundamentally different from traditional communication methods where the service provider (like an email provider) often has access to the content. Why is E2EE crucial for Messaging App Privacy ? Protects Against Snooping: It makes it incredibly difficult for hackers, governments, or even the platform itself to intercept and read private conversations. Enhances Trust: Users can communicate sensitive information with greater confidence, knowing their messages are for their eyes only. Prevents Data Breaches: If the platform’s servers are compromised, the encrypted message content remains unreadable to the attackers. The inclusion of E2EE in XChat is a fundamental step towards positioning it as a secure communication tool, addressing a critical user need in today’s digital environment. Decoding the “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption ” Claim Perhaps the most intriguing part of Musk’s announcement was the mention of “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption .” It’s important to clarify what this likely means in the context of a messaging app, as it doesn’t imply XChat messages are being stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin uses several cryptographic principles, primarily public-key cryptography (also known as asymmetric encryption) for securing transactions and verifying ownership. It also relies on cryptographic hashing and digital signatures. When Musk refers to “Bitcoin-style encryption” for XChat Security , he is likely referencing the application of similar robust cryptographic principles, specifically public-key cryptography, within the messaging protocol. Here’s how this might manifest: Public-Key Cryptography: Like Bitcoin uses public and private keys for sending/receiving funds securely, XChat likely uses key pairs for users. Your public key can be shared with others so they can encrypt messages only you (with your private key) can decrypt. This is standard for E2EE protocols (like Signal’s protocol, which WhatsApp and others use). Identity Verification: Similar to how Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically signed to prove they come from the owner of the private key, XChat might use digital signatures to verify the authenticity of messages and the identities of participants in a conversation. Secure Key Exchange: A critical part of E2EE is securely exchanging the keys used to encrypt and decrypt messages. Protocols often use methods inspired by cryptographic principles to ensure this exchange is secure and not vulnerable to interception. It’s less likely to mean features directly tied to the blockchain’s immutability or distributed ledger aspects, as XChat is a centralized service run by X. The term is more likely intended to evoke a sense of robust, cryptographically sound security akin to the foundational principles that make Bitcoin transactions secure, rather than integrating with the Bitcoin network itself. Beyond Encryption: Features Enhancing XChat Security and Usability Beyond the core E2EE and “Bitcoin-style” claims, Elon Musk X highlighted several other features rolling out with XChat that contribute to its functionality and potential Messaging App Privacy : End-to-End Security: While often used interchangeably with E2EE, this might imply a broader security posture encompassing not just message content but also protection against metadata leaks or other vulnerabilities within the app itself. Vanishing Messages: This popular feature allows users to set messages to automatically delete after a specified time period. This adds an extra layer of privacy, ensuring sensitive information doesn’t persist indefinitely in chat logs. It’s a common feature in secure messaging apps and enhances user control over their digital footprint. Audio and Video Calling: Integrating secure voice and video communication within the encrypted framework is crucial for a modern messaging app. Ensuring these calls are also end-to-end encrypted provides a private channel for real-time conversations. Support for All File Types: Allowing users to share any type of file (documents, photos, videos, etc.) securely within the encrypted chat environment adds significant utility. This means sensitive documents can potentially be shared without leaving the secure, encrypted channel. These features, combined with the core encryption, aim to make XChat a versatile and secure communication tool for users on the X platform. Under the Hood: Rust and a New Architecture The announcement also mentioned that the system is built using Rust and introduces a completely new architecture. For those interested in the technical underpinnings, this is noteworthy: Rust: Rust is a programming language known for its focus on memory safety and performance. Building a critical security feature like an encrypted messaging system in Rust can help mitigate common vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) that plague languages without strong memory safety guarantees. This choice suggests a focus on building a stable and secure foundation for XChat. Completely New Architecture: This implies XChat isn’t just an overlay on the old DM system but a fundamental redesign. A new architecture can be optimized for scalability, speed, and crucially, security from the ground up. This allows developers to implement modern encryption protocols and security best practices more effectively than trying to retrofit them into an older system. These technical decisions highlight an apparent commitment to building a robust and secure messaging platform, which is essential for gaining user trust in the realm of Messaging App Privacy . Benefits and Challenges for XChat Security The proposed features offer clear benefits: Enhanced User Privacy: E2EE and vanishing messages significantly improve privacy. Increased Security: Robust encryption protects against interception. Versatile Communication: File sharing, audio/video calls add functionality within a secure channel. Potential for Trust: If implemented correctly, these features could build trust with users concerned about their data. However, challenges exist: Implementation Accuracy: E2EE is complex; flaws in implementation can render it ineffective. The details of the “Bitcoin-style” aspects need clear technical explanation. Trust Deficit: Given past controversies surrounding X and its data policies, building user trust in a new, centralized messaging service with strong privacy claims might be an uphill battle for Elon Musk X . Regulatory Pressure: Strong E2EE often faces pressure from governments seeking access to communications for law enforcement or national security purposes. User Adoption: Competing with established secure messaging apps requires not just features but a proven track record and network effect. Comparing XChat’s Vision to Existing Secure Messaging Apps How does XChat’s announced feature set stack up against leaders in secure messaging? Feature XChat (Announced) Signal Telegram WhatsApp End-to-End Encryption Yes (Rolling Out) Yes (Default for all messages) Yes (For Secret Chats only) Yes (Default for all messages) “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption Claimed (Likely refers to crypto principles) Uses advanced cryptographic protocols Uses advanced cryptographic protocols Uses Signal Protocol Vanishing Messages Yes Yes Yes Yes Audio/Video Calls (E2EE) Yes Yes Yes (Group calls E2EE status varies) Yes Support for All File Types Yes Yes Yes Yes (with size limits) Underlying Tech Mentioned Rust, New Architecture Open Source, Signal Protocol Custom Protocol (MTProto) Signal Protocol Based on the announcement, XChat aims to offer a feature set comparable to other secure messaging apps, particularly regarding E2EE and related privacy features. The key differentiator and point of scrutiny will be the technical implementation and the specifics behind the “Bitcoin-style” claim. What Actionable Insights Can Users Take? For users of X and those interested in secure communication: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from X regarding the technical details of XChat’s encryption implementation. Look for whitepapers or technical documentation. Verify Claims: Skepticism is healthy in security. Wait for independent security audits or expert analysis of the XChat protocol once it’s fully rolled out. Understand E2EE: Educate yourself on how E2EE works and its limitations. Remember that E2EE protects message content, but metadata (who you talked to, when) might still be accessible to the platform. Consider Alternatives: If Messaging App Privacy is paramount, compare XChat’s features and trust model with established, audited E2EE apps like Signal. Be Mindful of Centralization: XChat is a centralized service. While E2EE protects message content, the platform operator still controls the service, user accounts, and potentially metadata. Conclusion: A Bold Step for XChat Security ? Elon Musk X ‘s announcement of XChat with End-to-End Encryption and “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption ” is a bold statement about X’s ambitions in the secure messaging space. By promising robust privacy features, support for all file types, vanishing messages, and secure calls, XChat aims to be a compelling option for users seeking more private communication within the X ecosystem. The technical choices, like building with Rust and a new architecture, suggest a serious effort to create a secure and performant system. However, the success and trustworthiness of XChat will ultimately depend on the transparency of its implementation, the verifiability of its security claims (especially the “Bitcoin-style” aspect), and X’s overall commitment to user privacy in practice. For users prioritizing Messaging App Privacy , XChat enters a competitive landscape, and its ability to build and maintain trust will be its greatest challenge.

Rumors started making the rounds on X on June 1, 2025, that Powell was stepping down and the interest rates would soon be cut. However, there has been no official confirmation, and many market analysts are waving off the claims as unfounded. This rumor, cast widely on social platform X on June 1, 2025, stated that Powell was stepping down and the interest rates would soon be cut. However, there has been no official confirmation, and many market analysts are waving off the claims as unfounded. Powel to resign tomorrow 🚨 I see lots of these nonsense posts on CT today Let me tell you 1st – it’s not gonna happen 2nd – if that happened, the markets would dump significantly ⚡️ Why? Trust in dollar and US economy would decrease instantly Just remember what happened… pic.twitter.com/1U2wEVNFE5 — Lana Queen (@Lana_Queen7) June 1, 2025 Polymarket traders seemed equally unimpressed. Despite the rumor, the odds on the prediction market for the question ‘Will Trump remove Jerome Powell in 2025?’ stayed steady at 14%, indicating no increase in confidence in the rumor. Analysts said this skepticism stemmed from a lack of institutional support and a constitutional limit to dismissing the Fed chair. Trump met with Powell on Thursday at the White House, their first sit down since the president’s return to office. The Fed statement said Powell did not appear to shift the policy direction and reiterated that monetary decisions would remain strictly data-dependent. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that meeting, saying that Trump pressed Powell to cut interest rates, citing his country’s economic disadvantage compared to countries like China. Trump has made no secret that he is frustrated with the Fed chair. In April, he tweeted on Truth Social that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” He later walked that back, saying he “had no intention” of firing him. The Supreme Court has weighed in as well, making it quite clear that Trump does not have the power to dismiss the Fed chair before his term ends in 2026. Fed independence tested as pressure builds Trump has softened the tone in recent days, telling an interviewer that he’s not planning to fire Powell but that he needs to be replaced soon. Trump noted, however, that Powell’s term ends only in a very short period in 2026. However, uncertainty has reignited fears that the Fed is not truly independent. The latest threats from Trump have come after periods of volatility. In one high-profile case, his social media comments sparked more than a few days of market mayhem in April. Interest rates have remained at 4.25% to 4.50% at the central bank’s three latest meetings. Powell has repeatedly refused to bow to political influence and insisted decisions must follow macroeconomic data, not presidential preferences. Powell said in his public remarks that he has not asked for a meeting with any US president and that the central bank must remain independent. A recent Supreme Court ruling allowing Trump to keep some of his dismissed independent agency employees off the job also had some indirect implications, some legal analysts noted. However, the court noted that the deal does not extend to the Federal Reserve, which the court called a uniquely structured body that behaved independently in the past. Bitcoin holds strong amid political uncertainty Bitcoin decoupled from traditional market movements as political tensions rise. Bitcoin traded above $105,000 despite Wall Street’s decline and the U.S. dollar falling to a three-year low. CryptoQuant data suggests that the current rally is getting close to a possible short-term top. The trend remains bullish, but further political uncertainty, which could see volatility spike, may prompt profit-taking. Trump appointed Powell in 2018, and his current term is until May 2026. While he has kept silent on Trump’s personal attacks, he has repeatedly stuck to the Fed’s familiar message of steady prices and maximum employment. He’s also said he did not ask to see any sitting president when he was in office. Powell met the president twice during Trump’s first term—once on his birthday and again later that year. The latest meeting was the first in-person face-to-face exchange during Trump’s second term, which followed months of public pressure.

It was the largest wipeout since February, with nearly 90% of losses stemming from traders betting on the upside. Major futures positions on BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE were forcibly closed as cascading liquidations kicked in across exchanges. One headline-grabbing casualty was James Wynn, a whale known for aggressive bets, who reportedly lost nearly all his capital after a $1.25 billion BTC long backfired. As events like this unfold, many investors are starting to view traditional trading as a high-risk arena and are now leaning toward presales—where the entry cost is low and the upside potential remains significant, especially during launches. Volatility Wrecks Traders as Attention Shifts to High-Upside Presales The latest correction has again exposed the vulnerability of leveraged traders. Bitcoin’s sharp retracement below $104,000 erased nearly $700 million in open long positions. This wasn’t a quiet correction—it was a market-wide flush. The effects rippled across Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, all posting significant single-day losses. Futures trading, which had seen renewed enthusiasm with open interest surging 51% since April, became the center of collapse. Traders who overexposed themselves to bullish derivatives faced rapid forced closures, amplifying the sell-off. Presales offer a middle ground between passive investing and active trading. They retain the upside that excites traders but without the exposure to intraday volatility. I’ll run it back, I always doAnd I’ll enjoy doing itI like playing the gameI like the swingsMoney is all about mindsetAt the end of the day, I’m still richer than 99.9% of CT brokiesI took a large and calculated bet at making billions, most of you wouldn’t dare,… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 31, 2025 Among the most dramatic losses was that of James Wynn, whose on-chain trading activity had earned both praise and scrutiny. Starting with just $4,000, he built up an astonishing $100+ million portfolio through daring long positions on BTC and various tokens. But during the tariff-induced drop, Wynn entered an enormous $1.25 billion long on Bitcoin. As the price slid below $105,000, the position unraveled catastrophically. Fees and slippage contributed to a $37 million loss in a single trade. In the following days, Wynn attempted to recover using high-risk memecoin positions across PEPE, TRUMP, SUI, and others. These too were liquidated as volatility persisted. What remained in his account: $23. Wynn’s story has become more than just drama—it’s now a case study. In forums, his name trends not with admiration, but as a warning. This has led to a change in mindset. While traditional trading allows fast gains, it also demands constant risk tolerance. Investors who were drawn to trading for potential returns are now gravitating toward presales—projects that launch with micro market caps and the possibility of a 10x to 100x increase. These tokens often begin at fractions of a cent, and unlike active trading, they require no timing precision or leverage to deliver gains. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Presales That Could 10x or More SUBBD As traditional trading continues to burn high-leverage players, a shift is happening toward presales that combine utility with long-term viability. SUBBD is drawing attention for precisely that reason. Instead of relying on speculative hype, it introduces a model that reshapes how content creators monetize their work. At its foundation is a decentralized protocol that lets creators issue their own branded tokens directly to supporters, bypassing outdated subscription models and eliminating platform fees that typically drain creator income. The $SUBBD token serves both creators and their communities. For users, it’s a gateway to exclusive content, early drops, private communities, and even voting rights on creator-driven proposals. For creators, it’s a means to lock in recurring income without surrendering control to centralized platforms. It removes the instability associated with ad-driven monetization and reimagines patronage as an investment-based ecosystem. What makes SUBBD relevant right now is its contrast with speculative derivatives. Instead of chasing volatility, it supports a system where holders are incentivized through staking, creator growth, and demand-driven appreciation. Projects like this are gaining traction because they align with the current investor mood—less exposure to sudden crashes, more focus on potential that compounds over time. With presale access offering early exposure to a fixed token supply and an ecosystem that thrives on creator output, SUBBD appeals to those who still seek aggressive upside but prefer not to live on the edge of liquidation. It answers volatility not with avoidance, but with real infrastructure for sustainable token growth. Snorter When traders like James Wynn lose millions overnight, it brings renewed attention to tools that simplify entry into crypto while avoiding such destructive risk. Snorter is a presale project building precisely in that direction—an automated trading assistant designed for on-chain users who want access to market opportunities without drowning in technical complexity or leverage. Snorter functions as a Telegram-integrated bot that scans for newly launched tokens, verifies contract safety, and even provides gas-efficient sniping features—all within a few taps. Built to streamline Solana-based token trading, it gives retail users the type of agility typically reserved for more seasoned, manually active traders. The value here is access, not leverage. But it’s not just a shortcut to memecoin speculation. Snorter has laid out a plan for tiered access models, a staking-backed subscription utility, and a revenue-sharing structure for early holders of its $SNORT token. Every time a trade is routed through Snorter, protocol fees are distributed to token holders, creating a system that rewards usage rather than speculation. In the wake of cascading market liquidations, tools like this gain weight. They don’t ask users to predict tops or bottoms. Instead, they offer infrastructure to improve trade execution, mitigate risks, and find alpha without depending on futures markets. As volatility shakes the confidence of many, Snorter’s presale represents a calculated pivot toward smarter trading—not riskier one. It’s utility-first, trader-friendly, and designed to reward participation without forcing exposure to the kind of positions that erased fortunes this week. Solaxy With risk tolerance shaken and derivatives growing more unpredictable, investor attention is turning to projects grounded in infrastructure and purpose. Solaxy is one of the few current presales combining both, offering an energy-efficient Layer 2 designed for cross-chain functionality between Ethereum and Solana. At a time when whales are taking profits and traders are sidelined, Solaxy offers a way to align with foundational tech rather than market timing. What sets Solaxy apart is its lightweight validation system. Rather than duplicating heavy chain activity, Solaxy enables smart contract execution with minimal fees and high throughput. This opens up room for DeFi tools, gaming, and staking to function with real-time efficiency and reduced cost. The native token, SOLX, carries the protocol's utility—used for staking, transaction fees, and node incentivization. It’s also how users participate in governance, with plans for decentralized upgrades and cross-chain bridges decided directly through token votes. During the recent market downturn, networks with high gas fees and slower transaction speeds became a source of frustration for developers and users alike. Solaxy’s presale stands out as a response to that tension. Rather than launching into the chaos of an exchange listing, it begins with early incentives, liquidity support, and time to build a network effect without being disrupted by volatility—a thought shared by ClayBro , a popular creator who covered the project on his YouTube channel. Presales like Solaxy are finding traction not because they promise hype, but because they address structural gaps left unfilled by overleveraged projects. For those pivoting from reactive trading toward long-term protocol exposure, Solaxy offers a calm and calculated entry. Best Wallet Token As liquidations unsettle even the most experienced traders, a growing number are shifting their attention toward ecosystems that offer stability, autonomy, and passive growth—all of which define Best Wallet’s vision. Best Wallet Token’s main product is a non-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet, but it’s far more than just a place to store tokens. It’s a financial toolset, equipped for staking, presale access, portfolio tracking, and on-chain trading—all wrapped into one mobile-first platform. The native token, BEST, acts as a value driver across this ecosystem. It unlocks staking rewards, early access to exclusive token launches via the wallet’s built-in presale aggregator, and future governance participation as the platform moves toward full decentralization. Holders also benefit from performance-based airdrops and trading incentives built directly into the wallet UI, giving BEST utility far beyond mere speculation. In a market where traders are being wiped out chasing fast returns, Best Wallet offers an alternative flow of rewards—one tied to usage, staking, and steady growth. It’s no surprise that attention is turning to it now. It operates quietly in the background, while traders reeling from lost leverage begin valuing reliability. What makes its presale timely is the current user sentiment: less tolerance for noise, more interest in products with real demand. The wallet already supports 60+ chains, shows cross-chain compatibility, and is built with institutional-grade encryption. This is not a bet on market sentiment—it’s a platform that continues to gain traction no matter which way the charts move. BTC Bull For traders who built fortunes overnight and lost them just as fast, BTC Bull is starting to look like a much-needed change of pace. It doesn’t rely on rapid scalping or high-risk plays. Instead, it rewards conviction—offering token airdrops tied to Bitcoin milestones and incentivizing users for simply staying engaged as BTC continues its long-term climb. The project is rooted in a philosophy that reflects the original ethos of Bitcoin: community-driven value backed by transparent incentives. With every major price threshold BTC crosses—$110k, $120k, and beyond—holders of BTC Bull’s native token receive milestone-based rewards, while a portion of tokens are burned, ensuring a deflationary supply curve. This system appeals to those who understand timing the market often fails, but being present during key moments matters more. Bitcoin hit $111K. 🐂🔥The first BTCBULL burn milestone is getting closer. pic.twitter.com/1iHi376vQl — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 22, 2025 It’s not just about passive rewards, though. BTC Bull also incorporates a structured staking model with tiered APY based on holding behavior. The longer tokens are staked, the greater the returns, creating a rhythm of engagement rather than speculative chaos. While James Wynn’s story is a cautionary tale of what happens when risk goes unchecked, BTC Bull presents a counterbalance: consistent growth built around the strongest asset in crypto. Its presale offers access before token burns and airdrop triggers come into play. For investors looking to stay exposed to Bitcoin’s rise without dancing around leverage, BTC Bull opens up that path—with clarity, structure, and none of the turbulence that took down traders last week. Conclusion For those rethinking their strategy after a tricky week in the markets, presales offer a path that doesn’t demand constant chart-watching or exposure to high-stakes trades. With lower initial valuations and clear utility baked in from the start, these early-stage opportunities present a chance to enter projects before the rest of the market catches on. In times like these, when volatility leaves little room for error, finding entry points that prioritize long-term potential over short-term risk may be the smartest move forward.

A significant movement was detected: 200 million XRP tokens have been locked away in escrow at Ripple. While this might sound like a major event, it’s a routine part of Ripple’s long-term strategy for managing the supply of XRP . Let’s delve into what this means and why it’s a key piece of the puzzle in understanding XRP price dynamics and the broader crypto market . What is Ripple Escrow and Why Does it Matter? At its core, the Ripple escrow mechanism is a feature on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) that allows parties to cryptographically secure XRP for a specified period or until a certain condition is met. Ripple Labs, the company most associated with XRP , utilizes this feature extensively to manage the vast majority of the XRP it holds. Here’s why this mechanism is crucial: Supply Management: When XRP is locked in escrow, it is removed from the circulating supply. This prevents a large number of tokens from flooding the market all at once, which could potentially have a negative impact on the XRP price . Predictability: Ripple’s escrow system is designed to be predictable. A large portion of their XRP is locked in a series of escrows that release on a monthly schedule. This provides transparency regarding future potential supply increases. Commitment Signal: By locking up tokens, Ripple signals its long-term commitment to the XRP ecosystem and its intention to release the tokens gradually and strategically, rather than dumping them on the market. The locking of 200 million XRP , as reported by Whale Alert, is typically part of this ongoing, scheduled process where unlocked tokens from the previous month’s release that were not sold or used are returned to escrow. The History of Ripple’s XRP Escrow Strategy To truly appreciate the significance of the Ripple escrow , we need to look back at its origin. In December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP – which was roughly 88% of its total holdings at the time – into a series of escrow accounts on the XRP Ledger. This move was a direct response to concerns from the community about the potential for Ripple to sell off its large holdings, which was seen as a risk to the stability of the XRP price . The 55 billion XRP were divided into 55 individual escrow accounts, each holding 1 billion XRP . These escrows were programmed to expire on the first day of each month for 55 consecutive months, starting in January 2018. Here’s how the monthly cycle generally works: On the first day of the month, one billion XRP is released from escrow to Ripple. Ripple then has access to this billion XRP for the duration of the month. Any portion of that billion XRP that is not sold, used for partnerships, or otherwise distributed by the end of the month is typically placed back into a new escrow account with a later release date. The 200 million XRP being locked is likely a portion of the 1 billion XRP that was released at the start of the current month, which Ripple decided not to use and has now returned to escrow for future release. How Does the Ripple Escrow Release Impact XRP Price ? The monthly release of 1 billion XRP from escrow is a closely watched event in the crypto market . While 1 billion XRP is a large number, it’s important to consider it in the context of the total supply and trading volume. Historically, the release itself doesn’t automatically cause a price drop. The potential impact on XRP price depends more on what Ripple *does* with the released tokens. If Ripple sells a significant portion on exchanges, it could increase selling pressure. However, if they use the tokens for strategic investments, partnerships, or simply return them to escrow, the market impact is minimal or non-existent. The fact that 200 million XRP is being returned to escrow suggests that Ripple did not utilize the full 1 billion released this month, which is generally viewed positively by the market as it indicates restraint in increasing the circulating supply. Understanding the Role of Digital Assets in Supply Management The Ripple escrow provides a fascinating case study in how issuers of large-cap digital assets can manage their supply to foster stability and predictability. Unlike traditional commodities or even fiat currencies where supply is controlled by mining rates or central banks, the supply schedule of many cryptocurrencies is predetermined or managed through smart contracts or similar mechanisms. For large token holders, especially the issuing entity, transparent and predictable supply management is key to building market confidence. When investors know the potential supply increases are governed by clear rules (like the escrow schedule), it reduces uncertainty and speculation based purely on potential large-scale sales by the issuer. Other projects in the crypto market use different vesting schedules, lock-up periods, or burning mechanisms, but Ripple’s large-scale, time-based escrow is one of the most prominent examples of an issuer actively managing a significant portion of a digital currency ‘s supply. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market ? While the locking of 200 million XRP is specific to Ripple, it highlights broader themes relevant to the entire crypto market : Importance of Tokenomics: The event underscores how crucial tokenomics – the study of how a cryptocurrency works within its ecosystem – is for investors. Understanding supply schedules, distribution models, and issuer holdings is vital. Transparency Builds Trust: Ripple’s use of a public ledger feature (XRPL escrow) for supply management allows anyone to verify the locked amounts and release schedules, contributing to transparency. Issuer Influence: It demonstrates that even in decentralized ecosystems, the actions of major holders or issuing entities can significantly influence market dynamics and sentiment regarding specific digital assets . For those tracking crypto news , monitoring such large movements and understanding the underlying mechanisms like the Ripple escrow provides valuable insight into the forces shaping asset values. Benefits and Considerations of Ripple’s Escrow Let’s summarize the key aspects of this strategy: Benefit Explanation Predictable Supply Market knows the maximum amount of XRP that can enter circulation each month. Reduced Market Flood Risk Prevents Ripple from suddenly selling off its entire holdings. Enhanced Transparency Escrow details are verifiable on the public ledger. Long-Term Signal Indicates Ripple’s commitment to the future of XRP . However, there are also considerations: Monthly Release Pressure: Although often returned, the monthly release of 1 billion XRP is a constant supply overhang that the market watches. Ripple’s Discretion: While the release is scheduled, Ripple still has discretion over how much of the released amount is actually sold or distributed, which introduces some level of uncertainty regarding immediate supply increases. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Know? For investors and participants in the crypto market interested in XRP , here are a few takeaways: Monitor Escrow Reports: Pay attention to reports from sources like Whale Alert regarding large XRP movements, especially those involving escrow. Understand the Cycle: Remember the monthly 1 billion XRP release and the subsequent return to escrow of unused portions. Don’t panic just because a release happens; focus on what Ripple *does* with the released tokens. Context is Key: A 200 million XRP lock is a routine event, not an anomaly. It’s part of a larger, predefined strategy. Focus on Fundamentals: While supply is important, also consider other factors affecting XRP price , such as utility, adoption, regulatory developments (especially the ongoing SEC lawsuit), and overall crypto market sentiment. Conclusion The recent report of 200 million XRP being locked in Ripple escrow is a standard occurrence within Ripple’s established supply management framework. This mechanism, designed to provide predictability and prevent market saturation, is a crucial aspect of XRP tokenomics. By locking the vast majority of their holdings and releasing them on a clear schedule, Ripple aims to foster confidence in XRP as a digital currency . While the monthly release is always noted by the crypto market , the return of unused tokens to escrow, as seen with the 200 million XRP , is generally a positive signal indicating responsible supply management.

Earlier today, Amonyx, a prominent crypto commentator on X, amplified a fresh update from Egrag that has sent waves of excitement through the XRP community. According to Amonyx’s post, Egrag’s latest chart signals that XRP is on the brink of a monumental surge, with price targets ranging from $10.70 to an eye-popping $55 and beyond. Chart Patterns Signal Historical Repetition As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.15, exhibiting a mere 1.05% price appreciation over the past day. What’s driving the latest hype is the technical structure outlined by Egrag Crypto. He describes the current phase as “Move 1”, a setup phase that has historically preceded XRP’s strongest breakouts. The next anticipated phase, “Move 2,” is where the fireworks are expected: a sharp liftoff that could catapult XRP into uncharted price territories. BREAKING: @egragcrypto just dropped a BOMB on #XRP History repeating? Move 1 Move 2 = Liftoff Current Price: $2.16 Targets: $10.7 • $18 • $27 • $55+ This chart screams: MOON VERY SOON pic.twitter.com/YJ81J82WyF — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 2, 2025 Egrag is known for his meticulous analysis of fractals, repeating historical patterns in price movements, and this latest call is no exception. By overlaying past price behaviors on the current chart, he suggests that XRP is mimicking a previous cycle that led to a significant bull run. If past patterns hold, the potential targets are remarkable: $10.70, followed by $18, $27, and possibly surging to $55 or beyond. Fueling the Momentum: Broader Market Context This bullish outlook does not exist in a vacuum. Ripple’s expanding partnerships with major financial institutions and central banks globally continue to strengthen the fundamental case for XRP as a cross-border settlement asset.

Japanese Metaplanet Buys Another 1,088 Bitcoins Its current value is over $930 million. The acquisition strengthens Metaplanet’s position as Asia’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder and one of the top 10 institutional Bitcoin holders globally. The latest purchase, which was made at an average price of 15.5 million yen ($108,051) per BTC, cost the company 16.885 billion yen (about $117.5 million). The announcement comes after Metaplanet recently issued $50 million in zero-interest bonds, signaling that its aggressive approach to Bitcoin accumulation will continue. With this acquisition, Metaplanet has moved one step closer to its year-end goal of 10,000 BTC, having acquired 7,126 BTC in 2025 alone. Since adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy in April 2024, the company has rapidly risen among institutional holders, drawing parallels with US software firm MicroStrategy, which continues to lead the global market with 580,250 BTC. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich has openly cited MicroStrategy and its chairman Michael Saylor as the inspiration behind the firm’s Bitcoin-centric strategy. Gerovich has previously outlined the firm’s long-term vision, saying, “Bitcoin is the foundation of a new financial paradigm.” Metaplanet’s success has spurred similar moves from other companies, including Twenty One, led by Bitcoin advocate Jack Mallers. Beyond Bitcoin, a growing number of firms are now turning to Ether, XRP, Solana, and other digital assets to build crypto-based corporate treasuries. Following the announcement, Metaplanet shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 2.34% to 1,094 yen as of 1:15 p.m. local time. The stock has risen more than twentyfold in the past year, according to Yahoo Finance data. However, its U.S. OTC-listed shares (MTPLF) closed down 7.64% at $7.25 on Friday. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price continues to consolidate and is currently trading around $105,000 after retreating from an all-time high of $111,800 last week. Market watchers see Metaplanet’s ongoing accumulation as a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory amid ongoing institutional adoption. *This is not investment advice.

According to data from Tokenomist, this week, from June 2 to June 9, Taiko (TAIKO), Ethena ( ENA ), and Neon (NEON) are facing major cliff unlocks that could exert significant downward pressure on their prices. TAIKO and NEON are facing the biggest cliff unlocks in terms of supply impact, with TAIKO unlocking 81.55 million tokens—71.23% of its total unlock supply—valued at $47.4 million, and NEON unlocking 53.19 million tokens, or 6.48% of its unlock supply, worth $6.94 million. Source: @WuBlockchain Will TAIKO cliff unlock send its price back to ATL? Taiko (TAIKO) is facing the largest upcoming cliff token unlock in the next 7 days, which carries a massive downside risk based on the recent price action and indicators. After attempting a reversal in late April and again in May — marked by two consecutive higher highs and breaks above EMA 20 — the momentum failed to hold. The price then made a lower high, pulled back, consolidated, and then broke below the local horizontal support at around $0.70, dropping to the $0.55 level and falling back below the EMA 20. The RSI also crossed below its moving average and currently sits at 34, pointing downward, confirming weakening momentum. Given the failed reversal attempts and a confirmed breakdown to lower levels, the upcoming token unlock poses a high risk of pushing TAIKO price below the critical support at $0.48 — its all-time low. The sharp 16% drop on May 31, accompanied by a massive volume spike, likely reflects investors anticipation of further downside due to this unlock. Source: TradingView You might also like: TAIKO layer 2 token debuts on Revolut, gaining access to over 45 million users Will the upcoming NEON unlock send its price back to $0.10 Similarly to TAIKO, Neon (NEON) price recently broke below its EMA 20 after a period of tight consolidation around it. This came after a brief but sharp spike in mid-May, where the price surged by over 40% in a single day, only to retrace most of the gains immediately the next day. Source: TradingView Price action shows rejection at every attempt to reclaim the $0.13–$0.15 range, and with volume thinning out, sellers appear to be regaining control. The RSI is currently at 42, below its moving average and sloping downward, reinforcing the bearish momentum. With the upcoming unlock, NEON price risks retesting the critical support around $0.11. A break below that level would likely expose the $0.095 zone, which served as a previous base. You might also like: Ethena slides as $12M token unlock casts shadow over ENA price Meanwhile, ENA’s unlock is larger in absolute value at $65.86 million for 212.5 million tokens, but it represents a much smaller 3.72% portion of its unlockable supply.

Many traders suspected it was a self-transfer, but crypto sleuth ZachXBT found the source to be ‘questionable.’ According to data from on-chain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence, Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s crypto wallet received 300.001 BTC ( BTC ) on May 30. The donation came from an unknown wallet , before it was moved by Ulbricht to a different wallet a day later. At current market prices, the 300 BTC donation is worth around $31.7 million. At press time, Bitcoin has gone up by 1.26% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been trading hands at $105,666. Initially, traders suspected the BTC donation was actually a self-transfer from the Silk Road founder’s own funds. This theory came from social media users who speculated that Ulbricht still had funds hidden away from his Silk Road days before he was sentenced to imprisonment. However, on-chain investigator ZachXBT believed the BTC transfer was unlikely to come from Ulbricht himself. “It likely doesn’t appear to be a self donation as people were claiming though it comes from a questionable sources due to the flagged address,” said ZachXBT in his post .

He stated that Jambler was an odd choice, considering most traders tend to use the more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai. Meanwhile, he said very few entities regularly use Jambler for large funds. Not only that, the blockchain investigator also discovered that it was likely the 300 BTC originated from two dormant addresses. One address was created in 2014, while the other wallet was active back in 2019. However, the second wallet was previously flagged as suspicious by compliance tools. Moreover, ZachXBT found that the two wallets had previously deposited large amounts of crypto into Jambler sometime between April and May. The on-chain investigator noted that the deposits match the timing of the donation sent to Ulbricht’s wallet. Ever since he was released from prison thanks to a pardon from President Trump last January, the Silk Road founder has been trying to auction some of his personal belongings. So far, he has raised more than $1.8 million worth of BTC from the sales, garnering support from the crypto community. Most recently, Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun gifted Ulbricht the iconic banana and duct tape artwork dubbed the “Comedian” on May 30.

At the recent Bitcoin Conference, he predicted Bitcoin could hit anywhere between $250,000-$500,000 in the coming years. But that wasn’t all. Hoskinson also shared Cardano’s latest moves in decentralized finance (DeFi), including plans to integrate XRP into its growing ecosystem. His long-term vision? A $10 trillion Bitcoin market backed by new infrastructure, smart contract layers, and real-world DeFi use cases that expand well beyond Bitcoin alone. Sounds exciting. Let’s dive in. Hoskinson’s Bitcoin Price Outlook Speaking during a session hosted by Input Output Global (IOG), Hoskinson said the path to a six-figure Bitcoin is being driven by increasing inflows and the shift toward Bitcoin as a store of value that now also taps into the power of DeFi. He looked back at Bitcoin’s early days, where small-scale mining and peer-to-peer transfers were the norm, contrasting them with today’s large mining operations and evolving network needs. While Bitcoin has held onto its original principles, its limitations are becoming more visible today. Bitcoin’s Core Principles vs. DeFi Potential Hoskinson pointed out three key rules that have always defined Bitcoin: All transactions must use only BTC Fees must be paid in BTC Yield must come only from BTC These rules help protect Bitcoin’s identity but have made DeFi integration extremely difficult. That’s where Cardano’s new approach comes in. Hoskinson introduced a modular infrastructure stack designed to add DeFi compatibility to Bitcoin without changing its core. He mentioned projects like Sundial, the Bitcoin Operating System, and work from infrastructure players such as Sergey Lerner and the Fairgate team as examples of how this can be achieved. He also highlighted new wallet designs from IOG that let users switch between regular Bitcoin use and DeFi features, while still using BTC for everything. This opens the door to lending, borrowing, and more – without compromising Bitcoin’s core ideals. Today at @TheBitcoinConf we demoed how we’re bringing Bitcoin and Cardano together. Bitcoin has the reach, but DeFi unlocks its full potential. We’re building the technology to bridge them. Everyone deserves access to the global economy. Be part of it. #Bitcoin2025 pic.twitter.com/K8r2qLR1fH — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) May 27, 2025 Cardano’s Bold XRP DeFi Integration Plan Hoskinson also confirmed that Cardano is working to bring XRP into its DeFi ecosystem, tapping into XRP’s strong reputation for cross-border payments. This integration could help form a seamless, scalable multi-chain ecosystem where Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano can operate together – boosting financial access and inclusion worldwide. “Everyone deserves access to the economy,” InputOutput stated on X , sparking excitement among crypto enthusiasts. Exciting Times Ahead Hoskinson’s bold prediction of a Bitcoin price surge and Cardano’s DeFi breakthroughs signal a progressive time ahead for crypto.

May proved to be a powerhouse month for US Bitcoin ETF inflows , showcasing robust demand from investors, particularly those operating within traditional finance. The figures are in, and they paint a clear picture of growing interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated, accessible investment vehicles. What’s Behind the Surge in US Bitcoin ETF Inflows? According to data shared by crypto market observer Trader T on X, U.S. spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) saw a significant net inflow of $5.2 billion throughout the month of May. To put that into perspective, this monumental inflow is equivalent to roughly 50,000 BTC being added to the holdings of these investment products over just 31 days. This follows a period of more modest inflows or even outflows in prior months, making May’s performance particularly notable. Looking at the broader second quarter of 2025 so far, the total net inflows into these US-based Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive milestone of approximately 80,000 BTC . This cumulative figure underscores a strengthening trend throughout Q2, suggesting that May wasn’t just a flash in the pan but part of sustained interest. The primary driver behind this significant surge appears to be increasing appetite from institutions and professional investors who are becoming more comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin via the ETF structure. ETFs offer a familiar, regulated wrapper that simplifies compliance and integration into traditional portfolios compared to direct spot Bitcoin purchases or other less regulated products. Breaking Down the May Bitcoin ETF Investment Landscape While the overall picture is one of strong positive flows, a closer look at individual fund performance reveals distinct trends within the Bitcoin ETF investment space. The market saw a clear leader emerge, alongside some continued outflows from existing products. Here’s a snapshot of the key figures for May: ETF Ticker Fund Name May Net Flow Notes IBIT BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust +$5.9 billion Leading the pack by a significant margin GBTC Grayscale Bitcoin Trust -$421 million Continued, albeit slowing, outflows ARKB ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF -$292 million Experiencing outflows during the month Other ETFs (Fidelity, Bitwise, etc.) ~-$287 million (estimated net) Mixed performance among smaller funds Total Net Inflow All US Spot Bitcoin ETFs +$5.2 billion Strong overall positive movement BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the undisputed heavyweight champion of May inflows, attracting a staggering $5.9 billion. This performance highlights BlackRock’s massive reach and the trust placed in their brand by large investors. Their competitive fee structure and broad distribution network likely contributed significantly to this dominance. On the other hand, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to see outflows, though at a much slower pace than in the initial weeks following its conversion to a spot ETF. These outflows are often attributed to investors taking profits, rebalancing portfolios, or switching to newer ETFs with lower management fees. ARK Invest’s ARKB also experienced outflows in May, indicating some rotation or repositioning among investors holding various Bitcoin ETF products. How Are May Bitcoin ETF Inflows Impacting Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The substantial inflows recorded in May are a powerful indicator of accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption. While retail investors certainly participate in these ETFs, the sheer volume and the types of firms likely utilizing products from major asset managers like BlackRock point towards increasing institutional involvement. Why are institutions favoring these ETFs? The reasons are multifaceted: Regulatory Clarity: Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. operate under established securities regulations, providing a level of compliance and oversight that traditional institutions require. Ease of Access: These products can be bought and sold through standard brokerage accounts, integrating seamlessly into existing investment workflows and portfolio management systems. No Custody Hassle: Institutions are relieved of the complex and often burdensome task of securely holding and managing private keys for actual Bitcoin. Liquidity: High trading volumes in the major ETFs ensure that institutions can enter and exit positions efficiently without significant market impact. The consistent buying pressure from these large inflows suggests that institutions view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but increasingly as a legitimate component for diversification or a hedge within broader investment strategies. This trend is crucial for the long-term maturation and stability of the Bitcoin market. What Do These May Bitcoin ETF Numbers Mean for Crypto Market Trends? The strong performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in May has significant implications for broader crypto market trends . These inflows represent sustained, external capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem, absorbing available supply on exchanges and potentially putting upward pressure on price. Unlike the more volatile swings often associated with retail trading sentiment, institutional flows tend to be larger, more strategic, and indicative of longer-term positioning. The consistent demand demonstrated in May suggests underlying strength in the market structure, providing a potential counterbalance to selling pressure from other sources. Furthermore, the success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other crypto-based ETFs in the future, potentially opening up traditional investment channels for other digital assets and further integrating the crypto market with global finance. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges in Bitcoin ETF Investment For investors considering participating in the Bitcoin ETF investment landscape, May’s data highlights both compelling opportunities and important considerations: Opportunities: Simplified Exposure: Easily add Bitcoin exposure to a traditional investment portfolio. Diversification: Bitcoin can offer diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets (though this can change). Potential for Growth: Continued institutional adoption fueled by inflows could drive significant future price appreciation. Liquidity: High trading volume makes buying and selling straightforward. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset, and ETF value will fluctuate accordingly. Fees: While competitive, ETFs have management fees that can impact long-term returns compared to holding spot Bitcoin directly (though direct holding has its own costs/risks). Tracking Error: ETFs aim to track the price of Bitcoin, but small discrepancies can occur. Market Risk: The value is tied directly to the performance of Bitcoin, which can be influenced by global macro factors, regulatory news, and market sentiment. Actionable Insight: Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment goals. While the inflows are positive news, they don’t eliminate the inherent risks of the crypto market. Researching specific ETF fees, structures, and the reputation of the issuer is crucial before investing. The Future Outlook May’s strong performance sets a positive tone for the remainder of Q2 and beyond. If these inflow trends continue, they could absorb a significant portion of the new Bitcoin supply entering the market post-halving and potentially lead to further price discovery. However, the market is dynamic. Factors such as changes in macroeconomic policy, further regulatory developments, or shifts in institutional sentiment could influence future flow patterns. Monitoring these ETF numbers provides a vital pulse check on institutional engagement with the leading cryptocurrency. Conclusion The $5.2 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs in May, contributing to an 80,000 BTC total for Q2 so far, is a powerful testament to increasing investor confidence and adoption. Led by BlackRock’s dominant performance, these figures underscore the growing significance of institutional capital in the Bitcoin market. While challenges and volatility remain, the strong demand through regulated ETF channels signals a maturing market and highlights Bitcoin’s increasing integration into traditional finance. These inflows are a key indicator for anyone tracking the evolution of the crypto landscape.

You’re not alone. Many crypto traders are finding traditional long-term ‘HODLing’ strategies challenging in the current economic climate. The global financial landscape is constantly shifting, and recent developments, particularly concerning international trade policies like the Trump tariffs, have injected significant market uncertainty crypto -wide. This environment is prompting a notable pivot towards more agile, short-term crypto trading approaches. This shift isn’t just a fad; it’s a strategic adaptation driven by the need to protect capital and seize fleeting opportunities in unpredictable conditions. Understanding Market Uncertainty Crypto Faces Today The crypto market, while often seen as uncorrelated, is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors. The trade policies enacted under U.S. President Donald Trump, specifically the imposition of tariffs on goods from countries like China, created significant ripples across global markets. This wasn’t just about tariffs; it was about the unpredictability of negotiations, the threat of escalation, and the potential impact on international trade flows and economic growth. This constant state of flux breeds market uncertainty crypto participants must contend with. Think about it: traditional assets like stocks and commodities react strongly to trade war news. As crypto gains mainstream attention and institutional involvement, it becomes more susceptible to these same pressures. A sudden tweet or a stalled negotiation can send shockwaves, causing rapid price swings in Bitcoin and altcoins. This heightened sensitivity makes long-term planning difficult, as the fundamental value propositions of assets can be temporarily overshadowed by geopolitical events. For crypto traders , this means adapting their perspective from years to days, or even hours. Why the Pivot to Short-Term Crypto Trading Strategies? In times of elevated market uncertainty crypto participants look for ways to minimize risk exposure while still seeking profitability. Holding assets for months or years leaves traders vulnerable to sudden, unpredictable downturns triggered by external events like trade wars or regulatory announcements. This is where short-term crypto trading gains appeal. According to Taoshi CEO Arrash Yasavolian, as reported by Cointelegraph, traders are increasingly prioritizing quick profit-taking over holding positions. The rationale is simple: enter a trade, capture a small gain from a short-term price movement, and exit quickly. This reduces the risk of being caught in a major overnight or multi-day price collapse caused by unexpected news related to tariffs or trade negotiations. It’s a strategy focused on agility and capital preservation in a volatile environment. Exploring Popular Short-Term Crypto Trading Strategies So, what specific crypto trading strategies are traders employing in this uncertain climate? The focus is typically on methods that involve frequent trades and short holding periods. Some common approaches include: Intraday Trading: Opening and closing all positions within the same trading day. This completely eliminates overnight risk. Traders using this method rely heavily on technical indicators and chart patterns to identify potential entry and exit points within a single session. Scalping: Making numerous trades throughout the day, aiming for very small profits on each trade. Scalpers hold positions for seconds to minutes, capitalizing on tiny price fluctuations. This requires intense focus and rapid execution. Swing Trading: Holding positions for a few days to a couple of weeks. While slightly longer than pure intraday or scalping, it’s still considered short-term compared to traditional investing. Swing traders try to capture a ‘swing’ or move in the market. These crypto trading strategies demand a different skillset than long-term investing. They require constant market monitoring, quick decision-making, and robust risk management protocols. The goal is to make many small, successful trades that accumulate into meaningful profits, rather than waiting for one large move. Benefits and Challenges of Short-Term Crypto Trading Adopting short-term crypto trading strategies in response to market uncertainty crypto presents both potential advantages and significant hurdles. Potential Benefits: Reduced Exposure to Macro Shocks: By closing positions quickly, traders limit their vulnerability to sudden market crashes caused by unexpected geopolitical or economic news (like tariff escalations). Potential for Faster Capital Growth: Successful short-term trades can potentially compound capital more quickly than waiting for long-term trends to play out. Capital Efficiency: Funds are not tied up in long-term positions, allowing traders to deploy capital more frequently and potentially capitalize on multiple opportunities. Opportunity in Volatility: While uncertainty creates risk, it also creates volatility, which short-term traders can attempt to profit from through frequent buying and selling. Significant Challenges: Higher Transaction Costs: Frequent trading incurs more fees (trading fees, potentially withdrawal fees), which can eat into profits. Increased Stress and Time Commitment: Short-term trading requires constant attention and can be emotionally draining. It’s essentially a full-time job. Risk of Whipsaws: Markets can move erratically in uncertain times, leading to false signals and trades that are quickly stopped out for losses. Difficulty with Market Noise: Short-term price action is often noisy and harder to interpret than longer-term trends. Tax Implications: Frequent short-term gains can have less favorable tax treatment in many jurisdictions compared to long-term capital gains. For crypto traders considering this shift, it’s crucial to weigh these factors carefully and assess if their personality, capital, and available time are suited for these demanding crypto trading strategies . Bitcoin Price Impact and Future Outlook How does this widespread adoption of short-term crypto trading affect the market, particularly the Bitcoin price impact ? Increased short-term activity can contribute to higher trading volume and potentially exacerbate volatility in the short term. As more traders are looking for quick exits, selling pressure can mount rapidly on minor downturns, and buying pressure can surge on small upward moves. However, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin price impact is still heavily linked to fundamental factors and major market catalysts. Analysts widely believe that a long-term trade agreement between the U.S. and China, which would alleviate much of the current market uncertainty crypto participants are facing, could serve as a significant positive catalyst. Such an agreement could boost global economic confidence, potentially increasing investor appetite for risk assets, including Bitcoin and altcoins, driving a prolonged price rise. Conversely, a breakdown in negotiations or an escalation of trade tensions could trigger further sell-offs across risk assets, impacting the Bitcoin price impact negatively and potentially reinforcing the need for short-term defensive strategies. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Navigating the current climate requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights for crypto traders : Education is Key: Before diving into short-term crypto trading , thoroughly understand the strategies, technical indicators, and risks involved. Start Small: Don’t risk significant capital while learning the ropes of short-term trading. Use small position sizes. Develop a Trading Plan: Define your entry/exit criteria, risk per trade, and daily loss limits. Stick to your plan rigorously. Implement Robust Risk Management: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on each trade. Never risk more than a small percentage of your capital on a single trade. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on major macroeconomic news, particularly regarding trade negotiations and regulatory developments, as these can trigger rapid market movements. Consider Your Taxes: Understand the tax implications of frequent short-term trading in your jurisdiction. Adapting your crypto trading strategies is essential in a dynamic market. Whether you choose to engage in short-term trading or simply adjust your long-term strategy to account for increased volatility, being prepared is paramount. Conclusion: Adapting to the Shifting Crypto Landscape The current era of market uncertainty crypto faces, fueled by factors like international trade tensions, has fundamentally altered the playing field for many participants. The move towards short-term crypto trading strategies by numerous crypto traders is a direct response to this environment, prioritizing agility and quick gains over long-term exposure. While these crypto trading strategies offer potential benefits like reduced risk from macro shocks and faster capital growth, they also come with significant challenges, including higher costs and increased stress. The Bitcoin price impact remains sensitive to these broader economic forces, with potential upside tied to positive developments like a resolution to trade disputes. Ultimately, success in this market requires adaptability, continuous learning, and disciplined execution of chosen crypto trading strategies .

Ripple’s recent legal victories are fueling optimism for XRP’s growth. Cardano’s robust technology is positioning ADA for a potential breakout. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being snapped up during its presale, with investors purchasing 525 million tokens and raising $9,800,000. Phase 5 of the sale has begun at $0.03 per token, with each token set to increase by 100% to $0.06 upon launch. These coins offer unique opportunities, blending innovation and value for June 2025. Ripple (XRP) surges with momentum Positive news is lifting Ripple (XRP) right now. Investors feel more confident now that Chesapeake’s case with the SEC was settled in 2025. At present, XRP can be bought for $2.30, a 30% difference from its highest value. Several analysts believe a rounded top shows up on the XRP/BTC chart, suggesting that an uptrend to $10 is possible. The optimism comes from major past enhancements, one of which was a 500% increase in 2024. New XRP futures contracts and a possible spot ETF in Canada are drawing institutional interest. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, now boasts a $315 million market cap, enhancing XRP’s utility. Investors are eyeing XRP for its growing role in cross-border payments. Cardano (ADA) coils for a breakout Cardano (ADA) is quietly building momentum in the crypto market. Priced at $0.735-$0.765, ADA is forming a descending triangle, a pattern often preceding sharp rallies. Analysts predict ADA could hit $6.10 in 2025, a 5x-8x increase, potentially outpacing Solana’s $91 billion market cap. Cardano’s focus on scalable, research-driven blockchain technology strengthens its appeal. The RSI at 50.9 signals stable momentum, while a nearing MACD bullish crossover suggests upward movement. ADA’s undervaluation makes it a compelling crypto investment. Its robust fundamentals position it as a long-term contender, attracting investors seeking high returns in 2025.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, Alden explains how the Fed typically controls credit growth in the US financial system. According to the macro guru, the Fed jacks up interest rates to slow down credit growth and inflation – a strategy which she notes has been effective for many decades. But Alden warns that the US has reached a turning point where the national debt is now so massive that raising interest rates, meant to curb credit expansion, ultimately pushes the government to borrow more, causing public debt to balloon even faster than private debt can shrink. “The problem is that many decades ago, when federal debt was low and most of the money creation was coming from the private sector, whenever they raised interest rates, they would slow credit growth. They would slow the private sector faster than they would blow out fiscal deficits. The problem now is that the [US debt] is 100% of GDP, which only happened in recent years. When they raise interest rates, they ironically increase the deficit at a faster pace than they slow down private sector credit growth. Basically, what that means is they don’t have brakes anymore. Nothing stops this train because there’s no brakes attached to it anymore.” Source: Lyn Alden/YouTube Alden also points out that the country will have an extremely difficult time managing the interest expense on its $36.22 trillion national debt. “Now, we are in an environment where, for the first time in decades, interest rates are not going structurally down anymore, and debt levels are still very, very high. They’re the highest that they’ve ever been since the 1940s. And so interest expense is actually becoming a very meaningful part of the federal expense for the first time ever, and there’s no easy way to get that under control. If they cut interest rates super low, then everybody wants to get into scarce assets. But if they keep interest rates high, they keep blowing up the federal deficit.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While Bitcoin continues to consolidate at critical levels, CoinShares published its weekly cryptocurrency report and said that there was an inflow of $ 286 million last week. “While there was an inflow of $286 million into cryptocurrency investment products last week, the total inflows over the 7 weeks reached $10.9 billion. Ethereum Rises, Bitcoin Stalls: Ethereum took the lead with an inflow of $ 321 million and showed its best 6-week performance since December 2024. Bitcoin, on the other hand, made a comeback in the middle of the week and finished the week with an $8 million exit.” Bitcoin's Uptrend, Ethereum's Big Comeback! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that there was an outflow in Bitcoin and a large inflow in Ethereum. While BTC experienced an outflow of $8 million, Ethereum (ETH) experienced an inflow of $321.4 million. When we look at other altcoins, SUI experienced an inflow of $2.2 million, Solana (SOL) experienced an inflow of $1.5 million, while XRP experienced an outflow of $28.2 million. “Ethereum led the way this week with another week of inflows of $321 million, bringing its 6-week inflow streak to $1.19 billion. It was the strongest series of entries since December 2024 and signaled a decisive improvement in sentiment. XRP saw its second week of outflows, totaling $28.2 million. The week started with strong inflows for Bitcoin, which reversed mid-week following the New York Court’s decision to declare the US tariffs illegal. At that point, the week ended with small outflows of $8 million. This was the first exit after a six-week consecutive series of inflows totaling $9.6 billion.” When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, it was seen that the USA ranked first with an inflow of 199 million dollars. After the US, Hong Kong and Germany saw inflows of $54.8 million and $42.9 million respectively. Against these inflows, Switzerland had outflows of $32.8 million, Sweden $3.9 million and Canada $9.4 million. *This is not investment advice.

The project is drawing investors with its presale raising $9,800,000 and over 525 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders. In presale phase 5, the altcoin cost just $0.03 and stands to make a profit of 100% when it launches for $0.06. Experts highlight its innovative lending model as a game-changer, positioning it as the best crypto to buy now. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) struggles with resistance at $0.762, relying on slower ecosystem growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh opportunity, blending affordability with robust utility. Its rapid presale success signals strong market trust, making it a standout choice for 2025 gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Redefines Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reshaping decentralized finance with its dual-lending system. Its peer-to-contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income through automatic interest adjustments.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) empowers investors with flexible terms, bypassing intermediaries. This utility drives demand, making it a top crypto to buy. The platform’s focus on accessibility positions it as a leader in crypto investment, offering practical solutions for diverse users in the crypto market. Stablecoin and Scalability Boost Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching an overcollateralized stablecoin on Ethereum, pegged to the USD.

A recent 15% price uptick shows promise, but resistance at $0.762 looms large. Analysts warn of a potential drop to $0.594 if support fails.

This surprising endorsement is causing a stir among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Could XYZVerse be the next big thing in the digital currency landscape? The implications of this backing are intriguing and worth exploring. $XYZ Unlocks the G.O.A.T. Status, Early Investors Positioned for Massive ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project. What sets $XYZ apart? It’s not a short-lived trend. This project has a clear roadmap and a dedicated community focused on long-term growth. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price. Launch Price: $0.0001 Price Now: $0.003333 Next Stage: $0.005 Final Presale Price: $0.02 Following the presale, the $XYZ token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target listing price of $0.10. If the project raises enough capital to support this valuation, early investors could see returns of up to 1,000x on their presale entries. So far, over $13 million has been invested, reflecting strong market interest. Notably, securing tokens at a lower presale price offers the potential for higher ROI upon launch. Demand for $XYZ is surging, driving rapid progress in the presale. Early buyers secure the lowest prices, maximizing their potential returns. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has been volatile lately. In the past week, its price dropped nearly 16%, settling between $0.18 and $0.22. Despite this recent dip, DOGE gained about 5% over the last month. However, over the past six months, it has declined more than 53%, indicating a long-term downward trend. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The 10-day Simple Moving Average is $0.19, just below the 100-day SMA of $0.20, suggesting short-term bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index stands at 44.59, approaching oversold territory, which might hint at a potential rebound. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0002885, pointing to possible continued downward pressure. Looking ahead, DOGE faces resistance at $0.25, roughly a 14% increase from its current upper range. Breaking through this could pave the way to the next resistance at $0.30, representing an approximate 36% rise. On the downside, immediate support is at $0.16, about 11% below the current lower range. Falling below this could see DOGE decline to the next support at $0.11, a further drop of around 31%. Based on these levels, the price could rise if it breaks through resistance, but failing to hold support might lead to additional losses. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Over the past six months, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has experienced a significant decline of 55.48% in its price. In the last month, the price dropped by 5.27%, and over the past week, it fell by 11.95%. Currently, SHIB is trading between $0.00001189 and $0.00001438. The coin's Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.88, suggesting that it is approaching oversold territory. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is negative at -0.0000000131, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are $0.00001285 and $0.00001318 respectively, showing a slight downward trend in the short term. SHIB faces immediate resistance at $0.00001581, with a stronger resistance level at $0.0000183. Support is found at $0.00001083 and a lower support level at $0.00000834. If the price breaks above the resistance, there could be potential for growth. However, if it falls below the support, the price may decline further. Traders are watching these levels closely to gauge SHIB's next move. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB continue strong, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the pioneering all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and aiming for substantial growth in the current crypto bull run.

45413662,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=164965,1748865053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45413662.jpeg,"Crypto Market Shifts: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 22, Confirming Bitcoin Season",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-9/,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Market Shifts: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 22, Confirming Bitcoin Season Are you wondering where the cryptocurrency market stands right now? A key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , offers valuable insight, and its current reading suggests a clear trend: we are deep in Bitcoin Season . What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index , tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a popular metric designed to gauge whether the broader crypto market is favoring Bitcoin or altcoins. It provides a snapshot of recent performance across a wide range of digital assets. Here’s how it works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens). It compares each of these top 100 coins against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. A high index score indicates that a large percentage of altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin, signaling Altcoin Season . A low score, conversely, means Bitcoin has largely outpaced the altcoins, indicating Bitcoin Season . Understanding Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season The index provides clear thresholds to define these market phases: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have performed better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically high (often above 75). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have performed better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically low (often below 25). Scores between 25 and 75 often represent a transition period or a neutral market. As of June 2nd, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 22. This low number falls squarely within the definition of Bitcoin Season , confirming that over the past three months, Bitcoin has been the dominant performer compared to the vast majority of the top altcoins. Why Are We Currently in Bitcoin Season? Several factors can contribute to a period of Bitcoin Season in the crypto market . These often relate to market cycles, macroeconomic conditions, and Bitcoin’s unique position as the largest and most established cryptocurrency. Possible reasons include: Flight to Quality: During uncertain economic times or periods of market volatility, investors may rotate capital from riskier altcoins back into Bitcoin, seen as a relatively safer store of value within the crypto space. Bitcoin-Specific Catalysts: Events like Bitcoin Halvings, major institutional adoption announcements, or significant regulatory news specifically impacting Bitcoin can drive its price up disproportionately compared to altcoins. Market Structure: Often, Bitcoin leads a bull run, with altcoins catching up later. A period of strong Bitcoin performance might precede a potential future altcoin surge, but for now, BTC is in the driver’s seat. Reduced Speculation: In quieter market periods or during price corrections, the speculative fervor around smaller, less-established altcoins can wane, leading to underperformance relative to Bitcoin. The current index reading of 22 strongly suggests that one or more of these factors have been at play over the recent 90-day period, favoring Bitcoin’s cryptocurrency price action. Implications and Actionable Insights During Bitcoin Season Understanding that the crypto market is in Bitcoin Season is crucial for navigating potential investment strategies. Here are some implications and potential actions: Implications: Altcoins, on average, are likely to underperform Bitcoin. Even if altcoins rise, they may do so at a slower pace than BTC. Risk appetite might be lower for smaller cap altcoins. Bitcoin dominance (BTC’s market cap percentage of the total crypto market) is likely increasing or remaining high. Actionable Insights: Focus on Bitcoin: Given the trend, a higher allocation to Bitcoin might be considered by some investors looking to align with current market momentum. Selective Altcoin Investing: Instead of broad altcoin exposure, focus on specific projects with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts, or those showing relative strength against Bitcoin. Risk Management: Be mindful that many altcoins can experience significant drawdowns during Bitcoin Season if BTC corrects. Stop-losses and position sizing are key. Accumulation Opportunities: For long-term holders, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate favored altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to BTC. Watch for Shifts: Keep an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and individual altcoin performance. A sustained increase in the index could signal a potential shift back towards Altcoin Season . Remember, past performance is not indicative of future results, and these are potential strategies based on the current index reading. Always conduct your own research (DYOR). Challenges of Navigating Bitcoin Season While Bitcoin Season might seem straightforward – focus on BTC – it presents its own set of challenges: Missing Potential Altcoin Gems: Even in Bitcoin Season, some individual altcoins might perform exceptionally well due to specific news or developments. Focusing solely on BTC means potentially missing these. Psychological Pressure: Seeing Bitcoin surge while your altcoin portfolio lags can be frustrating and lead to impulsive decisions. Timing the Shift: Knowing exactly when Bitcoin Season will end and Altcoin Season might begin is impossible, leading to the risk of reallocating too early or too late. Volatile Cryptocurrency Price Swings: Bitcoin itself can experience significant volatility, and a downturn in BTC can drag the entire market, including altcoins, down with it. Therefore, a balanced approach, even during Bitcoin Season , often involves careful planning and managing expectations. Conclusion: Riding the Bitcoin Wave The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool providing a macro view of the crypto market ‘s current dynamics. Its reading of 22 clearly indicates that we are in a period defined by Bitcoin Season , where Bitcoin is generally outperforming the majority of altcoins. This doesn’t mean altcoins are irrelevant, but it highlights Bitcoin’s current dominance in driving overall cryptocurrency price trends.

Finance icon Robert Kiyosaki is sounding the alarm again and this time, he says the storm has already begun. According to the bestselling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , the economic collapse he predicted in his 2013 book Rich Dad’s Prophecy is finally here. “I am afraid that crash time is now and through this summer,” Kiyosaki declared on X. But while the threat looms large, he insists there’s a silver lining for those who act fast and smart. Do not say I didn’t warn anyone. As predicted in my book Rich Dad’s Prophecy (2013) the biggest crash in history is coming. I am afraid that crash time is now and through this summer. Unfortunately, millions, especially my generation of boomers will be wiped out when the… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 2, 2025 Massive Crash Incoming: Are You Prepared? Kiyosaki believes the global economy is on the edge of the largest financial crash in history. His warning? A dramatic collapse in stocks, bonds, and real estate could wipe out millions of investors especially aging Baby Boomers heavily reliant on traditional markets. Yet amid this chaos, he sees a golden opportunity: Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Bitcoin Is Your Safe Space Kiyosaki claims that during this financial fallout, “billions will rush into Bitcoin” – alongside classic safe-haven assets like gold and silver. With markets in freefall, he suggests that Bitcoin could serve as a modern hedge against economic instability, especially as traditional assets crumble. While he’s issued similar crash predictions before, many aligning with periods of market turbulence, Kiyosaki says this time is different. And for proactive investors, he insists the crisis could be a rare gateway to long-term wealth. Why Silver Might Be the Smartest Bet Right Now Though he’s bullish on Bitcoin, Kiyosaki is especially excited about silver, calling it “the biggest bargain today.” He forecasts that silver, currently priced around $35 an ounce, could triple in value by the end of 2025. He also shared his plan to convert U.S. dollars, which he repeatedly calls “fake money”, into physical silver while it’s still affordable. Though he continues to accumulate Bitcoin and gold, he’s especially focused on silver as an undervalued play. ETFs? No Thanks. Go Physical, Says Kiyosaki Despite his enthusiasm for these assets, Kiyosaki strongly advises against investing through ETFs. In his words, exchange-traded funds are nothing more than “fake assets” manufactured by Wall Street. Whether it’s Bitcoin, gold, or silver, Kiyosaki urges direct ownership, believing only physical exposure to these assets can truly protect investors in a crash scenario. Market Meltdown or Wealth Opportunity? You Decide. As the summer heats up, Kiyosaki’s warnings have reignited fierce debate across social media. Some see his predictions as fearmongering. Others believe this could be the spark that accelerates mass Bitcoin adoption. One thing’s clear: for those willing to move fast and think independently, this period of volatility could also become one of the greatest wealth-building opportunities of our time.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|BTG,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 11:51:10

Cardano, a veteran blockchain, boasts a $28 billion market cap, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a bold DeFi newcomer, is turning heads with its presale raising $9,800,000 and over 525 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders. Currently in phase 5 at $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises a 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch. As investors weigh their options, this battle hinges on growth potential and real-world utility. Let’s explore what sets these projects apart. Cardano’s steady climb Cardano is carving a steady path in 2025. Trading between $0.735 and $0.765, its price reflects resilience despite a recent dip from $0.83. Analysts highlight Cardano’s lower $28 billion market cap compared to rivals, suggesting room for growth. Experts predict a potential surge to $6.10, driven by strong fundamentals and institutional backing. The U.S. government’s inclusion of Cardano in its strategic reserve underscores its credibility. Its decentralized framework and smart contract capabilities fuel optimism. Yet, Cardano’s established status means its explosive growth may lag behind newer tokens. Investors eyeing crypto prices today see Cardano as a stable, long-term bet, but its upside might be capped compared to emerging projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention with its presale momentum. Phase 5 is underway at $0.03, a 200% jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. Phase 6 looms with a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, and the confirmed $0.06 launch price guarantees a 100% ROI for current buyers. Analysts project a post-launch surge to $2.50, an 8,233% leap from today’s price, driven by its innovative DeFi model. The project’s $9,800,000 raise and 525 million tokens sold to 11,500 holders signal strong demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rewarding its top 50 holders with bonus tokens via a new leaderboard dashboard, boosting engagement. Its focus on crypto investment opportunities makes it a standout. Mutuum’s DeFi innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining crypto lending with a dual-model system. Its Peer-to-Contract approach lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income through dynamic interest rates. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct lending, cutting intermediaries for transparent, user-driven agreements. Built on Ethereum, its upcoming stablecoin ensures secure, algorithmically balanced transactions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates Layer-2 solutions for faster, cheaper transactions, addressing crypto prices today concerns like high gas fees. The beta platform launches alongside the token, offering immediate utility. A $100,000 giveaway sweetens the deal for early investors. This robust infrastructure positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a leader in crypto investment strategies for 2025. Security and transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is bolstering trust with a recently completed Certik audit, earning a 70.00 security score. No vulnerabilities surfaced in its smart contracts, and zero security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. Active monitoring and moderate social media engagement enhance its reliability. This solid foundation contrasts with Cardano’s established but less agile ecosystem. While Cardano’s fundamentals are strong, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s fresh approach and proactive transparency appeal to investors seeking crypto coins with immediate utility. The project’s focus on secure, scalable DeFi solutions aligns with growing demand for practical crypto investing options in 2025. Mutuum’s scalable future Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building for scale. Its Layer-2 integration ensures low-cost, rapid transactions, a critical edge in today’s crypto market. The platform’s stablecoin, backed by overcollateralized assets, funnels interest into a treasury for sustained growth. Revenue-driven token buybacks further bolster MUTM’s value, rewarding holders without inflating supply. Unlike Cardano, which thrives on long-term adoption, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers instant functionality at launch. Its presale success and community-driven incentives, like the leaderboard rewards, signal strong momentum. For those tracking crypto predictions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $2.50 post-launch target suggests it could outpace Cardano’s gradual climb in 2025. Choosing the best crypto The race between Cardano and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) hinges on investor goals. Cardano offers stability and institutional trust, with a potential $6.10 peak. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steals the spotlight with its 100% launch ROI and a projected $2.50 post-launch value. Its innovative lending, scalable tech, and Certik-backed security make it a compelling crypto investment. As phase 5 unfolds at $0.03, investors face a narrowing window to join before the $0.035 phase 6 price. For those seeking the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends affordability with explosive potential. Explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today to secure your stake in this DeFi contender.

Analysts Think So! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new token valued at just $0.003 is turning heads among experts. Analysts believe it has the potential to outshine PEPE by 2026. This low-priced coin might be the next big thing in the crypto market. What factors are fueling this optimistic outlook? Exploring the reasons behind the buzz surrounding this emerging digital asset. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $13 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme by Matt Furie. The cryptocurrency aims to join popular meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. By implementing a no-tax policy and being transparent about its lack of utility, PEPE embraces the simplicity of a memecoin while appealing to the community. Its roadmap includes listings on platforms like CoinMarketCap and trending on social media; listing on centralized exchanges; and a “meme takeover” through “tier 1” exchange listings. PEPE’s potential lies in strong community engagement and the viral nature of internet memes. As a deflationary token, it aims to increase scarcity over time, which could influence its value. The surge in its market capitalization to $1.6 billion highlights the impact of social trends on cryptocurrency markets. However, being upfront about its lack of utility, PEPE represents the speculative aspect of the crypto space focused on meme culture. The attractiveness of the coin in the current market cycle depends on factors such as market sentiment, community support, and broader cryptocurrency trends. The future performance of PEPE remains uncertain. Conclusion While PEPE has achieved notable success, XYZ’s unique sports-focused approach positions it to potentially surpass PEPE by 2026, especially with the current bull run.

According to the BBC, the bill in question aims to clarify how AI systems can use existing data for their models. However, a fierce row has started between ministers and peers who back the artists, with no quick solution in sight. The Data Bill has divided UK legislators The conflict, which stems from how best to balance the needs and demands of the two powerful industries in the UK, that is the tech and creative industries, might not just be about AI only. It also touches on human issues at the heart of the impasse, which are job security and creativity. The bill, once expected to smoothly pass into law this week has become a ping-pong game between the House of Commons and the House Lords. According to the BBC , the contention is about coming up with the best way to allow the tech industry access creative content to enhance their AI models without disadvantaging the livelihoods of those who created that particular content. At the center of the disagreement is the UK government’s proposal that AI developers be granted access to creative content unless individual owners actively decide to opt out. But, this approach has drawn firm opposition as about 300 members of the House of Lords disagree with this, arguing that AI developers should be forced to disclose which copyrighted material they use to train their tools. By so doing, this will lead to licensing and fair compensation. Former president of global affairs at Meta, Sir Nick Clegg is among those that support the bill. He is of the view that by asking permission from all copyright holders will “kill the AI industry.” Other legislators want the bill amended Leading the charge against the bill is Baroness Beeban Kidron, a crossbench peer and former film director, known for films like Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason. Baroness Kidron warns that without changes, ministers would be “knowingly throwing UK designers, artists, authors, musicians, media and nascent AI companies under the bus.” She accuses the government of enabling “state sanctioned theft” from a creative industry worth £124 billion. Resultantly, she is now asking for an amendment to the bill, requiring Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to give a report to the House of Commons on how the new law will impact the creative industry in three months. Adding complexity to the matter is Kyle, who also appears to have shifted his views on UK copyright law as he once described the law as “very certain.” However, he is now saying that the copyright law is now “not fit for purpose.” The origins of the conflict trace back to when AI developers, especially large US firms scraped vast amounts of data from the internet without payment, using it to train their AI tools that are now capable of creating texts, images and also mimic famous artists. This ignited a backlash from creators like Sir Elton John, Sir Paul McCartney, and Dua Lipa who called the practice theft and a threat to artists’ livelihoods. Recently, Sir Elton John said that the government was on course to “rob young people of their legacy and their income,” calling the current administration “absolute losers.” Elsewhere, the founder of Japan’s famous Studio Ghibli once described AI’s use in animation as “an insult to life itself.” Recently, there was a wave of Studio Ghibli style images that went viral on the internet and social media platforms after OpenAI released an update for its ChatGPT. However, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology says that they are carrying out wider consultation on these matters and will not consider changes to the bill unless they are satisfied that they work for creators.

However, these advancements can sometimes inadvertently open doors for malicious actors. Recent reports highlight a concerning trend following a key Ethereum upgrade, where certain features are being exploited in automated attacks leading to significant losses. What is the Ethereum Pectra Upgrade and EIP-7702? The recent Pectra hard fork on the Ethereum network introduced several improvements, one of which is EIP-7702. This Ethereum Improvement Proposal is designed to enhance the flexibility and capabilities of standard Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) – the typical wallets most users interact with. The core idea behind EIP-7702 is to allow these wallets to temporarily behave like smart contracts. Think of it this way: normally, your standard crypto wallet (an EOA) can only initiate simple transactions (send funds). Smart contract wallets, on the other hand, can execute complex logic, interact with decentralized applications (dApps) in sophisticated ways, and even enforce rules before a transaction is allowed (like multi-signature requirements). EIP-7702 bridges this gap by letting an EOA temporarily gain some smart contract-like abilities within a single transaction. This could pave the way for features like: Paying transaction fees with any token, not just ETH. Batching multiple operations into a single transaction. Enabling more complex authorization flows for transactions. The goal is to make interacting with Ethereum and dApps smoother and more user-friendly, aligning with the broader push towards account abstraction. How are Attackers Exploiting EIP-7702 for Wallet Drain Attacks? While EIP-7702 itself is intended to be a beneficial feature, its implementation seems to have created a new avenue for attackers, particularly in combination with a persistent vulnerability: compromised private keys . According to analysis cited by The Block, a significant number of EIP-7702 delegations are linked to malicious activities. Here’s the breakdown of the attack vector: Compromised Private Keys: The attack starts with attackers obtaining users’ private keys, often through phishing scams, malware, or data breaches. This is the fundamental security failure. Automated Exploitation via EIP-7702: With a leaked private key, attackers can craft transactions using the EIP-7702 feature. They delegate the compromised wallet’s control temporarily to a malicious smart contract they control. Rapid Fund Transfer: The malicious contract, using the temporary control granted by EIP-7702, automatically and instantly drains all valuable assets from the compromised wallet and sends them to the attacker’s address. Crypto trading firm Wintermute’s analysis reportedly found that over 80% of EIP-7702 delegations observed were connected to malicious contracts. These contracts often use identical, copy-pasted code, indicating a widespread, automated campaign. Real-World Impact and the Root Cause: Compromised Private Keys The consequences of these automated attacks are real and costly. Blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer highlighted one instance where a user lost nearly $150,000 in a phishing attack that utilized this method. This demonstrates the significant financial risk posed by this exploit. However, it’s crucial to understand the underlying issue. Security expert Taylor Monahan points out that the problem isn’t inherently with EIP-7702 itself. The core vulnerability remains the compromise of users’ private keys. EIP-7702, in this context, acts as an enabler, making it faster, easier, and potentially cheaper for attackers to automate the draining process once they have access to a key. Before EIP-7702, draining a compromised wallet might have required more manual steps or different transaction types. The new feature, while beneficial for legitimate use cases, inadvertently streamlines the malicious process for attackers who possess a leaked key. Strengthening Your Crypto Security : Actionable Steps Given that the root cause is compromised private keys, protecting your keys is paramount. Here are essential steps to enhance your crypto security: Never Share Your Private Key or Seed Phrase: This is the golden rule. No legitimate service, exchange, or person will ever ask for it. Be Wary of Phishing: Scammers create fake websites, emails, and social media profiles designed to trick you into revealing your private keys or connecting your wallet to malicious sites. Always double-check URLs and the legitimacy of requests. Use Hardware Wallets: For storing significant amounts of cryptocurrency, a hardware wallet is highly recommended. Your private keys are stored offline and never exposed to the internet, even when making transactions. Be Cautious with Browser Extensions: Only install wallet extensions from official sources. Fake extensions can steal your keys or monitor your activity. Review and Understand Transactions: Before confirming any transaction, especially those involving connecting your wallet or granting permissions (like EIP-7702 delegations), carefully review what you are authorizing. If something looks suspicious or requests excessive permissions, cancel it. Regularly Audit Wallet Activity: Keep an eye on your wallet’s transaction history for any unauthorized activity. While the Ethereum Pectra upgrade and features like EIP-7702 aim to improve the network, user vigilance remains the most critical defense against wallet draining attacks. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Landscape The exploitation of EIP-7702 highlights the constant cat-and-mouse game between protocol development and security threats in the crypto space. While the feature itself has potential benefits for improving wallet functionality, its current use in automated attacks underscores the persistent danger of compromised private keys . Users must prioritize fundamental crypto security practices above all else. Protecting your private keys is your first and strongest line of defense. While developers work to build safer and more user-friendly features like those introduced in the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, staying informed and cautious is key to navigating the digital asset landscape safely and preventing a devastating wallet drain .

Global Framework Alignment : Drawing insights from international regulators to shape India’s crypto future. Why Now? Pressure from India’s Supreme Court The move appears to be influenced by the Supreme Court of India , which criticized the current crypto regulations as “obsolete.” The Court has urged the government to update the legal framework, intensifying the pressure to act. What’s Next for India’s Crypto Ecosystem? While the discussion paper brings hope, it doesn’t guarantee immediate reform. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) remains skeptical and is focused on combating money laundering and cybercrime. It continues to prioritize the rollout of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) as a safer alternative to decentralized cryptocurrencies. Conclusion India’s crypto future is at a crossroads. While the upcoming paper could lead to legalization and tax reform, there’s still a long road ahead. For now, the government is balancing innovation with caution—ready to engage, but not without safeguards. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Popular names like Ethereum and Solana show little movement, remaining steady against the storm. Meanwhile, AI-driven tokens are catching eyes with their potential. Codename:Pepe is leading the pack, promising a blend of humor and impressive gains. Codename:Pepe emerges as an intriguing new project embracing artificial intelligence. It aims to revolutionize trading by offering exclusive insights and automated strategies. This unique token is stirring interest, banking on a community-driven approach to foster growth and success. As the crypto arena evolves, Codename:Pepe invites investors to join its covert mission. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, two of the most prominent trends today. Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal—many simply use ""AI"" as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility, while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project’s AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention. Analyze Market Sentiment: AI-driven algorithms evaluate discussions, hype levels, and whale movements to determine which coins have the most momentum. Provide Actionable Trading Insights: Generates AI-backed forecasts, risk assessments, and early buy/sell signals to maximize trading efficiency. Optimize Auto-Trading Strategies: Uses real-time data to adjust automated trading strategies, ensuring adaptability in fast-moving market conditions. The development team behind Codename:Pepe is focused on expanding both AI capabilities and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology evolves alongside the crypto market. A Smart Presale Strategy for Early Investors Codename:Pepe has decided to go with a community-driven presale model, giving early supporters access to the project at the best prices. The presale has a structured, multi-stage approach, designed to reward early adopters with big discounts: At stage 1, the $AGNT token was offered at $0.003333333. It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today’s crypto market: AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project’s focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing – Join the Mission Now! Ethereum’s Journey: Pioneering Decentralization and Eyeing the Future Ethereum is a blockchain platform that powers decentralized applications, known as dApps, without central control. It was the first to introduce smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements coded on the blockchain. This innovation has led to a vibrant ecosystem of applications, from decentralized exchanges to lending platforms. What sets Ethereum apart is its ability to create tokens, called ERC-20 tokens, used within these applications. They serve various purposes like governance, utility, or as stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Despite the variety of tokens, transaction fees, known as gas fees, are still paid in Ether (ETH), Ethereum's native coin. Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has evolved significantly. In 2022, it transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake system with an upgrade called the Merge. The next big step is sharding, which will split the blockchain into smaller pieces to improve scalability and reduce fees. These developments aim to make Ethereum more efficient and accessible. Historically, Ether has shown strong growth, reaching an all-time high near $4,900 in 2021. Analysts believe it could surpass this peak in the future, driven by the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and greater adoption. While price predictions vary, many see significant potential for ETH by 2030 and beyond. In the current market cycle of 2025, Ethereum remains a leader in the crypto space. Its ongoing innovations and widespread use make it an attractive option for those interested in blockchain technology and digital assets. The future looks promising as Ethereum continues to pioneer in decentralization. Solana: The Rising Star of Blockchain Poised for a Bright Future Solana is a blockchain platform launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko. It aims to solve the speed and scalability issues of older blockchains. Capable of processing over 50,000 transactions per second, Solana is one of the fastest blockchains available. The secret behind Solana's speed is its unique technology called Proof-of-History (PoH). This allows the network to timestamp transactions, processing them efficiently. Combined with Proof-of-Stake (PoS), Solana offers a powerful blockchain that attracts many developers and users. In 2021, Solana's native token, SOL, saw a remarkable price surge. From July to November, its value increased by over 600%, reaching an all-time high of about $260. This growth showcased Solana's potential and drew attention from investors. In the current market, Solana continues to show promise. Its speed and low fees make it a strong competitor to platforms like Ethereum. With increasing adoption and a growing ecosystem of apps, many find Solana attractive. Looking ahead, analysts predict a bright future for Solana. Some forecasts suggest that SOL could reach prices exceeding $500 in coming years. While predictions vary, the general sentiment is optimistic about Solana's growth. Conclusion Currently, established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are experiencing minimal movement, indicating less potential in the short term. As these prominent coins show limited growth, investors are turning their attention to innovative tokens that demonstrate stronger performance. Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a notable contender, unleashing true intelligence to achieve maximum profits. By utilizing advanced AI to analyze market trends and execute automated trades, it offers a powerful tool for navigating the dynamic meme coin market. With its unique approach and community-driven model, Codename:Pepe crypto provides a compelling alternative for those seeking significant gains amid the stagnation of traditional cryptocurrencies.

Enjin is a full-stack blockchain ecosystem designed for games, apps, and virtual economies. From the Enjin Wallet to NFT.io and Beam, it gives developers everything they need to build player-driven digital worlds where assets are real, ownable, and liquid. Launched as a gaming community platform back in 2009, Enjin pivoted to blockchain in 2017 and went on to co-create ERC-1155 , the now-standard multi-token NFT format on Ethereum. In 2023, Enjin leveled up again - launching the Enjin Blockchain , a purpose-built Substrate chain optimized for NFTs, gaming, and low-cost digital ownership. The Enjin Ecosystem Enjin isn’t just a blockchain - it’s a toolkit, a platform, and a thriving economy. Here’s how it breaks down: Enjin Blockchain : A high-throughput, eco-friendly Layer 1 built specifically for NFTs and digital assets. Proof-of-Stake, fast, and optimized for real in-game economies. Enjin Wallet : A secure mobile wallet for managing crypto and NFTs, trusted by millions. NFT.io : A fully integrated marketplace for creating, trading, and distributing NFTs on the Enjin Blockchain. Enjin Platform SDKs : Dev tools that allow games and apps to integrate NFTs in under 24 hours. Enjin Beam : A QR-based NFT distribution tool that turns NFT drops into real-world engagement events. Whether you're building the next Web3 MMORPG or dropping limited-edition assets at a live event, Enjin’s ecosystem gives you plug-and-play infrastructure. At the Core: Enjin Coin (ENJ) $ENJ is the native token of the Enjin Blockchain. It’s the governance and utility token that powers the Enjin ecosystem and is used by all games, products and services using Enjin for a variety of purposes. Governance & Staking - Stake ENJ coin, elect validators, vote on proposals and steer the future of the ecosystem. Transaction Fees - ENJ is used to pay for gas costs for every on-chain action. Trading - ENJ is the native trading token for the Enjin on-chain marketplace. NFT Minting - ENJ is used to create, mint, send, and infuse NFTs. ENJ Infusion - ENJ can be locked into an NFT to give it intrinsic value. The ENJ can be redeemed by destroying the NFT and releasing the ENJ to its holder. ENJ-Backed NFTs: Value You Can Redeem One of Enjin’s key innovations is ENJ-backed NFTs - each asset is minted with a specific amount of ENJ inside it. That ENJ is locked in the NFT and can be “melted” back out at any time by the holder. Game items with reserve value Digital collectibles with liquidity Tradable goods backed by real economic weight This feature gives NFTs a floor value, promotes sustainable ecosystems, and gives players true ownership with exit options. Adoption & Partnerships Enjin doesn’t just talk to builders - they’re building with the best: Microsoft - Azure Heroes badge system Square Enix - NFTs for gaming content Samsung - Integration into Galaxy Store 100+ indie and AAA developers - across AR, RPGs, card games, and Minecraft servers These aren’t test projects - they’re deployed, live integrations across mainstream and Web3-native platforms. What’s New? Enjin Blockchain launched in Sept 2023 with full migration from Ethereum and Polkadot Triple migration streamlined asset ownership and developer experience As of May 2024, 95% of ENJ supply unlocked , showing ecosystem maturity Enjin is no longer in beta mode. It’s shipping production infrastructure for the next wave of Web3 gaming. Fun Fact The ERC-1155 token standard - now used by every major NFT platform - was proposed by Enjin CTO Witek Radomski back in 2018. What started as a gaming upgrade became the bedrock of the modern NFT movement. Enjin has been in the game since before Web3 was a buzzword - and now they’re powering some of the most advanced tools for blockchain gaming anywhere. If you're building the future of digital economies, Enjin already built the infrastructure",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ENJ|ETH|TRADING|AR,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-06-02 12:03:47

Kbank, the trusted banking partner for one of the nation’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit, has successfully processed the country’s inaugural corporate crypto transaction . What Happened with Kbank and Upbit? According to reports from the Asia Business Daily on June 2, Kbank facilitated this groundbreaking transaction. The details reveal that the international nonprofit organization, World Vision, connected its corporate account directly to the Upbit exchange. This connection allowed World Vision to sell 0.55 ETH, which was valued at approximately $1,436 at the time, and subsequently withdraw the proceeds in fiat currency through their registered corporate bank account. This event is particularly noteworthy as it represents the first publicly known instance of a nonprofit entity converting cryptocurrency holdings into traditional cash via a registered corporate account on a regulated South Korean exchange. It underscores the increasing practical applications of cryptocurrency beyond individual trading and speculation. Why is This Corporate Crypto Transaction Significant? This transaction isn’t just a one-off event; it carries broader implications for the market and regulatory environment in South Korea. Here’s why it matters: Paves the Way for Corporate Adoption: It demonstrates a clear, functional path for businesses and organizations to interact with digital assets within the established financial infrastructure. This could encourage other corporations, both for-profit and non-profit, to explore similar avenues for managing crypto donations, payments, or investments. Validates Bank-Exchange Partnerships: The successful facilitation by Kbank through its partnership with Upbit highlights the importance and effectiveness of collaboration between traditional banks and crypto exchanges under regulatory frameworks. Regulatory Clarity Signal: While not a new regulation itself, the execution of such a transaction suggests a level of operational clarity or acceptance within the existing crypto regulation South Korea framework that allows for corporate engagement. Boosts Confidence: For potential corporate users and investors, seeing a reputable nonprofit like World Vision successfully execute such a transaction via a major bank and exchange can build confidence in the legitimacy and accessibility of the South Korean crypto market. How Does This Impact World Vision Crypto Holdings? For World Vision, this transaction demonstrates their ability to liquidate cryptocurrency donations or holdings directly through official channels. Nonprofits often receive donations in various forms, including cryptocurrency. Having a clear, regulated process facilitated by a major bank like Kbank and an exchange like Upbit simplifies the management and utilization of such digital assets for their charitable work. This also sets a precedent for how other charitable organizations operating in South Korea might handle cryptocurrency donations in the future, providing a template for compliance and operational procedures. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation in South Korea? While this specific transaction highlights operational capabilities under current rules, the broader landscape of crypto regulation South Korea continues to evolve. This event could potentially inform future regulatory discussions regarding: Specific guidelines for corporate crypto accounting and taxation. Expanded access for different types of corporate entities. Frameworks for institutional investment in digital assets. The successful execution of this transaction by Kbank and Upbit, involving a well-known entity like World Vision, serves as a practical example for regulators to consider as they refine the rules governing the digital asset space in the country. Conclusion: A Milestone Achieved The processing of South Korea’s first corporate crypto transaction by Kbank via Upbit for World Vision is a significant milestone. It validates the operational readiness of the infrastructure supporting the South Korea crypto market for corporate participation. This event not only benefits organizations like World Vision by providing a clear path for managing digital assets but also signals growing maturity and potential for wider corporate and institutional adoption within the country’s regulatory environment. It’s a positive step forward, demonstrating practical utility and integration.

This seismic shift—49.6 million Americans holding Bitcoin compared to fewer gold owners—hints at a changing tide in how wealth is stored and grown. Even more intriguing? Regulatory shifts might soon unlock $8.9 trillion in 401(k) funds for Bitcoin, amplifying this trend. Bitcoin Edges Out Gold: A New Market Leader River, a financial services firm, reports that 49.6 million Americans—roughly 15% of the U.S. population—own Bitcoin as of June. That’s more than those holding gold, a staple of financial security for centuries. Exact gold ownership numbers aren’t provided, but the chart positions Bitcoin ahead. Gold, prized for its stability , now trails a 2009-born cryptocurrency. The data underscores a market pivot, with Bitcoin drawing a younger, tech-forward crowd over gold’s traditional base. The River chart offers a clean headline: more Americans hold Bitcoin than gold. But there’s a catch. Gold jewelry—owned by millions—might not be counted. If included, gold ownership could climb higher, narrowing Bitcoin’s lead. Still, the comparison holds weight. Bitcoin’s 49.6 million owners represent a significant chunk of the market, achieved in just over 15 years. Gold, by contrast, has had millennia to cement its place. That Bitcoin is even in the conversation speaks to its rapid rise. 401(k) Doors Open: A Game-Changer Looms Bitcoin’s 15% penetration leaves plenty of room to grow. A major boost could come from 401(k) plans, where $8.9 trillion sits untapped. Swan, a cryptocurrency platform, notes that regulatory barriers are easing for 401(k) providers to allocate to Bitcoin. What’s the impact? A 1% shift of 401(k) assets to Bitcoin equals $89 billion—a hefty sum for any market. Not every provider will jump in; volatility and uncertainty linger. But the path is clearing, and accessibility could soon spike. This Bitcoin news isn’t just about numbers—it’s about potential. With ownership surpassing gold and 401(k) integration on the horizon, the cryptocurrency’s foothold in U.S. finance looks set to deepen.

This move is fueling a multi-coin rally, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerging as early leaders in the breakout. FloppyPepe (FPPE) just kicked off its second presale stage at a highly affordable $0.00000035 , and investor demand is already building fast. As the multi-coin rally intensifies, buyers are rushing to claim their 80% bonus using FLOPPY80 , locking in larger holdings before the next price jump. Multi-Coin Rally Ignites As Market Flips Bullish; FloppyPepe (FPPE) Surges In Second Presale Stage The Bitcoin price weekly chart has just flipped bullish, with analysts eyeing a $130,000 breakout—and the impact is already fueling a major multi-coin rally. Top performers like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) are seizing this momentum, positioning themselves as front-runners in what could be one of the biggest multi-coin rally cycles of the year. With capital flooding into low-cap gems, traders are now shifting their focus toward assets with exponential upside potential. FloppyPepe (FPPE) just entered its second presale stage at an incredibly low price of $0.00000035 . In just the past few hours, it crossed $2.2 million in total funds raised, with the current stage already mimicking the momentum of the first. Stage 1 sold out well ahead of schedule, and this second round is moving even faster, setting the pace for what could be a complete sellout before expected. As the multi-coin rally picks up pace, it is standing out as the clear favorite among low-cap opportunities. Bitcoin Price Spike Targets $130,000 As Multi-Coin Rally Gains Momentum Trending crypto news this week highlights the Bitcoin price weekly chart breakout, setting the stage for a $130,000 target. The Bitcoin price surge is also fueling momentum for a broader multi-coin rally, with top altcoins gaining traction. According to technical analyst Titan of Crypto on X (formerly Twitter), the Bitcoin price is eyeing the blue line of the Golden Ratio Multiplier, with the next stop at $130,000. At press time, the Bitcoin price sits at $105,797 after briefly spiking over 10% to hit $112,000 on the weekly chart. This strong movement reinforces confidence in both Bitcoin price strength and the potential scale of the ongoing multi-coin rally. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tracks New Gains In The Wake Of Multi-Coin Rally The recent Bitcoin price surge is setting up the market for a multi-coin rally, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerging as key altcoins expected to lead the charge. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001338, reflecting a 50% drop over the past year and a 15% decline in the last week, per CoinGecko. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted on X that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is consolidating within a triangle pattern, signaling a possible 17% breakout move. As part of the broader multi-coin rally, investors are watching closely to see if Shiba Inu (SHIB) will break upward or continue trending lower. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Leads Multi-Coin Rally With 80% Bonus And Strong Presale Momentum The multi-coin rally is gaining unstoppable momentum, with FloppyPepe (FPPE) positioned to lead alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) as prices soar. This surge reflects the strength behind the Bitcoin price breakout, which set the stage for a $130,000 target, fueling excitement across the market. With a limited-time 80% bonus using the code “ FLOPPY80 ,” SolidProof audited staking options for passive income generation are still available. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) second-stage presale $0.00000035 price is a rare window into a fast-moving bull wave, and once the meme coin hits major exchanges, this low-cap gem might never be this cheap again.

According to a June 2 announcement, the Japanese investment firm said it acquired the Bitcoin at an average price of $108,400 per coin for a total of $117.5 million. Massive corporate purchases at prices above the $100,000 mark indicate increasing institutional confidence in the current Bitcoin bull cycle. Bitcoin soared to an all-time high of nearly $112,000 on May 22 before retreating to $104,342 at press time, as per data from CoinGecko. With the latest buy, Metaplanet now holds 8,888 Bitcoin, worth roughly $930 million at current prices. The company is now a step closer to its year-end target of 10,000 BTC . Metaplanet’s ambitious Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which began with its official adoption of a Bitcoin treasury policy in April 2024, has pushed the firm to the top spot among corporate BTC holders in Asia and the top ten worldwide. Strategy remains the top Bitcoin holder in the world, with more than 580,250 BTC under its belt. Metaplanet’s latest purchase follows the issuance of $50 million in zero-interest bonds last week, providing additional funds for BTC buys without diluting existing equity. Bold Bitcoin Strategy Metaplanet has leaned heavily into Bitcoin as its core treasury asset amid increasing financial uncertainty, specifically in Japan’s bond markets. In March, the company appointed Eric Trump, son of the U.S. president, to its newly formed Strategic Advisory Board, citing his “business expertise and passion for Bitcoin.” Metaplanet is positioning itself in the mold of Michael Saylor’s software intelligence-turned-Bitcoin development company, Strategy, whose aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy has motivated a bevy of other publicly listed firms to follow suit. Interestingly, the Trump administration has launched two separate initiatives: a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, consisting of confiscated BTC and held as a permanent national asset, and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, which includes other seized crypto with potential for liquidation or strategic use.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-02 12:17:17

According to a prominent voice from the heart of American monetary policy, it’s the latter. Recent comments from a US Fed Governor suggest that these digital assets, often pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are viewed primarily through the lens of their utility as a Payment Instrument . This perspective could signal a shift in how regulators approach the burgeoning field of Digital Currency and Crypto Payments . US Fed Governor Waller’s View: Stablecoins as a Payment Instrument The core of the recent discussion comes from U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. As reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, Governor Waller stated quite plainly that stablecoins are “simply a payment instrument.” This might sound straightforward, but coming from a governor of the Federal Reserve, it carries significant weight. It frames stablecoins not just as speculative investments or complex blockchain technology, but as a practical tool for conducting transactions. Furthermore, Governor Waller highlighted their potential role in fostering competition within the payments sector. The current global payments infrastructure, while functional, often involves intermediaries, fees, and processing times that stablecoins aim to improve upon. By offering a potentially faster, cheaper, and more accessible way to move value, stablecoins could challenge existing payment networks and drive innovation. Why is this perspective from the US Fed important? The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in overseeing the nation’s payment systems and considering the implications of new financial technologies. Acknowledging stablecoins as legitimate payment instruments, rather than just speculative assets, could pave the way for clearer regulatory frameworks and greater integration into the financial system. Understanding Stablecoins: What Makes Them a Viable Payment Instrument? Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged 1:1 with a fiat currency such as the US dollar. This stability is precisely what makes them attractive as a Payment Instrument . When you use a stablecoin to pay for goods or services, or to send money, you want to be confident that its value won’t fluctuate wildly between the time you initiate the transaction and when it’s received. There are different types of stablecoins, primarily categorized by their collateralization method: Fiat-collateralized: Backed by reserves of traditional currency (like USD, EUR) held in banks. Examples include USDT, USDC, BUSD. Crypto-collateralized: Backed by other cryptocurrencies, often over-collateralized to absorb price volatility. Example: DAI. Algorithmic: Do not use direct collateral but rely on algorithms to manage supply and maintain the peg. (Note: This type has faced significant challenges and risks). The most common stablecoins used for Crypto Payments are fiat-collateralized ones, as their direct link to traditional currencies provides a higher degree of predictability needed for everyday transactions. Driving Competition in Payments Through Digital Currency Governor Waller’s emphasis on competition is key. The global payments market is vast and complex, dominated by established players. However, the emergence of Digital Currency , particularly stablecoins, presents an opportunity for disruption. How do stablecoins introduce competition? Lower Transaction Costs: Sending stablecoins can often be cheaper than traditional wire transfers or international remittances, especially for cross-border payments. Faster Settlements: Transactions on blockchain networks can settle in minutes, compared to days for some traditional methods. Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins can potentially be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and a digital wallet, including the unbanked or underbanked populations globally. Programmability: Stablecoins can be integrated into smart contracts, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial applications not easily done with traditional money. This potential for efficiency and accessibility puts pressure on existing payment providers to innovate and reduce costs, ultimately benefiting consumers and businesses. The US Fed , in its role of maintaining a stable and efficient financial system, recognizes this dynamic. The US Fed’s Broader Perspective on Crypto Payments and Digital Currency Governor Waller’s comments fit into a broader, ongoing conversation within the US Fed and other global central banks about the future of money and payments. While the Fed has been researching a potential U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), often referred to as the “digital dollar,” officials have also acknowledged the role and potential of private sector innovations like stablecoins. Some key considerations for the US Fed regarding stablecoins and Digital Currency include: Financial Stability: Ensuring stablecoins maintain their peg and do not pose risks to the broader financial system if a major issuer were to fail. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users from fraud, loss of funds, and ensuring transparency from stablecoin issuers. Illicit Finance: Preventing stablecoins from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. Interoperability: How stablecoins might interact with existing payment systems and potentially a future CBDC. Waller’s focus on stablecoins as a Payment Instrument and source of competition suggests that the Fed is not just observing from the sidelines but is actively considering their integration and regulation within the existing financial ecosystem, rather than viewing them solely as external, unregulated entities. Benefits and Challenges: Weighing the Impact of Stablecoins as a Payment Tool While the potential benefits are significant, the path for stablecoins to become widely adopted as a mainstream Payment Instrument is not without hurdles. Potential Benefits: Efficiency: Faster and potentially cheaper transactions, especially cross-border. Accessibility: Broader reach to individuals and businesses outside traditional banking. Innovation: Enables new business models and financial applications (e.g., DeFi, tokenized assets). Transparency: Transactions recorded on a public ledger (depending on the blockchain). Key Challenges: Regulation: Lack of clear, comprehensive regulatory frameworks globally and in the U.S. creates uncertainty. Stability Risks: While designed to be stable, some algorithmic stablecoins have failed, highlighting risks if reserves or mechanisms are insufficient. Adoption: Requires user education, infrastructure development, and merchant acceptance. Interoperability: Different stablecoins on different blockchains need ways to interact seamlessly. Centralization Concerns: Fiat-backed stablecoins often rely on centralized issuers and traditional banks for reserves. Illicit Use: Potential for misuse in illegal activities if not properly regulated and monitored. Addressing these challenges is crucial for stablecoins to fulfill their potential as a widely trusted Payment Instrument and truly contribute to competition in the payments landscape, as highlighted by the US Fed . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape What does Governor Waller’s perspective mean for different stakeholders? For Businesses: Explore accepting Crypto Payments via stablecoins, especially for international transactions. Understand the associated risks and regulatory requirements. Consider how stablecoins could streamline supply chain payments or enable new financial services. For Consumers: Learn about stablecoins as an alternative way to send and receive money. Be aware of the differences between stablecoin types and choose reputable issuers. Understand the security implications of using digital wallets. For Developers and Innovators: Continue building applications that leverage stablecoins for payments, remittances, and financial services. Focus on security, user experience, and compliance with evolving regulations. For Policymakers and Regulators (like the US Fed): Waller’s comments underscore the need for clear and balanced regulation that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. This involves defining stablecoins legally, establishing reserve requirements, and implementing oversight mechanisms. The recognition from a US Fed Governor that stablecoins function as a Payment Instrument is a significant step. It shifts the conversation from whether they are legitimate to how they can be safely and effectively integrated into the financial system to enhance competition and efficiency in Digital Currency payments. Conclusion: Stablecoins Gaining Recognition at the Highest Levels Governor Christopher Waller’s statement that stablecoins are fundamentally a Payment Instrument and a catalyst for competition is a powerful acknowledgment from within the US Fed . It signals that policymakers are increasingly viewing these digital assets not just as fringe crypto phenomena but as potentially vital components of the future payments landscape. While significant regulatory and technical challenges remain, this perspective from a key figure like Waller lends credibility to the utility of stablecoins for Crypto Payments and highlights their potential to drive innovation in the realm of Digital Currency . The focus is clearly shifting towards understanding how best to harness the benefits of stablecoins while ensuring financial stability and consumer protection.

Why It Might Vanish From Exchanges Soon,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-supply-shock-incoming-why-it-might-vanish-from-exchanges-soon/,"The post XRP Supply Shock Incoming? Why It Might Vanish From Exchanges Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, once touched $3.38 and is now holding steady at $2.50. Some people are worried, while others think it’s just a pause. But what if I told you this might be your last chance to grab some XRP before it becomes hard to find? What’s going on? Let’s dig in and see why XRP might vanish from your favorite exchanges soon. XRP’s Supply Shock is Coming Aduino Fina, a well-known analyst from Alpha Lions Academy, thinks XRP is heading for a big supply shock. This means XRP might soon be so hard to find that even huge investors can’t get their hands on it. How’s that possible? Well, every time you send XRP, a tiny amount, just 0.00001 XRP, is burned and gone forever. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Binance’s stash of XRP fell from 2.94 billion coins at the start of the year to around 2.86 billion today. That’s 82 million XRP gone in just a few months. It doesn’t sound like much, but over time, these little burns add up and shrink the total supply. More XRP Leaving Exchanges Every Day And it’s not just these small burns making XRP scarce. More people are taking their XRP off exchanges to store it safely in private wallets. Since January, Binance has lost 183 million XRP to these quiet withdrawals. Back in January, when XRP soared to a seven-year high of $3.30, Binance’s hot wallet ballooned over 3 billion coins as everyone rushed to sell. But soon after, the hype faded, and these coins started leaving exchanges, moving to cold wallets and secure storage instead. XRP ETF On The Horizon Adding to this, there’s a 90% chance that an XRP ETF will be approved by the end of 2025. If that happens, banks and big money managers will rush to grab as much XRP as they can. With less XRP left on exchanges and more people wanting it, prices could shoot up fast. That’s why many believe this could be the last chance to grab XRP before it gets harder to find and much more expensive. What Should You do? Crypto expert Cheeky Crypto says only invest what you can afford to lose, and remember big moves take time. Right now, people are moving XRP off exchanges, but supply shocks and ETF approvals don’t happen overnight. They take time to play out. If Ripple signs new deals with banks in Asia and the Middle East could also help XRP’s price and usage. Currently, XRP is around $2.14 , down 9% in a week, with a market cap of $125 billion. This might be a good time to buy more XRP while prices are low.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 12:21:59

These highly criticized meme-based tokens have remained afloat, with leaders Dogecoin and Shiba Inu collectively experiencing a bullish uptrend, suggesting a possible preparation for altcoin season. Shiba Inu corrects upwards following a surge in trading volume Shiba Inu, the 16th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and the second most valuable memecoin behind Dogecoin, has made a remarkable rebound after recording a mild intraday price decline. According to data from Coindesk Research’s technical analysis model, the meme coin experienced a 5% price surge in under 24 hours. The move comes after the asset recorded an intraday low, sending Shib down to the $0.0000139 price mark. The follow-up bullish reversal signals a slow recovery for SHIB, priming it to retest previous support levels soon potentially. The intraday price decline was observed after a sell-off, which resulted in the meme coin trading at a daily low. The meme coin began its recovery as buying pressure increased, with trading volume shooting upwards. Dogecoin (DOGE) bulls remain in control, breaking key resistance levels Similarly, leading memecoin Dogecoin has managed to stay afloat despite the volatility recorded in the previous week. The memecoin snagged 6.4% in gains under 24 hours, breaking through the $0.220 resistance levels. Notably, buying volume has surpassed $67,456,500. It bears mentioning that whale activities have skyrocketed for the memecoin, with large whales accumulating more than 1 billion Doge tokens over the last month. Both milestones suggest that Doge Bulls are wide awake and buying pressure is building up strongly, with a potential price breakout in sight.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) initially jumped to a record high of $109,300 in January and set a new one at $111,900 in May. Other meme coins initially surged in January following the launch of Official Trump ( TRUMP ), but retreated over the first quarter. Most staged a strong recovery in April, with some soaring more than 200% from their lowest levels this year. The question is whether Bitcoin and other altcoins will continue rising in June, or if a new crypto winter is about to start. Historically, June is usually one of the worst months in the crypto market. Most cryptocurrencies drop during the month, while volume typically slips as many investors take a summer holiday break. You might also like: Vitalik Buterin confirms Ethereum’s layer 1 to scale tenfold within 12 Months The average Bitcoin return in June since 2013 is minus 0.34%, while the median is minus 0.23%. This makes it the worst month after September. Also, Bitcoin has posted negative returns in June in most years since 2013. Ethereum’s performance in June is also not encouraging, as it has had a negative return in most years. Its average return since 2016 is minus 6.8%, its worst month of the year. ETH price action by month | Source: CoinGlass Therefore, if history repeats itself, a crypto winter may likely occur in June. This period is characterized by falling or stalling prices and reduced trading activity. It is also marked by a neutral fear and greed index. Bitcoin price action to determine crypto winter BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, will determine whether the crypto winter happens. A strong surge to new record highs may lead to renewed demand for altcoins, including meme coins. The daily chart shows that BTC has pulled back from its all-time high of $111,900 in May to $104,000. This pullback is likely part of the handle formation in a cup-and-handle pattern, a common continuation setup. The cup has a depth of about 32%, suggesting the coin may eventually surge to over $144,600. This target is derived by measuring the same distance from the upper side of the cup. Therefore, Bitcoin may drive a crypto winter as it continues forming the handle section. If this occurs, most altcoins may continue falling in June. Fortunately, due to the cup-and-handle pattern, the crypto winter will likely give way to a crypto spring once Bitcoin rebounds.

However, there has been a significant decline since then, and Bitcoin's upward momentum is thought to have temporarily weakened. At this point, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas said that the Bitcoin price is at a psychological and technical turning point that could start or end the next bull run. “Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are signaling that the current bullish momentum is starting to weaken. However, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin is optimistic, with both analysts and market participants increasingly convinced that we may be entering the early stages of a new supercycle. “At this point, investors are being cautious as they are not sure if this is the beginning of a short-term top or a pause before the next rise.” Bitcoin at Decision Point! While the analyst noted that the long-term outlook is optimistic, he said that Bitcoin is at a critical turning point and there are two possible scenarios for Bitcoin in the coming days. Stating that Bitcoin must remain in the range of $103,000 – $105,000 at this point, the analyst assessed that a possible drop below $103,000 could extend to $93,000. “If Bitcoin can stay in the $103,000-$105,000 range, it could rise again to $115,000.

For years, Ripple’s mission has been to revolutionize cross-border payments by offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternatives to legacy systems like SWIFT. But while many blockchain projects make big promises, Ripple has gone a step further: it has already secured partnerships with some of the world’s largest banks, quietly laying the groundwork for what could become a financial revolution. A recent thread by the X influencer X Finance Bull shines a spotlight on Ripple’s extensive banking network, arguing that the current XRP price dip is less a reason for panic and more a rare buying opportunity. Let’s unpack these key bank partnerships and explore why they could propel XRP to the stratosphere. Don’t fumble $XRP because of this dip. Banks aren’t just talking about crypto anymore, they’re integrating it. And Ripple is already 10 steps ahead. Here’s a thread of key bank partnerships with Ripple that could send #XRP to the stratosphere pic.twitter.com/znEZLGCt0H — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) June 1, 2025 Santander: A European Giant Moves with Ripple Santander, one of Europe’s largest banks , has been working with Ripple for several years. Unlike many financial institutions still testing the blockchain waters, Santander is already using RippleNet to facilitate cross-border payments. What’s more, the bank is actively exploring Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution, which leverages XRP to settle transactions instantly without the need for pre-funded accounts. This is not theoretical development; Santander has been piloting real settlement use cases with XRP, meaning the groundwork for scaled-up usage is already in place. Should Santander expand its ODL integration across its massive European customer base, the transactional volume flowing through the XRP ledger could surge, driving significant demand for the token. Bank of America Bank of America (BofA) has been collaborating with Ripple since as far back as 2016, positioning itself as one of Ripple’s most prominent U.S. banking partners. According to X Finance Bull, BofA has recently shown heightened interest not only in XRP but also in Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin project. If BofA were to fully adopt XRP for domestic and cross-border payments, the potential volume entering the XRP ecosystem would be enormous. Given BofA’s scale, handling trillions in assets, such an adoption could mark one of the most historic moments in crypto-financial integration. For XRP holders, this could translate to unprecedented utility-driven demand, a sharp contrast to the speculative cycles that typically dominate crypto markets. Standard Chartered Standard Chartered , a major player in Asia and the Middle East, has already integrated RippleNet into its cross-border payment systems. What sets this partnership apart is the bank’s direct exposure to some of the world’s largest remittance corridors, especially vital in developing markets where traditional banking infrastructure often struggles to meet the needs of cross-border families and businesses. The upcoming rollout of ODL across these corridors could supercharge XRP demand in these fast-growing regions. Given the scale of remittance flows, especially from expatriate workers in the Middle East to Asia, Ripple’s solutions offer a seamless, low-cost, high-speed alternative that stands to attract significant adoption. Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) Thailand’s largest bank, Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), is another early adopter of RippleNet. SCB is currently using Ripple’s technology to enable remittances across more than 12 countries. While this is already impressive, the real game changer would come when SCB flips the switch on ODL, tapping into XRP as the settlement asset. With Asia emerging as one of the most crypto-friendly regions globally, SCB’s potential expansion of XRP usage could position Thailand as a blockchain payments pioneer. As X Finance Bull highlights, this kind of regional momentum is often underestimated by Western markets but holds massive implications for global XRP liquidity. First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) stands as a powerhouse in the Middle East’s financial sector. As a RippleNet partner, FAB holds direct access to a staggering $19 billion remittance market. Should FAB move from simply leveraging RippleNet to full-scale ODL adoption, the resulting XRP liquidity requirements could be substantial. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Middle East is rapidly modernizing its financial infrastructure, with many countries pushing toward fintech innovation and blockchain integration. Ripple’s foothold in this region places XRP in a strong position to capture new market share and increase its role as a global liquidity bridge. CIBC: Canada’s Largest Bank Joins the Ripple Network Perhaps one of the most eye-catching developments is the involvement of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), Canada’s largest bank. According to X Finance Bull, CIBC has partnered with Ripple and is actively approving the use of XRP for cross-border settlements. This development signals a pivotal shift. When national banking leaders start onboarding blockchain assets like XRP, the conversation moves beyond speculative hype into institutional-grade utility. With CIBC on board, Ripple’s vision of global liquidity starts to look less like a distant goal and more like an unfolding reality. The Bigger Picture: XRP as the Global Bridge Asset If regulatory clarity continues to progress, as recent political developments, including mentions of XRP on Trump’s proposed Crypto Reserve list, suggest, the institutional path for XRP becomes even clearer. Ripple’s drawn-out legal battle with the SEC is nearing its end, removing one of the biggest overhangs on XRP’s market potential. As X Finance Bull emphasizes, XRP is uniquely positioned to solve one of the biggest pain points in global finance: the need for pre-funded accounts and the frictions of the SWIFT system. By acting as an instant bridge between currencies, XRP promises to unlock global liquidity on a scale previously unimaginable. This isn’t just hopeful speculation. Many of Ripple’s banking partners are already running real-world tests, fine-tuning the mechanics that could soon make XRP a cornerstone of cross-border finance. For investors watching the current XRP price dip, the message from X Finance Bull is clear: the dip is a gift. Once the institutional switch flips and green candles take over, the window to accumulate XRP at current levels may close swiftly.

His idea? A dark pool perpetual swap DEX designed to protect whales from front-running, MEV bot attacks, and liquidation hunting. If it sounds intriguing, that’s because it is. Read on to know more. Given recent events, I think now might be a good time for someone to launch a dark pool perp DEX. I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations. Even with a CEX… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 1, 2025 The Problem with Transparent DEXs Zhao’s proposal addresses a significant flaw in current decentralized exchanges (DEXs): the visibility of orders in real time. “If you’re looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you wouldn’t want others to notice until it’s completed,” Zhao stated in his X post. This issue becomes even more problematic on perpetual DEXs where liquidation levels are visible. Bad actors can coordinate attacks that push prices toward these thresholds, triggering mass liquidations. Case in Point: The $100M Liquidation on Hyperliquid CZ’s remarks came shortly after a dramatic incident involving trader James Wynn, who reportedly held nearly $100 million in long BTC positions on Hyperliquid. When Bitcoin briefly dropped below $105,000, Wynn’s positions were liquidated – prompting widespread speculation that it was a coordinated “liquidation hunt.” Rumors swirled on X that Tron’s Justin Sun had shown interest in the group allegedly behind the event, and that Eric Trump – yes, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump – had even been invited. While none of these claims are confirmed, the chatter underscores how exposed large traders are in today’s transparent DeFi markets. Dark Pools: A TradFi Solution for DeFi Dark pools aren’t new – they’ve long existed in traditional finance (TradFi) as private venues where large trades happen away from public order books. As CZ pointed out, these pools are often “10 times bigger” than transparent ones, shielding traders from front-running, slippage, and unnecessary market impact. Translating that model to DeFi, however, is no small feat. According to StealthEX CEO Maria Carola, “the fundamental challenge in building a dark pool-style perp DEX is achieving both privacy and verifiability.” She suggested technologies like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs could make this possible, allowing trades to be validated without revealing sensitive details. Balancing Privacy and Security in DeFi Still, Carola cautioned that “opacity is a double-edged sword.” While it reduces front-running risks, it can also obscure manipulative behavior, especially in leveraged environments like perpetual swaps. To offset this, she recommended integrating adaptive risk engines and behavioral anomaly detection, ideally with cryptographic accountability baked in. In short, if we’re going to hide trades, we’d better watch the system closely. So… Is a Dark Pool DEX the Future? CZ isn’t claiming his idea is perfect. In fact, he acknowledged that transparency can help market makers absorb large orders, making some forms of openness valuable. What he is doing, however, is pushing the space to evolve. He encouraged developers to explore on-chain dark pool designs, whether by hiding the order book or delaying visibility of smart contract deposits, to build a more balanced, secure environment for institutional-scale traders.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-02 13:33:30

Elon Musk is at it again in the virtual world—this time by promising to roll out ”Bitcoin-style” end-to-end encryption onto XChat, the revamped direct messaging service on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement, delivered in true Musk fashion via a tweet, has excited some and left most of the industry insiders and observers in the tech and cryptocurrency worlds unconvinced. XChat, which is written completely in the Rust programming language, is shipping with a raft of privacy-focused features: end-to-end encrypted messaging, disappearing messages, any-file-type support, and cross-platform video and audio calls — all without users needing a phone number. Musk says XChat's encryption is built on the same robust cryptographic foundations that protect Bitcoin, but what does that actually mean? Cracking ”Bitcoin-Style” Encryption Bitcoin's own security relies upon elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), specifically the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which allows users to generate public/private key pairs and securely sign messages. In discussing messaging, ”Bitcoin-style” cryptography likely means that XChat would utilize similar ECC-based techniques — i.e., Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) for secure key exchange and ECIES for message encryption. This can provide strong, efficient end-to-end security, with only the sender and recipient capable of reading the messages. However, as some cryptography experts have pointed out, Bitcoin itself does not encrypt transactions, but rather signs them, so that the ”Bitcoin-style encryption” label is more of a marketing phrase than an engineering term. Security researcher Ian Miers further contributed, ”Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption. It's like saying, we decided to drive our rocket on water, as NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen”. Others comment that Rust is a secure, new language, but it's not exactly a guarantee of cryptographic correctness. Security Experts: Divergent Perspectives and Outstanding Issues The cryptosphere and security communities disagree. Some privacy champions welcome XChat's move as a step long overdue toward the mainstream embrace of strong encryption, potentially signing up millions for public-key cryptography and secure digital communication as the new standard. Others caution that in the absence of open-source code and third-party audit, individuals are putting their trust in Musk's guarantee—a risky bet in the wake of the platform's recent history of data breaches. “Needless to say ‘Bitcoin style’ and ‘Rust’ are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app.” — Ian Miers, cryptography professor, on X “XChat’s ECC-based protocols could set a new standard for privacy, but only if they’re transparent and auditable.” — @PrivacyMatters, June 2, 2025 Mainstream Effect: Crypto Onboarding or Confusion? If XChat's security stands up to examination, it is a privacy game-changer for mass market messaging. The disappearing messages, file sharing, and phone number-less accounts place XChat on a head-to-head collision course with WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, but with the added twist of crypto-motivated security. Some believe this could demystify public-key cryptography for millions, paving the way for more mass-market use of crypto. Yet, the lack of technical clarity and the closed nature of X’s stack have left many experts cautious. Without open protocols or code audits, it’s impossible to know if XChat’s encryption is as “Bitcoin-grade” as Musk claims — or if it’s simply marketing spin Whether XChat's encryption is genuine privacy innovation or just good marketing, one thing is certain: the battle for secure messaging—and crypto's place in mainstream tech — is only just starting.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-02 13:35:33

Speaking at an event in Seoul, South Korea, Waller noted that any uptick in inflation caused by the new import taxes is likely to be brief, as mentioned in a Reuters report . “I support looking through any tariff effects on near-term inflation when setting the policy rate,” he said. Waller explained that if the duties end up near the lower end of possible levels and “underlying inflation continues to make progress to our 2% goal” while the job market remains “solid,” he would back “good news” rate cuts later this year. He added, “Fortunately, the strong labor market and progress on inflation through April gives me additional time to see how trade negotiations play out and the economy evolves” before the Fed must make a decision on rates. His remarks mirror what he has said in recent weeks, coming at a time of considerable uncertainty around Trump’s trade strategy. The president has made large, unpredictable changes to tariff rates and their timing, and the entire tariff program faces legal challenges that could undermine its goals. Many economists and Fed officials believe the tariffs will wind up pushing unemployment higher and inflation up while slowing economic growth. These import taxes have also raised doubts about whether the Fed will be able to lower its current federal funds rate, which sits between 4.25% and 4.50%, before year-end. Tariffs will drive near-term inflation rise, but it will be short-lived Waller’s openness to cutting rates if the economy allows stands in contrast to other central bank officials who have been more cautious, choosing to wait and see. He did caution that the economy has so far felt little impact from tariffs, but that could change. “I see downside risks to economic activity and employment and upside risks to inflation in the second half of 2025, but how these risks evolve is strongly tied to how trade policy evolves,” he said. Waller pointed out that higher tariffs will reduce spending, and businesses will respond “in part by reducing production and payrolls.” He said tariffs will be the main driver of any near-term inflation rise, but those price jumps would likely be one-time events, “most apparent in the second half of 2025.” If duties remain at a more modest level, around 10%, he believes some of the cost increases won’t fully be passed on to consumers. He also noted that the odds of facing a “large” tariff scenario have fallen. Past inflation drivers are not present today Waller said some of the worry about inflation stems from missteps during the pandemic, when many expected rising prices to be temporary. “What often has people spooked is we had the same view in 2021, that all this stuff was transitory, it was a one-time level effect, and then it would all go away,” he remarked. “And that just turned out to be wrong.” However, he pointed out that the factors that made inflation stick around back then are not present today. On the question of inflation expectations, Waller said he places more weight on what markets and professional forecasters predict rather than opinion surveys. Real-world data, he added, have not shown much change in the expected path of inflation . Waller turned to the recent rise in bond yields, which came amid growing caution toward dollar-denominated assets due to Trump’s trade actions. He said higher borrowing costs are tied to concerns about growing government debt and questions about how open the U.S. is to foreign investment. “There seems to be an attitude that foreign buyers of assets are not welcome in some sense,” he said, referring to certain government statements. “There’s been a risk-off attitude from foreign buyers of Treasuries, all U.S. assets … It’s not really that big, but it’s definitely there,” he added.

A significant development is coming out of Singapore , a major hub for financial technology and digital assets. If you are involved with or utilize services from crypto firms based in Singapore, especially those serving clients outside the country, pay close attention. The Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) has announced a crucial change that will impact many operators and their international users. Why is MAS Implementing This New Regulation? The primary goal of financial regulation, including in the crypto space, is to ensure market stability, protect investors, and prevent illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing. Singapore has been proactive in building a robust framework for Digital Token Service Providers (DTSPs). This latest move by the MAS is a natural extension of that effort, aiming to bring all aspects of services provided by Singapore-based entities under the purview of local regulation . Previously, some firms operating out of Singapore might have focused their licensing efforts primarily on domestic services, while perhaps serving overseas clients without the full DTSP license required for local operations. This created a potential loophole where Singaporean entities could conduct international business in digital tokens without being fully supervised by Singaporean authorities for those specific activities. The new rule seeks to close this gap, ensuring that any firm based in Singapore, regardless of where its clients are located, must adhere to Singapore’s high regulatory standards if providing digital token services. Enhancing Regulatory Perimeter: Extending oversight to all services provided from Singapore, local or overseas. Investor Protection: Ensuring that overseas clients dealing with Singapore-based firms benefit from MAS’s protective measures. Combating Financial Crime: Strengthening Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CFT) controls across all services. Maintaining Singapore’s Reputation: Solidifying Singapore’s position as a well-regulated and trusted financial center for digital assets. What Exactly Does This Ban Mean for Unlicensed Firms? The core of the announcement is clear: any local crypto firm based in Singapore that does not hold the necessary Digital Token Service Provider (DTSP) license from the MAS must cease providing digital token services to overseas clients. The deadline for this cessation is June 30, 2025. This applies specifically to unlicensed firms operating from Singapore. This is not a suggestion or a phased approach with a lengthy transition period. The report, notably highlighted by Wu Blockchain, indicates there will be no grace period beyond the June 30, 2025, deadline. This emphasizes the urgency for affected firms to assess their licensing status and operational structure. For unlicensed firms currently serving international customers from Singapore, this necessitates immediate action. They must either: Apply for and successfully obtain a DTSP license from MAS before the deadline. Wind down their services for overseas clients by June 30, 2025. Explore restructuring options, potentially relocating the part of their business that serves overseas clients outside of Singapore, though this comes with its own complexities and regulatory considerations in the new jurisdiction. Failure to comply with this directive can result in significant consequences. According to the information available, non-compliant firms may face penalties. While the specific nature and severity of these penalties were not detailed in the initial report, regulatory penalties from a body like MAS can range from financial fines to operational restrictions and reputational damage. What Are the Implications for Singapore’s Crypto Ecosystem? Singapore has actively courted the crypto industry, aiming to be a leading global hub for digital assets and blockchain technology. This regulatory tightening by MAS , while potentially challenging for some unlicensed firms , is largely seen by proponents as a necessary step to mature the ecosystem and attract more institutional players and serious businesses. Potential Benefits: Increased Legitimacy: Licensed firms operating from Singapore will have clearer regulatory standing, potentially increasing trust among international partners and investors. Level Playing Field: Ensures that all firms providing similar services from Singapore operate under the same regulatory obligations, preventing unfair advantages for unlicensed firms . Attracting Quality Businesses: Stricter regulation can deter less scrupulous operators, making Singapore more attractive for reputable global crypto companies seeking regulatory clarity. Enhanced Global Reputation: Reinforces Singapore’s image as a responsible and well-governed financial center in the digital asset space. Potential Challenges: Compliance Burden: Obtaining and maintaining a DTSP license is a rigorous and costly process, potentially challenging for smaller firms. Business Disruption: Unlicensed firms relying heavily on overseas clients face significant disruption, potentially leading to downsizing or relocation. Impact on Innovation: Some argue that stringent regulation could stifle innovation, although MAS aims for a balance between regulation and fostering innovation. Client Migration: Overseas clients of affected unlicensed firms will need to find new service providers, which could temporarily impact trading volumes or service availability for those individuals/entities. The move signals that MAS is serious about ensuring that any crypto activity originating from Singapore meets stringent compliance standards, regardless of the client’s location. This is part of a global trend where regulators are expanding their reach to cover cross-border digital asset services. Actionable Insights for Crypto Firms in Singapore If your crypto firm is based in Singapore and serves clients outside the country without a DTSP license, the clock is ticking. June 30, 2025, is the hard deadline. Here are key steps to consider: Assess Licensing Status: Confirm whether your current activities serving overseas clients fall under the scope requiring a DTSP license from MAS . Consult with legal and compliance experts specializing in Singaporean financial regulation . Evaluate Licensing Feasibility: If a license is required and you don’t have one, assess the feasibility, cost, and timeline of applying for a DTSP license. The application process is known to be thorough and can take a significant amount of time. Plan for Non-Compliance: If obtaining a license is not viable or desired, develop a clear plan to cease serving overseas clients by the deadline. This includes communicating with affected clients, facilitating asset transfers, and ensuring a smooth wind-down process for those specific services. Explore Restructuring: Consider if restructuring your business operations, perhaps by establishing entities or partnerships in other jurisdictions for overseas clients, is a viable alternative. This requires careful legal and regulatory planning in all involved locations. Strengthen Compliance: Regardless of the path chosen, ensure your internal compliance frameworks, particularly regarding AML/CFT and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, are robust and aligned with MAS expectations. This is crucial whether applying for a license or winding down. This directive highlights the importance for all firms operating in the digital asset space to stay updated on regulatory changes in every jurisdiction where they have a presence or serve clients. Proactive compliance is key to navigating the evolving global regulation landscape for crypto . How Does This Compare to Other Jurisdictions? Singapore’s approach reflects a broader global trend where financial regulators are extending their oversight to cross-border digital asset activities. Many jurisdictions are grappling with how to regulate services provided by locally-based entities to international users. For instance, the European Union’s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation includes provisions for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and aims to create a harmonized framework across member states, which will naturally impact cross-border services within the EU. The United States also has complex regulations where federal and state laws apply, and the question of jurisdiction for services provided to international clients by US-based entities is an ongoing area of focus for regulators like the SEC and CFTC. Singapore’s move is significant because it explicitly targets the ‘export’ of unlicensed digital token services from its shores. It sends a strong signal that operating a crypto business from Singapore requires adherence to Singaporean standards, regardless of where the customer is located. This proactive stance by MAS aims to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure that the risks associated with digital asset services are managed effectively at the source. What Does This Mean for Overseas Clients? If you are an overseas client using a crypto service provider based in Singapore that does not hold a DTSP license, you will need to transition to a different platform or provider by June 30, 2025. It is advisable to identify whether your current provider is licensed by MAS for digital token services. Most licensed entities prominently display this information. If your provider is among the unlicensed firms affected by this ban, they should be communicating with you about the upcoming changes and providing instructions on how to manage your assets or transition your services. Clients should prepare to transfer their digital assets to a licensed platform or a self-custody wallet before the deadline to avoid potential disruptions. This change, driven by MAS regulation , ultimately aims to direct users towards platforms that meet stringent regulatory and compliance standards, potentially offering a higher level of security and consumer protection, although users should always conduct their own due diligence. Conclusion: Navigating Singapore’s Evolving Crypto Landscape The decision by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to require local crypto firms to hold a DTSP license even when serving overseas clients marks a pivotal moment in the nation’s approach to digital asset regulation . This directive, targeting unlicensed firms and set with a firm deadline of June 30, 2025, underscores MAS’s commitment to comprehensive oversight and risk management within the burgeoning crypto sector. While posing operational challenges for some firms, this move is poised to strengthen Singapore’s position as a reputable and compliant global financial hub for digital assets. It emphasizes that operating from Singapore comes with the responsibility of adhering to its robust regulatory framework, regardless of client geography. Firms must act swiftly to assess their status and determine the best path forward – licensing, winding down overseas operations, or restructuring – to ensure compliance and avoid potential penalties. For overseas clients, it’s a call to verify the licensing status of their Singapore-based providers and prepare for necessary transitions. As the digital asset space matures, clear and comprehensive regulation like this from MAS will be crucial in fostering trust and sustainable growth.

It promises efficiency and innovation, yet the way it is presented to the world is raising significant concerns. Increasingly, this powerful technology is being dressed up in human clothing, marketed not as software or a tool, but as a ‘co-worker’ or ’employee’. This framing is more than just semantics; it’s a deliberate strategy with potentially harmful implications. The Strategy Behind AI Marketing as ‘Co-workers’ Why are companies, especially startups fresh out of accelerators like Y Combinator, pushing this narrative? The answer lies in psychology and market positioning. In an economy where hiring feels risky, pitching AI as ‘staff’ directly appeals to overwhelmed hiring managers. It softens the perceived threat and builds trust quickly by giving the AI a friendly, human-sounding name or persona. Examples abound: Anthropic named its platform ‘Claude’, aiming for a warm, trustworthy companion feel for a complex neural net. This mirrors tactics seen in fintech apps using friendly names like Dave or Albert to make financial transactions feel less intimidating. Companies like Atlog explicitly market an ‘AI employee’ designed to handle multiple functions, openly suggesting that one human manager could oversee many more operations, implying a significant reduction in the need for human staff. Some AI models are even given human-like names, like ‘Devin’, further blurring the lines between code and colleague. This approach is designed to make sharing sensitive data or relying on the AI feel more comfortable, like interacting with a trusted individual rather than a machine learning model. Addressing AI Job Displacement Concerns While the marketing is clever, it sidesteps a crucial issue: AI Job Displacement . The language of ‘AI employees’ is, in many cases, code for ‘human replacements’. When an ‘AI employee for furniture stores’ handles payments and marketing, the implication is clear: fewer human employees are needed for those tasks. The economic signals are already present. Recent data shows rising numbers of unemployed Americans receiving jobless benefits, including many laid-off tech workers. Experts like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have predicted that AI could eliminate a substantial portion of entry-level white-collar jobs in the near future, potentially driving unemployment significantly higher. While the exact scale and timeline are debated, the potential for widespread disruption is real and concerning. Marketing AI as a ‘co-worker’ feels particularly callous when viewed against this backdrop of potential job losses. It abstracts human roles into functions that can be automated, making it easier to overlook the human impact of technological advancement. Promoting AI Tools Over AI Employees Historically, major technological shifts were introduced differently. IBM’s mainframes were powerful computers, not ‘digital co-workers’. Personal computers were marketed as ‘workstations’ or ‘productivity tools’, empowering individuals rather than replacing them wholesale. This distinction in language is critical. Instead of selling ‘AI employees’, the focus should be on developing and marketing AI Tools that augment human capabilities. Software should extend the potential of actual humans, making them more productive, creative, and competitive. AI can be a powerful assistant, a data analysis tool, a creative partner – something that helps a great manager run complex businesses more effectively, rather than replacing 19 managers with one human and an AI system. Navigating the Future of Work with Realistic Expectations The integration of Generative AI into workplaces is inevitable and holds immense potential for positive change. However, how we frame this integration matters. Focusing on AI as empowering tools fosters a narrative of collaboration and enhancement, preparing the workforce for a future where humans and AI work together, each leveraging their unique strengths. The current trend of anthropomorphizing AI and marketing it as a ‘co-worker’ risks creating unrealistic expectations, downplaying the significant societal challenge of AI Job Displacement , and ultimately proving to be a disservice to both the technology and the people it impacts. The conversation needs to shift from ‘AI employees’ to how AI Tools can help shape a more productive and innovative Future of Work for everyone. Companies have a responsibility to be transparent about the capabilities and limitations of their AI products and to market them honestly for what they are: powerful tools designed to perform specific tasks. That’s what businesses and individuals are truly looking for – technology that helps them achieve more, not fake colleagues that obscure the reality of automation.

Here’s what it all means. #JamesWynn #Hyperliquid #Bitcoin https://t.co/0zaR5Z0VyQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 On May 21, he opened a $830M long on BTC, later adding another $1.1B as BTC crossed $111K, bringing his unrealized profits to nearly $40M. The 40x leveraged position had a liquidation level of $107,975. Initially profitable, the trade soured after Bitcoin dropped following Trump’s tariff announcement. On May 25, Wynn attempted to hedge with an $856M BTC short, also 40x leveraged, but exited just 15 hours later with a $15.5M loss. His last profitable trade came on May 24, netting $18.4M as part of a risk management effort. Yet the same day, he closed a $1.25B long on Hyperliquid at a $13.4M loss , despite it having briefly shown $40M in paper gains. He also exited a 540 BTC sale for $1.5M profit during the same period. Wynn’s cumulative swings totaled $117.5M, with one of his largest exits occurring after BTC dipped to $107,431, just shy of his $104K liquidation price. He confirmed the exit on X, stating he had “cut his losses.” Prior to this, he had earned $25.19M from a PEPE long. The collapse marked the end of a dramatic journey from $4M to a $100M portfolio peak. In a reflective X thread, Wynn called his final hours “surreal,” admitting he posted cryptic warnings as prices neared liquidation. I've decided to give perp trading a break. Thank you @HyperliquidX for your hospitality. Your service, impeccable. Your platform exquisite. Its been a fun ride. Approx $4m into $100m and then back down to a total account loss of $17,500,000. The time has come for me to… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 2, 2025 He blamed real-time funding costs on Hyperliquid for draining his capital: “The cost wasn’t just emotional. It was literal—bleeding by the second.” Despite vowing to step back, blockchain data from Hypurrscan confirmed that hours later, Wynn re-entered with a new $100M BTC long, again on Hyperliquid, again at 40x leverage, with an entry at $105,890.30. As of the latest update, the position is down $1.7 million, and Wynn appears to be adding to it to avoid liquidation. Source: Hypurrscan Community Split as Whales Fade, Retail Follows James Wynn’s return to the market with a massive 40x leveraged long has divided the crypto community. His position, now the largest on Hyperliquid, reignited interest in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While some applaud his transparency, others see it as reckless. An AI crypto assistant on X called Wynn’s move “textbook degen,” noting that some whales are actively betting against him while retail traders follow his lead. Alva also flagged concerning technical indicators—CRSI above 92 and a bearish MACD cross—suggesting potential downside ahead. “Wynn’s straight back in with size,” Alva warned . Wynn’s latest BTC actions are textbook degen: after catastrophic losses, he’s straight back in with another massive long, drawing both copiers and contrarians.

A trader using the wallet address 0x2258 reportedly made $5.6 million in just three days by systematically counter-trading Wynn’s public positions.

When Wynn exited his position the next day, the trader closed their short for a $1.36 million profit—part of a string of well-timed moves that’s turning heads across the crypto space.

While some may not be in favor of his ‘unserious’ online persona, crypto degens, for one, love every bit of it. After all, one tweet from the tech mogul can send any crypto’s price soaring. Something similar happened on Sunday night, when Musk took to X to post a 15-minute clip from the video game Path of Exile . Keep reading to learn more about Elon Musk’s Kekius Maximus obsession, his history of spiking meme coin prices, and discover a few legitimate/safe meme coins getting ample attention right now. Decoding the Kekius Maximus Episode Musk’s X post , captioned ‘Kekius Maximus pit level 117, hardcore rank 1,’ showed an in-game character named Kekius Maximus fighting off enemies and scoring points. Almost immediately after Musk’s tweet, several meme coins named after Kekius Maximus recorded significant spikes. For example, the Ethereum-based Kekius Maximus ($KEKIUS) shot up around 10%, whereas the Solana-based $KEKIUS rose by a chunky 9.5%. However, the most notable fact here is that Elon Musk isn’t personally affiliated with any of these cryptos, meaning they’re all ‘unofficial’ at best, if not ‘fake.’ This significantly increases the risk of them being rug pulls, cash grabs, or outright scams. Instances of traders not being able to sell their meme coin positions are, unfortunately, quite common. Musk’s History with Meme Coins Interestingly, Musk has a habit of tweaking his X username to show his support for a particular cryptocurrency. For instance, he changed his X bio to ‘CEO of Dogecoin,’ which led to a noticeable surge in $DOGE’s price. Speaking of $DOGE, Elon Musk was, in fact, one of the biggest catalysts behind its historic growth. Remember Musk’s famous SNL appearance back in 2021 ? He humorously referred to himself as the ‘Dogefather,’ hyping up the dog-themed meme coin like very few could. Floki Inu is another mainstream meme coin that jumped off Elon’s shoulders. Floki, in case you didn’t know, is the name of Musk’s real-life pet dog. Also, this is exactly what happened with CZ’s Broccoli. Soon after the crypto legend expressed his approval of meme coins and revealed his pet dog’s name (Broccoli), the crypto market saw a slew of $BROCCOLI tokens. Again, none of these were ‘official’ coins, even though a couple of them ended up with over 1,000% gains in less than a week. Sure, you can potentially make a fortune in one such wild celeb-fueled crypto rally. However, it makes little sense to gamble on such tokens when you can invest in legitimate, fundamentally strong cryptos like the ones below. These offer serious utility to encourage long-term holding. 1. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best Meme Coin to Buy Right Now MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , with an AI-infused Pepe the Frog as its mascot, is quite possibly the best crypto to buy right now . It’s an AI agent designed to always stay on top of online crypto chatter and real-time market activity, which is how it’s able to identify the next big crypto coin with decent accuracy. Here’s how $MIND works: It interacts with crypto influencers on online platforms like X, sparking thoughtful conversations with its context-aware tone and crypto lingo. After assessing the community’s biases, $MIND looks up live activity data, such as early investor funding, volume spikes, and token launches. Finally, the AI agent combines the two to point $MIND holders towards the best cryptos to invest in . Additionally, as a self-evolving AI agent, MIND of Pepe will also one day be able to create its own tokens. Needless to say, these new cryptos will be built around current market trends, which will put them in a great position to rocket to the moon. For access to MIND of Pepe’s actionable crypto investment advice as well as its handcrafted tokens, you’ll have to become a $MIND holder. The best part? You can buy $MIND now for just $0.0037515. That’s because the project is currently in presale, and it’s doing well, with over $12M raised. However, the presale ends in less than 24 hours, so hurry up! This is your last chance to grab $MIND at this price before it goes live on exchanges. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana Layer-2 with $43.2M in Presale Funding Solaxy ($SOLX) is another revolutionary crypto with Pepe the Frog as its face. Solaxy’s Pepe, however, features Einstein-like hair, signaling the project’s real-world application and importance. $SOLX aims to solve Solana’s long-standing problems of network congestion and scalability, which crept up soon after $TRUMP’s success flooded the blockchain with more investors than what Solana was equipped to handle. By building the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy will reduce the burden on the network’s mainnet. The new L2 will offload a bunch of transactions onto a sidechain. Moreover, Solana will also benefit from Solaxy in the form of increased affordability. That’s because $SOLX will process transactions in batches, which will reduce the cost per transaction. Given Solaxy’s one-of-a-kind mission, it’s hardly a surprise that it’s predicted to shoot up over 11,400% and reach $0.20 by 2030. It’s currently live, but the presale will be ending in less than 15 days. To make the most of Solaxy’s growth, become an early investor in the project — you can buy some $SOLX for just $0.001744. 3. Pepecoin ($PEP) – Pepe-Inspired Meme Coin Currently Breathing Fire Pepecoin ($PEP) looks and feels very similar to the OG $PEPE crypto, but it has a handful of unique features up its sleeves. For starters, unlike other popular meme coins , $PEP runs on its own blockchain. This allows it to not only offer low transaction fees but also completely eliminate Ethereum’s gas fees. Another unique Pepecoin feature is that it supports merged mining. This simply means that you can mine two or more crypto coins, like Dogecoin and Litecoin, simultaneously without using any additional computing resources. Also, $PEP’s commitment to decentralization is evident from the fact that all of the coins have only been distributed through mining – no pre-mine or team allocation. Since its launch in January 2024, $PEP is up nearly 3,300%. It’s also one of the top trending cryptos currently, with an over 34% gain over just the past seven days . Each coin is currently available for a low price of $0.0002690. Beware of Fake Meme Coins & Don’t Forget to DYOR With fake meme coins running riot through the crypto market, it’s important to be cautious of the tokens you select for investment purposes. That said, even with legitimate projects that show high potential and aren’t as reliant on a celebrity tweeting in their favor, like MIND of Pepe ($MIND) and Solaxy ($SOLX) , they’re still dependent on the broader market sentiment. No crypto investment is free from risk.

The SHIB price has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. SHIB Price Crashes Amid Slow Burn Rate And Massive Offload Also, Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. The SHIB price has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that the Shiba Inu whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB). Source: TradingView Shibarium (the layer-2 network) is also not doing well, as its total value locked is stuck at $2.92 million. In comparison, Uniswap (UNI) launched earlier this year with a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. This week’s biggest burn was an 18 million transaction, directly affecting the SHIB price. Investing $300 in Unilabs Now Could Turn Into $9,000? While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to hold ground in a shaky market, dropping nearly 30% from its May highs and facing slowed network growth, Unilabs (UNIL) is shaping up to be the AI-powered gem that could flip the narrative. Shiba Inu’s token burn rate is down, whales are exiting, and Shibarium is losing steam with under $3 million locked. Meanwhile, Unilabs boasts over $30 million in assets under management, introducing AI adoption in crypto with real-time data analysis and early-stage investment tracking. While the SHIB price hopes for $0.01 someday, Unilabs investors are already eyeing real value growth where a $300 investment could realistically surge past $9,000 as the ecosystem gains traction. Unilabs (UNIL) Takes the Lead Amid Memecoin Market Shakedown Among several dominating factors, what sets Unilabs (UNIL) apart is its AI-powered Launchpad, a robust infrastructure that basically never sleeps. It scans the crypto market for emerging projects daily, filtering hype from true potential. Instead of waiting for a coin to trend, Unilabs identifies high-growth tokens before they hit mainstream headlines. With tools like the Early Access Scoring System (EASS) and AI Market Pulse, Unilabs dominates projects like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, making data-backed investing easier, faster, and smarter. This isn’t just another DeFi asset manager, but an AI hedge fund for the everyday investor. Unilabs native token also offers a golden ticket opportunity to holders. This AI token is about exposure to elite-level projects, unlocking dividends, early access, governance power, and staking rewards. With each tier that holders move up, their share of the 30% platform fee redistribution grows. This unique advantage makes the UNIL token a must-have in 2025. Conclusion: As AI continues to lead the next crypto bull run, it won’t be a surprise if UNIL surges past $0.10 or even $0.25 in the next 12 to 18 months. While the current SHIB price and other memecoins are driven by community hype and speculative hope, Unilabs brings structure, data, and sustainable growth. And it’s not about luck, it’s about timing and tech. While the broader crypto ecosystem is leaning into AI, real-world assets, and institutional-grade DeFi, Unilabs platform fundamentals lead the charge and dominate other crypto giants. The memecoin network may have the memes, but Unilabs (UNIL) has the math, the momentum, and the money. Check out its fast-selling presale today.

Hot wallets on Tron, Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon saw suspicious outflows on May 8, and the stolen assets were sold via DEX. The on-chain detective blew the whistle on Sunday, claiming that BitoPro was possibly hacked and the funds went into a coin mixer. According to ZachXBT, the loot was drained from hot wallets across multiple chains and laundered via Tornado Cash and Thorchain. Funds were then deposited into Tornado Cash or bridged Bitcoin via THORChain before they were deposited into Wasabi. The exchange has so far not officially acknowledged the incident, suspending its services only on the grounds of “system maintenance.” BitoPro acknowledges security breach weeks after incident 【BitoPro Official Statement: June 2, 2025】 BitoPro recently experienced a cyberattack on an old hot wallet during a wallet system upgrade. Upon detection, we quickly launched an emergency response, securing assets by moving them to new wallets and blocking the attacker. — BitoGroup 幣託集團 (@BitoEx_Official) June 2, 2025 BitoPro finally confirmed three weeks after the incident that it had suffered a wallet exploit. On June 2, the exchange said the breach occurred during a wallet system upgrade when an attacker exploited an “old hot wallet” during internal fund reallocation. On May 9, BitoPro announced a maintenance period for the exchange, which was resolved on the same day. Deposits, withdrawals, and all trading functions remained operational while a third-party blockchain security firm was commissioned to trace the stolen funds. However, many users have since reported being unable to withdraw USDt (USDT). “We hereby declare that the platform has sufficient virtual asset reserves and user rights are not affected at all. Since the incident, user top-up, withdrawal and transaction functions have remained normal.” – BitoPro BitoPro promised to release its new hot wallet address for external inspection soon in order to demonstrate its commitment to asset security and transparency. The exchange’s team added that many of the platform’s assets were stored in cold wallets with no external connections for a long time and had never been affected, so the overall assets were safe. The team also said it will continue to improve information security protection mechanisms, fine-tune wallet management processes and monitoring capabilities, and protect the asset security of every user. ZachXBT believes BitoPro’s delay in publicizing breach was unnecessarily Do you want to explain to the community why multiple of your hot wallets saw suspicious outflows of ~$11.5M on May 8, 2025 where you still have not disclosed the security incident on X or Telegram several weeks later? pic.twitter.com/HlD0c93Or4 — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 2, 2025 The crypto Sherlock Holmes also questioned BitoPro’s reluctance to publicize the hack and loss of funds on X or Telegram weeks (~25 days) after the alleged security incident. He recently demanded real consequences , especially for underage SIM swappers and phishers, pointing out that Canadian and EU laws were a bit lenient on such young malicious actors. However, SomaXBT, another scam survivor turned crypto-threats investigator, claimed that the BitoPro team was probably working in the background to recover the stolen funds to surprise their users with a great heist and recovery story. The exchange users shared ZachXBT’s claim on the official BitoPro Telegram channel, where an administrator of the channel responded by saying they had just received numerous inquiries and would respond accordingly after investigations were concluded. As of the time of publication, the extent to which user assets on the exchange were affected remains unclear, and the attackers have not yet been identified.

The initiative aligns with BRICS efforts to reduce reliance on Western financial systems. Russia’s central bank now allows qualified investors limited access to crypto-linked derivatives under strict conditions. Russia is exploring ways to use cryptocurrencies to settle grain export payments, as the country looks to bypass Western sanctions and modernize its trade infrastructure. On June 2, the Russian Agricultural Bank (RusAg) reportedly said it is working with the Bank of Russia to evaluate digital asset-based payment solutions for grain exports. Irina Zhachkina, RusAg’s First Deputy CEO, described cryptocurrencies as a “convenient alternative instrument” for cross-border payments, especially as sanctions continue to limit Russia’s access to traditional financial systems. Sanctions Squeeze Russia’s Grain Exports as SWIFT Access Tightens Russia’s grain exporters have been squeezed by restrictions on logistics, shipping insurance, and the SWIFT banking network. These limitations have made it increasingly difficult for Russian companies to conduct transactions in U.S. dollars or euros. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized architecture, are emerging as a potential workaround. The move builds on Russia’s prior experience using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) to settle oil trades with China and India . Russia’s crypto initiative also fits into a broader de-dollarization push among BRICS nations. President Vladimir Putin recently proposed a BRICS grain exchange and a cross-border payment system using alternative currencies or digital assets. The initiative aligns with efforts across emerging markets to reduce reliance on Western-controlled financial systems. Russia is setting up two Cryptocurrency exchanges—one for international trade, one for Russian — alongside its own stablecoin. Wave ""bye"" to another aspect of sanctions. pic.twitter.com/QnKyxGogNp — James Porrazzo (@JamesPorrazzo) August 23, 2024 Several BRICS members, including China and Brazil, have expressed interest in blockchain-based payments for commodities trading. A crypto-based grain settlement system could provide BRICS countries with a resilient, sanction-resistant payment mechanism — and set an example for broader adoption in global trade. While the concept is gaining momentum, implementation remains in early stages. Regulatory hurdles, volatility in crypto markets, and resistance from some trade partners could slow progress. Legal questions also remain about how crypto-based grain transactions would be taxed, reported, and enforced under international trade law. Russia Allows Limited Crypto Derivatives Trading for Qualified Investors Last week, Russia’s central bank announced that it is allowing qualified investors limited access to crypto-linked financial products. Under the new guidance, banks and financial firms can offer derivatives and securities tied to cryptocurrency prices, though these products must be non-deliverable and settled in fiat. The Bank of Russia emphasized a cautious approach, requiring institutions to fully cover exposures and set strict risk limits. The central bank also plans to introduce formal regulations over the next year to address volatility risks linked to crypto markets. While the move marks a shift in Russia’s stance, direct crypto purchases remain off-limits. The government is also considering a pilot framework that would permit select investor groups to conduct crypto transactions in a highly controlled environment. In April, the Finance Ministry and the central bank began laying the groundwork for a state-run crypto exchange . The new platform, operating under Russia’s experimental legal regime for financial innovation, will serve only “super-qualified” investors.

That’s not all, a massive 111.8 billion SHIB outflow from exchanges has led to the burning questions on every SHIB enthusiast’s mind: “Will Shiba Inu (SHIB) reach 1 cent ?” or “Will Shiba Inu go up?” or “Is Shiba Inu a good investment?” Furthermore, we’ve crafted a comprehensive Shiba Inu price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030 to address these pressing queries.

45417514,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=398812,1748872480,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/45417514.jpeg,Elon Musk Faces Backlash Over ‘Bitcoin-Style Encryption’ Claim in XChat Launch,https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-faces-backlash-over-bitcoin-style-encryption-claim-in-xchat-launch/,"Elon Musk’s latest announcement about a new encrypted messaging feature on X has ignited a firestorm, not for the feature itself, but for his baffling description of its underlying tech. On June 1, the X owner revealed via his official account on the social platform that the new XChat has been “built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption.” Why Experts Say “Bitcoin-Style Encryption” is Nonsense Shortly after Musk’s post , a flood of commentary emerged, challenging the accuracy of his terminology. Notably, Bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer responded bluntly: “Bitcoin literally doesn’t have any encryption in it whatsoever.” The Taproot Wizards co-creator followed up by explaining that BTC uses cryptographic hashing and signing, which are essential for verifying data integrity and ownership, but do not conceal messages, a key function of encryption. “Encryption is when you have a message and want to keep it secret. Nothing in the Bitcoin protocol is encrypted… It’s all open, transparent, and viewable by anyone.” Adding to the chorus, cryptographer Ian Miers pointed out Bitcoin’s lack of privacy, likening it to a social media platform for bank accounts. “Everything you do is broadcast publicly,” he stated. “It’s the opposite of private.” The Zcash co-founder stressed that BTC transactions rely on signatures for authentication, rather than encryption for secrecy. He further critiqued the vagueness of Musk’s statement, writing: “Needless to say, ‘Bitcoin style’ and ‘Rust’ are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app.” However, several other voices supported the Tesla CEO, with some guessing that he may have meant SHA-256 hashing. Computer engineer Wei Dai also offered a charitable interpretation , suggesting that Musk might have equated “Bitcoin-style” with “peer-to-peer” or “end-to-end” encryption. However, this theory failed to clarify what encryption protocols XChat actually uses, and such ambiguity only added fuel to the fire. Musk Under Scrutiny The ongoing debate comes amid broader concern surrounding Musk’s leadership. Just a month ago, Tesla was forced to issue a public denial following claims by the Wall Street Journal that the electric car manufacturer was in the market for a new CEO. This was supposedly due to investor unease over the 53-year-old’s controversial political engagements and erratic online behavior. The Tesla board responded, reaffirming its complete confidence in Musk’s leadership. This latest episode with XChat risks further undermining the outspoken billionaire’s credibility among technologists. As pseudonymous developer Yueya.eth aptly put it: “Marketing teams love throwing around crypto buzzwords without understanding basics.” And in an ecosystem where language and accuracy build trust, the Boring Company founder’s vague phrasing may cause more confusion than hype.

45417671,https://cryptonews.com/?p=367186,1748872763,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45417671.jpeg,Cardano Price Prediction: Chaos or Catalyst? ADA Reacts to Hoskinson Fallout,https://cryptonews.com/news/cardano-price-prediction-chaos-or-catalyst-ada-reacts-to-founder-fallout/,"The Cardano community has been shaken up in the past couple of days after a dispute emerged between the founder of this blockchain’s protocol, Charles Hoskinson, and a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol called Optim Finance. According to Hoskinson, Optim financed a slander campaign against him that accused him of allegedly adding code to Cardano’s Allegra update that would allow him to redirect $600 million worth of ADA tokens without going through a community vote. The latest accusations were made by Masator Alexander, a creator of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), who claimed that Hoskinson managed to take control of this massive amount of tokens tied to the 2021 ADA initial coin offering (ICO). In 2021, Charles Hoskinson unilaterally used his genesis keys to REWRITE the Cardano ledger and take control of ₳318m ($619m) By comparison, when the DAO hack happened in 2016, the Ethereum community forked over $60m. One of the largest ledger reorgs in blockchain history: — masato_alexander (@masatoalexander) May 7, 2025 The founder of Cardano denied these accusations and took aim at Optim Finance, whose native asset O plummeted from $0.29 to $0.18 – a 38% loss – in late May after Hoskinson cut ties with this DeFi project. Ecosystem growth has been a weak spot of the Cardano network for years. Despite ADA’s rank as the 10th most valuable token in the crypto market, its DeFi ecosystem is quite small compared to its closest rivals like Solana and even Sui. Hoskinson’s hostile response to Alexander’s allegations was not welcomed by the Cardano community as it was deemed detrimental to the relationship between the project and its ecosystem developers. Does this latest rift favor a bearish Cardano price forecast ? Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Could Drop to $0.50 After Trend Line Break Cardano has been dropping for 7 days in a row. The market’s latest pullback along with this project-specific matter may have prompted a strong decline in its price. During this period, ADA has shed 12.8% of its value while its year-to-date losses currently stand at nearly 21%. The daily price chart shows a bearish breakout of ADA’s descending price channel that could result in further losses. Cardano’s recent break below key support could signal a bearish turn. While a short-term bounce to retest the former trendline from below is possible, the current technical setup suggests a likely retreat toward the $0.50 mark in the coming weeks — forming a more cautious Cardano price prediction for now. In contrast, Solana continues to dominate as a go-to ecosystem for DeFi growth. Solaxy (SOLX), a cutting-edge Layer 2 scaling solution built on Solana, has rapidly become one of the hottest crypto presales of the year . With its mission to streamline network efficiency and reduce congestion, SOLX is positioning itself as a key player in the next wave of decentralized innovation. Solaxy (SOLX) Enters the Last Days of Its Presale – Don’t Miss Your Chance to Invest Solaxy (SOLX) has been designed to eliminate the congestion issues that have negatively impacted Solana’s operational efficiency in the past. The project achieves this through the launch of a side chain that bundles transactions offline to alleviate the mainnet’s burden during peak usage periods. The developing team has already made significant progress in the deployment of this L2. Thus far, they have launched a testnet, a token bridge, and an L2 block explorer that investors can check in real time to assess the performance of this solution. As the utility token of this solution, $SOLX will experience high demand once Solaxy is widely adopted by top exchanges and wallets. To buy $SOLX at its discounted presale price, head to the Solaxy website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap SOL and USDT or use a bank card to make your investment.

Nasdaq has just received a fresh filing to list 21Shares’ spot Dogecoin ETF, a move that could open DOGE to traditional brokerage accounts. At the same time, Yeti Ouro’s Stage 4 presale has raced past the $4.3 million mark on a $0.041 token price while disclosing a Play-to-Earn (P2E) vision aimed at long-term utility. ETF Filing Puts DOGE One Step Closer to Wall Street On 28 May 2025, 21Shares US LLC submitted an amended Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the “21Shares Dogecoin ETF.” The trust would hold spot DOGE, with Coinbase Custody fending the assets and track the CF DOGE-USD Settlement Price—mirroring the structure of spot-Bitcoin ETFs approved earlier this year. Nasdaq’s companion rule-change request has already been acknowledged, starting the SEC’s formal review clock. Analysts see the product as a credibility leap for a coin born from internet humor, arguing that an exchange-traded wrapper could funnel both retirement account flows and large-advisor allocations into DOGE if approved. DOGE Price Snapshot Amid Renewed Institutional Buzz Dogecoin spent most of May consolidating, but the ETF headline revived bullish sentiment. On 30 May 2025, Dogecoin price was at $0.2049 , down 8.8% on the day yet still up nearly 17% week-over-week as traders weigh the ETF’s odds. Market depth on major exchanges shows improving buy-side liquidity each time regulatory milestones hit the tape—a pattern similar to Bitcoin’s run-up during its own spot-ETF saga earlier this year. Yeti Ouro Presale Rockets Past $4.3 Million in Stage 4 While DOGE courts institutions, Yeti Ouro is wooing retail speculators and gamers. Stage 4 of the presale went live at $0.041 per YETIO and the project has sold more than 246 million tokens, bringing the total funds raised to $4,371,593.21. That is a 242% paper return for the earliest Stage 1 buyers, who entered at $0.012. The team has also launched a $100,000 giveaway —five winners will each receive $20,000 in YETIO—adding viral fuel to social-media chatter. Prospective entrants can find details on the project’s website. From Meme to Tangibility: Inside YETIO’s P2E Roadmap Unlike many one-note meme coins, Yeti Ouro plans to anchor long-term demand in a play-to-earn ecosystem of Yeti Go built on Unreal Engine 5. Tokens will function as in-game currency, reward power-ups, and later govern community-driven asset burns. Yeti Go throws you straight into the action with stunning visuals and a pulse-pounding soundtrack. Developed in collaboration with the powerhouse team behind gaming giants like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, The Witcher, and Dead Space, this game is built for thrill-seekers. But it’s not just about what you see—the sound design, shaped by pros who’ve worked with Grammy-nominated artists like Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid, adds energy and emotion to every moment. The white paper outlines phased releases: an endless-runner demo lands this summer, followed by terrain-based PvP modes that burn a fraction of entry fees, shrinking the circulating supply. Fifteen percent of the one-billion token cap is ring-fenced for ongoing gaming rewards, and unsold presale inventory is slated for burn at token-generation event (TGE). The strategic blend—scarcity mechanics plus skill-based earning—aims to convert meme speculators into daily active players, a model popularized by earlier P2E pioneers but now enhanced with console-grade graphics. What Parallel Narratives Mean for Retail Investors? DOGE and YETIO sit at opposite ends of the meme-asset maturity curve, yet both highlight crypto’s expanding opportunity set. If regulators green-light the 21Shares ETF, DOGE could see a structural bid from wealth-management channels that dwarf today’s spot markets. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro is proving that presales can still attract eight-figure interest—provided they pair internet-culture branding with a tangible utility roadmap. For traders, the divergence is clear: DOGE offers an asymmetric bet on regulatory approval and macro adoption, but near-term upside may hinge on SEC timelines. YETIO provides early-stage exposure to a token that is still privately priced; however, execution risk remains until the game launches and liquidity opens on exchanges. As always, due diligence is central—but meme-coin season shows no sign of losing its narrative firepower.

45417731,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69376,1748872805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,RichMiner’s new green electricity mining strategy: cryptocurrency holders unlock low-carbon and high-yield potential,https://timestabloid.com/richminers-new-green-electricity-mining-strategy-cryptocurrency/,"Introduction: When holding coins encounters a ceiling of value-added “In addition to staking at low interest rates, can the Bitcoin in your wallet create greater value?” A 2024 Bitwise research report pointed out that 53% of cryptocurrency holders worldwide have idle assets exceeding 60% of their total investment, and the annualized return of traditional value-added channels is less than 4%, while the capital, technology and energy costs required to build their own mines are prohibitive for 95% of retail investors. RichMiner uses Green Power Cloud Mining as a fulcrum and launches three innovative secrets, allowing coin holders to leverage low-carbon high returns without selling tokens – this is not only a financial upgrade, but also a return to the original value of cryptocurrency. Why is green electricity + cloud mining an inevitable trend? Policy forced: The EU “Markets in Crypto Assets Act” (MiCA) requires the disclosure of mining carbon footprints, and China has completely cleared out thermal power mines – the high energy consumption model has come to an end. Institutional entry threshold: The premise for companies such as Tesla and MicroStrategy to hold Bitcoin is “clean energy mining”, and ESG ratings have become a capital entry pass. User mental migration: Surveys show that 73% of millennial investors are willing to pay a premium for “low-carbon cryptocurrencies”. RichMiner ‘s three low-carbon secrets: Secret 1: Dynamic green electricity + AI scheduling system, a tool for maximizing profits; Technical essence – Dynamic optimization of mining energy consumption through AI matching grid load troughs with renewable energy (wind power/photovoltaic) production peaks. Automatic operation and maintenance monitoring – AI monitors the operating status of mining machines around the clock, automatically repairs abnormalities, and ensures stable operation. Dynamic switching: The platform’s AI algorithm analyzes the market (coin price, computing power demand) in real time, and automatically allocates computing power to the highest-yielding currency (such as BTC, ETH, DOGE, etc.) to protect your income. AI + cloud computing power = a new generation of intelligent mining experience Join RichMiner, let technology make money for you, and let intelligence change the future! Secret 2: Compliance and stability foundation: peace of mind investment guarantee; RichMiner data encryption transmission: SSL/TLS encryption protocol is used to ensure the absolute security of user data during transmission. RichMiner cold wallet asset storage: Most of the platform’s digital assets use a cold wallet storage mechanism to isolate network risks and prevent hacker attacks. RichMiner funds are safe and reliable: The platform has maintained a zero safety accident record for three consecutive years. RichMiner strictly complies with regulations: Comply with UK FCA regulations and anti-money laundering requirements, regularly publish audit reports, and eliminate “Ponzi” risks. RichMiner regular security audits: Regular platform audits are conducted through a third-party security team to promptly fix vulnerabilities and continuously improve the platform’s defense capabilities. Secret 3: Green enhancement of the revenue cycle; Avoid the risk of electricity price fluctuations: Users do not need to bear the surge in electricity prices caused by fossil energy prices or policy regulation, and the income is more stable. Cost reduction of 40%: The platform deploys renewable energy mines around the world, directly using solar and wind power to generate electricity, and the electricity cost is only 60% of that of traditional mines. Low carbon footprint: In response to global regulatory trends, new regulations such as the EU’s “Markets in Cryptoassets Act” (MiCA) set limits on high-carbon mining, green mining has become a compliance requirement, and platform qualifications are protected from policy shocks. A win-win situation for environmental protection and revenue: Each revenue has a lower “carbon content”. Compared with coal-fired mines, RichMiner reduces carbon emissions by more than 75%. Global mines are powered by 100% renewable energy, and each revenue can be traced back to a carbon offset certificate. RICH MINER uses wind and solar green electricity as its engine to break through the mining cost ceiling, so that the birth of each token carries a lower carbon footprint. “ RichMiner Guide: Three-step strategy from registration to profit maximization Register and start: If you register, you will get 15 Computing power bonus of USD. Choose to buy contracts to get income: RichMine’s contracts focus on efficiency – short term, fast return, full return. The following chart shows the potential income; (The platform has launched a series of stable high-yield contracts, which you can view on the RichMiner official website). Withdrawal and reinvestment: Daily income can be withdrawn to the wallet or invested in higher-level contracts to obtain more mining income. Conclusion: Redefining the ecological niche of coin holders RichMiner ‘s secret reveals a new paradigm; cryptocurrency holders are not only investors, but also instigators of clean energy computing power. When each coin is converted into real productivity through green electricity, coin holders are upgraded from “passive waiting” to “active creation” – while capturing the potential for profit, they also engrave the green gene on the carbon footprint of the blockchain.

According to reports from well-known on-chain analyst ZachXBT, Taiwan-based BitoPro may have suffered a significant loss of funds due to a suspected security breach. What Happened at the BitoPro Crypto Exchange? The alleged incident reportedly took place on May 8th, raising concerns about the security posture of BitoPro . While details are still emerging and the exchange has not yet made a public statement confirming the breach, the on-chain evidence points towards suspicious activity. ZachXBT, known for his detailed investigations into crypto scams and hacks, highlighted unusual movements of assets from several of BitoPro’s hot wallets. The suspected loss is estimated to be around $11.5 million in various digital assets. This figure, if confirmed, represents a substantial amount for any exchange and immediately brings the focus back onto the critical importance of robust security measures in the cryptocurrency space. Tracing the Funds: How Crypto Hot Wallets Were Targeted The report indicates that the alleged breach affected crypto hot wallets operated by BitoPro. Hot wallets, while convenient for facilitating quick transactions, are online and thus potentially more vulnerable to cyberattacks compared to cold storage solutions. The suspicious activity was observed across multiple blockchain networks, suggesting a coordinated effort by the attackers. Affected chains reportedly include: Tron Ethereum Solana Polygon Following the alleged extraction from the crypto hot wallets , the stolen assets were reportedly moved quickly through various channels in an apparent attempt to obscure their origin and ownership. This involved: Selling the assets through decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Depositing funds into Tornado Cash, a now-sanctioned crypto mixing service known for enabling privacy but also used for illicit activities. Bridging funds to Bitcoin (BTC) using THORChain, a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol. Transferring the final BTC amounts to Wasabi Wallet, a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet. This complex trail highlights the methods attackers use to launder stolen digital assets and the challenges faced by investigators and exchanges in tracing them. Understanding the Implications of a Security Breach A security breach , whether confirmed or suspected, has wide-ranging implications for a crypto exchange and its users. For BitoPro, this could mean: Loss of User Trust: Security is paramount in crypto. An incident like this can severely erode user confidence, potentially leading to withdrawals and a decrease in trading volume. Reputational Damage: The exchange’s standing in the competitive crypto market could be negatively impacted. Regulatory Scrutiny: Security incidents often attract attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to investigations and stricter compliance requirements. Financial Costs: Beyond the lost assets, there are costs associated with investigation, potential reimbursement (if the exchange covers losses), and strengthening security infrastructure. For users, it’s a stark reminder of the risks associated with keeping significant amounts of funds on exchanges, especially in hot wallets. The Role of Blockchain Security and On-Chain Analysis While the incident points to a potential failure in the exchange’s internal security, the very nature of blockchain security allows for the transparency needed for analysts like ZachXBT to trace the flow of funds. Public ledgers on chains like Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Polygon record every transaction, providing breadcrumbs for investigators. On-chain analysis tools and expertise are crucial in identifying suspicious patterns, linking addresses, and following the movement of stolen assets, even when obfuscation techniques like mixers or cross-chain bridges are used. This transparency, inherent to blockchain security , acts as a double-edged sword: it reveals the attack but also aids in tracking the perpetrators. What This Means for BitoPro and the Broader Crypto Landscape As of now, BitoPro has not officially commented on the situation. The crypto community awaits a formal statement to understand the full extent of the issue, whether it was indeed a breach, and what steps the exchange is taking to address it and protect user funds. This suspected incident serves as a critical reminder for all participants in the crypto space: For Exchanges: The constant need to audit and enhance security protocols, especially for crypto hot wallets , and to maintain transparency with users during potential incidents. For Users: The importance of practicing good security hygiene, such as enabling two-factor authentication, using strong passwords, and critically, minimizing the amount of crypto stored in exchange hot wallets, opting for cold storage for significant holdings. The resilience of the overall blockchain security ecosystem relies on continuous vigilance and improvement from all parties involved. Summary: The crypto world is watching closely as Taiwan’s BitoPro exchange faces scrutiny over a suspected security breach on May 8th, potentially resulting in an $11.5 million loss from crypto hot wallets across multiple blockchains. On-chain analysis by ZachXBT suggests stolen funds were laundered through DEXs, Tornado Cash, THORChain, and Wasabi Wallet. While BitoPro has not confirmed the incident, it underscores the persistent security challenges faced by crypto exchanges and the vital role of blockchain security and on-chain monitoring in tracking illicit activity. This event is a sharp reminder for both platforms and users about the necessity of prioritizing security in the volatile digital asset landscape.

XAUt0 is the omnichain deployment of Tether Gold, allowing users to own a physically backed, inflation-resistant asset while tapping into the full composability and financial innovation of digital assets. Today, there are many ways to get started with gold, from metal ETFs to tokenized price trackers. However, most of these options only provide indirect price exposure to gold prices, and don’t offer true ownership rights or the ability to freely use or move holdings. Launched in 2020, Tether Gold (XAUt) was one of the earliest and most groundbreaking projects to bring real-world assets on-chain at scale. By combining the reliability of physical gold bullion with the transparency and accessibility of blockchain technology, XAUt was an early innovation that offered the best of both worlds: a timeless hedge against inflation, delivered with the flexibility and freedom that modern finance demands. Now with XAUt0, XAUt can be leveraged across leading blockchains and easily plugged into lending, liquidity pools, FX arbitrage, and more. By combining the direct, physical gold ownership of Tether Gold with the frictionless, omnichain liquidity layer pioneered by USDT0, XAUt0 creates a globally accessible, infinitely programmable form of gold that retains the reliability and timelessness of the original asset. With the price of gold reaching all-time highs, the launch of XAUt0 enables the world’s most enduring store of value to become as seamless and accessible as the networks that increasingly define global capital flows. XAUt0 is the omnichain deployment of Tether Gold (XAUt), built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. XAUt0 allows users to seamlessly and securely move their XAUt between chains. Each XAUt token represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of gold on a specific gold bullion bar meeting the quality assurance requirements of “London Good Delivery” set by the London Bullion Market Association, securely stored in a Swiss vault. All XAUt and therefore XAUt0 holders have an ownership interest in a specific physical gold bar, rather than indirect exposure to gold prices. In collaboration with the TON Foundation and The Open Platform (the largest venture builder in TON & Telegram), the first deployment of XAUt0 will take place on The Open Network (TON), bringing tokenized gold to hundreds of millions of users within the Telegram ecosystem. “The initial rollout of XAUt0 on TON reflects our shared vision of making digital assets seamlessly accessible to people around the world, unlocking new economic opportunities for those who need them most,” said Andrew Rogozov, CEO and Founder of The Open Platform. “Starting today, Tether Gold will be instantly available to users of Wallet in Telegram, and in Q3, we will launch a major promotional campaign to engage users of TON Ecosystem.” While Bitcoin is metaphorically considered “digital gold” due to its trustless scarcity model, XAUt0 introduces real “digital gold” that is both physically backed and built for seamless omnichain use. Inheriting the core strengths of XAUt, XAUt0 offers powerful advantages over directly holding physical gold, including: 24/7 Access: While traditional gold markets close for weekends and holidays, XAUt0 holders can buy, sell, lend, or use their digital gold at any time, from anywhere. Secure Digital Storage: XAUt0 holders enjoy the economic security of gold with the self-custody of digital wallets, without the costs and hassle of physical custody. Infinite Divisibility: XAUt0 can be bought and sold in fractional increments, opening up new possibilities for everything from collateral provision to portfolio diversification. Physical Redemption Options: XAUt0 holders can exchange their XAUt0 for XAUt, which can be redeemed for physical gold, delivered to a Swiss address. “XAUt is already setting a new standard for tokenized gold—each token represents direct ownership of physical gold securely stored in Switzerland,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “At Tether, we're excited to witness the launch of XAUt0, which aims to revolutionize gold in the digital era.” “At USDT0, our mission has always been to unify liquidity and make digital assets truly borderless across blockchain ecosystems,” said Lorenzo R., Co-Founder of USDT0 and Everdawn Labs, a leading software development firm in the Tether ecosystem. “With the launch of XAUt0, we’re applying that same mission to gold, one of humanity’s oldest and most enduring stores of value. By unlocking seamless omnichain access to physically backed gold, XAUt0 brings a timeless asset into the decentralized ecosystem.” For more information, users can visit gold.usdt0.to or follow USDT0 on Twitter @USDT0_to .

45417742,https://bitzo.com/2025/06/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bears-target-100000-as-bulls-struggle-to-regain-foothold,1748872838,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/45417742.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bears Target $100,000 As Bulls Struggle To Regain Foothold",https://bitzo.com/2025/06/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-bears-target-100000-as-bulls-struggle-to-regain-foothold,"Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week in the red despite a weekend recovery that lifted the price from a low of $103,199 to beyond $105,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency lost the $105,000 level during the ongoing session and is trading around $104,130. BTC closed below its daily support level on Thursday, slipping below the 20-day SMA to $105,662. It extended its losses on Friday and is down over 5% in the past week. Silk Road Founder Did Not Donate Bitcoin To Himself Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht recently received a significant donation of 300 BTC , leading many to speculate he donated the coins to himself. However, on-chain investigator ZachXBT has revealed that while the donated Bitcoin came from questionable sources, it is unlikely to be a case where Ulbricht donated to himself. Ulbricht had been soliciting donations and received 300 Bitcoin worth $31.4 million, according to data from Lookonchain. The donated Bitcoin came from a wallet using a mixing service called Jambler, leading to speculation that the funds were from hidden profits from Silk Road. However, ZachXBT was skeptical that this was the case because “very few entities use Jambler.” He also claimed he found a potential demix for the donation. “It likely doesn’t appear to be a self-donation as people were claiming though it comes from questionable sources due to the flagged address.” The on-chain investigator also stated that one of the addresses involved had exchange activity going back to late 2014, while another was active in 2019. “Both were depositing in size to Jambler at similar times as the 300 BTC Ross donor received from Jambler. Both had dormant BTC from Nov 2019 until the mixer deposits made from April to May 2025. Everyone was accusing Ross of a self-donation, so if anything, this proves it was a donation and not his secret stash because there was activity when he was away in prison.” Buying Bitcoin Will Get Harder Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor believes it will get exponentially harder to purchase Bitcoin as more large companies and corporate entities pivot towards the asset. This week, Trump Media Group announced plans to allocate $2.4 billion to buy Bitcoin and build a treasury. Meanwhile, Tether, Softbank, and Strike’s Jack Maller launched Twenty One, with plans to add 42,000 BTC to its balance sheet. Metaplanet also announced its latest Bitcoin purchase, adding 1,088 BTC to its holdings. While shares of some of these companies have declined, Saylor maintained that holding Bitcoin on balance sheets has proved to be extremely popular. Saylor believes it will become exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, with the Strategy co-founder bullish on the flagship cryptocurrency’s prospects. “Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come, and no force on earth can stop it.” However, not everyone is on board. Microsoft has rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin to its reserves, with Meta shareholders also rejecting the idea this week. However, Saylor said Strategy will continue buying Bitcoin, stating, “We think it will get exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy Bitcoin.” Metaplanet Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Japanese investment company Metaplanet has become the world’s eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC) after announcing its latest purchase worth $117.9 million. The company’s latest purchase makes it the world’s ninth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin as it continues its aggressive buying strategy. Metaplanet announced the purchase of 1,088 Bitcoin for $117.9 million at an average price of $108,400, taking its total holdings to over 8,888 BTC . “Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC .” Corporate purchases of Bitcoin indicate growing institutional interest and confidence in the asset and the current bull market cycle. Metaplanet’s purchase comes amid rising uncertainty in Japan’s bond markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to regain momentum after suffering a substantial decline last week. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered over the weekend, but not before dropping to a low of $103,199. Analysts have stated that a decline was expected after the rally as long-term holders locked in their profits, with buyer exhaustion also weighing the price down. With sellers gaining the upper hand, BTC could dip to $100,000 or lower if current sentiment persists. However, analysts are unanimous in stating that the current pullback should not be viewed as a bearish signal, indicating it is an excellent buying opportunity. “This potential pullback should not be viewed solely as a sign of weakness. In many bull cycles, such corrections and shakeouts serve to flush out over-leveraged positions and reset sentiment, ultimately laying the groundwork for renewed upward momentum.” BTC’s consolidation phase can be a healthy development, providing the market with a sustainable foundation for the next leg of its rally as leveraged positions reset and spot demand consolidates. Bitfinex analysts stated, “Bitcoinʼs ability to continue to consolidate above its short-term holder cost basis around $95,000 remains key. The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3.” BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday, dropping nearly 4% and settling at $107,346. The price recovered over the weekend despite the selling pressure, rising 0.56% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase and settling at $109,453. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to slip below $109,000 and settle at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% and settled at $107,834. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as BTC fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, BTC recovered on Saturday, rising 0.69% to $104,784. The price continued to push higher on Sunday, increasing nearly 1% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. However, BTC is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 2%, slipping below $105,000 and trading around $104,100. If sellers retain control, BTC could slip to $100,000 or lower. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Smart buyers are now focusing on real-use ecosystems with forward momentum. Projects like Chainlink (LINK), VeChain (VET), and Hedera (HBAR) continue to build through technology upgrades and integration efforts, but a fresh contender is drawing attention: BlockDAG. Often included in discussions around top altcoins to buy, BlockDAG is making waves thanks to its hybrid architecture, smart contract readiness, and mounting exchange support. With a presale price still frozen at $0.0018 through June 13 and growing chatter about a possible $1 value target, many are jumping in to claim a strong early position before the next phase begins. This article takes a detailed look at LINK, VET, and HBAR while diving into how BlockDAG is quickly becoming one of the top altcoins to buy in 2025, thanks to practical use, developer tools, and wide-ranging momentum. BlockDAG: Leading the Charge Among 2025’s Top Altcoins to Buy BlockDAG is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm in 2025, and it’s more than justified. With a massive $281 million raised, over 21.8 billion BDAG coins already sold, and more than 170,000 holders onboard, this is not just another blockchain presale; it’s a full-blown ecosystem in motion. Right now, the presale price is still locked at $0.0018 until June 13. That’s far below the current Batch 28 rate of $0.0262 and even more so when compared to the confirmed listing price of $0.05. This setup provides early participants with a massive possible ROI, making BDAG one of the top altcoins to buy for those seeking early-stage potential with strong fundamentals. Why is the buzz so strong? BlockDAG supports Ethereum-based development through full EVM compatibility, allowing for easy dApp and smart contract deployment. Thanks to its combined DAG and Proof-of-Work design, it offers both speed and security, two core traits needed for large-scale adoption. A no-code dApp builder also opens the door for non-technical users, making the ecosystem more inclusive. Exchange activity is gaining momentum too, with listings confirmed on MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, XT.com, and LBank. BlockDAG has scheduled the GO LIVE reveal on June 13. BlockDAG isn’t just promising progress, it’s actively delivering on it. That’s why it now ranks as one of the top altcoins to buy as 2025 continues. Chainlink (LINK): Expanding Interoperability and Market Strength Chainlink (LINK) is holding strong at around $15.99 and has gained over 22% this month. Much of this strength comes from rising user confidence, shown by more than $66 million worth of LINK being pulled from exchanges, often a sign of long-term holding behavior. A key advancement fueling this growth is the rollout of Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) on Solana. This opens new layers of functionality across DeFi platforms and strengthens Chainlink’s position in cross-network operations. With short-term predictions reaching toward $20, LINK remains one of the top altcoins to buy based on its role in decentralized oracle services and its steady improvements in connectivity. VeChain (VET): Solid Tech Base with Room to Run VeChain (VET) is currently priced at around $0.0278, reflecting a small 1.31% dip. While its recent movement is relatively quiet, the launch of VeChain’s new cross-chain bridge could mark the start of a stronger growth cycle. Analysts project a possible price increase between 150% and 200% by the end of 2025, assuming its enterprise blockchain tools gain more adoption. Despite some near-term volatility, VeChain remains of interest to those who focus on utility over hype. Although it may not be among the fastest risers right now, VET continues to be mentioned among the top altcoins to buy for those with a long-term view. Hedera (HBAR): Consistent Development, Growing Trust Hedera (HBAR) is trading around $0.187 and has experienced a slight daily drop. However, forecasts remain optimistic, with estimates suggesting a price of $0.25 in May and a potential climb to $0.46 by the year’s end. HBAR stands out for its technical design and enterprise partnerships. Developers are increasingly attracted to its performance capabilities and ongoing testnet evolution. Although price action has remained slow, Hedera’s fundamentals continue to improve. For those evaluating top altcoins to buy with staying power and solid architecture, HBAR is worth a deeper look. 2025’s Must-Watch Altcoins: Why BlockDAG Stands Out As the market grows more selective, it’s clear that real progress and innovation matter more than ever. While Chainlink, VeChain, and Hedera each bring valuable technology to the table, BlockDAG is positioning itself a step ahead with its all-in-one approach. From full EVM support and user-friendly tools to a growing list of exchange listings and a locked-in price of $0.0018 through June 13, BDAG offers a compelling combination of access, utility, and potential growth. With a future listing price of $0.05 or more, early participants may be looking at one of the best ROI setups in today’s market. Whether you’re a developer building your next project, a crypto enthusiast exploring new ecosystems, or someone searching for the top altcoins to buy this month, BlockDAG is one of the most exciting names to keep on your radar as 2025 unfolds.

The product, a structured bond , tracks the value of Bitcoin and is designed for qualified investors seeking crypto-linked returns without directly owning or storing digital assets. Returns on the bond are influenced by two factors: Bitcoin’s performance against the U.S. dollar and any potential appreciation of the dollar versus the Russian ruble. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency investments, investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without setting up a crypto wallet or using offshore exchanges. All transactions are settled in rubles and handled entirely within Russia’s domestic financial infrastructure. Sberbank plans to expand crypto offering Sberbank also confirmed plans to expand this offering. According to the bank, similar crypto-linked structured instruments will be made available on the Moscow Exchange in the near future. In addition, its investment division, SberInvestments, will roll out a new Bitcoin futures product on June 4, aligning with a broader launch by the Moscow Exchange. The move comes just days after the Bank of Russia greenlit the offering of cryptocurrency-based financial instruments to professional investors, signaling a notable policy shift amid growing demand for regulated exposure to digital assets.

The acquisition also proves that there is still rising institutional confidence despite Bitcoin's recent volatility. Meanwhile, Strategy, led by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, acquired an additional 705 BTC for $75.1 million during the price dip, pushing its total holdings to a staggering 580,955 BTC. This stockpile is valued at over $40 billion. Strategy’s continued accumulation strategy is drawing a lot of attention, especially after a director’s share sale. Despite turbulent markets, crypto investment products saw $286 million in inflows last week, which was the seventh consecutive week of capital inflows. While Bitcoin ETPs experienced slight outflows, Ethereum investment products surged and netted $321 million in their strongest week since late 2024. Metaplanet Buys More BTC Japanese investment firm Metaplanet became the world’s eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin after another major purchase. In a June 2 post on X , the company announced the acquisition of 1,088 BTC at an average price of $108,400 per coin, totaling $117.9 million. This latest investment brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 8,888 BTC, placing it ahead of Galaxy Digital’s 8,100 BTC and Block Inc.’s 8,485 BTC, according to Bitbo data . The move is impressive not only for its size but also for the price point, which was over $100,000 per BTC. This could mean that the company has deepening institutional confidence in the ongoing bull market. Largest Bitcoin holders (Source: Bitbo ) The purchase also happened against a backdrop of rising economic uncertainty, particularly in Japan’s bond markets, where yield spikes are raising concerns over fiscal stability and sovereign debt risk. According to Bitwise’s head of European research, André Dragosch, current default probabilities across G20 bonds support a Bitcoin valuation above $200,000. Bitcoin itself recently reached an all-time high above $112,000 on May 22 before pulling back to around $105,464. Analysts at Bitfinex consider this consolidation healthy as it provides a foundation for a potential next leg up, especially if Bitcoin continues to hold above its short-term holder cost basis of around $95,000. They believe the coming weeks will be pivotal in determining whether the recent highs were a local peak or the beginning of a broader Q3 rally. However, some analysts are warning people over the speculative enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin-linked equities. Metaplanet’s own stock surged to the point where it’s trading at a $596,000 Bitcoin premium . This means that investors are effectively paying more than five times the spot price of BTC via exposure to Metaplanet shares. (Source: 10xResearch ) Strategy Also Adds More BTC to Its Treasury Strategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, also recently confirmed another major BTC acquisition as part of its aggressive buying strategy. The company is led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, and revealed that it purchased 705 Bitcoin between May 26 and May 30 for a total of $75.1 million. The acquisition was completed at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This means that Strategy took advantage of the temporary Bitcoin price dip , which fell from $110,000 early last week to an intraweek low of around $103,400 by the weekend. This latest purchase was Strategy’s final addition to its Bitcoin treasury for the month of May, and brings its total holdings to an unprecedented 580,955 BTC. The total value of these holdings, which were acquired at a blended average cost of $70,023 per coin, now amounts to approximately $40.68 billion. This very firmly cements Strategy’s position as the largest Bitcoin-holding public company by a huge margin. The announcement coincides with a series of share sales by Strategy director Jarrod Patten, which raised some questions about insider sentiment. According to a May 30 securities filing, Patten sold 3,750 shares of Strategy’s Class A stock over the course of a week between May 22 and May 29. These transactions occurred just as the company was finalizing its latest Bitcoin purchases. The sales applied additional pressure to Strategy’s stock price, which briefly dipped below $360 on May 28 and May 30. However, the stock rebounded slightly to close the week at $369, though it remained 1.6% down in pre-market trading. Strategy stock price YTD (Source: Google ) Despite recent volatility, Strategy’s stock is still up on the year after gaining 23% year-to-date and boasting an impressive 123% gain over the past twelve months. Overall, the company’s steadfast accumulation strategy is being closely watched by both institutional investors and crypto market participants, especially as Strategy’s purchases now occur at price levels well above the average cost basis. Investors Keep Buying Crypto Meanwhile, crypto investment products continued to attract capital last week despite heavy market volatility and a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price. According to a June 2 report by CoinShares, digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $286 million in inflows for the week ending May 30. This was the seventh consecutive week of inflows, and pushed the total over that period to $10.9 billion. (Source: CoinShares ) However, the broader market decline led to a drop in total assets under management (AUM) from a record $187 billion to $177 billion. CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, attributed the drop in AUM to growing market concerns over geopolitical factors, including US tariff uncertainty. Bitcoin tumbled from $110,000, which also contributed to a modest outflow of $8 million from BTC investment products. Despite the outflows, long-term sentiment toward Bitcoin is still cautiously optimistic, though analysts pointed out that June tends to be a historically mixed month for the crypto market, which could add to short-term instability. (Source: CoinShares ) Meanwhile, Ethereum-based investment products led the pack with $321 million in inflows. Which was its strongest flow since December of 2024. This renewed demand happened after ETH’s long underperformance earlier in the year, which even led some trading firms to compare its behavior to that of meme coins. With ETH currently trading around $2,486, it gained 36% over the past 30 days. Other crypto products showed diverging trends. XRP investment vehicles posted outflows for the second consecutive week by shedding $28 million. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs continued to lead all issuers with $790 million in inflows despite witnessing a sharp end-of-week drop in its Bitcoin ETF products. Year-to-date, iShares’ inflows reached $12.4 billion, although their AUM slipped from $74.8 billion to $72.9 billion. Conversely, ARK Invest and 21Shares saw the largest issuer-level outflows last week, with combined losses of $282 million and total yearly outflows now standing at $22 million. The flow reversal across Bitcoin products is being linked to profit-taking activity, seasonal weakness, and broader macroeconomic concerns.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-02 14:04:21

Unlike MicroStrategy, GME is buying Bitcoin near all-time highs, making rapid gains less likely and increasing risk compared to MSTR's earlier entry. The core business continues to shrink rapidly, with declining sales and store closures, and profits are mostly from interest on cash reserves. Given the lack of clarity on GME's Bitcoin strategy and the risks involved, I rate the stock a 'hold' and will monitor for further developments. Gamestop ( GME ) has pivoted into a crypto investment company. This was always the most likely course of action as it explored options for its $4B cash pile. But has it unlocked value for shareholders? This article looks at how Strategy ( MSTR ) leads the way, but will be hard to replicate. The Pivot The company outlined plans to invest in Bitcoin in March. On March 25, 2025 we announced that, as part of our revisions to the Investment Policy, the Board approved the addition of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, whereby a portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances may be invested in Bitcoin. We have not set a maximum amount of Bitcoin we may accumulate, and may sell any Bitcoin we may acquire. On May 28th, confirmed they purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. Assuming a cost of $90-100K, GME spent $420-471M on the position. That's about one-tenth of the cash pile, last reported to be $4.7B. GME That's all the information the company have released on the matter so far. CEO Ryan Cohen recently said the purchase of Bitcoin was a ""currency hedge."" It sounds like he may be distracting from the company's pivot, but perhaps he is right. GME has held over $4B in cash (and I assume USTs) for nearly a year now. Diversifying into other currencies with the potential to grow the holding is a reasonable approach, if a risky one. Cohen also said he would not call out GME's crypto strategy in advance, and would follow its own path instead of copying an existing player such as Strategy ( MSTR ). This could mean all sorts of things - perhaps GME won't copy MSTR's approach to raising capital to acquire Bitcoin. However, I assume they will at least have a similar approach to buy and record Bitcoin on the balance sheet. It will be interesting to see if the buying is steady or if there is any kind of strategy. Will they invest the whole $4.7B? There are still a lot of questions, and Strategy's Bitcoin Initiative - Project Roadmap is a useful source of information on some of the steps that could be taken. Indeed, the guide seems tailor-made for GME. MicroStrategy is sharing its learnings and methodologies so that other organizations can successfully navigate the adoption of bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. A lot of the information relates to managing risk and governance. GME will need to establish storage solutions and have a custodian for acquired Bitcoins. Here's a sample of what may be going on behind the scenes if GME follows a similar route to MSTR. Strategy Being able to follow in the footsteps of MSTR is an advantage, although you could say MSTR's assistance is not completely altruistic - GME and any other company to now pivot into Bitcoin investments will indirectly help MSTR as it will increase demand and potentially push up Bitcoin prices. Before pivoting into Bitcoin investments, MSTR was a software company focused on data mining and enterprise analytics. The stock never managed to recover from the huge boom and bust pattern in the 2000 era. Tradingview Revenues were shrinking in the 5 years before the 2020 Bitcoin initiative. Data by YCharts You could say there are similarities between GME and MSTR around the time they pivoted into Bitcoin investments. The key difference is that GME is starting its purchases when Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs around $100K. When MSTR first launched its Bitcoin initiative in 2020, prices were near $10K following a crash. I won't make a call on future Bitcoin prices, but it is well-known that the best price gains are made when assets recover from a crash, not when they are already trading near all-time highs. It is therefore unlikely that GME will make a rapid rise like MSTR did in 2020. I don't want to make too many comparisons between MSTR and GME as they may end up with completely different strategies. After all, GME has only invested one-tenth of its cash in Bitcoin and may do something completely different with the rest. However, there is something else we can learn from MSTR in relation to valuation: MSTR has always traded at a large premium to NAV. Strategy Tracker The premium has narrowed to around 1.7x, but was as high as 3x in November last year when there was a large Bitcoin rally and bullish sentiment in the crypto space. GME has a lofty valuation of $13B given its shrinking underlying business, but it may not seem quite as lofty if it were to hold $4B in Bitcoin and Bitcoin was in a bullish phase. Data by YCharts Do I think GME should be valued at $13B if it has a $4.7B holding in Bitcoin? No, but if the Bitcoin price doubled and management displayed an effective strategy, then it might not be too far off. The Rest of the Business Ryan Cohen joined the board of directors in 2021 and became CEO in 2023. He recently said GameStop was a ""piece of crap"" and losing a lot of money when he took over. I wouldn't argue with that assessment, but I get the impression that Cohen still thinks it is a piece of crap and is not that interested in the core business. The FY results confirmed another significant decrease in sales. During fiscal 2024, total net sales decreased 27.5% compared to the prior year, with net sales in our Europe, Canada, United States, and Australia segments decreasing by 38.0%, 30.2%, 24.9%, and 22.5%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The decrease in consolidated net sales in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a $516.6 million or 33.9% decline in the sales of software, a $897.1 million or 29.9% decline in the sale of hardware and accessories, and a $36.1 million or 4.8% decline in the sales of collectibles. Locations are shrinking, and they closed around half of European stores last year. GME One of the financial highlights was: Completed divestiture of Italy and the wind-down of store operations in Germany. We can see the way this is likely going and GME may operate only in the U.S. in the coming years. The company is making small profits, but this is mostly due to the interest income from its large cash holding (likely invested in UST Bills). Interest income, net increased $113.9 million to $163.4 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $49.5 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the issuance and sale of shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Transactions, as well as higher interest rates in the current year compared to the prior year. Take away income expenses, and there is a small $30M loss for the year. GME This probably suits management. If the legacy business is small, easily managed, and more or less breaking even, the pivot into other investment areas could be smoother. Conclusions GME has invested around one-tenth of its cash pile in Bitcoin, and it seems to be pivoting into a Bitcoin holdings company. Meanwhile, the legacy business continues to shrink at a rapid pace. CEO Ryan Cohen has not outlined the company's Bitcoin strategy yet, but we can assume it will be similar to MSTR - accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible and hope it goes up in price. This has potential, but MSTR's successful pivot in 2020 was helped massively by the preceding Bitcoin crash of 80%. Huge gains were made on the recovery to new highs. GME is not in the same situation, and with Bitcoin trading near all-time highs, the gains could be limited. GME is at an interesting stage of development and is worth monitoring, but until we know more about the Bitcoin strategy, I will not be rushing to buy and rate it a ""hold.""",MSTR|GME,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-02 14:09:13

This incident, highlighted by blockchain security firm Cyver Alerts, underscores the persistent challenges in maintaining ironclad blockchain security in an interconnected digital asset ecosystem. What Happened During the Nervos Network Crypto Hack? According to an alert shared by Cyver Alerts on the social media platform X, suspicious activity was detected involving the Nervos Network ‘s bridge. The firm indicated that an unknown attacker managed to gain control of this critical piece of infrastructure, which facilitates the movement of assets between different blockchain environments. The result was a substantial loss: approximately $3 million worth of crypto assets were stolen. The specific tokens targeted in this sophisticated attack included a variety of stablecoins and major cryptocurrencies: 257,800 USDT 539.09 ETH 898,300 USDC 60,400 DAI 0.79 WBTC This diverse haul demonstrates the attacker’s aim to acquire high-value, liquid assets. Understanding the Crypto Bridge Exploit So, what exactly is a crypto bridge exploit , and why are bridges often targeted? Blockchain bridges are essential tools in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. They allow users to transfer tokens and data between different blockchains, solving the crucial problem of interoperability. For instance, a bridge might let you use Bitcoin (BTC) on the Ethereum network or move assets from a Layer-1 chain like Ethereum to a Layer-2 solution like Nervos Network. However, bridges are complex pieces of software and infrastructure. They often involve locking assets on one chain and minting wrapped representations on another, or relying on validator networks to confirm transactions across chains. This complexity creates potential vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit flaws in smart contracts, compromise validator keys, or manipulate the underlying logic of the bridge to steal the locked assets. Bridge exploits have unfortunately become a recurring theme in blockchain security incidents, accounting for hundreds of millions, sometimes billions, of dollars in losses across various networks. The Nervos Network incident adds to this concerning trend. The Attacker’s Next Move: Leveraging Tornado Cash Following the successful theft, the attacker reportedly converted all the stolen assets – including the stablecoins and WBTC – into Ethereum (ETH). This consolidated sum of ETH was then transferred to Tornado Cash (TORN), a well-known crypto mixing protocol. Tornado Cash is designed to obfuscate the origin and destination of cryptocurrency transactions by pooling funds from many users and then allowing them to withdraw from the pool. While proponents argue it’s a tool for privacy, it has frequently been used by malicious actors, including those behind major hacks, to launder stolen funds and make them difficult to trace. The use of Tornado Cash in the Nervos Network crypto hack suggests the attacker is attempting to cover their tracks and evade identification and recovery efforts. How Did the Nervos Network Team Respond? In the wake of discovering the suspicious activity and confirming the crypto bridge exploit , the Nervos Network team took immediate action. Their primary response was to pause all smart contracts associated with the compromised bridge or potentially affected parts of the network. This is a standard emergency procedure designed to prevent further losses or ongoing malicious activity. Simultaneously, the team initiated a full investigation into the incident. This involves working with blockchain security experts like Cyver Alerts, analyzing transaction logs, identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, and potentially coordinating with law enforcement or exchanges, although recovering funds sent to mixers like Tornado Cash is notoriously difficult. What Does This Incident Mean for Blockchain Security? The Nervos Network crypto hack serves as another stark reminder of the inherent risks in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. Despite continuous advancements, vulnerabilities persist, particularly in complex cross-chain infrastructure like bridges. Key takeaways for blockchain security from this event include: Bridge Risks: Bridges remain high-value targets due to the significant liquidity they manage and their technical complexity. Layer-2 Security: While Layer-2 solutions aim to improve scalability, their security is often intertwined with Layer-1 and the mechanisms used for bridging assets between layers. The Challenge of Mixers: Protocols like Tornado Cash continue to pose significant challenges for tracing and recovering stolen funds, complicating the work of investigators and victims. Importance of Monitoring: The detection by a security firm highlights the critical role of constant, sophisticated monitoring of network activity. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Users and Projects For users interacting with the Nervos Network or any other blockchain project, incidents like this reinforce the need for caution. While Nervos is investigating, users should stay informed via official channels. More broadly, when using bridges or interacting with DeFi protocols, it’s crucial to understand the associated risks. Diversifying assets and not keeping excessive funds on single platforms or bridges is a prudent strategy. For blockchain projects, especially those operating bridges or Layer-2 solutions, the Nervos Network crypto hack emphasizes the absolute necessity of: Rigorous Audits: Regular, independent security audits of smart contracts and infrastructure are paramount. Bug Bounties: Incentivizing white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Real-time Monitoring: Implementing systems to detect unusual activity quickly. Incident Response Plans: Having clear procedures in place for pausing operations, investigating, and communicating with the community during an exploit. The challenge of recovering funds once they enter mixers like Tornado Cash is immense, making preventative blockchain security measures the most critical line of defense. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Blockchain Security The reported Nervos Network crypto hack , resulting in a $3 million loss via a crypto bridge exploit and the subsequent use of Tornado Cash , is a significant event for the community. It serves as a powerful reminder that the digital frontier of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, while innovative, is also a battleground for blockchain security . As the Nervos team continues its investigation, the broader industry must learn from these incidents, constantly enhancing security protocols and fostering a culture of vigilance to protect users and the integrity of decentralized networks.

Whale moves and Ripple lawsuit turns fuel this tug-of-war. If you’re watching XRP markets this week, you’re witnessing a rare split in trader psychology: while futures traders are doubling down on bearish bets, options traders remain stubbornly optimistic. This divergence has left analysts and investors scrambling to make sense of conflicting signals, as whale wallets and legal milestones add even more intrigue to the story. Futures: The Bears Take Control The futures market has turned decisively negative. CryptoQuant statistics show that XRP's taker buy/sell level has been below 1 for the past two weeks, at 0.92 — a very strong sign that sellers rule. The long/short level, now 0.82, also confirms most traders expect further downside. XRP has shed nearly 10% in the past week and is trading perilously near the critical $2 support, with analysts warning that a fall below here can trigger a cascading liquidity effect. The mood darkened further with open interest in XRP futures declining to $3.2 billion, nearly 10% less than the recent peaks of the past month. Historically, falling open interest reflects waning interest and can be a precursor to sharp price falls if selling pressure rises. “XRP’s futures market is flashing red—shorts are in control and support is looking shaky,” tweeted @CryptoQuant. Options: Bulls Refuse to Back Down At the same time, options traders are not backing down. Open interest on Deribit is rising, with most bets made on high-strike calls between $2.60 and $3.00+—a sign of persistence bullishness. The most traded is the call at $4, with over $5 million notional OI open interest, and the calls at $3 and $3.10 each have over $5 million OI. Nearly all of this trading is on Deribit, which has over 95% of XRP options volume. Why the optimism? For some, it's the larger view: holding out for a U.S. XRP ETF, Ripple's growing role in cross-border payments, and hopes that the years-long SEC lawsuit is finally on the cusp of a resolution. Others are looking at the recent pullback as a buying opportunity, betting on a legal victory or ETF approval to rocket XRP into the stratosphere. “Options traders are betting on an XRP rebound — calls at $3 and $4 are hot. Are the bears missing something?” shared @DeribitInsights. Whale Wallets and Liquidity Maps Under the hood, whale wallets are making waves. Whale Alert followed 40 million XRP ($87 million) moving between big wallets on June 1, as institutions gear up for possible breakdown or breakout. Liquidity maps show frenetic action around the $2.00 and $2.30 levels — key zones that will drive huge movements if they break. “Massive XRP transfers as whales reposition — are they prepping for a reversal or more pain?” asked @WhaleAlert. Legal Drama: Ripple's Lawsuit Hangs in the Balance No analysis of XRP would be complete without the Ripple-SEC saga. The new twist: Judge Torres spurned a proposed settlement, prolonging uncertainty and keeping pressure on the price. But from legal experts, the fundamentals haven't shifted—XRP isn't a security, and a final resolution may arrive as soon as this summer. Until then, the legal overhang continues to split trader sentiment. Technicals and Outlook Technically, XRP is at a crossroads. The 200-day moving average at $2.31 is key support; a breakdown there might send XRP down to $1.96 or worse. But if the buyers step in and ETF or legal news is positive, bullish bets by options traders could be warranted with a sharp bounce back to $3 or higher.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-02 15:21:15

On Friday, Justice Minister Pavel Blažek resigned, with the opposition set to demand the resignation of the coalition government this week as well. The situation caught on fire at the end of last week after Blažek, a conservative politician, accepted a large donation in BTC and sold it for about $45.8 million in March, the AP reported . The opposition has raised concerns over the source of the donation . Blažek received the coins from Tomas Jirikovsky, a convicted criminal. Jirikovsky operated the Sheep Marketplace . In 2017, he went to prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal trading of weapons. Jirikovsky’s lawyer reportedly approached Blažek in March 2025, saying his client would donate 30% of his BTC stash to the ministry. Police had confiscated the wallet containing this BTC and returned it to Jirikovsky after his release in 2021. Poslední veřejná dražba se uskutečnila včera 27. května, celkem bylo úspěšně realizováno 78 elektronických aukcí a do majetku státu směřuje 956,8 mil. Kč.

Jirikovsky probably wanted “to repent” through the donation, he said. He also claimed that courts had not proven that the BTC came from criminal activity. However, the opposition parties argue that it’s unclear why Jirikovsky gave the coins to the ministry or where the coins came from. They accused Blažek of potential money laundering. Furthermore, they argue that the state shouldn’t use the money until these points are clear. Meanwhile, the High Prosecutor’s Office in Olomouc is investigating the case on suspicion of abuse of official authority and laundering of proceeds of crime. Blažek denied knowledge of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, he said he resigned so not to harm the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. The PM said he believed that Blažek acted with goodwill.

The transaction, flagged by blockchain analysts and tracked by platforms such as Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence, has sparked a wave of speculation across the crypto community.The funds appear to have passed through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service, rather than more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai.... Czech Coalition Government in Danger? Today, Brno Daily reported that the lower house will hold an urgent session on Thursday. The opposition parties will use the occasion to demand the resignation of the coalition government, the deputy leaders of the ANO and SPD parties, Karel Havlicek and Radim Fiala, said on Sunday. “We will want the government to find sufficient self-reflection and resign,” Havlicek said. The current cabinet could stay until the parliamentary elections in October, but it shouldn’t have the power to make major decisions. If the coalition government doesn’t resign, “We are very strongly considering calling a no-confidence vote in the government.” Fiala, deputy leader of the far-right SPD, said that his party “will support an extraordinary session” and a vote of no confidence in the government. However, lower house speaker Jan Skopecek said the opposition’s plans are just “theatre” in the campaign ahead of the elections. He added that Blažek has already resigned, so there is no reason for the cabinet to do so as well. Moreover, Czech Fiscal Council chair Mojmir Hampl argued that this case raises numerous key technical questions. However, these will not be answered in the pre-election stage. Meanwhile, Le Monde reported that Jirikovsky had been trying to recover about 1,500 BTC, seized by the police, since his imprisonment. During the trial, the court suspected that the coins came from Nucleus . This is a dark web marketplace that, the report claims, shut down the day after Jirikovsky’s arrest. Source: Arkham Furthermore, BTC market monitors noted that a portion of the Nucleus-linked BTC , dormant since 2016, moved to new wallets in March. This is after Blažek signed the agreement, reports claim. Jirikovsky claimed that he got to keep the BTC because he had obtained it legally. Blažek claimed he hadn’t made any promises in return for the donation. All these allegations will likely be brought up during the Thursday emergency session.

Sellers took control during the 13:00 hour, where volume surged past 1.1 million, breaking through the $153.10–$153.30 support region and accelerating the bearish momentum. Despite a modest recovery attempt, SOL remains on the back foot, trading just above $153. With lower highs forming across recent sessions and key support zones under threat, analysts warn that further downside is possible unless bulls reclaim the $153.30 level. The psychological $150 mark now looms as the next major line of defense. Technical Analysis Highlights Strong resistance at $158–$159 triggered a 4.48% decline from peak to trough. High-volume breakdown below $153.10–$153.30 support zone signals bearish shift. SOL fell from $154.53 to $151.89 in the final hour, a 1.7% intraday drop. Notable selling at 13:40 (36K) and 13:48 (59K) accelerated downward momentum. Price has since rebounded to $153.81, with tentative support near $152.50. Lower highs and elevated selling volume suggest continued short-term pressure. A close above $153.30 is needed to signal potential trend stabilization.

It’s no longer just a conversation topic for tech enthusiasts. Today, trading digital assets is something individual investors, institutions, and even governments are watching closely. Image But with the rapid rise of the crypto market comes a whole lot of noise. New platforms, new coins, constant volatility, and endless headlines. It can feel overwhelming, especially if you're just getting started. That’s why understanding the landscape and knowing what to look for in a trading platform is more important than ever. The Rise of Cryptocurrency Trading The early days of crypto were mostly about buying and holding. Bitcoin was the big name, and the idea of trading it like a traditional asset wasn’t mainstream. That changed fast. As more people realized the potential of digital currencies, a full-blown market emerged. Trading volumes exploded. New tokens hit the scene. And platforms began offering tools that looked a lot like those used in forex or stock trading. This shift marked the beginning of cryptocurrency trading as a serious, fast-paced, and highly speculative activity. Now, traders can go long or short, use leverage, access real-time charts, and manage portfolios all within the crypto ecosystem. More importantly, it's not just about Bitcoin anymore. Ethereum, Solana, and dozens of other coins are actively traded every day. Each one moves differently, driven by unique tech developments, partnerships, and global news. For traders, this variety means opportunity, but also the need for constant learning and awareness. What Makes Cryptocurrency Trading Unique? Trading crypto isn't quite like trading stocks or commodities. Yes, it still involves buying and selling, watching charts, and managing risk. But a few things make it stand apart: ● 24/7 market – Unlike traditional markets, crypto never sleeps. Prices move day and night, even on weekends and holidays.● High volatility – Price swings are common, sometimes sharp, and often driven by headlines, social media, or market sentiment.● Lack of central control – No central bank or government controls most cryptocurrencies. That decentralization is part of the appeal, but also adds uncertainty.● Security and storage – You’re not just thinking about price: you also need to consider how your assets are stored and protected. These factors create both risk and opportunity. For some traders, the fast pace and non-stop movement are what make crypto exciting. For others, the lack of predictability is a reason to stay cautious. Key Features to Look for in a Trading Platform With hundreds of platforms out there, picking the right one can be a challenge. But a good platform does more than let you buy and sell. It supports your strategy, keeps you informed, and helps protect your funds. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a crypto trading platform: ● User experience – Is the interface clean and easy to navigate? Can you find what you need without digging through menus?● Security measures – Look for strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options.● Asset variety – A broader selection of coins can help you diversify and take advantage of more market opportunities.● Trading tools – Real-time charts, technical indicators, and order types like stop-loss or take-profit are essential for active traders.● Educational resources – Some platforms offer tutorials, market updates, and analysis, which are helpful for both beginners and experienced users.● Fees and spreads – Transparent pricing matters. Check what it costs to enter and exit trades, especially if you’re trading frequently. Not every platform will offer everything. It depends on your goals. Beginners might value simplicity and learning materials, while advanced traders may want deeper analysis tools and faster execution. Comparing Popular Platform Options Choosing the right platform can shape your entire trading experience. With so many available, it helps to understand how different types cater to specific needs and skill levels. Platforms for Beginners Beginner-focused platforms are typically built with simplicity at their core. They often feature uncluttered interfaces, clear buy and sell options, and minimal distractions. This allows new traders to focus on the basics without being overwhelmed by advanced tools they may not need just yet. In many cases, these platforms also include helpful resources like tutorials, quick guides, or FAQs to explain common terms and functions. Some even offer demo accounts where you can practice trading without using real money. For someone taking their first steps into cryptocurrency trading, this type of environment can make the learning curve far less intimidating. Platforms for Experienced Traders More advanced users usually want something that gives them greater control and insight. Platforms designed for experienced traders tend to offer more in-depth features, including real-time market data, customizable charting tools, and advanced order types like stop-limit or trailing stop orders. Speed and precision also matter here. These platforms typically focus on delivering fast execution and access to deeper liquidity, which can make a difference when working within narrow margins or reacting quickly to market changes. While the interface might be more complex, that complexity comes with added flexibility, which seasoned traders often value. All-in-One Multi-Market Platforms Some traders don’t just want access to crypto. They’re also looking to manage trades in forex, indices, or commodities from a single place. This is where multi-market platforms stand out. These platforms allow users to diversify their trading strategies without switching between services. Being able to monitor different asset classes side by side can help traders make more informed decisions, especially during periods of high market correlation or volatility. One platform that takes this approach is ThinkMarkets . It offers both cryptocurrency and traditional market access in one integrated environment. For traders who like the idea of managing everything in one account, from crypto positions to index trades, this type of setup brings added convenience and versatility. Staying Ahead with Market Trends Several factors can cause sudden price changes. Regulatory announcements are one of the biggest. If a government tightens or loosens its stance on crypto, the market reacts immediately. A single statement from a financial authority can cause major shifts, especially for larger coins. Blockchain upgrades are another key influence. For example, when a popular network like Ethereum undergoes a major update, traders and investors closely watch to see how it affects fees, transaction speed, and scalability. If the changes are positive, the price may rise. If they’re poorly received, it might do the opposite. Adoption news also plays a major role. When digital currencies are integrated into major payment platforms or used by well-known companies, confidence in the asset tends to grow. This usually pushes demand higher, especially among long-term holders. Even activity from large crypto holders, sometimes referred to as “whales,” can influence the market. When these big players move large amounts of coins in or out of wallets, traders take notice. It often signals that a big move is coming, and many people act accordingly. Stay Informed, Trade with Intention Successful traders pay attention to this type of information and learn to read between the lines. They understand that price action isn’t random. It’s the result of news, sentiment, and larger economic patterns. Having access to timely updates and solid market analysis can give traders the edge they need to respond quickly and make better decisions. The key to success isn’t finding shortcuts or guessing which coin will skyrocket next. It’s about staying informed, using the right tools, and approaching each trade with a clear purpose.

Since its beginning on April 1, the pre-launch phase has seen several price jumps, taking the HINU token’s value from an initial $0.00015000 to its current value. The project has raised $788,111 so far, is closing in on the $800,000 milestone, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million. Husky INU (HINU) Registers Jump The Husky Inu (HINU) token registered the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase, rising to $0.00017682. The next price jump will take the token’s price to $0.00017733. The price increase is part of Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase and allows the project to continue its fundraising effort as its official launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase and HINU’s regular price increases allow the project to raise additional capital and fund ongoing development, research, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and ecosystem expansion. How Does The Pre-Launch Phase Work? Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase rewards early supporters and adopters while maintaining transparent growth. The pre-launch phase will see the HINU token price increase every two days until it meets its fundraising goal or all the HINU tokens sell out. The starting price of the HINU token at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000. The pre-launch phase follows a compounded growth model, and the longer the pre-launch phase lasts, the higher the price of the HINU token rises. The pre-launch phase picks up where the Husky Inu presale left off, continuing the project’s fundraising as it attempts to reach its stated goal of $1.2M. The table below explains how the pre-launch phase price increase works. Day Token Price 0 $0.00015000 2 $0.00015043 4 $0.00015087 6 $0.00015130 8 $0.00015174 10 $0.00015217 …. Compounded ….

The project recently crossed the $750,000 milestone, has raised $788,111, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2M as interest in the project soars. Husky Inu has attracted significant attention from investors and the broader meme coin community as they look for alternate avenues to enter the crypto market.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down nearly 1% as it struggles to regain momentum. However, Ethereum (ETH) reclaimed $2,500, up 0.69%, trading at $2,525. Ripple (XRP) is marginally up while Solana (SOL) is down nearly 1, trading just above $150.

BTCS Inc., a Nasdaq-listed blockchain company betting big on Ethereum ( ETH ), added another 1,000 ETH to its holdings through the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com . The purchase brings the company’s total ETH balance to 13,500. Having held 9,063 ETH at the end of the first quarter, the purchase means its growth in Q2 now stands at approximately 50%, BTCS Inc. said in an announcement on June 2, 2025. This expansion goes beyond a simple bet on the top altcoin by market cap—it reflects BTCS Inc.’s long-term strategy to deliver shareholder value through digital asset exposure and blockchain infrastructure development. Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, noted that by focusing on revenue-generating infrastructure via NodeOps and increased builder activity, the company is deploying a growth-oriented model. “This complementary approach not only delivers the benefits of a digital asset treasury strategy but also unlocks long-term growth potential that goes far beyond mere price appreciation. We believe this dynamic model is uniquely positioned to maximize shareholder value over time,” Allen added.

The plan, which looks to mirror Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy, comes as many institutions adopt digital asset treasury strategies, including for assets such as Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ). Notably, Strategy’s buying spree of BTC has continued with the latest acquisition of 705 bitcoins for about $75.1 million. As announced on June 2, 2025, this brings the company’s total haul to 580,955 BTC, cumulatively scooped for about $40.68 billion. Companies such as SOL Strategies are intent on taking this approach with Solana, while recently, Saudi-backed firm VivoPower revealed plans to buy $121 million of XRP .

The surprise election of nationalist candidate Karol Nawrocki as president has alarmed Brussels, according to a recent report by the Financial Times. It has raised concerns that the pro-EU government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk could be undercut, reforms needed to unlock EU cash may stall, and Poland might help block a major trade agreement with the South American Mercosur bloc. Nawrocki, a former football hooligan with no government experience, ran on a “Poland First” platform. He openly criticized EU policies on topics such as climate change, support for Ukraine, and social issues. “Let’s help others, but let’s take care of our own citizens first,” Nawrocki declared during the campaign. Orsolya Raczova, an analyst focusing on Central and Eastern Europe at Eurasia Group, said that Tusk’s efforts to overhaul Poland’s judiciary “will be paralyzed… Nawrocki will prevent him from implementing an overhaul of the judiciary in line with EU demands.” Raczova added that the new president is likely to join other nationalist leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, in pushing back against Brussels. When Tusk took office as prime minister in October 2023, his return to power was hailed in Brussels as a chance to restore Poland’s more pro-EU stance. EU funding at risk as judiciary reform blocked by veto In 2024, after Tusk’s government pledged to amend the judiciary system so it met EU requirements, the European Commission released €137 billion in funds that had been set aside for Poland. Of that sum, Brussels has already paid out over €20 billion from Poland’s €60 billion share of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery fund. It has also sent nearly €7 billion of the €76.5 billion in regular regional funds. Outgoing President Andrzej Duda vetoed the reforms, and Nawrocki has promised to continue blocking them once he takes office in August. Although the Polish president has limited executive power, the office can block legislation passed by parliament and can nominate key state officials, including the central bank governor. If Tusk wants to override a veto from Nawrocki, he would need a three-fifths majority in parliament, a level he cannot reach without votes from the PiS party. Daniel Freund, a Green member of the European Parliament, argued that the Commission released funds to Poland “prematurely.” A European Commission spokesperson responded by saying, “We cannot speculate about future decisions of the Polish president-elect.” The spokesperson added, “We are confident that the reforms that have been started by the Polish government will be pursued and will be continued,” and that Brussels would “seek good cooperation” with Nawrocki once he assumes office. One example is the Mercosur trade deal, which Tusk supports. Polish farmers fear that cheaper food imports from South America could undercut them and lower safety standards in the EU. The Polish Farmers’ Party represents farmers and is in Tusk’s coalition. France has already said it won’t approve the Mercosur deal, and Ireland, Austria, and the Netherlands remain skeptical. If Poland blocks it too, there won’t be enough votes to approve the deal. Nawrocki aligns with other anti-EU leaders Nawrocki will stand alongside Orbán in Hungary and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico as a leading anti-EU voice in the region. His victory also comes ahead of the Czech Republic’s parliamentary election in October, where populist leader Andrej Babiš is leading in opinion polls. Officials worry that anti-Brussels sentiment is growing among voters in the European Union’s eastern member states. Though Nawrocki criticized EU financial and military aid to Ukraine during his campaign, analysts believe his stance will not change Poland’s broadly pro-Kyiv policy. Widespread opposition to Russia’s war across Poland makes it unlikely that the new president would alter that course. Still, other domestic issues tied to pro-EU policies will likely suffer. Meanwhile, across Europe’s Eurosceptic political circles, Nawrocki’s win was celebrated. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, called the result “great news from Poland.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Five cryptocurrencies are exhibiting indicators that they might expand a lot by July. This post reveals several digital assets that might turn a $500 investment into $50,000. Find out which cryptocurrencies can be a quick way to become rich. $XYZ unlocks the G.O.A.T. status for early investors Set up for a lot of ROI XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a new idea to the memecoin space by combining the thrill of sports with the fast-paced energy of crypto. This project is more than just another token; it’s a growing community of people who love football, basketball, MMA, and esports. It’s for hardcore fans of these sports. XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin with its bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision. People are paying attention to it; it just won the title of Best New Meme Project. What makes $XYZ different? It’s not a passing fad. There is a clear plan for this project and a community that is focused on long-term growth. The sports mentality has made the $XYZ token the best competitor, ready to crush all others. $XYZ is on its way to the winner’s podium, where it will be a badge of honor for people who love sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Gives You Something Before It Hits the Market The $XYZ presale is going on right now, and you can buy the token at a special price before it goes on sale. Price at Launch: $0.0001 Now, the price is $0.003333. Next Stage: $0.005 Final Price for Pre-Sale: $0.02 After the presale, the $XYZ token will be available on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, with a target price of $0.10. If the project gets enough money to back this value, early investors could make up to 1,000 times what they put in during the presale. So far, more than $13 million has been put in, which shows that the market is very interested. Getting tokens at a lower presale price is important because it could lead to a higher return on investment when the product launches. The presale is moving quickly because there is a lot of demand for $XYZ. People who buy early get the best prices, which gives them the best chance of making money. Join the $XYZ Presale Now and Watch Your Pennies Turn into Millions! Cardano’s ADA: The Green Crypto That Is Taking on the Market Cardano is getting a lot of attention in the crypto world because of its unique approach. It was made for smart contracts and lets developers make games, apps, and tokens on its platform. ADA, the coin that comes with it, is not just another cryptocurrency; it competes with Ethereum’s ETH. People can store value, make payments, and even stake it on the Cardano network. The way Cardano works is what makes it different. It uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros instead of processes that use a lot of energy, which makes it energy-efficient. But that’s not all there is. There are two layers in Cardano’s blockchain. One takes care of transactions and the other takes care of smart contracts. This design makes it better at processing transactions, which could happen up to a million times a second. Interacting with smart contracts has become safer and cheaper since the release of Cardano native tokens in March 2021. ADA is a good choice for people who are interested in cryptocurrencies right now because it focuses on sustainability and scalability. As the crypto market changes, Cardano’s cutting-edge technology makes it a strong competitor to other major coins. MKR: The Governance Token That Will Shape the Future of Decentralized Finance Maker (MKR) is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s what makes DAI, a stablecoin linked to the US dollar, work. MKR, which started in 2017, lets people who own it vote on the Maker Protocol, which is a system that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that people who own MKR can have a say in how DAI is run and improved. MKR’s value goes up as DAI does well, unlike other coins that pay dividends. Maker was one of the first projects in decentralized finance (DeFi) and has paved the way for creating financial products that don’t need banks. MKR stands out in the current market because it has a strong base and is used in real life. Many cryptocurrencies go up and down a lot, but DAI stays stable, and MKR is a big part of keeping that stability. As more people become interested in DeFi, MKR’s value may go up. MKR has a unique advantage over other tokens: it lets you control a stable and widely used coin. As the crypto market changes, projects like Maker that offer real value and usefulness may become more appealing to investors who want to see their money grow over time. The Polygon Ecosystem Token’s Rise in Crypto: Unlocking the Potential The Polygon Ecosystem Token, or POL, is getting a lot of attention. It is a utility token for the large Polygon network and is important for many tasks. Holders can stake their tokens to help keep the network safe by locking them up. They get more tokens as a reward for doing this. This process not only makes the network stronger but also helps the people who take part. POL is also a big part of how decisions are made in the Polygon ecosystem. People who own tokens can vote on plans that will affect the network’s future. This means that the community really has a say in how things go. POL holders also have access to special services that give them access to features that aren’t available to everyone. POL stands out because the crypto market is looking for coins that are useful and have strong communities. In the current market cycle, it is a good choice because it can be used for many things and the Polygon network is growing. The Rise of BNB: Binance’s All-in-One Crypto Coin That Changes Everything Since BNB came out in 2017, the crypto has been the most important part of the Binance ecosystem. BNB started off as an ERC-20 token, but today it runs both the Binance Chain and the Binance Smart Chain. It’s not simply a digital currency; people use it to pay fees, generate new tokens, and transfer assets around on the network. Users may stake their BNB to gain rewards since there is a technology called Proof-of-Staked Authority that supports smart contracts. Plus, storing BNB includes rewards like cheaper fees on Binance.com and access to several other sites that accept it. With its unique features and solid support, BNB stands out in today’s crypto market. Every quarter, Binance burns BNB, which lowers the overall supply from 200 million to 100 million over time. By making the coin less common, this method might raise its value over time. When compared to other cryptocurrencies, BNB has real-world uses and is an important part of one of the biggest crypto ecosystems. The currency appears well in the current market cycle since more projects are being built on Binance Smart Chain and more people are using BNB for its advantages. For those who pay attention to market trends, BNB is a mix of usefulness and growth potential that is hard to ignore.

Monero ( XMR ) climbed to $365, its highest point since May 28, and now sits 16% above its lowest level from last week. The rebound happened even as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies wavered. It happened as the demand for privacy coins like Horizen ( ZEN ) and Zcash ( ZEC ) jumped. On-chain data shows that Monero’s exchange outflows surged to $8.9 million last week—the largest jump this year. Exchange outflows typically indicate that investors are moving tokens into self-custody, a potentially bullish signal. Monero’s funding rate has remained positive since May 15, suggesting that traders expect future prices to be higher than the current spot price. A positive funding rate is often viewed as a bullish catalyst, as crypto.news reported . You might also like: Best XRP rivals to buy for the next crypto bull market Monero token has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months after spending three years in a consolidation phase. This rebound happened after a US court ruled against the Treasury Department for sanctioning Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer. The department was then forced to remove sanctions earlier this year. XMR’s momentum further accelerated after hackers reportedly used the coin to move over $300 million in suspected stolen funds. Monero is considered ideal for illicit transactions due to its privacy-enhancing features, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. These technologies ensure transaction anonymity. For example, ring signatures obscure the sender by blending their signature with decoys, while stealth addresses generate a one-time address for each transaction, further masking recipient details. Monero price technical analysis XMR price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that XMR has been in a sustained bull run since February 2024, when it was trading at $100.90. The token remains above both the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. It has rebounded to $366 from last week’s low of $312. The Relative Strength Index and the MACD have all pointed upwards. For the rally to continue, Monero must break above resistance at $420, its highest point this year. A successful move above this level would invalidate the double-top pattern, whose neckline sits at $312, and could signal a further rally toward $500. Conversely, a drop below the $312 support would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Amidst the dip, RENDER , Jupiter , and Ethena catch the eye as they hover at oversold levels. This article explores whether these cryptocurrencies are poised for a significant rebound, presenting potential growth for those who time their entry right. Discover which coins might be on the brink of a breakout. RENDER Price Slide: Evaluating Support and Resistance Levels Render price changes over the past month indicate a drop of roughly 20.75%, with the coin shifting steadily lower amidst negative market sentiment. Over the last six months, the decline reached around 57.11%, reflecting significant losses that underscore ongoing bearish pressure. Volatility has characterized this period, as the coin experienced downward momentum that hints at a market struggling to stabilize. Traders have witnessed drastic falls and cautious activity, leaving the coin in a vulnerable state. Recent performance aligns with the extended trend of losses observed, marking a period of substantial price erosion that few bullish signals have countered. RENDER now trades within a defined range between $3.17 and $5.05. The nearest resistance level is at $6.23, with immediate support at $2.46. A break above $6.23 might open the door to further upside, potentially testing a secondary resistance near $8.10. Conversely, a fall below $2.46 could push prices toward the second support level around $0.58. Current indicators suggest that bears are in command, with the RSI reading of 36.61 indicating limited buying pressure. Short-term traders may look for a move above resistance to catch a rebound, while those cautious of a prolonged downturn might consider scalping near support. Risk management is essential until a more defined trend emerges. Jupiter Coin: Recent Trends and Price Levels Jupiter recorded a monthly gain of 10.22% after experiencing a week-long decline of 8.49%. Over the past six months, the coin has dropped sharply by 58.94%, revealing substantial long-term challenges for investors. Volatility has marked this period, with short-term corrections contrasting against a brief recovery last month. These price fluctuations highlight moments of optimism, quickly followed by pullbacks. While there are signs of short-term recovery, the prolonged downturn emphasizes caution among traders, as renewed buying interest struggles against lingering bearish sentiment that keeps market outlook subdued. Currently, Jupiter trades between $0.39 and $0.65, with key support at $0.27 and resistance at $0.78. A secondary resistance is observed near $1.04, while an additional support layer exists at $0.02. Technical indicators show mixed signals; the Awesome Oscillator offers a slight positive reading, while the Momentum Indicator is mildly negative. With the Relative Strength Index at 46.91, the coin appears to be neutral. Bullish buyers have increased prices recently, yet bears exert pressure with a recent weekly drop. Traders should observe for a retest of support at $0.27 for a potential bounce, and watch for a break above $0.78 for further gains. Ethena (ENA): Past and Present Market Trends Ethena experienced a minor dip over the last month, marking a -0.63% price change, while the decline steepened to -19.27% this past week. An extended analysis over a six-month period reveals a significant drop of 62.20%, indicating strong downward pressure. Trading ranged between $0.22 and $0.43 during this timeframe, highlighting volatility and a consistent erosion of value. The price performance suggests repeated bearish sentiment, with short-term rebounds that fail to surpass the long-term downtrend. Currently, Ethena is trading in the range of $0.22 to $0.43, facing immediate resistance at $0.55 and support near $0.14. The second resistance level is at $0.75, while the lower boundary approaches zero. Technical indicators, including the Awesome Oscillator at -0.026 and a slightly negative Momentum Indicator at -0.064, suggest bears are dominant. The RSI reading of 40.84 further supports the bearish outlook, indicating weakness but not an oversold condition. Cautious entries near support may be considered, with profit-taking near resistance levels, necessitating careful risk management. Conclusion The correction has opened new entry points for RENDER , Jupiter (JUP) , and Ethena (ENA) . These coins are currently at oversold levels. This situation could potentially set the stage for significant growth. Investors should watch for any signals of upward momentum. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal The trades occurred on January 29, February 27, May 13, and May 18, with the earliest made more than 120 days before being reported, well past the 45-day deadline mandated by law. The STOCK Act requires lawmakers to disclose transactions over $1,000 within 45 days. Violations can lead to ethics investigations and fines, though penalties are often minor, typically $200, and frequently waived by ethics officials. Violating the Stock Act Gill is among a growing list of lawmakers who have violated the STOCK Act. In many cases, members of Congress have blamed delays on ignorance, clerical mistakes, or errors by accountants. Interestingly, such violations only attract standard fines of just $200. In addition to Bitcoin, Gill reported trades in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) and Treasury-only government securities (TOIXX), both filed on the same day. Gill’s sizable exposure to digital assets comes as the U.S. moves toward clearer cryptocurrency regulation following President Donald Trump’s return to office. Notably, Gill’s purchases coincided with Bitcoin trading above $100,000; the asset is priced at $104,141, down 0.5% on the day and 3% over the past week. Bitcoin one-week price chart.

James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, disclosed the cryptocurrency investment funds' weekly flow in a blog post on Monday. The report shows that these vehicles, which offer exposure to digital assets, recorded a net inflow of $286 million in the previous week.The positive flow extends the streak of crypto investment products to seven weeks, with their last outflow in mid-April. Remarkably, the funds have accrued a total of $10.9 billion during this impressive run, bringing the year-to-date total to $11.13 billion.Ethereum Dethroned Bitcoin Last WeekTypically, investment vehicles that track the performance of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, lead the proceedings weekly. However, Ethereum’s resilience in the face of market uncertainties and recent positive sentiments saw it emerge as the top performer last week. Specifically, Ethereum investment funds raked in $321 million in the week between May 26 and June 2, continuing their strong investor traction. The inflows took their weekly streak to six weeks, the best run since December 2024.Meanwhile, Ethereum funds have now recorded an MTD inflow of $889.5 million and a YTD of $1.4 billion. Generally, vehicles tracking the altcoin king now have a cumulative $14.3 billion in assets under management (AUM).Furthermore, Bitcoin’s streak ended last week, as funds tracking the asset saw mild outflows. The products had been on a six-week streak, bringing in $9.6 billion during the run, before last week's $8 million net outflow.Butterfill highlighted the funds’ strong start to the week, before a macroeconomic headwind from the New York court's declaration that the United States’ tariffs were illegal. Nonetheless, the asset maintains a healthy MTD inflow of $5.5 billion and $10.2 billion YTD.For XRP, its outflow streak extended to two consecutive weeks. XRP-based funds recorded a net outflow of $28 million, further suggesting caution among investors towards the asset, which had been on an 80-week inflow streak until two weeks ago.Other major flows saw Sui and Solana investment products draw in 2.2 million and $1.5 million, while users pulled $3.6 million and $2.4 million from Short Bitcoin and multi-asset funds, respectively. Inflows per Asset Inflows per Asset Remarkably, the net AUM across crypto investment funds reduced last week despite the $286 million inflow. For context, it dropped from its all-time high of $187 billion to $177 billion, as asset prices reduced within the week.Other Countries Step UpMeanwhile, according to regional flows, the United States, as is typical, led inflows, attracting $199 million. These numbers are meager compared to last week’s massive inflows, which were spurred by the performance of Bitcoin spot ETFs.Nonetheless, other countries showed serious momentum. For instance, Hong Kong's inflows improved from $3.3 million two weeks ago to $54.8 million the previous week, with Germany’s $42.9 million also surpassing the previous week's inflows.Australia recorded a net inflow of $21.5 million, while Switzerland, Sweden, and Brazil continued their poor run of form.",Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-02 15:41:50

Bitcoin traded lower over the past week, dropping from over $110,000 on May 27 to slightly above $104,000 by June 2. However, amid this short-term stagnation, attention has shifted to long-term projections, particularly from social media figure Bitcoin Dad, who continues to promote an ambitious price target for the asset.Tracking Momentum Amid Boring Price ActionWhile Bitcoin’s price has hovered above $100,000 for 25 consecutive days, Bitcoin Dad described the market as “boring.” https://twitter.com/bitcoin_dad/status/1929307914050699560Despite the perceived lack of volatility, he remains confident in a year-end price of over $200,000. From the current level of $104,167, Bitcoin would need to rally approximately 91.99% to reach this target. If achieved, Bitcoin’s market capitalization would expand to around $3.97 trillion, assuming the circulating supply remains constant.Bitcoin Dad, who refers to himself as a Bitcoin millionaire, previously stated that price gains stem from “math, patience, and research.” On May 8, he reminded his followers that Bitcoin still trades below $1,000,000, reinforcing his belief that it remains early in the asset’s adoption cycle. When asked about a $450,000 EOY projection from another market commentator, he indicated he would acknowledge being wrong if that figure materializes.A Shared Target for Bitcoin PriceOther analysts also support this Bitcoin projection. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has projected a $200,000 price by the end of 2025. On May 14, he outlined multiple drivers behind this view, including inflows into spot ETFs, growing corporate interest, and recent government initiatives. According to Hougan, ETFs acquired over 500,000 Bitcoin in the previous year, significantly outpacing the 165,000 new coins mined annually.Meanwhile, the U.S. government holds over $17 billion in Bitcoin. A recent executive directive now tasks the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce with sourcing more Bitcoin without using taxpayer funds. Reports also confirm that Abu Dhabi purchased $460 million worth of Bitcoin in the form of BlackRock's IBIT, and other governments are reportedly exploring similar allocations.Analysts Maintain Long-Term Bullish TargetsIn addition to Hougan and Bitcoin Dad, multiple market figures have issued parallel forecasts. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani reiterated his firm's $200,000 Bitcoin projection by 2025. Elsewhere, Fred Krueger, a mathematician with a PhD from Stanford, posted on X that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high within the week. Earlier in April, he assigned a 77% probability to Bitcoin achieving a new all-time high by 2025.",Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-02 15:43:02

The move quickly drew attention across the crypto community. Specifically, some speculate that the coins could be part of Ulbricht’s hidden Silk Road stash, suggesting a self-donation. However, crypto investigator ZachXBT pushed back on these claims. According to him, the funds originated from wallets that utilized Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service.Likely Source of the 300 BTCZachXBT revealed that the addresses had histories dating as far back as 2014 and 2019 and had remained dormant until activity resumed between April and May 2025. Both addresses deposited significant amounts into Jambler shortly before the 300 BTC donation was sent to Ulbricht.ZachXBT explained that while the transaction probably isn't a self-donation, as some have alleged, it raises concerns due to its origin from a flagged address associated with questionable sources. He also emphasized that privacy-focused users typically opt for decentralized mixers, not centralized ones like Jambler.https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1929378278214906145Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Ulbricht has already cashed out the disputed 300 BTC. Data from Arkham shows he withdrew the tokens to an external wallet 24 hours ago. That wallet now holds only $1,968 in crypto. Ross Ulbricht Bitcoin wallet activity Silk Road Ties Still Under the MicroscopeUlbricht, who was arrested in 2013 and sentenced in 2015 to a double life sentence plus 40 years, served 11 years in prison before receiving a pardon from U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2025. Despite his release, wallet activity connected to Silk Road continues to draw scrutiny.In January, Coinbase director Conor Grogan reported discovering 430 BTC worth over $45 million in long-dormant wallets he believes are linked to Ulbricht.These funds have remained untouched for over 13 years and were never seized by authorities. Arkham Intelligence later validated Grogan’s assessment, tying 14 wallets to Silk Road activity , including one holding over $9 million in BTC.https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1882046613709115875Beyond DonationsUlbricht recently held an online auction featuring personal belongings from his pre-arrest and prison life.

But Exabits is changing that. With its upcoming $EXA token, Exabits is opening the door for everyday users to participate in the growing demand for GPU compute and earn from it. If you're a developer, investor, or just curious about crypto, this model offers a new way to share in the value of real infrastructure. Why GPU Compute Matters Behind every AI breakthrough, there’s serious compute power . Whether it’s training large language models, building autonomous systems, or powering Web3 gaming, GPUs are the workhorses. And demand for them is growing fast. The problem? Most people can’t access or invest in these systems directly. That’s where Exabits comes in. Learn more about Exabits’ GPU cloud . The $EXA Token: A Gateway to Real-World Utility Exabits is launching its native token, $EXA, as a way to open up its infrastructure to a global audience. This isn’t just another crypto with vague promises. $EXA will have actual utility on the platform: • Pay for GPU compute at a discount• Stake to earn rewards• Access exclusive network features• Help govern future upgrades Holding $EXA is like having a key to one of the most powerful AI infrastructures on the market. The Dual-Token Model: Yield Meets Ownership One of the things that really sets Exabits apart is its two-token model. In addition to $EXA, there’s $XBIT, a token that represents ownership in GPU assets within the Exabits network. Staking $XBIT allows users to earn yield, which is paid in $EXA. It's like earning a return on physical infrastructure only tokenized. This gives the ecosystem a strong foundation: real-world usage creates demand and token holders directly benefit from it. Real Demand = Real Rewards Exabits isn't speculating on future customers. They already serve major Web2 and Web3 clients, from big names like Lepton AI (Recently acquired by Nvidia), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and PaleBlueDot AI to rising Web3 giants like NEAR Protocol and io.net. Their infrastructure is already in high demand. This matters because the value of the $EXA and $XBIT tokens is tied to real usage, not empty promises. More usage means more fees, more rewards, and stronger token fundamentals. Community Airdrop: Your Early Entry Point To get more people involved, Exabits is running an airdrop campaign ahead of the token launch. This is a chance to engage with the project and get early exposure to $EXA. By joining the Exabits community and completing simple tasks, users can earn free tokens and start participating before the token goes public.

Here is the Latest Multi-Million Dollar Hack Incident!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/hacking-incidents-never-end-in-the-crypto-industry-here-is-the-latest-multi-million-dollar-hack-incident/,"Nervos Network’s cross-chain protocol Force Bridge has been hit by a decentralized finance (DeFi) attack, causing the loss of over $3 million in cryptocurrencies, according to analysis by Web3 security firm Cyvers. Nervos Network's Force Bridge Hacked: Over $3 Million in Crypto Stolen According to security researchers, the attackers seized approximately 257,800 USDT, 539.09 ETH (about $1.35 million), 898,300 USDC, 60,400 DAI, and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin worth approximately $83,000. Most of the stolen assets were converted to Ethereum and transferred through the Tornado Cash mixer, which is often used to cover up the tracks. Following the attack, infrastructure company Magickbase, which makes significant contributions to the Nervos ecosystem, announced that it has stopped its bridge service and launched an investigation. The company made a statement on June 2 on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) stating, “Our team is investigating the incident.” Singapore-based Magickbase is known as one of the main partners providing infrastructure support to Nervos Network’s developers and users. The company recently announced plans to terminate its Force Bridge service as of May 31, citing low user activity and high maintenance costs. Nervos Network, whose mainnet was launched in 2019, aims to increase cross-chain interoperability and create an integrated blockchain ecosystem with tools such as Force Bridge. DeFi bridges like Force Bridge work with smart contracts and “token wrapping” technologies that allow for the transfer of assets and data between isolated blockchains, but these systems are frequently subject to hacker attacks due to their complex structures and security vulnerabilities. Notable past examples include the Ronin Bridge attack in 2022, where $600 million was stolen, and the Wormhole attack, where $323 million was stolen. Such incidents once again reveal how fragile DeFi bridges can be in terms of security. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Hacking Incidents Never End in the Crypto Industry!

The breach is the latest incident where the vulnerabilities of a blockchain’s interoperability solutions have been exploited, raising concerns about the security of cross-chain protocols. Magickbase and Cyvers sound the alarm about Nervos breach One of the first alerts came from Magickbase, a developer of Nervos-integrated desktop wallet software. In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), the team said it had picked up on unusual activity on Force Bridge and immediately shut down related services to protect users. “We’ve detected abnormal activity on #ForceBridge and have paused the service as a precaution. Our team is investigating,” Magickbase wrote, assuring its users that more information would be shared as it becomes available. Shortly after the post, blockchain security firm Cyvers Alerts published a more detailed breakdown of the breach. According to their analysis, a suspicious address has taken over the bridge and launched unauthorized movement of assets out of the Nervos network. 🚨ALERT🚨Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions involving @NervosNetwork . A suspicious address appears to have taken control over the bridge, stealing ~$3M in assets: 257.8K $USDT 539.09 $ETH 898.3K $USDC 60.4K $DAI 0.79 $WBTC All funds were swapped to $ETH and… pic.twitter.com/jA3EZVpTeN — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) June 2, 2025 So far, the only communication from Nervos itself has been a repost of Magickbase’s initial warning. According to Cyvers, the attacker converted the stolen tokens into Ethereum and began funneling the funds through Tornado Cash, a crypto “mixer” that scrambles transaction trails to make the origin and destination nearly impossible to trace. This kind of laundering is all too familiar, and Tornado Cash has increasingly been used as a go-to tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen funds. And once the money hits Tornado, recovery becomes a long shot. A bigger problem in the blockchain world Unfortunately, this incident is just the latest in a growing pattern. Cross-chain bridges have become some of the most attacked pieces of infrastructure in the crypto ecosystem. High-profile hacks like those on the Ronin and Binance bridges have made headlines; other exploits, like those involving Orbit Chain, Socket, and ALEX bridge, have also cost users millions of dollars over the past year. Force Bridge was supposed to be part of Nervos Network’s broader vision of secure, scalable blockchain interoperability. The network has been widely praised in the past for its hybrid design, combining Bitcoin’s UTXO model with smart contract functionality. In a 2024 Messari report , Nervos CKB was even called a potential “game-changer” for blockchain programmability. But as this breach demonstrates, even technically sophisticated networks are only as secure as their most exposed component. This has also brought to light the ongoing debate surrounding the use of tools like Tornado Cash . The argument that it offers legitimate privacy benefits for users may not continue to hold water with its continuous use by bad actors to launder large amounts of stolen funds and complicate tracking efforts.

BNB Chain just processed triple the combined DEX volume of Ethereum and Solana. Can this fuel the breakout? Institutional demand is growing, with ETF talks and a major SEC legal victory sparking predictions of a $2K rally. Source: Coinwaft This breakout performance didn’t just boost price charts; it catapulted $BNB deeper into the elite tier of cryptocurrencies, solidifying its rank as the fifth-largest digital asset by market cap. Now valued at over $92 billion, BNB towers more than $10 billion above Solana and outpaces the likes of Cardano and Tron by nearly four times. BNB Chain Outpaces Rivals with Record-Breaking $12.4B DEX Volume The growth in $BNB’s value has also been reflected in the BNB Chain’s performance. Its 24-hour decentralized exchange (DEX) volume recently hit an all-time high of $12.4 billion. https://t.co/z71KqrrWQL — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) June 2, 2025 This figure triples the combined DEX volume of Ethereum and Solana, illustrating the BNB Chain’s growing market relevance. According to DeFiLlama, the BNB Chain also ranks third in active wallet addresses in the DeFi space, boasting over 1.4 million. It trails only Solana (5.06 million) and Tron (2.54 million), reinforcing its large user base. Source: DefilLama Another key indicator of BNB Chain’s rising dominance is the explosion of stablecoin issuance on the network. As of November 2020, the stablecoin market cap on BNB Chain stood at a modest $140 million. Fast forward to the present, and the network now commands over $10.2 billion in stablecoin total value locked (TVL). $2K $BNB? Maxis Says ‘Trillion-Dollar Innovation’—But Can It Deliver? This growth has fueled bullish sentiment among BNB loyalists, many of whom view the coin as a “trillion-dollar innovation.” Some are making bold predictions.

Technical Analysis: $BNB Breakout Signals Path Toward $793 Price Target The chart indicates that $BNB recently surged from a demand area between $620 and $635, which is now acting as a major support zone. This range, showcased in blue on the chart, previously served as resistance but has flipped to support following a strong upward move marked by a spike in trading volume. $BNB Price Prediction/ Source: TradingView The price action shows that $BNB attempted to climb higher but encountered a major resistance zone between $711 and $732, represented in red. This area has historically capped upward momentum and now stands as the primary hurdle $BNB must overcome to initiate a run toward a new all-time high (ATH). The chart projects an upside target of $793.12, representing a potential gain of about 20.86% from the current level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 49.45, suggests a neutral momentum. During the recent rally, the RSI also showed signs of bullish consolidation, remaining mostly above the midpoint (50). A renewed push above 50 on the RSI would support a bullish case and suggest improving momentum.

Optimism, Raydium, and Polkadot Could Be the First to Recover",https://bitzo.com/2025/06/short-term-rally-after-red-monday-optimism-raydium-and-polkadot-could-be-the-first-to-recover,"After a tough start to the week, a few cryptocurrencies are showing signs of a potential comeback. Some traders are keeping a close eye on Optimism , Raydium , and Polkadot. These coins could be gearing up for a strong short-term rally. Find out which digital assets are poised to bounce back quickly. Optimism Price Analysis: Recent Downturn and Key Trading Levels Over the last month, Optimism dropped by about 10.72%, while the six-month decline deepened to around 75.13%. The coin traded within a range of $0.50 to $0.88, reflecting reduced investor confidence. Price movements during this time showed no significant recovery, and notable declines indicate cautious trading behavior. This trend suggests a period of pressure for the asset, with performance struggling to escape its established price range. The ongoing decrease highlights a lack of momentum, leaving traders wary of potential risks. The current trading range for Optimism is between $0.50 and $0.88. Immediate resistance is at $1.10, while the nearest support is at $0.35, suggesting it may attract buying interest. A second resistance at $1.48 and a theoretical floor at zero provide context for risk assessments. Indicators show bears are dominant, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.059 and an RSI reading of 40.24. There is no clear uptrend now, and most signals point negative. Traders should watch for dip-buying opportunities near support, while a breach of resistance would signal a potential shift in sentiment. Raydium: Recent Downtrend and Key Price Levels Define Market Sentiment Over the last month, Raydium fell by 15.21% as prices traded between $1.83 and $3.50. The past six months saw a decline of 53.42%, driven by strong selling pressure that broke through higher levels. The price action indicated a consistent downward trend with bearish energy prevailing. Indicators reveal negative momentum, highlighting a significant shift away from any sustained gains. Currently, Raydium trades between $1.83 and $3.50, with resistance at $4.52 and further at $6.18. Support is established near $1.18, above a lower extreme around $0. Bears dominate the market, shown by a 1-week price change of -24.13% and negative momentum indicators. The RSI at 36.08 suggests the asset nears oversold conditions, but no distinct upward trend has emerged. Traders might consider short positions if the price rises above resistance, while a bounce from support could signal potential recovery if volume increases. Caution is advised due to the unclear market sentiment and limited bullish strength. Polkadot Faces Continued Bearish Pressure with Limited Short-Term Gains Polkadot experienced a one-week decline of over 10% and a drop of 3.125% over the past month. In the last six months, the coin's price decreased by nearly 59%, illustrating a broader downturn. This long-term loss highlights persistent bearish pressure that overshadows minor fluctuations in shorter timeframes. Although short-term corrections were less severe, they indicate volatility, while prolonged weakness underscores ongoing challenges for the coin. Overall, the past performance reflects a market struggling with significant selling pressure and uncertainty. Price currently hovers between $3.48 and $5.04, with nearest support at $2.87 and resistance at $5.99. Bears dominate the market, creating a clear downward bias, but the established range offers important levels for traders. A drop below $2.87 could lead to further declines toward $1.31, while a breakthrough at $5.99 may initiate moves toward $7.55. Traders might consider buying dips near $2.87 or waiting for an upside breakout signal. Oscillators and moving averages suggest ongoing pressure, but stabilization above immediate resistance could prompt bullish opportunities, requiring caution and strategic planning. Conclusion OP , RAY , and DOT show potential for a quick rebound. These coins have seen positive signs in early reactions. Investors are closely watching these projects after recent declines. Optimism, Raydium, and Polkadot have strong fundamentals that may drive short-term recovery. The next few days could be crucial for their performance. If their momentum continues, they could lead the market's recovery. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It was fast, emotional, and massively profitable for early believers. PEPE didn’t need a use case or complex infrastructure—it was pure meme power. But as the hype fades and attention turns toward more sustainable growth, a new contender is entering the spotlight: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Where PEPE relied on emotion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on structure. It isn’t aiming for a viral moment. It’s building an ecosystem—one that’s already audited, and preparing to launch with real earning potential. And while PEPE delivered 20x on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned for 50x based on cold, hard fundamentals. The Foundation: Decentralized Lending With Real Yield Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can lend or borrow a variety of digital assets. It offers two lending models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system allows users to deposit assets like ETH, AVAX, or DAI into a shared pool and earn interest that automatically adjusts with market demand. This means higher utilization equals higher APY. At current demand levels, long-term lenders have seen annual returns that rival the best of traditional finance—without giving up control of their assets. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model is even more exciting. It lets users lend directly to others with custom terms and rates. More importantly, it unlocks access to assets rarely supported by P2C platforms. You can lend or borrow memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB)—letting you generate income even from speculative tokens. Deposits are represented by mtTokens, which accumulate value over time. By staking these mtTokens in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s safety module, users receive passive dividends funded by the protocol’s revenue. These dividends are paid in MUTM tokens, creating a sustainable feedback loop that rewards long-term holders and strengthens the token’s value. 50x Is Not a Dream—It’s a Target Backed by Real Progress Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 5 of its presale. The token is priced at $0.03, up 200% from the $0.01 price in Phase 1. Early investors have already tripled their money, and over $9.72 million has been raised from more than 11,450 holders. Waiting for later phases means paying more and gaining less—every step forward reduces the return potential. Let’s break it down. A $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.03 gets you around 33,333 MUTM. When the token hits $1, that becomes $33,333—an easy 33x. But MUTM isn’t aiming for $1 alone. With its multiple earning avenues, and a soon-to-launch platform, hitting $1.50 would turn that same investment into $50,000. That’s a 50x return—driven by product, not popularity. Earning Passive Income From Day One When the platform goes live, users will be able to deposit assets like ETH or DAI into the protocol and start earning instantly. For example, locking $2,000 worth of DAI in the P2C pool during periods of high utilization can generate annual returns well above 10%. That’s income in your wallet—without selling your crypto or relying on token price appreciation. Meanwhile, those who participate in the safety module by staking their mtTokens receive additional MUTM rewards. These rewards come from buybacks using real protocol revenue. The more the platform is used, the more dividends are distributed. This is how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates wealth: not through speculation, but through actual product usage and value capture. Upcoming Beta Launch and $100K Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t waiting until post-launch to start making waves. The beta version of the platform is set to go live by the time the token hits the market. This means users can immediately start lending, borrowing, and earning—while other projects are still building their minimum viable product. To accelerate adoption, the team has launched a $100,000 giveaway to reward the community. It’s a signal of commitment and momentum—designed to attract active users, boost visibility, and expand the protocol’s early user base. Security First: CertiK Audit Completed Before any serious money enters a DeFi platform, it needs to be secure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already passed a full audit by CertiK, the most respected name in blockchain security. The Token Scan Score stands at 70.00, based on both static and manual analysis. With smart contracts validated and vulnerabilities addressed, investors have one less thing to worry about. This level of transparency and preparedness is why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already being compared to early-stage DeFi giants. And with its multichain ambitions and flexible asset support, it’s designed for scale. The Time to Enter Is Now The early phases of a quality project are where the real gains are made. At $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers one of the best asymmetric opportunities in crypto right now. With a working product, audited contracts, real passive income, and tokenomics designed for long-term growth, it’s only a matter of time before the broader market catches on. Pepe (PEPE) gave speculators 20x. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives investors a path to 50x—and this time, it’s not a gamble. It’s a platform built for performance, and the countdown to launch has already begun.

Solaxy and Wall Street Ponke (WPonke) are emerging as the leading candidates in the sector, leading in terms of use cases, and growth potential. As investors continue to look for the next 100x token for 2025, these two projects are attracting attention in different ways. Solaxy stands out as a technical creation within the Solana ecosystem, while WPonke uses community protection and AI-powered intelligence. Both projects provide something new to investors, but which holds the promise of the best returns this year? Solaxy: A Leap Forward for Solana Solaxy is the first layer 2 solution to be built on the Solana blockchain. The main aim of the project is to handle the issues related to scalability on the network. While Solana promises fast transactions, congestion, and failures on the networks have been something that has worried traders. Solaxy is built to resolve these issues, hoping that its increased throughput and support for multiple chains will allow it to serve as the basic layers for decentralized applications in the future. The project has been enjoying a lot of interest, with its presale raising over $40 million. The strong support from users and investors shows there is growing confidence in what it brings to the crypto industry. Wall Street Ponke: AI Meets Meme Culture In contrast, Wall Street Ponke is taking the meme coin industry in a new direction. While meme culture gives it humor and popularity, it also uses technology like artificial intelligence. The project started after a disagreement within the original Ponke team. With the team growing weary of aiming for fame, the WPonke team decided to focus on openness and helping its community instead. Welcome to Wall Street Ponke . WITH THE $WPONKE TRADING PLATFORM YOU’RE NOT JUST TRADING, YOU’RE TRADING SMARTER SAFER AND WITH PEACE OF MIND #WPONKE $WPONKE 🔗: https://t.co/lQk6PYik7O pic.twitter.com/30dUCoIcsU — Wall Street Ponke (@Wallstreetponke) May 14, 2025 Its presale has raised over $330,000 so far, with tokens priced at $0.000264 per unit. ROADMAP The roadmap at WPonke shows a main emphasis on making the token useful In the first phase (Q1–Q2 2025), the plan is to complete the smart contracts and provide an AI trading platform. In this phase, the group will kickstart actions to raise awareness. In phase 2 (Q3 2025), a presale and the first beta version of the trading platform will be launched. Educational content and special events will begin in this phase. By Phase 3 (Q4 2025), the full platform, including e-learning features, will be live. Layer 2 privacy features will also be activated to protect users. Phase 4 (2026) will focus on expanding multi-chain support, strengthening AI tools, and moving the project into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). HOW TO BUY Participating in the WPonke presale is an easy process. The first step is to get a crypto wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Install your wallet and ensure the recovery phrase is saved securely and safely. Next, get ETH, BNB, or USDT by purchasing it on an exchange. After depositing, transfer the tokens to your wallet and make sure it is on the relevant blockchain network. On the WPonke presale dashboard, connect your wallet, pick the payment option, and decide on the amount you would like to invest. During the presale, you can also stake your tokens to get additional rewards. TOKENOMICS of WALL STREET PONKE WPonke’s tokenomics shows that the team is using a balanced approach. 35% of the tokens are allocated to the presale, allowing more investors to benefit from it early. 25% is allocated to marketing, helping to maintain the movement of the token after it launches. 15% will be used to support liquidity on exchanges to ensure smooth trading.

After repeated failed attempts to break past resistance, ETH now sits under heavy selling pressure, raising concerns about a deeper correction. Bulls appear to be losing control as overall market sentiment weakens amid global economic uncertainty and the persistent weight of rising US Treasury yields. Some market participants are now bracing for a significant downturn if Ethereum fails to hold above key demand zones. Related Reading: Solana Reclaims Key Support After Sweeping Lows – Early Signs Of Reversal? However, not everyone is turning bearish. Some prominent analysts maintain a highly bullish long-term view, arguing that Ethereum still has significant upside this cycle. According to Ted Pillows, Ethereum could reach $10,000 before the cycle ends. From his perspective, current price action represents a temporary dip rather than a trend reversal, and accumulating during weakness is the smarter move for long-term investors. While short-term uncertainty dominates headlines, long-term conviction remains strong among Ethereum supporters who point to rising institutional interest, declining exchange supply, and the overall maturing of the Ethereum ecosystem as reasons to stay optimistic. For now, ETH’s position just under $2,500 sets the stage for a critical test in the days ahead. Ethereum Analysts Eye Breakout Potential Ethereum is currently testing a crucial support level at $2,500 after repeatedly reaching the $2,700 resistance over the past few weeks. This zone has proven difficult to break, but bulls are still holding the line. If ETH manages to reclaim the upper range and close above it, analysts believe it could ignite the altseason the market has been waiting for. Despite Ethereum’s underperformance over the past year, marked by a lack of sustained momentum and significant selling pressure, the recent price action suggests a shift. Over the past few weeks, ETH has entered a more bullish phase, supported by increasing on-chain activity and stronger demand. Some analysts remain firmly bullish. Ted Pillows, for example, has projected that Ethereum is headed above $10,000 this cycle. While short-term volatility may cause concern, long-term conviction remains strong. For many investors, the message is clear: embrace the dips, accumulate strategically, and avoid panic selling. Technical sentiment across the board is turning cautiously optimistic. Market watchers point to Ethereum’s resilience at the $2,500 level as a sign of building strength. If this support holds and bulls step in with volume, the breakout above $2,700 could be swift and aggressive.

ETH Tests Key Support As Bulls Defend $2,500 Ethereum is currently trading around $2,488 after a 2% daily drop, showing continued weakness below the crucial $2,700 resistance zone. The chart highlights a clear consolidation range forming since early May, with ETH repeatedly failing to close above the 200-day SMA, currently around $2,680. This long-term moving average is acting as a significant barrier, preventing any breakout momentum from gaining traction. Support remains at the lower boundary of the range near $2,470–$2,500, where buyers have consistently stepped in to absorb selling pressure. This area coincides with the 34-day EMA at $2,386 and the 100-day SMA just below current levels, forming a dense cluster of technical support. However, volume has been declining, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears have clear control. If Ethereum loses the $2,470 level decisively, the next key area to watch lies near $2,300, where the 50-day SMA could act as a cushion. Related Reading: Solana Flashes Buy Signal – $159 Support Key For Rebound Conversely, reclaiming $2,700 with strength could signal the beginning of a larger move to the upside. Until then, ETH remains stuck in a range, and traders will be watching closely for a decisive break—up or down to define Ethereum’s next major trend.

In another update, blockchain security firm Hacken revealed that the exploit occurred after the attacker made multiple failed attempts over a six-hour period before finally breaching the system. “This exploit reinforces what we’ve been warning about for months: access control failures are now one of the most critical threats in Web3,” Hacken said in a statement shared with Crypto.news. “The attacker made multiple failed attempts over a 6-hour window before successfully draining 874 BNB. That kind of activity should have raised immediate alarms.” According to Hacken, the attacker initially targeted Force Bridge on BNB Chain shortly after 01:30 UTC on June 2, making repeated failed attempts. A small test breach occurred around 02:23 UTC, netting just $25. The full-scale exploit happened at 07:36 UTC, when 874 BNB, worth roughly $572,000 at the time, was successfully drained. Additional funds were later stolen on both BNB Chain and Ethereum, bringing the total to $3.9 million. The stolen assets were quickly funneled through crypto mixers and anonymous platforms, including Tornado Cash and FixedFloat, in an attempt to obscure the trail. Hacken noted that funds were split among newly created wallets and routed through multiple hops before being deposited to these services.

Our team is investigating.” Force Bridge plays a key role in Nervos Network’s multi-chain vision, enabling transfers of assets like ETH, ERC-20 tokens, and potentially non-fungible tokens between Nervos and networks such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. The bridge functions by locking assets on the source chain and issuing matching tokens on Nervos, under the protection of a multi-signature wallet operated by Nervos and its partners. This exploit adds to a growing list of cryptocurrency hacks that continue to trouble the industry. According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, the cryptocurrency industry lost $244.1 million in May as a result of hacks. Although that number is still high, it represents a 39% decrease from the total losses in April, indicating a slight improvement in response or defense capabilities.

While this scenario remains speculative, it is grounded in historical data and long-term market projections. SHIB’s Current Position Reflects a Major Pullback In October 2021, Shiba Inu hit an all-time high (ATH) of $0.000088, with its market capitalization reaching approximately $51.9 billion. At that time, the global cryptocurrency market cap was $2.6 trillion, giving SHIB a market dominance of 1.99%. Since then, both its price and dominance have declined significantly. Currently, SHIB trades at $0.00001291, reflecting a nearly 10% drop in the past week alone. This decline follows the recent broader crypto market correction, which has particularly affected altcoins. The current price level places Shiba Inu roughly 70% below its March 2024 local peak of $0.00004563, despite ongoing bullish momentum in the market since the last quarter of 2024. The token remains far from revisiting its 2021 ATH. However, many analysts believe a future resurgence remains possible. While ambitious targets, such as $0.01, continue to circulate among community members, more measured projections are gaining attention. Price Projection if SHIB Reclaims 2021 Dominance at $40T Market Cap One such outlook comes from Times Tabloid, which explored a scenario where SHIB regains its 1.99% market share in a global crypto market valued at $40 trillion. Under those conditions, Shiba Inu’s market cap would soar to $796 billion. Based on its current circulating supply of approximately 589.5 trillion tokens, this would place SHIB’s price at $0.00135, a new all-time high. This price level represents an over 10,400% increase from its current value. Market Experts Back Long-Term Growth Potential Long-term market projections such as those by Cardano supporter Dan Gambardello have also drawn attention. In June 2023, Gambardello stated the global crypto market cap could hit $40 trillion. He acknowledged the uncertainty around the timing but asserted confidence in its eventual realization. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts, such as LuckSide, have predicted that Shiba Inu could achieve the $0.001 price point. Similarly, a forecast from Changelly indicates that SHIB could reach $0.001 by January 2040. SHIB at Current Dominance in a $40T Market However, if Shiba Inu maintains its current dominance level of 0.23% when the global crypto market cap reaches $40 trillion, the token’s market capitalization would rise to $92 billion. This would still result in a substantial price increase, with SHIB valued at $0.0001560, significantly above its current price but below the peak levels discussed. Ultimately, while SHIB’s performance in the near term remains uncertain, historical benchmarks and optimistic projections suggest considerable potential under favorable conditions. Whether Shiba Inu can reclaim its former dominance and benefit from a global market expansion remains a topic of debate. But the numbers offer a compelling scenario for long-term investors to consider. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Many who joined the crypto bandwagon early benefited from successive bull runs that enabled them to retire early. Employees Retire Early After Shiba Inu's Parabolic RallyThe Crypto Basic has reported stories of employees quitting their 9-to-5 jobs after making substantial gains from crypto investments. Most of these stories were associated with Shiba Inu following the token’s remarkable performance in the 2020/2021 market cycle. As previously reported, a truck driver retired early after his $650 investment in Shiba Inu skyrocketed to $1.7 million. In addition, a warehouse manager also retired from his job, thanks to Shiba Inu’s rally. The warehouse manager generated a profit of approximately $1.5 million within a year of investing $8,000 in Shiba Inu. These stories motivated many to enter the crypto space, with hopes of also retiring early. Key Considerations for Early Retirement To retire early, one must attain financial freedom to cover their needs and wants while setting aside inheritance for loved ones. However, people’s retirement goals differ based on their lifestyle and geographical location. People residing in high-cost locations and seeking a luxurious lifestyle might set a high retirement target of over $1 million. In contrast, individuals living in low-cost areas with frugal lifestyles might retire early after making $500,000. As the search for alternative paths to financial freedom surges, we explored how people can achieve this by investing in SHIB. Specifically, the Crypto Basic estimated the number of SHIB tokens an investor would need to acquire today to retire by 2040, assuming the price rises to $0.001 per token. It is worth noting that we considered three financial targets for this analysis: $500,000, $1 million, and $5 million. Amount of SHIB Needed to Retire Early By 2040 Reaching these retirement targets requires investors to hold a certain amount of SHIB. An individual seeking to reach a target of $500,000 by 2040, if the price hits $0.001, must have or purchase approximately 500 million SHIB tokens today. Those targeting $1 million or $5 million require holdings of 1 billion SHIB or 5 billion SHIB tokens, respectively. The good news is that these tokens can be acquired at discounted prices, given SHIB’s current value. At the current price of $0.00001276, holdings of 500 million, 1 billion, and 5 billion SHIB tokens cost about $6,380, $12,760, and $63,800, respectively. The value of these tokens could soar to $500,000, $1 million, or $5 million if SHIB hits an ambitious target of $0.001 by 2040. Prediction for SHIB’s Rise to $0.001 Meanwhile, clinching the $0.001 target is no easy feat, as it would require SHIB to eliminate two zeros from its price. It also demands a surge of 7,736% from the current value. Assuming SHIB reaches this milestone and its total supply of 589.5 trillion tokens remains unchanged, its market capitalization would increase to approximately $589.5 billion from its current value of $7.51 billion. Interestingly, several experts have predicted a surge in Shiba Inu’s value to the $0.001 target. Following Shiba Inu’s breakout in mid-October 2024, veteran market expert Crypto Sheriff set three bullish targets for SHIB, including $0.001. Besides Crypto Sheriff, other experts, such as LuckSide , have issued a similar projection for SHIB, forecasting that its price will someday soar to the $0.001 mark. Can SHIB Hit $0.001 Before 2040? Although this analysis conservatively projects that SHIB might reach the $0.001 target by 2040, some experts believe it may occur sooner. For instance, Krao predicted that SHIB would rally to $0.001 in the early part of this year, specifically January-February. However, the prediction did not materialize as expected. Changelly experts anticipate the $0.001 target will be reached between 2035 and 2039. Furthermore, the Telegaon prediction platform estimates that SHIB will rise to the $0.001 mark by 2035, five years earlier.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-02 16:16:28

This guide looks at the top cryptos to watch now, backed by real progress like strong crypto presale results, technical rollouts, and range-bound setups. With growing attention on market-ready features and ecosystem strength, these coins are gaining ground. The list includes a $281 million presale with EVM tools and high upside potential. The article explores four key projects showing real-time growth. These are not just names from old cycles but networks actively expanding. From presales to Layer 1 cryptos, the market is seeing some clear leaders. Timing is key, and the setups mentioned below reflect strong signals in terms of technology, pricing, and community activity. These are the top cryptos to watch now. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Gem That Has Pulled in Over $281M BlockDAG remains among the top cryptos to watch now, with over $281 million raised and 21.8 billion BDAG coins sold during the presale. The current offer sits at $0.0018 in Batch 28, staying live until June 13. After this, batch-based pricing resumes up to Batch 45. When the presale ends, the coin is expected to launch at $0.05, offering an ROI projection of around 2,677% to those buying BDAG now. The upcoming “GO LIVE reveal” on June 13 is also set to announce the 20 CEXs listing BDAG, with MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, LBank, and XT.com already confirmed. The technology behind BlockDAG (BDAG) blends DAG structure with Proof-of-Work to reach speeds of 15,000 transactions per second. Its toolkit includes EVM support, smart contract features, and a no-code launchpad for tokens and dApps. Retail users mine BDAG through the X1 app, while large-scale mining options include the X30 and X100 units. Over 1 million users already mine through mobile, boosted by a 25% referral bonus and the “Double Up” promo. With the presale’s fixed rate closing soon, BlockDAG stands as a core name among top cryptos to watch now. 2. Hyperliquid: Full EVM Deployment and Steady Growth Hyperliquid (HYPE), currently priced at $31.43 with a market cap of $10.49 billion, has seen a 3.79% dip over the past day. Still, it stays relevant due to its HyperEVM rollout, bringing Ethereum compatibility to its mainnet. This upgrade lets developers work on Ethereum-like contracts using Hyperliquid’s native performance. A small unlock event is expected on November 29, 2025, adding just 216,580 tokens, 0.02% of the total, to circulation. This limited release supports liquidity while keeping supply pressure low. Hyperliquid’s core appeal is combining CEX-level performance with DeFi features. It’s growing from a platform into a broader protocol, making it one of the top cryptos to watch now. If traction grows among developers and users, the price outlook may strengthen going into Q4. 3. Avalanche: Price Holding Range with Upside to $50 Avalanche (AVAX) trades at $20.19, swinging between $19.91 and $21.82 in the past day, down by 6.09%. The coin is maintaining a solid range between $19 and $29, signaling a possible breakout. Analysts suggest that if the price moves cleanly above this band, it could reach $50.05 before year-end. Avalanche’s strength lies in its underlying ecosystem. The network has gained attention for partnerships and a strong technical base. With Subnet options and reliable upgrade patterns, AVAX continues to attract attention. Even during flat price periods, its infrastructure supports ongoing development. These are the reasons it’s one of the top cryptos to watch now, particularly if sentiment shifts positively in the second half of the year. 4. Sui: Holding Support and Looking for a Breakout Sui (SUI) is trading at $3.18, with recent action between $3.07 and $3.49. The 7.56% drop in the last 24 hours hasn’t changed overall sentiment. Analysts expect average prices near $3.43 in May, with highs reaching $3.51 by August. Strong resistance remains around $3.80, and a break past that could open further gains. Sui’s appeal lies in its ability to scale and stay EVM-ready. It’s crafted for app developers who want high throughput with ease of use. With a stable toolkit and growing traction, SUI is gathering interest again. This price setup and infrastructure focus place it firmly on the list of top cryptos to watch now. Final Verdict! These are not speculative picks, they’re active networks gaining momentum. BlockDAG’s fixed pricing and June 13 CEX updates make it a standout with urgency. Hyperliquid is evolving into a full EVM-compatible system with practical use. Avalanche is staying in a range that could lead to a strong move toward $50. Sui is showing signs of a bullish shift, thanks to its development strength and scaling focus. Each of these is well-positioned, showing why they’re among the top cryptos to watch now . If you’re aiming for smart entries backed by current data, this is the list to start with before the next major price shifts occur.

But a few names are clearly gaining traction. BlockDAG, Avalanche, Sui, and Litecoin are all showing important shifts, whether it’s high presale activity, strong price recovery, or major technical developments. These aren’t just short-term movements; there are deeper drivers behind each one. This list is built around confirmed updates as of May 31, 2025. From BlockDAG’s $281 million presale to Sui’s ETF attention and Litecoin’s bullish breakout chances, these names have solid momentum. Whether you’re starting fresh or looking for the next smart move, these top cryptos to buy this month stand out for their timing and strength. 1. BlockDAG: $281M Raised and Exchange Listings Coming Soon Among the top cryptos to buy this month, BlockDAG (BDAG) is leading in visibility. The project has now raised $281 million with 21.8 billion BDAG coins sold. Though it’s in Batch 28 priced at $0.0262, a limited-time offer keeps the price locked at $0.0018 until June 13. The launch price is set at $0.05, which could give early participants a potential 2,677% return. On June 13, BlockDAG is set for GO LIVE reveal, where it will announce 20 centralized exchanges for BDAG listings. Five confirmed names already include MEXC, LBank, Coinstore, XT.com, and BitMart. BlockDAG’s framework supports fast growth. It uses a hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work model that confirms multiple blocks in parallel, offering speeds of up to 15,000 TPS. It also provides EVM compatibility and tools like a no-code token builder, Startup Hub, X1 mobile miner app, and advanced hardware miners, including the mining beast X100. The “Double Up” option allows users to add and double previous amounts, while the 25% referral reward also remains in place. With over 1 million X1 mobile app users and many exchange listings on the horizon, BDAG is moving quickly. Anyone focusing on top cryptos to buy this month should consider BlockDAG’s pricing window and tech setup as serious strengths. 2. Avalanche: Price Pullback but Real-World Use Grows Currently trading near $20.06, Avalanche (AVAX) has slipped slightly from its recent peak of $21.82. The price found solid footing between $21.32 and $21.40, despite a 6.78% pullback from $23.04 during broader market pressure. Charts show some buyers stepping in at key support points, and breaking above $22.35 may lead back toward $25. What keeps Avalanche on the list of top cryptos to buy this month is its development focus. It just announced a new link with Filecoin, launching a cross-chain data bridge aimed at expanding Web3 storage capacity. In another move, Bergen County in New Jersey is now using Avalanche for digitizing property deeds, highlighting practical use beyond DeFi. This kind of usage adds lasting strength, even in periods of price cooling. 3. Sui: Security Bounce and ETF Progress Sui (SUI) is holding around $3.14 after bouncing back from a major hack on the Cetus DEX, which led to a $223 million loss. The Sui Foundation took action quickly, freezing $162 million and passing a recovery plan backed by over 90% of validators. SUI has gained support near $3.40 and is now in slow recovery mode. What’s energizing the market is more than a price bounce. Nasdaq has filed a 19b-4 form to list a spot ETF for SUI via 21Shares, placing it among the few altcoins under serious ETF review. If it goes through, this could attract institutional interest. With Sui reinforcing its security and possibly entering the ETF space, it’s becoming one of the top cryptos to buy this month, especially for those looking for strong projects in the mid-cap range. 4. Litecoin: ETF Buzz and Strong Chart Setup Litecoin (LTC) price is sitting at $84.75, with upward resistance near $91.76 and good support at $83.63. Some bullish patterns, including ascending triangles, suggest a possible move to $136 if volume increases. If it can reclaim the $98 level, a sharper rise may follow. Aside from charts, the talk around a possible Litecoin spot ETF is building up. Analysts see a 68% chance of approval in 2025, which could align LTC with Bitcoin on institutional access. Longer-term outlooks mention a possible jump to $500 by year-end, depending on the wider market. Thanks to its established track record and improving chart structure, Litecoin still earns a spot among the top cryptos to buy this month. Final Take! These crypto picks are backed by fresh events and data. BlockDAG’s crypto presale is still open, but the pricing gap won’t last once higher batches sell out. Avalanche’s partnership with Filecoin and use by government bodies shows lasting promise. Sui is repairing fast and drawing ETF-related attention. Litecoin has patterns and potential approval news that suggest bigger moves ahead. All four options fit different risk levels, from early-stage presales to more developed networks with strong signals. But what connects them is timing. Whether it’s BDAG’s upcoming GO LIVE reveal or Litecoin’s bullish trend, these are the top cryptos to buy this month before momentum carries them to new levels.

Two tokens garnering significant attention are Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ozak AI (OZ) . While SHIB aspires to reach $0.01, OZ aims for a $1 valuation. This analysis explores their respective potentials and the feasibility of achieving 100x gains in the coming year. Shiba Inu’s $0.01 Ambition Shiba Inu, a meme-inspired crypto, received large popularity in some point of the 2021 bull run, accomplishing an all-time high of $0.00008845. Currently buying and selling at approximately $0.00001295, SHIB might need to grow by 79,000% to hit the $0.01 mark. Achieving this may require a market capitalization of several trillion bucks, surpassing the modern-day total market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined. Efforts to bolster SHIB's value include the development of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain solution, and token burn mechanisms to reduce supply. However, analysts suggest that even with these initiatives, reaching $0.01 in 2025 is highly improbable without unprecedented market conditions and adoption rates. Ozak AI’s $1 Target Ozak AI is an emerging project that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to provide predictive analytics and data solutions. Currently in Ozak AI presale phase at $0.003, OZ has already raised over $1 million, indicating strong investor interest. Analysts believe that Ozak AI may want to realistically reach a price of $1 by 2025, representing a potential 300x return for early investors. This positive outlook is based totally on the project's revolutionary technique and the developing demand for AI-pushed solutions in the crypto area. Comparative Outlook: Stability vs. Exponential Growth Shiba Inu offers a greater set up presence in the crypto market, with a big community and ongoing improvement efforts. However, its path to $0.01 is fraught with substantial demanding situations, such as the want for massive market capitalization and sizable adoption. Ozak AI offers a high-risk, high-praise opportunity. Its low access price and progressive integration of AI and blockchain era function it as a potential breakout project in 2025. The possibility of accomplishing 100x or even 300x returns makes it an appealing option for traders inclined to embody better risk for substantial rewards. While Shiba Inu's goal of reaching $0.01 captures the imagination, the practical challenges make it a less likely candidate for 100x gains in 2025. Ozak AI, with its ambitious roadmap and strong early-stage momentum, offers a more plausible path to significant returns. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions in these volatile markets. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto enthusiasts and businesses make the correct decisions.

This move, initially reported by Times Tabloid , has drawn global attention as it signals deepening institutional and sovereign interest in the digital asset space. According to the latest official announcement by VivoPower International PLC on its X account, the prince’s acquisition will happen through a strategic partnership with BitGo, one of the world’s leading digital asset custody providers. This collaboration ensures that the prince’s ambitious entry into XRP is securely handled, leveraging BitGo’s world-class infrastructure and treasury solutions. BitGo @BitGo Enters Strategic Partnership with VivoPower $VVPR to Facilitate its Initial US$100 Million XRP Acquisition for Treasury Strategy 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗 https://t.co/wi4KosTMH0 pic.twitter.com/Tmm3OArx5E — VivoPower (@Vivo_Power) June 2, 2025 BitGo’s Pivotal Role in Facilitating the Investment BitGo’s reputation in the digital asset space cannot be overstated. As a global leader in digital asset custody, BitGo brings multi-signature security, regulatory compliance, and advanced treasury management capabilities, which are crucial for institutional investors. The platform processes more than $1 billion in transactions monthly and is particularly geared toward helping institutional clients integrate crypto into traditional financial operations securely. By partnering with VivoPower, BitGo has effectively provided the operational backbone to facilitate the prince’s $100 million XRP acquisition. This collaboration marks a vital moment not only for the involved parties but also for the broader crypto market, demonstrating how institutional-grade custodianship can enable sovereign and high-net-worth investors to navigate the crypto industry. VivoPower’s Expanding Crypto-Focused Treasury Strategy VivoPower has been steadily advancing its digital asset strategy over the past year. Through its subsidiary, Tembo e-LV, the company has already made headlines by announcing that it would accept payments in Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) for its electric vehicles. This progressive step reflects VivoPower’s belief in digital currencies as both a medium of exchange and a treasury reserve asset. In its public statement, VivoPower emphasized that the prince’s XRP acquisition aligns with its broader treasury strategy : holding portions of reserves in digital assets while applying prudent market assessments and risk controls. This approach is designed to enhance the company’s financial flexibility and capture the potential upside in the fast-growing crypto sector. Ripple’s Growing Global Footprint The prince’s investment in XRP arrives at a time when Ripple, the company behind XRP, is rapidly expanding its global presence. Ripple has established numerous partnerships with financial institutions, payment providers, and fintech hubs worldwide to push the adoption of blockchain-based solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Notably, Ripple recently announced a collaboration with South Korea’s BDACS to strengthen institutional custody services for XRP and RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin. These global partnerships continue to strengthen XRP’s standing as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions, a role that significantly differentiates it from many other cryptocurrencies in the market. Institutional and Sovereign Confidence in XRP While retail investors have long been engaged with XRP, the entrance of sovereign players such as a Saudi royal into the ecosystem is a powerful endorsement. This investment signals growing confidence in XRP’s long-term utility, particularly for cross-border payments and liquidity management. Moreover, it suggests that sovereign wealth, family offices, and institutional treasuries are increasingly looking to diversify into digital assets, recognizing them not only as speculative instruments but as essential components of modern financial portfolios. A Landmark Moment for the Crypto Market The BitGo-VivoPower partnership facilitating this $100 million XRP acquisition by a Saudi prince marks a watershed moment in the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates how far the industry has matured, with sophisticated infrastructure now available to support even the most demanding investors. As digital assets continue to embed themselves into global financial frameworks, such high-profile investments are expected to accelerate, signaling a new era where cryptocurrencies like XRP are no longer fringe instruments but foundational components of modern treasury strategies.

45423677,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=739523,1748884225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45423677.jpeg,Meta is set to fully automate ad creation and targeting with AI,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/meta-wants-to-fully-automate-ad-creation/,"Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is gearing up to hand advertisers a fully automated, AI-powered advertising engine by the end of next year. The new suite of tools, first revealed by The Wall Street Journal, will allow brands to generate and precisely target entire ad campaigns simply by uploading a product image and specifying a budget. Meta will redefine its advertising services with this initiative By bypassing traditional creative, planning, and media-buying agencies, the move threatens to reshape the marketing services landscape and expand Meta’s already massive $160 billion annual ad business . Currently, Meta offers a range of AI features that let advertisers optimize and tweak existing creatives before they go live on Facebook and Instagram. The forthcoming enhancements, however, will create everything from static images and video clips to headline and body copy, then deploy them automatically to the most relevant audiences. Geotargeting capabilities will tailor offers, say, holiday packages, to users based on their likely travel interests and locations. Institutional investors reacted swiftly to the news. Shares of WPP, the world’s largest marketing services firm, slid about 3% in early trading. Paris-listed Publicis Groupe and Havas also saw declines of 3.9% and 3%, respectively, as markets digested the prospect of Meta encroaching on agencies’ fee pools. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has characterized the initiative as fundamentally redefining what “advertising” means in the digital age. In April, during Meta’s investor update, he unveiled plans to boost capital expenditures to between $64 billion and $72 billion in 2025, up from a previously announced ceiling of $65 billion, largely to underwrite the company’s AI infrastructure build-out. The announcement signals how central machine learning and automation are to Meta’s roadmap for revenue growth. Critics warn that automating creative production could dilute brand safety and erode creative control. While Google, OpenAI, and other technology players have rolled out their own image and video-generation platforms, marketers remain cautious, weighing concerns over quality, consistency, and compliance. Still, Meta’s commanding user base of 3.43 billion monthly active users across its flagship apps, gives it a unique advantage in delivering highly personalized ads at scale. What is the fate of agencies under Meta’s new AI tool? Meta’s executives insist the tools are designed to empower rather than eliminate agencies. Alex Schultz , Meta’s chief marketing officer and vice president of analytics, recently posted on LinkedIn that agencies will be “more important than ever” as AI handles routine tasks, freeing up human talent to focus on strategic creativity. He argued that smaller advertisers, those without the budget or expertise to retain agencies, stand to benefit most, as the platform will “level the playing field” for millions of small and mid-sized businesses. Under the new system, a local boutique could upload an image of its bestselling handbag, set a modest spend, and let the AI engine produce multiple ad variants, complete with tailored copy and targeting recommendations, across Facebook and Instagram. The system will then monitor performance, adjust bids, and reallocate budget dynamically to maximize return on ad spend, all without human intervention. Industry analysts say the technology could shave weeks off campaign production cycles and reduce costs. However, they caution that the long-term impact remains uncertain. Questions remain on whether brands will relinquish creative decision-making entirely to algorithms and how agencies will adapt to maintain relevance when clients can bypass them altogether. Other social platforms are racing to follow suit. Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit have been beefing up their own AI and machine-learning offerings to capture a slice of digital ad dollars in an increasingly competitive market. Yet it is Meta’s combination of scale, data depth, and capital resources that sets it apart. Zuckerberg has made clear that measurable, scalable AI solutions are the future of advertising. His vision of an “AI one-stop shop” aims to streamline the entire marketing workflow: define objectives, assign budgets, and leave the execution to Meta’s machine-learning models. If successful, the shift could both fortify the company’s advertising moat and redraw the boundaries of the global marketing services industry while the market awaits to see if agencies can reinvent themselves fast enough to thrive in the AI era.

Currently trading around $95.67, Litecoin has posted a weekly gain of 5.15% and recorded a notable 2.80% uptick in trading volume, suggesting revitalized interest among market participants. But does this short-term optimism signal a longer rally—or a temporary rebound? According to TronWeekly and analyst VipRoseTr, the breakout above the descending channel resistance on May 20 has put LTC in a new bullish light. The key target in the near term is around $120.95, which represents a potential 26% move from the breakout level. The breakout was paired with rising volume, a classical signal of confirmation. Yet the price has since entered a consolidation zone between $94 and $96, suggesting that market players are pausing to assess whether this momentum is sustainable. In terms of broader technical structure, Litecoin’s support sits near $92.65, while the next critical resistance lies around $150. Whether the asset can hold above its current consolidation band will likely determine if it moves toward the projected upside or slips back into range-bound movement. Either way, the Litecoin Price Prediction 2025 outlook is now being reevaluated in both conservative and bullish camps. Diverging Forecasts: Conservative Vs. Optimistic Views on LTC Market predictions for Litecoin’s 2025 price performance are significantly split. DigitalCoinPrice holds an optimistic view, projecting a climb past $211.56 by year-end, with the possibility of revisiting its all-time high at $412.96 if momentum continues to build. This outlook is supported by Litecoin’s increasing integration across payment gateways and its established role in peer-to-peer transactions. On the other hand, technical analysis by Changelly suggests a more restrained future. Their projected 2025 range sits between $80.20 and $87.31, with average trading levels around $94.41. This forecast implies a negative return on investment (approximately -8%), underscoring the risk that Litecoin may remain locked in a narrow trading band throughout the year. Much of this discrepancy stems from Litecoin’s perceived utility gap in a rapidly evolving Layer-1 and Layer-2 ecosystem. While LTC remains functional and time-tested, newer projects like Qubetics are bringing fresh utility to the table—especially in critical domains like wallet security, multi-chain interoperability, and real-world integration. Qubetics Redefines Wallet Infrastructure for a Multi-Chain Future As the crypto landscape matures, wallet architecture has become a focal point of innovation. Qubetics is leading this transformation through its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, an application that addresses cross-chain asset management, user sovereignty, and institutional security in one unified interface. Unlike traditional wallets that are often siloed to a single blockchain or require cumbersome bridging, Qubetics provides seamless interoperability across Ethereum, Solana, Arbitrum, and other leading chains. This allows users to store, transfer, and interact with assets from different ecosystems—all while maintaining full custody of their private keys. In an environment where bridges remain vulnerable to attacks and regulatory scrutiny is tightening, this kind of infrastructure is not just useful—it’s essential. The wallet is also deeply integrated into Qubetics’ broader platform, which includes tokenized assets, developer IDE tools, and data services. Its intuitive UX is designed for both retail and institutional users, featuring gas fee optimization, automated transaction routing, and native staking dashboards. With over 27,400 token holders already backing the protocol, Qubetics is carving out a crucial infrastructure niche that Litecoin has yet to explore. Qubetics Presale: The Numbers Behind the Momentum The Qubetics crypto presale i s not just a short-term opportunity—it’s a structured rollout with ROI projections that are catching attention even in a volatile market. Now in Stage 37, the $TICS token is priced at $0.3370, with each stage lasting just 7 days. Every Sunday at 12 AM, the token price jumps by 10%, creating consistent upward momentum. Over 514 million tokens have been sold so far, with more than 27,400 holders on board. Total raised? $17.6 million and counting. What makes the math interesting isn’t the stage count—it’s the possible outcomes. If someone enters with just $100 today, they’re looking at: $196.65 if $TICS hits $1 post-presale $1,483.25 at $5 $2,966.51 at $10 And a staggering $4,449.76 if it climbs to $15 after mainnet launch. The numbers aren’t speculative alone—they’re grounded in utility. As more developers onboard to use Qubetics’ non-custodial tools and users seek a safer, more agile alternative to fragmented wallet solutions, the protocol’s fundamentals are catching up with its valuation. In this context, Qubetics could eclipse more established coins not in innovation, but in sheer relevance. Conclusion: Will Litecoin Hit $210 or Be Outpaced by Infrastructure Leaders? The Litecoin Price Prediction 2025 narrative is currently at a crossroads. While recent technical patterns suggest a bullish reversal toward $120 and possibly higher, broader market forecasts still diverge widely. LTC’s role as a peer-to-peer payment coin remains solid, but in a market increasingly driven by cross-chain functionality and tokenization, its value proposition may be more limited than in past cycles. This is precisely where Qubetics excels. By focusing on next-generation wallet infrastructure, seamless interoperability, and community-scaled growth through its crypto presale, Qubetics may present a more forward-looking bet in 2025’s altcoin market. For those seeking more than just a rebound story, Qubetics offers a full-stack architecture built for what’s next—not just what’s already been.

45423718,https://cryptonews.com/?p=367226,1748884596,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45423718.jpeg,Strategy Doubles Down on Crypto with $75M Purchase of 705 Bitcoin,https://cryptonews.com/news/strategy-doubles-down-on-crypto-with-75m-purchase-of-705-bitcoin/,"Strategy, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, announced on Monday that the firm has purchased an additional 705 Bitcoin for approximately $75.1 million between May 26 and 30, reinforcing the company’s ongoing commitment to the cryptocurrency. Strategy has acquired 705 BTC for ~$75.1 million at ~$106,495 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.9% YTD 2025. As of 6/1/2025, we hodl 580,955 $BTC acquired for ~$40.68 billion at ~$70,023 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/K4tex3qHrN — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 2, 2025 This purchase was funded by proceeds from the company’s active at-the-market (ATM) offerings of its preferred stock classes, STRK and STRF. The purchase period spanned from May 26 to June 1, 2025, and marks another milestone in the company’s long-running Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm now holds a total of 580,955 BTC acquired for an aggregate purchase price of roughly $40.68 billion, representing an average purchase price of $70,023 per bitcoin. This latest buy reflects Strategy’s ongoing commitment to its Bitcoin-centric corporate treasury strategy, where excess capital, including proceeds from equity offerings, is consistently redeployed into the cryptocurrency. With this move, Strategy also disclosed a bitcoin yield of 16.9% year-to-date, reinforcing its position as the largest corporate holder of BTC globally. The timing of this acquisition, at a higher average price compared to its long-term cost basis, suggests that Strategy views Bitcoin’s recent rally as a sign of longer-term strength rather than a peak. ATM Programs Fuel Expansion During the same period, Strategy said it has made use of its ATM equity programs to raise funds for both operational and investment purposes. Between May 26 and June 1, the company raised a total of $74.6 million across its ATM programs: $36.2 million from the sale of 353,511 STRK shares and $38.4 million from the sale of 374,968 STRF shares. These preferred stock instruments, each carrying attractive dividend yields of 8.00% and 10.00% respectively, were established earlier this year and have already shown strong traction in the market. As of June 1, there remains substantial capacity within these programs for future issuance—$20.68 billion for STRK and $2.05 billion for STRF—indicating Strategy’s intent to continue leveraging these instruments for growth and BTC accumulation. The company also declared quarterly cash dividends on both series of preferred shares, with STRK shareholders receiving $2.00 per share and STRF shareholders receiving approximately $2.64 per share. These payments are scheduled for June 30, 2025, to shareholders of record as of June 15. The dividend on the STRF shares includes an accrual from the issuance date of March 25, further underlining the firm’s attention to maintaining shareholder value alongside its bitcoin-centric strategy. K33 Says Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks K33 Research reports that Strategy appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week—down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. “The pace of ATM utilization is notably slower than the first round,” Lunde noted. Between early November and mid-December, Strategy raised an average of $2.13 billion weekly. In contrast, recent averages have dropped to $788 million.

In this case, prominent online analyst TradingShot pointed out that Bitcoin nearly touched its four-hour 200-period moving average ( MA ) on Saturday, a critical support level since April 16. In a June 2 TradingView post , TradingShot noted that after testing this level, BTC immediately rebounded. While the bullish reaction has been moderate since price action remains capped below the four-hour 50-period MA, there are compelling reasons to expect an imminent breakout. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Specifically, the formation of a blue Arc pattern over the past three weeks mirrors the price behavior seen during previous peaks and pullbacks since Bitcoin’s early April bottom. These Arc patterns have historically signaled significant upward momentum once the price breaks above resistance. Adding to the bullish case, the four-hour Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) dipped into oversold territory for the first time since April 7. This condition suggests Bitcoin may be primed for a sharp reversal as buyers capitalize on discounted prices. Bitcoin’s next price target Even the weakest rally of this long-term bullish leg has seen gains of at least 16.06%. If the 4H MA200 continues to hold and Bitcoin breaks above the 4H MA50, TradingShot anticipates a minimum short-term rise of 16.06%, pushing BTC to approximately $120,000. As reported by Finbold, TradingShot previously suggested that historical price movements indicate that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by late 2025. Meanwhile, pseudonymous analyst El_crypto_prof highlighted a familiar chart setup in an X post : a final small dip before a powerful surge. With BTC hovering above $104,000, he identified $102,000 as a prime entry point and $97,000 as the critical floor for this bullish scenario to unfold. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the project’s official account stated that while they’ve been “working closely with exchanges,” the process has required “a bit more time to finalise.” To show appreciation for early adopters, Bitcoin Pepe is now offering a 30% bonus to all current holders who participated in the presale phase. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 8:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies With the listing just two weeks away, excitement is building among investors who see the coin as one of 2025’s most promising meme tokens. The announcement follows a highly successful presale, during which Bitcoin Pepe raised over $13 million, signaling strong early investor confidence in the project’s potential. Why CEX Listings matter for Bitcoin Pepe A centralized exchange (CEX) listing is a major milestone for any crypto project, and for Bitcoin Pepe, it could be the spark that launches the coin into the mainstream. CEX listings provide increased liquidity, visibility, and accessibility, opening the door to a wider audience beyond the DeFi-savvy crowd. Most retail investors still rely on centralized platforms to purchase crypto, meaning that listing on a top-tier exchange could significantly boost trading volume and market awareness. The June 17 listing could mark the moment Bitcoin Pepe transitions from meme coin cult favorite to broader market contender. What makes Bitcoin Pepe an attractive pick for 2025 While meme coins are often associated with hype over substance, Bitcoin Pepe is trying to stand out by building a strong community and capitalizing on broader market tailwinds. Its branding, merging the internet’s beloved Pepe character with the gravitas of Bitcoin, has struck a chord with a new generation of crypto investors looking for high-upside plays with viral potential. Add to that the fact that the crypto market is heating up again. With the Federal Reserve expected to resume cutting interest rates in the second half of 2025, and Bitcoin itself pushing toward new highs after months of consolidation, the macro environment is turning bullish. If Bitcoin rallies, it tends to lift the entire market, and meme coins, often the most speculative of all assets, typically see explosive gains during these phases. What could drive future demand for Bitcoin Pepe Bitcoin Pepe isn’t just another meme coin – it’s the world’s only Bitcoin meme ICO, aiming to merge viral internet culture with serious blockchain innovation. The project is building Solana on Bitcoin, introducing a Meme Layer-2 that features instant transactions, ultra-low fees, and a new PEP-20 token standard to support scalable, fun applications on the Bitcoin network – all of which could further improve its demand and lead to a higher price target moving forward.

As ADA coin momentum slows, some market players are shifting their focus toward emerging projects with practical utility. One notable move comes from a Morgan Stanley trader who has reportedly bet $750,000 on Unilabs (UNIL). As attention shifts towards this rising PassiveFi token, market experts believe it could outpace Cardano in 2025. Cardano Price Dips, Raising Investor Caution The Cardano price performance over the past month has left investors questioning its potential. At the time of writing, the ADA coin’s price has slipped 6.36% to trade at $0.65. Source: TradingView According to TradingView, the Cardano price has declined steadily from highs near $0.85 to lows around $0.66, representing a significant downward correction. The token’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering around 25.49, suggesting the ADA coin is in deeply oversold territory. The Cardano price decline can also be due to the shift in sentiment among ADA holders. Cardano has long been known for its research-driven development, but this price slump has led some institutional players to look elsewhere for higher potential returns. One such example is a Morgan Stanley trader who recently moved $750,000 away from the ADA coin and into a fast-rising project: Unilabs (UNIL). While Cardano promotes long-term change through its proof-of-stake blockchain, much of its impact remains theoretical. Unilabs, on the other hand, redefines investing by offering AI-powered portfolio automation and early access to high potential crypto assets, all designed for hands-free investing. Unilabs (UNIL): Simplifying Crypto Trading with AI-Powered Tools Emerging as a powerhouse in the DeFi sector, Unilabs offers real utility backed by AI and data. The platform aims to simplify trading for investors by providing smart investing tools and access to early stage investments, no matter the size of their portfolio. Here are some of the features of Unilabs: 1. AI Market Pulse This tool utilizes artificial intelligence to monitor crypto trends, market shifts, and opportunities. With just a few clicks, users can monitor token price movements, including Cardano price performance, to automatically rebalance their portfolios and maximize potential returns. 2. Memecoin Identification Tool Recognizing the rising sentiment surrounding memecoins, Unilabs offers a tool to identify high ROI meme tokens early. This identification tracks liquidity metrics, listing prospects, and virality to find gems other than traditional tokens like ADA coin. 3. Passive Income Unilabs offers several passive income opportunities, including a stablecoin savings account that ties users’ funds to stablecoins like USDT and DAI. These funds are invested in secure and high yield opportunities, helping investors earn without worrying about market volatility. 4. Staking Rewards UNIL holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards with an estimated APY of 122%. On top of that, UNIL redistributes 30% of all platform fees to UNIL holders through its five-tier rewards system. Unilabs Builds Hype While ADA Coin Falters While the Cardano price has struggled to maintain bullish momentum, UNIL is gaining traction due to its strong narrative around artificial intelligence and risk-managed exposure to digital assets. The project’s ongoing ICO has raised over $1.8 million selling each UNIL token at $0.0051. Unilabs is already halfway through its second presale stage, with investors having purchased over 384 million UNIL tokens. As the stage progresses, the price of UNIL is expected to rise in the next round. Unilabs continues to draw strong interest from market participants including a Morgan Stanley trader who bet $750,000 on the UNIL token over Cardano. Market experts predict that this PassiveFi token has the potential to surpass the ADA coin. If Unilabs reaches just 10% of Cardano’s current market cap, the UNIL token could climb from $0.0051 to about $0.13, representing over 2,400% increase. As the ADA price continues to slip, Unilabs is on track to become the best altcoin in 2025. Conclusion The Cardano price continues to struggle with declines, causing investors to seek the next growth alternative. With experts projecting massive gains, traders are accumulating UNIL tokens as the ADA coin continues to face uncertainty. Investors seeking significant returns should consider buying the UNIL token at its low entry price before the next price increase.

M2: Abra CEO Sees $130,000 As Liquidity Floods In",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-vs-m2-abra-ceo-130000/,"Bill Barhydt, the founder and chief executive of crypto-banking platform Abra, set Crypto-X alight over the weekend by reposting a collage of global M2-versus-Bitcoin charts first popularised by macro investor Raoul Pal and researcher Julien Bittel. “I’ve seen over a dozen posts with different versions of the global liquidity M2 vs Bitcoin price chart – I’ve attached several here. Credit @RaoulGMI and his colleague @BittelJulien for discovering the trend,” he wrote. “Most of these charts predict a dip over the coming days to around $100 k and then a move to new ATH of $130 k in August/September … Or this could all be horseshit. Whatever.” Will Bitcoin Follow M2? Expanding on the macro backdrop, Barhydt argued that “global liquidity needs to rise significantly in the coming months. Bitcoin remains the mother of all liquidity (re: debasement) sponges.” He framed the asset’s reflexivity in stark terms: as fiat supply grows, Bitcoin absorbs the monetary excess, and the resulting gains “will most likely spill over into other L1 platforms and then ultimately speculative alts – the proverbial alt season.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Tipped For $340,000 Target If This Support Level Holds – Details Even so, he cautioned traders against complacency. “Watch your leverage, touch grass and please please be civil,” Barhydt advised, noting that the anticipated pull-back could be a gentle pause or a swift capitulation toward $95,000 before any summer rally materialises. When a follower fretted that the model might already be overcrowded, Barhydt dismissed the idea that positioning had reached critical mass: “I’ve thought about that but we’re talking about trillions of dollars and billions of people. There might be thousands of people focused on this but not more. Even then retail writ large isn’t focused on crypto right now.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming A second critic complained that the liquidity data “is not collected on a timeframe that would predict daily moves.” Barhydt concurred, replying: “I completely agree. Hence the ‘whatever’ reference. It’s macro directional on a weekly scale at best. But in that regard it’s been a very good tool.” The liquidity-first thesis still has heavyweight backers. Pal recently told Real Vision subscribers that “liquidity is the single most important driver of all asset prices,” estimating that rising world-money supply accounts for up to 90% of Bitcoin price action, while Bittel’s latest update pegs global M2 near a record $111 trillion – a level he says leaves Bitcoin “still going higher.” Whether those macro tailwinds propel Bitcoin to the $130,000 target or prove, in Barhydt’s own words, to be “horseshit” will depend on how briskly central banks resume balance-sheet expansion and how aggressively traders deploy leverage in the weeks ahead. For now, Barhydt’s call serves as both roadmap and reality check: the next swing could be explosive, but the model is only as good as the liquidity it tracks. At press time, BTC traded at $104,625.

Many people did not expect Garlinghouse to support Bitcoin and its community because he strongly criticized its flaws for years. Because he changed his opinion, people are now questioning whether he is genuine or if his moves are just for political and industry support, especially now when cryptocurrency is under pressure from governments and traditional banks. While some believe he wants to unify the crypto world to push back against tight regulations and a banking system that still controls most global finance, others worry that he might be giving in to Bitcoin maximalists. Whatever the reason, Garlinghouse’s new message is bold, and it could reshape how people view Ripple and XRP in the larger crypto conversation. Ripple and Bitcoin communities have long clashed Ripple and Bitcoin supporters have disagreed on what makes a good cryptocurrency for over a decade. The XRP community has long said Bitcoin still depends on proof-of-work mining that consumes large amounts of electricity and handles fewer transactions per second, while their token solves real-world problems by being faster, more scalable, and far more energy-efficient. Garlinghouse described Bitcoin’s mining model as outdated and harmful to the environment, and he has repeatedly said XRP is better suited for building a real, usable financial system on the blockchain. On the other hand, Bitcoin maximalists claim XRP is centralized, controlled by Ripple Labs, and serves banks instead of empowering individuals. They call the token a “banker coin” and say it goes against the original vision of crypto, which was meant to remove middlemen, not work with them. Maxis also points to the long legal battle with the SEC as proof that XRP isn’t a trustworthy or decentralized cryptocurrency. Ripple’s peace gift to Bitcoin supporters stirs mixed reactions Brad Garlinghouse donated the Skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community days before the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference began. Some people praised the move as a way of acknowledging past conflicts while signaling a new willingness to collaborate. At the same time, some Bitcoin maximalists saw it as a sign that Ripple and its supporters finally recognized Bitcoin’s dominance. Others said the peace offering showed that XRP needed Bitcoin more to succeed in cryptocurrency. In one post, a user said, “Ripple tried to replace Bitcoin for 10 years. Now they’re offering us skulls like it’s ancient Rome.” Another viral tweet said, “When you lose the war, at least bring a gift.” However, XRP loyalists had mixed reactions because some interpreted the move as a sign that Ripple was rising above petty arguments and positioning itself as a unifier in the industry. In contrast, others worried that the gesture made Ripple look weak. Garlinghouse makes a risky but strategic move Brad Garlinghouse’s new tone toward Bitcoin could be a carefully calculated strategy that allows him to build stronger alliances as the US government and financial regulators scrutinize digital assets. He may also want to prepare Ripple for upcoming discussions with financial institutions and governments that want to integrate blockchain technology on condition that they see signs of stability and professionalism. However, critics argue that Garlinghouse might be extending a hand that won’t be accepted, making his gestures look like weakness instead of strength. The biggest risk is within Ripple because the brand has always positioned XRP as an efficient, scalable, and low-cost alternative to Bitcoin, and its supporters stood proudly against what they saw as Bitcoin’s flaws. Garlinghouse’s latest message muddies the line between rival and partner, and a growing number of XRP fans feel like the company is gradually retreating from the principles that made it unique, which muddles and frustrates its base. Supporters who once believed XRP would overtake or replace Bitcoin may now wonder if the goal has changed and Ripple could lose its loyal following by trying to appeal to both sides.",OP-ED|Bitcoin|Ripple,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-02 17:30:52

Built on LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token standard, XAUt0 offers users interoperable, on-chain access to physical gold stored in Swiss vaults, according to a press release on the matter. The first deployment of XAUt0 will occur on The Open Network ( TON ),the blockchain closely integrated with the Telegram messaging app. This integration will make gold-backed tokens instantly accessible to hundreds of millions of Telegram users through the in-app Wallet, marking a major leap in real-world asset accessibility within social platforms. The rollout is expected to bring tokenized gold to Telegram’s massive user base, enhancing liquidity and accessibility for both retail and institutional participants. Each XAUt0 token represents one troy ounce of physical gold meeting the “London Good Delivery” standards.

The token retains the same backing as Tether Gold ( XAUt ), which launched in 2020, but with the added ability to move freely across chains. The omnichain nature of XAUt0 allows users to engage in decentralized finance activities, such as lending and arbitrage, while holding an inflation-resistant asset. It also brings benefits like 24/7 trading, fractional ownership, and digital self-custody without compromising the security of underlying physical reserves. The launch mirrors a broader push to tokenize real-world assets and provide programmable, borderless access to traditional stores of value like gold. “XAUt0 brings a timeless asset into the decentralized ecosystem,” said Lorenzo R., co-founder of USDT0 and Everdawn Labs. With gold trading near all-time highs, Tether is positioning XAUt0 as a modern, blockchain-native alternative for gold investment—combining the historical stability of commodities with the flexibility of digital finance.

Meanwhile, a small leveraged ETF tied to the stock, Defiance Daily Target 2x Short MSTR ETF (SMST), has plummeted to a record low of $29, marking an 82% decline from its January levels. The ETF holds over $42 million in assets. SMST vs MSTR vs Bitcoin | Source: SeekingAlpha This sharp underperformance is due to SMST’s design: it seeks -2x the daily percentage change of Strategy stock (MSTR). In other words, it is structured to rise when Strategy stock falls—and to decline when the stock is in an uptrend. You might also like: Strategy stock price moves into a correction: will it rebound? For example, on Monday, June 2, MSTR stock rose 1.30%, while SMST dropped 2.50%. Other leveraged MSTR ETFs have also lagged behind its stock this year. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF has dropped by 4.5% while the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF has also dropped by 6.4% this year. These funds have struggled largely because Strategy stock has declined more than 12% from its highest level this year, despite remaining up year-to-date. Inverse leveraged ETFs like SMST are risky Historically, leveraged inverse ETFs underperform their benchmark assets. For example, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF or SQQQ has crashed by 97% in the last five years. In contrast, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ or TQQQ has jumped by 242% in the same period. The SMST ETF will likely continue falling since analysts anticipate that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will do well in the long term. Ark Invest sees Bitcoin jumping to $2.4 million by 2030, while BlackRock expects that it will hit $700,000. If these estimates are correct, it means that Strategy stock will jump in the long term because the company holds almost 600,000 Bitcoins, a number that is increasing weekly. The other risk for SMST ETF is that it is highly expensive, with an expense ratio of 1.29%. In contrast, popular ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 and iShares S&P 500 charge just 0.03%. This means that a $10,000 invested in SMST will charge an annual fee of $129, while the S&P 500 funds charge just $3 a year.

According to data compiled by CryptoQuant, a total of 490.3 billion TRX was transferred during the month, equivalent to approximately $132.4 billion at the token’s current price of $0.27. Surge in Network Activity The latest milestone marks a significant increase from April 2025, when 362.92 billion TRX was transferred, showing a month-over-month growth of about 34%. The latest record depicts an increasing transactional activity on the Tron blockchain. CryptoQuant stated that the rise in volume indicates strong user engagement and continued network demand. TRX has performed significantly well in May, supported by strong on-chain fundamentals and price resilience. Data also showed that TRX exhibited a relatively stable and low-risk investment profile, attracting steady inflows. However, the past week witnessed increased selling pressure amid broader market turbulence driven by geopolitical tensions and shifting investor sentiment. This caused it to dip to $0.257 briefly. The altcoin has since recovered and is currently trading near $0.27. Despite this, Tron managed to overtake Cardano to become the ninth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with its market cap rising to nearly $26 billion while Cardano’s fell to $23 billion. Tron Dominates Stablecoin Activity Across Latin America and Africa Zooming out, the Tron network also recorded a significant surge in stablecoin activity, even surpassing Ethereum in terms of stablecoin volume. In fact, as per Artemis’ latest report , Tron has emerged as the most widely used blockchain for settling customer flows by value, followed by Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. In Latin America, Tron dominated stablecoin settlement, particularly in Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil, where it accounts for the bulk of transaction activity. In African markets, Tron and Ethereum share dominance, with the former emerging as the leading network in six out of ten countries analyzed, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mauritius, Morocco, and Seychelles.

Reveals the Secret of Its Success!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitwise-cio-speaks-highly-of-this-altcoin-reveals-the-secret-of-its-success/,"New statements came from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who stands out with his strong predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market. This time he talked about one of the largest altcoins, Ripple – XRP. On this point, Matt Hougan recently praised XRP and emphasized the strength of its community. Hougan stated that he believes XRP’s success can primarily be attributed to the strength of the community behind it. According to Hougan, who stated that he gave a keynote speech at the XRP Las Vegas event from his X account, the conference venue was filled with 1,000 people at 1:00 pm ET on Saturday. That number was impressive, according to Hougan, as early Saturday afternoon events tend to draw fewer people, but the XRP community showed its strength and filled the venue. The Bitwise CIO was asked about the key takeaways from the conference, to which Hougan responded by comparing Bitcoin and XRP. At this point, the Bitwise CIO stated that the XRP community is increasingly accepting that Bitcoin and XRP are not direct competitors, and that both XRP and Bitcoin serve different markets. “I think the XRP world has embraced the idea that BTC and XRP serve different markets and that BTC’s development will not disrupt XRP’s goals. But mostly, it's just the power of the community. That's a huge piece of success in crypto, and the community in XRP is strong.” Bitwise CIO previously predicted that if XRP manages to gain a significant foothold in sectors like payments and tokenization, its price could rise to around $30 after a decade. *This is not investment advice.

While ADA continues to make a name for itself with its 100 percent rise, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson made a bold prediction for Bitcoin (BTC). Hoskinson predicted at the recent Bitcoin Conference that Bitcoin could reach somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 in the coming years. Hoskinson also shared Cardano’s latest expectations for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, including plans to integrate XRP into its growing ecosystem. Noting that Bitcoin is a store of value from the strength of DeFi, he said the shift towards BTC is accelerating. Reiterating three long-standing and defining principles for Bitcoin, Hoskinson listed them as “all transactions must use only Bitcoin, fees must be paid in BTC, and returns must come only from Bitcoin.” Hoskinson said that these rules help protect Bitcoin’s identity but make DeFi integration extremely difficult, and that’s where Cardano comes in. At this point, Hoskinson stated that they have developed the technology to enable DeFi integration and connect BTC and DeFi without changing the essence and identity of Bitcoin. Charles Hoskinson also confirmed that Cardano is working to incorporate XRP into the DeFi ecosystem and wants to leverage XRP’s strong reputation for cross-border payments. Finally, Hoskinson added that this integration could help create a seamless, scalable multi-chain ecosystem where Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano can work together, increasing financial access and inclusivity around the world. *This is not investment advice.

For both crypto investors and ETF sponsors, the timing of bringing staking returns to Wall Street just got a whole lot murkier. Legal Hurdles: C-Corps, Cayman Subsidiaries, and ”Investment Company” Status SEC took aim at REX Shares and Osprey Funds, issuers of the first proposed Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs, on May 30. The agency questioned whether these funds structured as unusual C-corporations and using Cayman Islands subsidiaries are an ”investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The SEC said that the registration statements could be ”potentially misleading,” and the compliance of the funds with Rule 6c-11 (the ETF rule) is unchallenged. ETF analyst James Seyffart called the filings “a bunch of clever legal and regulatory workarounds,” but the SEC isn’t convinced. In a formal letter, the agency asked issuers to delay the launch until these concerns are resolved, warning that further steps could be taken to ensure compliance. “The SEC’s letter is a clear signal: staking ETFs aren’t getting a free pass. Expect more delays and more legal wrangling,” tweeted @JSeyff. The Staking Dilemma: Yield, Slashing, and Securities Law At the heart of the SEC's concern is whether staking rewards qualify these ETFs as securities. Although the SEC separated earlier this year that protocol staking itself is not a securities transaction, the SEC is worried about the disclosure, distribution, and risk management of staking yields within a fund structure. Among key concerns are: How ETFs disclose staking rewards, and can they guarantee periodic returns? What if staked assets are punished for validator abuse of power? Are investors safeguarded? Staked ETH and SOL tend to have lock-ups, making day-to-day ETF redemptions difficult. Offshore structures for managing staking may avoid US regulations, further providing cause for concern. Legal experts inform us that the SEC's focus on these areas is not unexpected. ”The agency is ensuring that retail investors understand the risks of staking — especially slashing and variable yields,” said securities attorney Lisa Bragg. ”If disclosures are not as clear as a crystal ball, the SEC will keep these ETFs in cold storage.” Issuers Hurry to Update Filings Despite the regulatory chill, REX and Osprey are hopeful. General counsel Greg Collett told Bloomberg, ”We think we can bring the SEC on board on the investment company question, and we're not going to bring the funds to market until we do.” Issuers will likely resubmit their filings, improve risk disclosures, and disclose the treatment of staking rewards and penalties. “Even if the SEC doesn’t allow this structure, more straightforward attempts to allow staking in a US ETF will ultimately be successful. It’s a matter of when, not if,” Seyffart told Cointelegraph. What's Next? The Race to Launch At this point, the race to launch the first US staking ETF is on. Expect the SEC's pushback to prove temporary, and a more conventional fund structure—perhaps with even stronger risk management will ultimately find approval. Others warn that until the SEC is appeased on cutting, yield, and legal classification, staking ETFs will find themselves trapped in regulatory purgatory.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-02 17:47:11

Criminals are using delivery trucks to access secure areas without being challenged. High-value crypto holders face rising physical extortion risks globally. On May 31, Paris prosecutors charged 25 suspects in a string of crypto-linked abductions, including a foiled kidnapping attempt targeting Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat’s family. The cases, marked by severed fingers and €7M ransom demands, reveal a brutal new front in crypto crime. At least three high-profile abduction plots have been disrupted since May, all targeting French crypto executives or their relatives. Prosecutors warn that the tactics, which include physical mutilation, reflect an escalating threat to digital asset holders. NEW: France Charges 25 Suspects in Connection to Crypto Abduction Cases According to the report, the suspects are all ages 16-23, including 6 minors charged.

In a bold daylight attack near a school, the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of crypto firm Paymium, were nearly kidnapped by assailants posing as delivery drivers. The attackers used a van marked with the branding of French courier delivery service Chronopost to blend in. The attempt failed due to the intervention of a bystander and the victim’s companion. @Valeurs | Ce mardi matin, deux personnes proches de l'univers de la cryptomonnaie ont fait l’objet d’une tentative d’enlèvement en plein Paris.

Prosecutors also pointed to other failed crypto kidnapping plots, including a prior attempt on the same targets the day before. This also included a disrupted scheme near Nantes just last week. So far, 18 suspects have been placed in pre-trial detention. Three have requested to delay their court hearings, and four others are under judicial supervision, which requires them to follow strict rules while awaiting trial. France has witnessed a disturbing rise in such incidents, and recent headlines reflect the scope of the problem. On May 1, the father of a young online poker player, who had earned millions through crypto trading and live streaming, was kidnapped in Paris’s 14th arrondissement. Four attackers disguised as UPS delivery workers used a stolen van to abduct the victim. A ransom of €5–€7 million was demanded via wire transfer. To coerce the son into transferring the requested sum, they severed one of the victim’s fingers and recorded the act. The victim was later rescued in Palaiseau during a coordinated police operation. Another similar case was reported in January. David Balland, co-founder of the crypto hardware company Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in the Cher region of France. The attackers reportedly severed one of Balland’s fingers and recorded the brutal act. They then sent the video to his business partner, Eric Larchevêque, along with a ransom demand. According to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau, the kidnappers requested payment in cryptocurrency and managed to collect part of the ransom.

They are now part of a growing criminal playbook targeting high-profile figures in the digital finance sector. As crypto assets gain value and visibility, so does the risk for those who own them. Global Hotspots Where Crypto Kidnappings Are Surging France may be in the spotlight, but it’s far from the only country facing this trend. Crypto kidnappings are on the rise worldwide. From South America to North America, Europe to Asia, criminals target digital asset holders with alarming boldness. In the U.S., two NYPD officers were placed on modified duty last week . Investigators are examining their possible involvement in a crypto kidnapping case involving an Italian national in Manhattan.

On May 23, a young Russian couple was kidnapped in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They were held until a $43,000 Bitcoin ransom was paid . They were later released. Meanwhile, the U.S. charged six men in February linked to the October 2024 kidnapping of four Chicago residents. The victims were forced to transfer $15 million in crypto . Just a month before that, a UK court sentenced seven gang members to lengthy prison terms for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor . The operation was an attempt to extort digital assets. One of the most high-profile cases in Canada involved WonderFi CEO Dean Skurka. He was kidnapped during rush hour in Toronto in November 2024 and released after reportedly paying a $1 million ransom . Crypto abductions have cracked the safety net of digital finance. They show that the risks of holding valuable digital assets extend beyond phishing emails and password theft. They can reach into homes and families, threatening personal safety. Governments are intensifying their fight through cross-border investigations, tighter regulations, and advanced technology tracking. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How are criminals identifying crypto targets? Some scour social media for targets. Others leverage data from hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, such as the latest Coinbase data dump on the darknet. Why aren’t crypto abductions prosecuted as terrorism? These kidnappers aren’t political. They’re part of profit-driven crime rings, hunting crypto wealth through brutal but businesslike schemes.

Ripple (XRP) leads the pack with renewed investor confidence following regulatory clarity and expanding global partnerships. Dogecoin (DOGE), once regarded as speculative, now emerges as an unlikely stalwart, held together by an engaged community and growing real-world uses. While leading coins dominate crypto news today, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a new crypto token with game-changing DeFi might and growing presale demand. With crypto prices today reflecting a broader market recover`y, investors scanning for the best crypto to buy now or the next big cryptocurrency are watching these three closely. Whether you’re investing in crypto long-term or exploring short-term trends, XRP, DOGE, and MUTM represent a balance of legacy strength and emerging upside, a rare combination in today’s volatile market. XRP and Dogecoin Lead June 2025’s Top Crypto Picks XRP is trading at $2.21, indicating a strong bounce fueled by Ripple recently launching its stablecoin, RLUSD. Analysts anticipate XRP to reach between $5 and $7 in the first half of 2025, fueled by increased adoption and regulatory easing. Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.206, with anticipation of reaching $0.38 by July, depending on fanbase support and potential ETF news. These two cryptos are among the best cryptos to invest in right now, with very good investment prospects. New altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also gaining traction as potential high-growth investment opportunities within the emerging cryptocurrency market. Phase 4 Sold Out, MUTM’s Ascent Is Only Beginning The Mutuum Finance presale is in phase 5 with Phase 4 totally sold out. The tokens are available at $0.03, and listing for $0.06. Early investors are looking at up to 100% potential returns when MUTM goes live. MUTM is rapidly taking center stage, with over $9.7 million raised and attracting more than 11,500 investors. The token price will rise to $0.035 in the next phase, providing current participants with a 16.67% profit. A Smarter DeFi Model: Hybrid Lending for a New Era Mutuum Finance stands out through its dual approach to crypto lending, which integrates Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) allows users to put stablecoins like USDT into smart contract liquidity pools and automatically earn passive income. In contrast, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) allows lenders and borrowers to communicate directly without intermediaries, with the ability to adjust loan terms and privacy advantages. This is a hybrid solution that provides more decentralization and flexibility but at the same time has strong yield opportunities, while liquidity providers receive over 10% today in passive return. Trust and Transparency Delivered: Stablecoin and Completed Certik Audit Mutuum Finance is not only innovating, it is establishing trust. The platform’s open-source smart contracts have undergone a rigorous, officially completed audit by Certik. In addition to the native token, Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin that is engineered to steer clear of pitfalls that have toppled algorithmic stablecoins. Security and transparency are always primary pillars of the ecosystem. June 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal month for crypto investors, with Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leading the charge. XRP is gaining strength with a stablecoin launch and bullish price forecasts reaching up to $7, while DOGE’s growing utility and strong community support continue to surprise skeptics. However, it’s Mutuum Finance that may offer the most asymmetric upside. With over $9.7 million raised, more than 11,500 investors onboard, a confirmed Certik audit, and a token price still at just $0.03, MUTM presents an opportunity for early backers to secure up to 100% ROI before the $0.06 listing. With DeFi innovation, a hybrid lending model, and a stablecoin in development, Mutuum Finance stands out as the top emerging altcoin to buy now. Learn more and join the presale.

The new asset will run on TON with the ticker XAUt0, offering exposure to gold in a convenient on-chain form. Tether’s gold-backed token is the next asset to benefit from the long-running partnership with TON. The chain is one of the few to carry a native version of USDT, offering convenience and liquidity.

The TON version will represent the same ownership of one troy ounce of gold, certified by the London Bullion Market Association. The on-chain asset will also differ from other forms of simple tokenized gold present on a single chain. The new standard for XAUt0 tokens will run on LayerZero’s Omnichain standard. This will allow users to move tokens seamlessly between chains, ensuring full 1:1 backing and no price disparities. Tether’s gold token currently has its largest markets on Bybit and HTX, with volumes ranging between $3M and $6M daily. The asset has relatively low activity due to its high price but has reflected the demand on spot gold markets. The launch arrived at a time when spot gold traded at $3,379.99, up 39.95% for the past year. Tether’s gold token XAUT taps demand for tokenized precious metals The original XAUT tokens by Tether first appeared in 2020, in time to tap one of the significant rallies of physical gold. The tokens allow for fractional ownership as well as physical delivery to a Swiss address. TON already carries over 928M USDT tokens, retaining its native usage ahead of other L1 and L2 chains. The addition of tokenized gold boosts the chain’s total value locked and may increase trading opportunities. Tether’s XAUT climbed relentlessly in the past year, tracking the growing demand for anti-inflationary assets. | Source: Coingecko The addition arrives as Telegram’s network aims to become more compliant and tap the US investor market. The XAUt0 coins and tokens are transferable to other chains, with automated mint and burn during bridging. The assets can also be used as DeFi collateral or held as exposure to spot gold. For now, gold-backed tokens remain pseudonymous and borderless, though the physical gold may be subject to limitations. XAUT is backed by 7.7 tons of physical gold, based on Tether’s latest attestation. Tokenized precious metals total about $2.1B for various types of assets. Tokenized gold aims to resemble the crypto ethos for hard money while also tapping the recent speculative interest in gold.

Click here to find out more » By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) began Monday’s European session by staging a mild rebound at $105,500, after last week’s 5.5% drop from $109,000 to $103,200. That retracement pulled the price below the 0.786 Fibonacci level of the rally that ended at the all-time high of $112,000, signalling profit-taking into month-end. Despite the late-May weakness, Bitcoin still closed the month with an 11% gain, building on April’s 14% rise. That two-month strength suggests the broader bullish structure is still valid, but recent developments now place heavy emphasis on reclaiming critical resistance zones to sustain upward momentum. BTC price dynamics (April - May 2025). Source: TradingView The price rebounded from $103,200 over the weekend, reclaiming the 0.786 Fibonacci level. But today’s Asian session selloff found resistance near $105,800, a level that coincides with both the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, commonly known as the golden ratio, and the 100 EMA on the 4-hour chart. This confluence marks the most immediate barrier for bulls. Bitcoin rally depends on clearing $106,000 and invalidating the EMA death cross As the European session opens, Bitcoin attempts another retest of this resistance zone. But the upside remains constrained by the bearish crossover structure on the 4-hour chart, where the 20 EMA crossed below both the 50 and 100 EMA following last week’s slide. Although the 20 EMA has been reclaimed at $105,350, the 50 EMA at $106,000 is the next hurdle before further upside can be considered. Momentum also reflects indecision. The RSI holds around 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This supports the idea of a key inflection point, where the next move will depend on whether price breaks above the golden ratio or slips back toward support. If bulls fail to reclaim the $106,000 to $107,000 resistance band, downside could revisit the previous week’s low at $103,200. A break above $107,000, however, would likely confirm a broader bullish continuation for early June. Bitcoin price dropped to $104,750 and tested the key Fibonacci zone before rebounding . A death cross on the 4-hour chart increased the risk of further decline.

A Bitcoin price technical analysis deep dive,https://crypto.news/is-the-crypto-bull-run-still-alive-a-bitcoin-price-technical-analysis-deep-dive/,"Bitcoin’s recent pullback has sparked debate: is the bullish trend still intact, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? With price currently trading above a key channel low and the 200-day moving average, this zone may represent the foundation for the next leg higher—toward $116,000. After tapping a new all-time high around $111,900, Bitcoin ( BTC ) entered a corrective phase, pulling back toward high-timeframe support at $104,300. This zone marks the bottom boundary of the bullish channel that has contained price action for months. Rejections from the channel high often lead to retests of the channel low, which is precisely what has occurred. Price is now hovering just above the 200-day moving average, a level closely watched by institutional traders and a historically reliable marker of macro support. Key technical points Channel Low Support at $104,300 : Acts as the structural base for the current bullish trend; holding this level is crucial for any continuation to the upside. 200-Day Moving Average: Bitcoin is currently trading above this dynamic support, reinforcing bullish bias if it continues to hold. Trendline Resistance Above: A descending trendline acts as minor resistance. Breaking this would signify a structural shift and the start of a new bullish leg. Bullish Market Structure Since $74,000: Price continues to print higher highs and higher lows. As long as this pattern holds, the trend remains intact. “Power of Three” Accumulation Structure: Price appears to be forming an accumulation-manipulation-distribution phase. Reclaiming the channel confirms the bullish reversal. Failed Auction Possibility: If price reclaims the channel after manipulation, a failed auction scenario is confirmed, greatly increasing the odds of a move to $116,000. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a market context perspective, the rejection from the channel high and subsequent retracement toward the channel low are technically expected. Price inside a well-defined channel often oscillates between its boundaries before breaking in the dominant direction. The rejection at $111,900 aligned with the channel’s resistance, while the current stalling at $104,300 has already produced a strong bullish candle, signaling that buyers are defending this level. This type of impulsive bounce from support suggests a short-term sentiment shift. Structurally, Bitcoin is trading back within its established bullish channel, implying the previous breakout may have been an early expansion or overextension. The current retest can be seen as a healthy reset before continuation.

Historically, this level has acted as long-term support during major bull trends. A close and consolidation above it typically signals that the broader uptrend remains in place. As long as BTC holds this level, it projects long-term strength. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Beyond surface-level technicals, there is growing interest in a possible “Power of Three” pattern. This accumulation framework includes three phases: Accumulation – where price consolidates in a range Manipulation – where price breaks below key support, shaking out weak hands Distribution – a powerful rally following the fakeout In this context, the drop below the channel low may represent manipulation. A reclaim of the channel would confirm a failed auction, a classic deviation followed by strong continuation. If this pattern holds, the move to $116,000 could unfold rapidly, aligning with Fibonacci extensions and the measured move from the channel range. BTCUSDT (6H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s broader structure remains technically bullish. Since forming a major swing low at $74,000, the asset has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows. The current correction fits within that structure and could represent a new higher low. Only a clean break below $104,300 on high volume would challenge this thesis. You might also like: Blockchain firm BTCS Inc. buys 1,000 ETH via Crypto.com Volume remains telling. While it spiked during the drop, it has stayed elevated during the defense of $104,300, evidence that demand is present at support. Sustained buying pressure at this level could set the stage for the next upward rotation. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Bitcoin holds above $104,300 and remains above the 200-day moving average, the bullish market structure is intact. A reclaim of the channel followed by a break of trendline resistance would confirm the next bullish phase. Expect a rotation toward $111,900, followed by a measured extension toward $116,000. If this plays out, Bitcoin would validate the Power of Three structure and confirm that the recent breakdown was a deviation, fueling a failed auction rally toward new highs.

Solana 's futures contracts are set to debut shortly, attracting attention from traders. Meanwhile, Cardano hits a crucial resistance level, hinting at potential upward momentum. This article delves into which cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth in the coming days. Ethereum Price Dynamics: Short-Term Rally Meets Long-Term Correction Ethereum has shown vibrant price swings over the past month with a 35% increase, reflecting renewed buying interest in the market. However, the six-month perspective reveals a 31% decline, indicating ongoing challenges and caution among investors. Recent gains overshadow a backdrop of longer-term pressure that continues to influence sentiment. These fluctuations highlight an appetite for risk while underscoring unresolved issues stemming from market corrections. Current trading levels are between $1923 and $2962, with crucial resistance at $3395 and secondary resistance near $4434. Support is around $1319 and a second level at $280. The market shows mixed technical indicators. The Awesome Oscillator reads 208 and the Momentum Indicator slightly negative at -35. RSI at 54 hints at balanced strength, as bulls rally against bearish pressure. The lack of a clear uptrend suggests a market waiting for further catalysts. Traders may test resistance at $3395 for gains if the level holds, while a retrace could find support at $1319. Solana's Recent Gains Amid Long-term Downward Pressure Solana recorded a 5.19% gain over the last month while declining 33.55% over the past six months. A one-week drop of 11.34% highlights short-term volatility, with price movements reflecting quick shifts and modest rallies that could not overcome overarching downward pressure. This behavior shows that while there have been fluctuations, the overall trend remains bearish over a longer period. Currently trading between $136 and $182, SOL is confined within a tight range defined by key levels. Immediate support at $115.83 and resistance at $207.89 set clear boundaries. Indicators show bearish pressure, with a negative Awesome Oscillator at -4.80 and an RSI around 41.40, suggesting bears have more influence. Traders may approach the support area cautiously while watching for signs of upward strength to challenge resistance levels. The environment is mixed, providing opportunities within the established price zone. Cardano Price Outlook: Past Volatility Meets Key Support and Resistance Cardano experienced a modest decline of 2.72% over the past month alongside a steep half-year drop of 43.05%, complemented by a recent one-week fall of 10.53%. Historical price movements reveal a lack of sustained recovery despite fluctuations, keeping investor sentiment subdued. The market has shown noticeable volatility without clear signs of stabilization, with price action slowing from previous momentum. This data underscores persistent bearish pressure over the last six months, with recent dips amplifying concerns among traders. Currently, Cardano trades in a range between $0.597 and $0.819, facing clear resistance at $0.95 and a secondary barrier around $1.17. Support is evident near $0.50, with another safety net at $0.28. Bearish tendencies continue to dominate, as indicated by a summary recommendation of -0.35 and a moving average suggestion of -0.80. While oscillators display a slight lift at 0.09 and an RSI reading of 38.32 suggests oversold conditions, no clear trend is evident. Traders should monitor price behavior closely, as a bounce off support may signal a potential shift, while a breakdown could confirm further decline. Conclusion Ethereum is on the verge of a significant bullish breakout following its recent update. SOL futures are set to launch soon, generating heightened interest. ADA is approaching a pivotal resistance level, indicating potential price changes. The coming days could see notable movements in these cryptocurrencies.

Just 3.92 million votes supported the measure, while nearly 5 billion were cast in opposition. The idea was put forward in January by Ethan Peck, a bitcoin advocate who works as the bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive. Peck’s proposal called for Meta to move a portion of its $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. He argued that the tech giant should treat bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to weather monetary policy uncertainty. The campaign was not limited to Meta. Peck also targeted Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) with similar proposals, filed on behalf of the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). Microsoft shareholders recently voted against the plan. Amazon has not yet held a vote. Though Meta doesn’t hold crypto on its balance sheet, the company has dabbled in blockchain before. In 2019, it announced Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That effort collapsed in 2022 after regulatory backlash and internal struggles, rebranding briefly as Diem before being shut down. Meta’s broader crypto strategy remains unclear. While its metaverse ambitions prompted the 2021 rebrand from Facebook to Meta, the company has pulled back on that vision in recent months. Still, earlier this year, reports surfaced that Meta was exploring the use of stablecoins to manage payments across its family of apps.

This intriguing pattern leads to speculation about the possibility of an imminent bullish surge. The signs point towards an important phase that savvy investors should not overlook. Discover which digital assets are potentially primed for explosive growth and why now may be a pivotal moment. Litecoin's Price Behavior and Current Market Sentiment Over the last month, Litecoin 's price has remained relatively steady with a change of only -0.31%, yet this modest movement contrasts with a deeper 6-month decline of -33.14%. The coin also experienced a weekly drop of -8.205%. Data reveals a period of controlled activity before a pronounced downturn over the longer term. These shifts hint at a period of consolidation followed by bearish pressure weighing on the market. The gradual shift from stability to a steeper decline captures Litecoin’s evolving market sentiment over recent months. Current prices range from $76.52 to $102.42, with key support at $65.86 and secondary support at $39.95. Resistance levels are noted at $117.66 and further at $143.57. Bears dominate sentiment, as a negative momentum of -7.443 and an RSI of 41.63 indicate seller pressure remains influential. Limited signs of a clear upward trend suggest trading ideas should focus on testing lower bounds and monitoring whether the market holds the $65.86 support. Breaks above the $117.66 resistance may signal a shift in market control, while caution around these identified zones is advisable. Chainlink Price Overview: Monthly Dips Amid Six-Month Decline Last month showed a decline of around 5% alongside a weekly drop near 11%, while the coin deepened its six-month loss by over 40%. The price followed a bumpy path recently, reflecting overall softness in market sentiment. Data points indicated reduced momentum over time, highlighting that Chainlink faced notable downward pressure during the analyzed months, accompanied by significant short-term volatility. LINK current price stands between $12.14 and $16.89, with immediate support at $10.30 and resistance at $19.80. A secondary support near $5.55 and an additional resistance at $24.55 define the broader trading range. Indicators show mixed signals; the negative readings from the Awesome Oscillator suggest bears have been active. No clear trend emerges, allowing for trading ideas like buying near the support level of $10.30. Traders may consider entering and exiting tactically within these channels while monitoring for any changes in momentum. Conclusion Both LTC and LINK are showing patterns that have historically led to significant price increases. These indicators suggest that the final accumulation phase might be approaching. Investors could consider paying close attention as these coins may soon experience upward momentum. The present data offers a promising outlook for potential future gains.

But as CZ’s proposal stirs the pot, rival security teams are rolling out their own solutions — turning 2025 into a high-stakes arms race for DeFi’s future. CZ’s Vision: A Dark Pool DEX to Hide Big Trades On June 1, CZ traveled to X to ask why every order on a DEX must be public, especially in the upper echelon world of perpetuals where liquidations can be ”hunted” by competitors and bots. ”If you want to buy $1 billion of a coin, you typically wouldn't want other people to know about your order until it's complete,” he posted, citing a recent $100 million liquidation on Hyperliquid that most suspect was organized by opportunistic traders. CZ's answer: a dark pool DEX, in which liquidation points and trades are hidden until they are executed. He suggests that zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and encrypted order books be used to hide large trades from view — borrowing a privacy concept from traditional finance and moving it to the forefront of DeFi. The goal? Make front-running and MEV attacks nearly impossible, bringing institutional-grade trading to crypto. “I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations.” — @cz_binance The Security Race: Wintermute's ”CrimeEnjoyor” and BitMEX's Lazarus Defense While CZ's proposal is still on paper, others are fighting real threats today. Top market maker Wintermute has newly launched ”CrimeEnjoyor” — a tool that infuses on-chain notifications into Ethereum contracts that have been marked as wallet drainers. Such notices target a spike in malicious EIP-7702 delegations, with over 97% of such type of contracts now marked as sweepers that drain hacked wallets automatically. Wintermute's fix: reverse-engineer the evil bytecode, insert a warning message, and make it clear to anyone inspecting the contract. It's a clever trick on the transparency problem, attempting to protect users from the dark side of DeFi composability. “These are sweepers, used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised addresses... This one copy-pasted bytecode now accounts for the majority of all EIP-7702 delegations. It’s funny, bleak, and fascinating at the same time.” — @wintermute_t In the meantime, BitMEX recently thwarted a phishing assault by the notorious Lazarus Group, proving that even nation-state hackers can err. BitMEX security experts traced the attack to a misconfigured database, pointing to the never-ending cat-and-mouse situation between hackers and protectors. Are These Fixes Realistic? Devs Weigh In Developer reaction to CZ's dark pool DEX is mixed. Some applaud the vision, commenting that ZKPs and encrypted mempools will finally bring privacy to DeFi trading. Others are warning that hiding orders on-chain is both a technical and a philosophical issue—transparency is one of the core DeFi principles, and trustless privacy is hard to scale. Wintermute's ”CrimeEnjoyor” has been seen as a clever band-aid but no panacea: ”It's a step in the right direction, but as long as users have private keys, phishing and wallet-draining will remain a threat,” remarked an Ethereum core dev. “CZ’s dark pool DEX could unlock institutional DeFi, but it’s a moonshot. CrimeEnjoyor is clever, but we need more than warnings to fix wallet security.”— @deanmlittle The 2025 Security Arms Race: Who's Ahead? As DeFi grows, so do the threats. CZ’s dark pool DEX could be a turning point if the tech catches up to the vision. Wintermute’s scanner and BitMEX’s vigilance show that defense is evolving, but the attackers aren’t standing still. As the security arms race heats up, the only certainty is that DeFi’s battle with MEV and front-running is far from over—and the next breakthrough could come from anywhere.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-02 19:09:57

A recent survey suggests a significant number are doing just that, indicating that candidates’ stances on crypto policy are playing a notable role in how they cast their presidential vote . Understanding the Pulse of Korean Crypto Investors A comprehensive survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between May 27 and 30 offered valuable insights into the minds of 2,000 Korean crypto investors . This poll tracked weekly trends and sentiments within this specific demographic, shedding light not only on their market outlook but also on the political weight they place on cryptocurrency-related issues. What’s the Latest on Bitcoin Price Prediction? One key aspect of the survey focused on the immediate future of the market, specifically regarding Bitcoin price prediction . The sentiment showed a notable shift towards optimism: Increase or Significantly Jump: 51.9% of respondents expected Bitcoin’s value to rise this week, a significant jump from 37.6% the previous week. Stable Market: 33.9% predicted a stable market, slightly down from 35.8% last week. Decline or Sharp Drop: Only 14.2% anticipated a decline, a sharp decrease from 26.7% previously. This indicates a growing bullish sentiment among Korean crypto investors looking at short-term movements. Gauging the Overall Market Sentiment Beyond specific price predictions, the survey also captured the broader market sentiment among the respondents. The feelings were mixed, but leaned slightly away from fear: Neutral: 39.2% felt neutral about the overall market conditions. Optimism or Extreme Optimism: 34.7% expressed positive sentiment. Fear or Extreme Fear: 26.1% reported feeling fearful. While a large segment remained neutral, the split between optimism and fear highlights the inherent volatility and uncertainty still felt by investors, even amidst short-term bullishness on Bitcoin. Does Crypto Policy Really Influence the Presidential Vote? This is where the survey delivered its most compelling finding. Ahead of the South Korean presidential election on June 3, respondents were asked about the impact of candidates’ crypto policy pledges on their voting decisions. The results clearly demonstrate that for a significant portion of Korean crypto investors , these policies are not just a minor consideration: Influence Level Percentage of Respondents Affects vote to some extent 34.2% A significant factor 26.5% A minor influence 18.2% Play no role at all 11.1% Single most important factor 10.0% Combining the ‘significant factor’ and ‘single most important factor’ categories reveals that over a quarter (36.5%) of Korean crypto investors consider crypto policy a major determinant in their presidential vote . Including those for whom it has ‘some extent’ of influence brings the total to over 60%. Why is Crypto Policy Becoming a Key Election Issue? The survey results underscore a growing trend: cryptocurrencies and related regulations are transitioning from a niche financial topic to a relevant political issue. As the number of people invested in crypto grows, their collective voice and concerns regarding clear regulation, investor protection, and taxation become more impactful. Candidates who acknowledge and address these concerns through well-defined crypto policy proposals are likely to resonate more strongly with this voter base. Actionable Insights for Candidates and the Industry For political candidates, ignoring the crypto community’s concerns could mean alienating a significant voting bloc. Developing thoughtful and clear positions on crypto regulation, taxation, and innovation is becoming increasingly important. For the crypto industry in Korea, these findings highlight the need for continued engagement with policymakers and public education efforts to shape future regulations constructively. Conclusion: Crypto Investors Make Their Voices Heard The survey provides compelling evidence that Korean crypto investors are not just passive market participants; they are engaged citizens who consider digital asset policies when making their presidential vote . With shifting sentiments on Bitcoin price prediction and varying degrees of market sentiment , the community remains dynamic, but their political influence, tied directly to crypto policy , is becoming undeniable. This signals a future where cryptocurrency issues will likely remain a relevant topic in political discourse.

If the flagship crypto can hold above a key price level, June 2025 could bring a strong recovery. However, he warned that if Bitcoin fails to do so, the anticipated rally may be delayed. Industry Expert Compares Bitcoin to Gold In a recent report, Charles Edwards said that after gold passed its highest price in 2008, it dropped slightly but rose to even higher prices. This happened when the precious metal turned a past resistance level into support. Edward believes Bitcoin is now in a similar position. Bitcoin broke past its 2021 high of $73,884 and reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980 in late May. However, since then, the digital coin has dropped by 6.39%. Edwards says that for Bitcoin to continue rising, it must turn the $106,047 level into strong support. According to CoinMarketCap data , Bitcoin is trading at $104,379 at the time of writing, down 0.39% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s Next Move Hinges on $106K Price Level Bitcoin’s recent drop below the key level of $106,047 has caused some concern among investors. The cryptocurrency closed below this level for two consecutive days, which Charles Edwards describes as a negative sign. He believes that for Bitcoin to recover, it must close above $106,047 and hold that level. The founder said turning a previous resistance level into support is usually a sign that the market is ready to rise. Without this change, Edwards warned that the decline could continue, and any new rally might be delayed. Meanwhile, Katalin Tischhauser from Sygnum noted that Bitcoin is entering a new phase of supply shock . She explained that this supply constraint could create conditions for Bitcoin’s price to rise in the coming months. This development happens simultaneously as big investors are buying more Bitcoin to hold it. This shows that institutions are still interested, even though the market has dropped recently. Bitcoin Set for Short-Term Rebound Amid Fed Uncertainty On the bright side, another crypto analyst, PropheticBTC, agrees with the bullish outlook. He expects the flagship crypto to rise to $110,000 soon. While Edwards focuses more on the medium-term trend, PropheticBTC is more optimistic about the short term. Nevertheless, both analysts believe a recovery is possible, especially if Bitcoin climbs above the $106,047 mark. Beyond technical charts and indicators, macroeconomic and regulatory developments could shake things up.

While the overall losses marked a 16.94% decrease from April’s $364 million, one attack vector—code vulnerability—saw a dramatic surge. In May alone, $229.6 million was lost due to flawed code, a 4,483% increase from April’s $5 million. This vulnerability category became the top incident loss contributor, accounting for the majority of stolen funds. #CertiKStatsAlert Combining all the incidents in May we’ve confirmed ~$140.1M lost to exploits, hacks and scams after ~$162m was frozen. ~$8.5M of the total is attributed to phishing. More details below pic.twitter.com/LTE6axKeGi — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) June 2, 2025 CertiK Senior Blockchain Security Researcher Natalie Newson emphasized the gravity of this spike, noting that although losses from code vulnerabilities had been declining in recent years, from $1.35 billion in 2021 to $173 million in 2024, May’s figure shows an urgent need for heightened code auditing and formal verification processes. Newson stresses that the rise shows how even mature areas of the space must remain vigilant, employing both human and AI-driven security protocols. Phishing and DeFi-Related Incidents Dominate Web3 Phishing scams , which had accounted for a large portion of April’s losses, saw a steep drop. In May, phishing-related incidents totaled $47.6 million—an 85% decrease from April’s $337 million. Despite the decline, phishing remained the second-most costly attack vector after code vulnerabilities, followed by private key compromises ($11.6 million) and price manipulation attacks ($1 million). DeFi platforms remained the most-targeted sector, experiencing losses of over $241 million in May. This reflects a broader trend of DeFi being a prime target for hackers due to its open-source nature and large pools of capital. Social engineering scams accounted for $35.5 million in losses, while exchanges and wallet drainers lost $11.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Cetus Hack Among the Month’s Major Incidents Among the nine major incidents identified in May, the most devastating was the attack on Cetus, which resulted in $225.6 million in stolen assets. Other breaches included Cork Protocol ($11.9 million), BittoPro ($11.1 million), Mobius DAO ($2.1 million), and Demex Nitron ($950,599). CertiK’s latest report is a stark reminder of the persistent and evolving threats within the Web3 ecosystem. As attackers refine their strategies, so too must the security measures designed to defend against them. Hacks and Scams in April Due to Phishing and Social Engineering Phishing accounted for the lion’s share of April’s losses, approximately $337 million. The standout case was the theft from an elderly U.S. investor , where the attacker used highly advanced social engineering tactics to deceive the victim and gain access to their Bitcoin wallet. According to CertiK, this event marks a new wave of cybercrime, where criminals bypass code and blockchain infrastructure entirely, opting instead to exploit human behavior. Social engineering, a tactic that manipulates people into revealing confidential information, has become one of the most effective strategies for crypto criminals. These attacks are particularly insidious because they often appear legitimate, tricking even experienced investors.

By 2028, the minimum WLD price might drop to $ 1.11 while its maximum can reach $1.6 The price of Worldcoin is expected to reach a maximum level of $7.18 in 2031. Worldcoin is capturing the attention of investors and enthusiasts in equal measure, which aligns with the world’s prediction. In the first week of May, Worldcoin’s token, WLD, saw a dramatic rise in its value, positioning it as one of the top-performing altcoins in the market. This surge coincides with heightened activity around artificial intelligence (AI) advancements, particularly those involving OpenAI, hinting at a significant correlation between WLD’s market movements and developments in AI technology. The buzz is partly attributed to speculative reports about potential collaborations and new ventures that could integrate more AI tools into cryptocurrency. Overview Cryptocurrency Worldcoin Token WLD Price $1.11 (-0.5%) Market Cap $1.73B Trading Volume (24-hour) $130.24M (-9.17%) Circulating Supply 1.55B WLD All-time High $11.82 Mar 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.5817, June 2, 2025 24-hour High $1.17 24-hour Low $1.11 Worldcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $3.62 (227.62%) Price Volatility 15.32% 50-Day SMA $ 1.088847 14-Day RSI 48.29 Sentiment NEUTRAL Fear & Greed Index 73 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) Worldcoin price analysis: WLD drops to $1.11 as price pressure builds at the support level Repeated tests of the $1.11 support suggest buyers are losing strength, increasing the risk of a breakdown. The pattern of lower highs confirms sustained selling pressure and a short-term bearish trend. Price is compressed between $1.11 and $1.17, pointing to an imminent breakout in either direction. Worldcoin (WLD) traded at $1.11 on June 2nd, 2025, reflecting a 0.56% decline in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is currently holding above a critical support level at $1.11, while resistance is established at $1.17. The narrowing price range between these levels indicates mounting pressure that could lead to a breakout or breakdown in the near term. With a market capitalization of $1.72 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $131.34 million (down 6.09%), WLD is showing signs of consolidation amid reduced trading activity. Worldcoin daily price chart: WLD sellers in control as $1.11 gets retested On the 1-day chart, WLD is maintaining a bearish structure, with a clear series of lower highs and downward momentum reinforcing selling pressure. The asset briefly approached the $1.17 resistance, but failed to breach it, leading to a steady slide back to the $1.11 support level. This zone is now being tested for the third time, increasing the probability of a breakdown if buyer strength continues to weaken. The price action suggests that the token is trading within a descending channel, with momentum favoring sellers. The RSI remains neutral but leans slightly bearish, failing to cross key midline levels. There’s no bullish divergence to suggest an immediate reversal. The volume has declined more than 6%, confirming that recent rallies lacked conviction. Candle formations show long upper wicks, confirming repeated sell-offs on intraday spikes. If $1.11 fails to hold, bears may push the price toward the $1.08 region, a previous minor accumulation level. Bulls must reclaim $1.17 with high volume for any potential reversal. Worldcoin 4-Hour price chart: WLD short-term trend remains bearish On the 4-hour chart, WLD continues to print lower highs and lower lows, reinforcing a short-term bearish channel. Price remains compressed just above the $1.11 support, showing indecision among buyers and no signs of bullish reversal patterns. The RSI is trending downward and volume is thin, confirming a lack of bullish participation. Unless bulls step in with strength soon, a break below $1.11 on this timeframe could accelerate losses into the lower $1.08–$1.06 range. Worldcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.985184 BUY SMA 5 $ 1.137329 SELL SMA 10 $ 1.270456 SELL SMA 21 $ 1.248037 SELL SMA 50 $ 1.088847 BUY SMA 100 $ 1.003232 BUY SMA 200 $ 1.433908 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 1.188944 SELL EMA 5 $ 1.101147 BUY EMA 10 $ 0.977782 BUY EMA 21 $ 0.906062 BUY EMA 50 $ 0.991154 BUY EMA 100 $ 1.27301 SELL EMA 200 $ 1.713849 SELL What can you expect from the Worldcoin price next? The $1.11 support is the critical level to watch. With repeated retests and no strong bounce, the structure suggests that this support is weakening. If WLD breaks below $1.11 with volume, the following likely downside targets are $1.08 and potentially $1.06, where previous minor demand zones exist. Conversely, if buyers manage to defend $1.11 and push the price back toward resistance, the $1.17 level must be broken decisively to signal any short-term bullish shift. Until one of these levels gives way, the price is likely to remain range-bound, with a bearish bias due to the ongoing pattern of lower highs and reduced trading volume. Traders should prepare for increased volatility, as the tight price range suggests a breakout move is approaching. The following sessions will be key in defining the short-term direction of WLD. Wordcoin Recent News Worldcoin Surges 10% Following World Foundation’s $135M Raise from Early Investors Worldcoin’s token WLD surged 10% after the World Foundation raised $135 million from early backers, including Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Crypto. The funds will support the global growth of World ID, the company’s biometric identity platform, focusing on the US and key markets. World Foundation raised $135M from @a16z and @BainCapCrypto to accelerate scaling the real human network. Funding was through a recent direct purchase of liquid, market-priced $WLD . — World (@worldcoin) May 21, 2025 Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin (WLD) is currently under short-term bearish pressure, with the price stuck between $1.11 support and $1.17 resistance. Until one of these levels breaks, it remains in a range-bound, low-momentum phase, which may not favor short-term traders. Long-term, WLD shows strong adoption with 1.86 million holders and a fully diluted valuation of $11.1 billion. However, only 15.5% of tokens are unlocked, meaning future supply increases could impact price. The project’s success hinges on real-world adoption and regulatory clarity. Why is WLD Price down today Worldcoin (WLD) is down 0.56%, trading at $1.11 as of June 2, 2025, mainly due to technical weakness and market indecision. The price has failed to break above the $1.17 resistance, and repeated tests of the $1.11 support suggest buyer exhaustion. The 6.09% drop in 24-hour trading volume signals reduced demand and fading momentum, adding to the bearish pressure. Additionally, WLD is trading in a tight range, and the persistent pattern of lower highs reflects sustained selling interest, contributing to today’s price dip. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, requiring substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use. Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. What will be the value of Worldcoin in 2025 Based on current trends and market conditions, Worldcoin’s average value is predicted to be $0.86, with the potential to reach a high of $2.11 by 2025. Does Worldcoin have a promising long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; hence, many may consider investing in the token as it may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success. Worldcoin price prediction June 2025 Worldcoin is expected to exhibit a range of price movements in June 2025. The potential low is $0.7, while the average price might be around $0.9.

While global trends often dominate headlines, regional insights, especially from highly active markets like South Korea, can offer unique perspectives. This is where understanding the pulse of the Korean crypto community becomes invaluable. We’ve tapped into exclusive data from Bitcoin World to bring you a snapshot of the tokens that captured the most attention within the South Korean crypto community during the week of May 23 to 29. By analyzing both search volume and mentions, we can gain a clearer picture of what’s driving curiosity and conversation among Korean investors and enthusiasts. Why Understanding South Korea Crypto Trends Matters South Korea has long been recognized as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market. Its tech-savvy population, high internet penetration, and enthusiastic adoption of digital technologies have made it a hotbed for crypto trading and innovation. Trends originating or gaining traction within the country can sometimes foreshadow broader market movements or highlight specific projects gaining serious momentum. Monitoring South Korea crypto trends provides valuable intelligence for investors worldwide. Top Searched Crypto Korea: What Were Investors Looking For? Curiosity often starts with a search. The tokens with the highest search volumes indicate which projects or assets people are actively researching, likely driven by recent news, price movements, or general interest. Here’s what the data revealed for the week: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 38,370 2 ETH 18,054 3 BTC 16,025 4 SOPH 9,159 5 SUI 8,660 6 ONDO 8,147 7 MOVE 5,537 8 SOL 5,461 9 EOS 4,079 10 NXPC 3,991 XRP stands out significantly, nearly doubling the search volume of the second-place token, Ethereum (ETH). This suggests ongoing strong interest, perhaps related to legal developments or community anticipation. ETH and BTC maintain their positions as foundational assets, consistently ranking high. What’s particularly interesting are the newer or less globally prominent tokens like SOPH, SUI, ONDO, MOVE, EOS, and NXPC making the top searched crypto Korea list, indicating specific regional interest or recent developments within those projects resonating with the Korean audience. K-Community Crypto Buzz: What Were They Discussing? Beyond just searching for information, what are people actively talking about? Mention data reflects ongoing discussions, sentiment, and community engagement around specific tokens. Here’s the list of the most mentioned tokens in the K-community crypto space: Rank Token Mentions 1 BTC 1,415 2 ETH 603 3 TRUMP 293 4 XRP 170 5 SOL 159 6 SUI 99 7 VIRTUAL 45 8 NXPC 44 9 PEPE 39 10 ONDO 38 Interestingly, while XRP dominated searches, BTC and ETH lead the mention count, suggesting they are central to broader market discussions and sentiment analysis. The appearance of the TRUMP token at number three is notable, indicating that politically linked or meme-style tokens can generate significant discussion volume, even if search interest isn’t as high. Other tokens like SOL, SUI, NXPC, PEPE, and ONDO also feature in discussions, mirroring some of the search trends but with different relative prominence. Comparing Search vs. Mention: What Does It Tell Us? The differences between the search and mention lists offer valuable insights: High Search, Lower Mention (e.g., XRP, SOPH, MOVE, EOS): People are actively seeking information. This could be due to recent news, potential investment opportunities they are researching, or trying to understand a project. The conversation might be happening elsewhere or is less consolidated in the monitored K-Community channels. High Mention, Lower Search (e.g., TRUMP, VIRTUAL, PEPE): These tokens are generating buzz and discussion, possibly driven by social media trends, specific events, or their nature as speculative or community-driven assets. The conversation itself might be the primary driver of interest, rather than in-depth research. Consistent High Ranking (e.g., BTC, ETH, SUI, ONDO, NXPC): These tokens are both being actively researched and discussed, indicating sustained and broad interest within the community. This comparison highlights that search volume often reflects initial or specific information-seeking behavior, while mentions indicate active community engagement and sentiment around a token. What Drove Interest in These Tokens Last Week? Pinpointing the exact reasons for the surge in interest for each token during this specific week (May 23-29) would require deeper analysis of news and events surrounding each project during that period. However, based on the Bitcoin World data , we can infer that factors likely included: Recent price volatility or significant price movements. Major project updates, partnerships, or roadmap milestones. Listing announcements on popular exchanges. General market sentiment influencing interest in major assets like BTC and ETH. Social media trends and community hype, especially for tokens like TRUMP and PEPE. Understanding these drivers is key to interpreting the data beyond just the numbers. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor So, how can you use this information about the Korean crypto community ‘s focus? Sentiment Gauge: High mention volume can indicate strong community sentiment, positive or negative. Identifying Potential Movers: Tokens appearing high on both lists, or showing a significant jump in search/mentions, might be worth researching further. Regional Nuances: This data highlights tokens with potentially stronger interest in the Korean market compared to global averages. Starting Point for Research: If a token you weren’t tracking appears high on these lists, it’s a signal to investigate why. Remember, this data is a snapshot from one week and one platform. It’s a valuable piece of the puzzle, but should be combined with broader market analysis and fundamental research. Conclusion: A Window into Korean Crypto Sentiment The Bitcoin World data for May 23-29 offers a fascinating look into the minds of the Korean crypto community . XRP’s dominance in searches, the consistent focus on BTC and ETH in discussions, and the emergence of specific altcoins and meme tokens paint a picture of a dynamic and engaged market. By tracking what this influential community is searching for and discussing, investors can gain valuable insights into potential trends and sentiment shifts. Staying informed about regional dynamics like these is crucial in the fast-paced world of crypto.

45428432,https://invezz.com/?p=2746080,1748892056,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Best Altcoin to buy now? ETH vs MUTM,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/02/best-altcoin-to-buy-now-eth-vs-mutm/,"Investors are eyeing the best crypto to buy now as the market buzzes with opportunity. The price of Ethereum rose again to $2,728 as whales added 190,000 tokens to their portfolios. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting more attention in their presale and selling over 525 million tokens to 11,500 investors, making $9,800,000. Phase 5 is underway, offering MUTM at $0.03, a 200% jump from the opening phase’s $0.01. This surge signals strong demand, positioning MUTM as a fresh contender against Ethereum’s established dominance. Both projects promise unique value, but which one holds the edge? Let’s explore their potential. Ethereum’s steady ascent Ethereum is proving to be tough even in a volatile crypto market. Tether, currently priced at $2,728, shows a 6.6% rise in the day, ahead of Bitcoin’s recent losses. In only five days, those holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH have gotten their hands on 190,000 tokens, indicating that investors trust Ethereum. When the 20-day EMA breaks above the 200-day EMA, it could lead to a rally to $3,000, as some analysts look for $3,400 by this time next year. With the RSI at 71, this shows there’s strong buying pressure behind Ethereum’s rise. Capital rotation from other coins to Ethereum further bolsters its appeal. Yet, its high entry price may deter smaller investors seeking affordable crypto investments. Ethereum’s strength lies in its established network and widespread adoption. As a backbone for DeFi and smart contracts, it commands significant market trust. Traders are conducting twice the usual number of trades, pushing volumes up 24% to $25 billion. Should momentum start to weaken, the price may fall back to $2,440. Anyone who chooses stability over potential high rewards finds Ethereum to be a great option. Its technical indicators and whale activity suggest a promising short-term outlook, but its growth potential may be tempered by its already substantial market cap. Mutuum Finance’s presale surge The platform offered by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is changing things in the DeFi sector. The fifth phase of its presale is now active and tokens cost $0.03, twice the price of the initial launch at $0.01. There are now more than 11,500 people who keep tokens from the project which have sold for over $9,800,000 so far. The next phase will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, and the token is set to launch at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% ROI for current buyers. Analysts predict a post-launch price of $3, offering a potential 9,900% return, making it a compelling crypto investment. The project’s dual lending model blends Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems, fostering transparency and user control. Lenders can deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income with automated interest adjustments. The Peer-to-Peer model enables direct agreements, cutting out intermediaries and aligning with DeFi’s ethos. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates on Ethereum’s blockchain, leveraging its security while preparing for Layer-2 integration to ensure faster, cheaper transactions. This scalability positions MUTM as a forward-thinking player in the crypto market, appealing to investors seeking innovative crypto coins. Security and community strength Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building trust with robust security measures.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains strong after a pullback from a major rally, states a report by Bitfinex analysts, released on Monday, June 2. After reaching its all-time high of $111,880 with a 50% rally in just 45 days, the asset has encountered significant macroeconomic pressure. Notably, reinstated tariffs resulted in a sharp spike in Treasury yields, with 30-year Treasury yields rising above 5 percent. These factors are fueling risk-off sentiment, which is affecting both stocks and Bitcoin. Moreover, the Bitcoin derivatives market, Bitfinex analysts explain, is likely overheated. Still, the report suggests that Bitcoin remains in a strong position. “Despite the pullback, we believe Bitcoin remains structurally strong. This correction appears to be a healthy reset rather than a breakdown—driven by leverage flushing and profit realisation after one of the sharpest recoveries in crypto history,” Bitfinex report. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs ended six-week inflow streak over macro jitters and BTC slump Bitcoin faces macro uncertainty, profit taking Bitfinex analysts note that open interest rose to an all-time high of $49.4 billion, indicating that traders are increasingly hedging their bets and speculating on the asset. In both cases, this suggests that traders are anticipating more volatility. You might also like: Will Bitcoin and altcoins rise in June, or is a new crypto winter coming? Adding to this narrative is a decline in consumer spending, driven by growing concerns over the effects of tariffs. At the same time, unrealized profitable positions in Bitcoin have risen to historic levels, likely leading to significant profit taking ahead. Bitcoin short-term holder realized price | Source: Bitfinex “On-chain metrics corroborate this: the Relative Unrealised Profit indicator has broken above its +2 standard deviation band, a historically euphoric zone that typically precedes sharp intraday swings and local tops,” Bitfinex report. Despite these risks, other developments suggest that Bitcoin remains in a strong position. Notably, institutional adoption is picking up, with more and more companies diversifying into Bitcoin. One of them is GameStop, which invested $513 million in BTC, in an effort to diversify from its declining core business.

A significant development recently emerged from South Korea, where the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA) issued an investor warning concerning the CKB token . This move by DAXA, a collective of the nation’s leading crypto exchanges, highlights the proactive steps being taken to safeguard market participants, especially following recent technical challenges within the broader crypto ecosystem. Understanding the DAXA Warning on CKB The warning from DAXA is a crucial signal for anyone involved with the CKB token , which is the native asset of the Nervos Network. According to an announcement disseminated via member exchanges like Upbit, the decision to issue this alert stems from a specific security incident. The core issue revolves around a bridge mechanism operating within the ecosystem connected to the Nervos Network bridge . DAXA, comprising major players in the South Korean crypto market, acts as a self-regulatory body. Its primary function is to promote a safe and transparent trading environment. When a potential risk is identified, especially one that could impact the integrity or security of an asset listed on member exchanges, DAXA issues warnings or takes other necessary measures. This recent action regarding CKB falls directly into that mandate, underscoring the alliance’s commitment to investor protection. What Happened with the Nervos Network Bridge ? Cross-chain bridges are vital components in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape, enabling the transfer of assets and data between different blockchain networks. While they offer immense utility, they have also become significant targets for exploits due to their complexity and the large amounts of value they often handle. The DAXA warning on CKB is directly linked to a security issue reportedly affecting a bridge associated with the Nervos Network. Details surrounding the exact nature of the security issue might vary, but common vulnerabilities in blockchain bridges include: Smart Contract Bugs: Errors in the code governing the bridge’s operations can be exploited. Private Key Compromises: If the keys controlling assets locked in the bridge are compromised. Oracle Failures: Issues with the data feeds that inform the bridge about events on other chains. Validation Issues: Flaws in how transactions are verified across chains. While specific details of the Nervos-related incident prompted the DAXA warning are crucial for a full understanding, the general principle remains: a vulnerability in a bridge can put assets at risk, potentially impacting the value and tradability of associated tokens like CKB. Why This Matters in South Korea Crypto Markets South Korea boasts one of the most active and influential cryptocurrency markets globally. Decisions made by regulatory bodies or self-regulatory alliances like DAXA carry significant weight and can directly impact trading volume, investor sentiment, and even the listing status of tokens on major exchanges. The fact that DAXA, an alliance representing exchanges handling a vast majority of the country’s crypto trading volume, issued this alert means it’s being seen by a large and active investor base. The member exchanges of DAXA include: Upbit Bithumb Coinone Korbit Gopax These platforms are the primary gateways for South Korean investors accessing tokens like CKB. Therefore, a DAXA warning disseminated through these channels is not merely advisory; it’s a direct communication to a significant portion of the global CKB holder base, urging caution and potentially influencing trading decisions. Actionable Insights for CKB Token Holders If you hold CKB tokens, this DAXA warning warrants your attention. Here are some actionable steps and considerations: Stay Informed: Monitor official announcements from DAXA, member exchanges (like Upbit), and the Nervos Network team. Look for updates on the security issue and its resolution. Assess Your Risk: Understand that a security warning indicates potential risk. Evaluate your exposure to CKB and decide if you need to adjust your holdings based on your risk tolerance. Understand Exchange Policies: Exchanges might implement specific measures, such as restricting deposits/withdrawals related to the affected bridge or even delisting the token if the issue is severe and prolonged. Be aware of the policies on the exchange where you hold CKB. Avoid Affected Bridges: If the warning specifies a particular bridge, refrain from using it until the security issue is confirmed as resolved and safe to use. Diversify: This event serves as a reminder of the inherent risks in crypto. Diversification across different assets and networks can help mitigate the impact of single-asset or single-network issues. This isn’t necessarily a call to panic sell, but rather a prompt to exercise caution and make informed decisions based on the available information and your personal investment strategy. Broader Implications for Crypto Security and Investor Confidence The DAXA warning on CKB is more than just a token-specific event; it reflects the growing pains and security challenges within the broader crypto landscape. Cross-chain bridge exploits have resulted in billions of dollars in losses across various networks over the past few years, making them a critical area of focus for security audits and development efforts. Such warnings, while potentially causing short-term market volatility for the affected asset, also serve a positive long-term purpose. They: Raise awareness among investors about the technical risks associated with decentralized technologies like bridges. Incentivize blockchain projects (like Nervos) to prioritize and enhance their security infrastructure, especially for critical components like bridges. Reinforce the role of bodies like DAXA in providing a layer of investor protection in markets where formal regulation might still be evolving. Ultimately, the response to this crypto security alert from both the Nervos team and the wider community, alongside the actions taken by exchanges under the DAXA umbrella, will be key in determining the long-term impact on the CKB token and confidence in its associated infrastructure. Conclusion: Navigating Warnings in the Digital Asset Space The investor warning issued by South Korea’s DAXA regarding the CKB token , prompted by a security issue affecting a Nervos Network bridge , is a significant development that underscores the inherent risks and the increasing maturity of self-regulatory efforts within the South Korea crypto market. For holders of CKB and participants in the wider digital asset space, this serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of due diligence, staying informed about crypto security risks, and understanding the mechanisms that protect (or fail to protect) their investments. While warnings can be concerning, they are also vital tools for fostering a safer and more resilient ecosystem for everyone involved.

According to relevant statistics, more than 90% of people aged 25-80 will invest, and the scope of their investment is relatively wide, such as banks, stocks, foreign exchange, cryptocurrency cloud mining platforms , etc., which are all within the scope of their investment. So which one is the best? Let’s share it with you today. First of all, let’s look at banks. As a financial product based on banks, its popularity and security are relatively high. It can also be said that now anyone with some money will keep it in the bank. But in general, the yield is relatively low, with an average annual interest rate of about 0.5%. This is a model of small and fragmented funds, which is convenient to use for a few hundred yuan. Secondly, look at stocks and foreign exchange. Stocks are a high-yield financial management method that was popular on the Internet a few years ago. People with relevant financial knowledge, professional standards, and unique vision can often get high returns in stocks. However, high returns are also accompanied by high risks. It is possible to get rich overnight and become poor overnight. Especially with the downward trend of economic development, the risk factor of stocks is getting higher and higher. Many stockholders can no longer bear the pressure and have fled. 2024 is not optimistic for the development of stocks. If there is no good news in 2025, then the development will naturally be limited. Looking at the cryptocurrency cloud mining platform, in comparison, the profitability and security of the cloud mining platform are relatively high. Take the ETHRANSACTION cloud mining platform, which was favored by investors last year, as an example, to see the current performance of the ETHRANSACTION platform. Last year, the number of new users invested in the ETHRANSACTION platform increased by nearly two million, and the investment return rate was about 4%-7%.

The acquisition goes through the parent company of the multistrategy crypto hedge fund Monarq Asset Management. FalconX has expanded its services after acquiring a stake in the parent company of Monarq Asset Management. The Monarq fund is a multi-strategy crypto investor, helping FalconX expand into the asset management business. The acquisition will be a new stage for Monarq, which went through two rounds of restructuring and rebranding. Monarq Asset Management was formerly known as MNNC Group, registered in the Cayman Islands. Before that, the fund was known as Ledger Prime, part of the FTX exchange’s wealth management empire. Ledger Prime was connected to the activities of Alameda Research, the crypto trading firm that was entangled with the FTX exchange. Later, Ledger Prime relaunched under the new identity of MNNC, before once again rebranding as Monarq under the management of Shiliang Tang . FalconX aims to reach out to a wider circle of clients Previously, FalconX has stated its intentions to acquire suitable companies, tapping its record revenues from the growing crypto market. Recently, FalconX also partnered with Standard Chartered to offer services to institutional clients. In January, FalconX also acquired the derivative exchange Arbelos Markets. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, as FalconX is a privately held company. The acquisition aims to expand the prime broker’s user base beyond hedge funds, trading funds, and asset managers, according to the head of revenue and business at FalconX, Austin Reid. Reid also mentioned the new clients of FalconX may include endowments, pensions, family offices, or anyone looking for asset management solutions within crypto. He added that the company would seek more acquisitions in the next year or two, going with the wave of consolidations in the crypto space. The Monarq Asset Management spun off as a new fund, entirely independent of its history with FTX and Alameda Research. In early 2024, the fund also raised up to $100M for renewed investments. Old LedgerPrime wallets remained active until two months ago, with vestigial assets from previous trading. As of 2025, Monarq had a team of 16 employees, with crypto strategies deployed to both centralized markets and DEX. The fund has several hundred million dollars in assets under management, based on the founder’s estimates. Monarq applies quantitative, delta-neutral, and directional trading strategies. The acquisition is one of the final elements in repairing the legacy of defunct exchange FTX. The fund now operates on a new market, with wider adoption and higher institutional involvement. FalconX itself carries over $174M in its known wallets. The broker was instrumental in moving some of the assets of FTX to exchanges during the bankruptcy lawsuits. The broker has also handled the assets of Celsius Network. FalconX itself has admitted to having up to 18% of its assets locked within the wallets of FTX. Despite the partial recovery, the broker retained sufficient liquidity, in addition to raising $150M at $8B valuation. The recent deal underscores the decision to forget the FTX fallout and attempt renewed investments in the expanded crypto market.

Important news from the South Korean crypto exchange giant, Bithumb. If you’re holding or trading Berachain (BERA) tokens on their platform, there’s a crucial update you need to be aware of. Bithumb has officially announced a temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals for the Berachain (BERA) token. Why is Bithumb Suspending Berachain (BERA) Transactions? The primary reason cited by Bithumb for this temporary halt is to support an upcoming network upgrade for Berachain. Network upgrades are essential events in the life cycle of a blockchain project. They are implemented to introduce new features, improve performance, enhance security, or fix existing issues within the network protocol. Think of it like a software update for the entire blockchain – it’s necessary for the network’s continued health and evolution. Bithumb, as a responsible crypto exchange , needs to ensure that its systems are fully compatible with the upgraded Berachain network. This often requires pausing transaction services like deposits and withdrawals during the upgrade process to prevent any potential issues, such as lost funds or incorrect transaction processing, that could arise from interacting with a network undergoing significant changes. What Does This BERA Deposit Suspension Mean for You? The announcement specifies that the BERA deposit suspension and withdrawal suspension will begin precisely at 09:00 UTC on June 4th . This is a hard deadline, and users should take note of the exact time. Here’s a breakdown of what this means for users holding or trading Berachain BERA on Bithumb: No Deposits: You will not be able to deposit BERA tokens into your Bithumb wallet after the specified time. No Withdrawals: Similarly, you will be unable to withdraw BERA tokens from your Bithumb wallet after the specified time. Trading May Continue: Typically, such suspensions only affect deposits and withdrawals. Trading pairs involving BERA on Bithumb are likely to remain active, but this should be confirmed via Bithumb’s official announcement. Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit or withdraw BERA on Bithumb, make sure to complete your transactions well before the 09:00 UTC deadline on June 4th. It’s crucial to monitor Bithumb’s official website and communication channels for the exact duration of the suspension and the announcement regarding when services will resume. The suspension is temporary, but the exact end time will depend on the successful completion and stability of the Berachain network upgrade . Understanding the Berachain Network Upgrade While the specific details of the upcoming Berachain upgrade are not fully detailed in Bithumb’s announcement, network upgrades are a standard procedure across the blockchain industry. They can range from minor bug fixes to major protocol overhauls that introduce new consensus mechanisms, scaling solutions, or developer tools. For a promising project like Berachain, these upgrades are vital for its long-term growth, security, and functionality. The fact that a major crypto exchange like Bithumb is actively supporting the upgrade by adjusting its services indicates their commitment to maintaining compatibility and providing a secure environment for their users trading the token. Navigating Crypto Exchange Procedures During Upgrades This situation with Bithumb and Berachain BERA is not uncommon in the world of cryptocurrency. Exchanges frequently suspend deposit and withdrawal services for various tokens when their underlying networks undergo maintenance, upgrades, or hard forks. Key aspects to remember: Communication is Key: Reputable exchanges like Bithumb provide advance notice of such suspensions. Always check their official announcements. It’s for Safety: These suspensions are primarily implemented to protect user funds and ensure data integrity during potentially disruptive network events. Temporary Inconvenience: While inconvenient, it’s a necessary step for the health of the blockchain network and the safety of exchange operations. Here’s a quick summary table: Exchange Token Action Start Time (UTC) Reason Bithumb Berachain (BERA) Deposit & Withdrawal Suspension June 4, 09:00 Network Upgrade Support Actionable Insights for BERA Holders on Bithumb Mark your calendars for June 4th, 09:00 UTC. If you plan to move BERA, do it well before the deadline. Keep an eye on Bithumb’s official announcements for updates on when services will resume. Understand that this is a standard procedure aimed at ensuring the security and compatibility of the exchange with the upgraded network.

Here’s what investors are saying. Meta’s decisive shareholder vote rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, aligning with similar moves by Microsoft and Amazon in similar decisions. According to an SEC filing , just 0.1% of shareholders voted in favor, while 95% voted against. For some, this suggests that tech firms are still lagging in Bitcoin adoption. For one, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, believes tech firms are missing out . He pointed out that Meta’s large cash positions are already speculative. If the dollar falls, so will their cash reserves, and Bitcoin could serve as a way to diversify. “They are already hoarding fiat with $30B in cash, up from $12B in 2023,” Matthew Sigel, VanEck. Sigel acknowledged that this accounts for just 2% of Meta’s market cap. However, other companies—including Netflix, Google, and Verizon, hold fewer reserves, and some even carry significant amounts of debt.

Bitcoin is not gaining traction among major firms Bitcoin has recently gained attention as with more and more companies increased their positions. One of them is GameStop, which invested $519 million in BTC. However, as many have pointed out, most of the companies doing big Bitcoin plays tend to struggle in their core business, with GameStop being no exception . In many cases, these companies are hoping that speculative interest around Bitcoin could boost their stock price. However, in GameStop’s case, the success was momentary, with its share price falling from a high of $35 shortly after the acquisition. For successful businesses like Meta, Bitcoin is a less compelling buy. For Meta investors, including investment giants like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity, traditional risk management is sufficient. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still seen as too risky to hold.

Gold is now comfortably trading over $3350, and aiming for $3400 and possibly a new all-time high above $3500 as well. Table of Contents Previous week’s forecast recap of crypto.news Key economic events of this week Gold HTF Overview Gold Forecast for June 2nd to June 6th Trading Strategies & Investment Recommendation Similar to last week, the bias is gold is buy, upon retracement to specific levels. Let’s discuss the key pivot levels for gold buying and selling in this XAUUSD weekly forecast of June 2nd to June 6th, 2025. Previous week’s forecast recap of crypto.news In the previous week’s forecast we gave a 4h zone as high probability for buys, which was from $3260-$3208. Price is now up 1100 points from that zone and has the potential to run to $3400 and beyond. XAUUSD 4h chart – Source: Tradingview Other levels shared in the last week’s forecast have not hit yet, but they remain valid, so do keep an eye out for them as well. Now let’s start by discussing the key economic events of this week and their possible impact on the price of XAUUSD. Key economic events of this week Some significant U.S. economic reports are scheduled for release this week that are expected to impact XAUUSD . Monday, June 2nd ISM Manufacturing PMI A higher-than-expected PMI may strengthen the USD and put downward pressure on gold. Gold prices would probably be supported by a weak reading. Fed Chair Powell Speaks Powell may suggest aggressive policy or rate rises, which would cause the USD to rise and drive gold lower. Usually, gold would be lifted by dovish remarks. Tuesday, June 3 Job Openings at JOLTS Increased job vacancies indicate a strong labor market, which would strengthen the USD and depress gold. Lower values might have the reverse effect. Wednesday, June 4 ADP Non-Farm Employment Change Strong ADP data indicates labor strength, which weighs on gold and increases the USD. On the basis of recession fears, a miss might lead to gold buying. ISM Services PMI Excellent services PMI supports bearish gold sentiment, optimistic USD sentiment, and economic resilience. The demand for gold is supported by a lower reading. Thursday, June 5 Unemployment Claims Gold may suffer from fewer claims, which show the strength of labor. Growing claims may indicate economic strain and raise the price of gold. Friday, June 6 Average Hourly Earnings m/m Increased salaries indicate inflationary pressure, which could lead to Fed tightening bets (bearish on gold, bullish on the USD). Non-Farm Employment Change Gold declines and the dollar rises when the NFP report is strong. Weak numbers increase recession fears and are frequently positive for gold. Unemployment Rate A decrease in unemployment is both good for the USD and bad for gold. Gold as a safe haven is usually supported by an increase.

XAUUSD 1w chart – Source: Tradingview Gold Forecast for June 2nd to June 6th Gold is showing bullish momentum in all lower time frames which makes buying an ideal position to enter and hold. In the 1 hour timeframe the strongest buying level is coming up at the weekly open, opening gap, and 1 hour structure level of $3303-3295.

Cross-chain bridges are high-risk targets. BitoPro’s delayed disclosure undermines trust, proving that timely communication is essential even with sufficient reserves. $11.5 million vanished in minutes—Taiwan’s BitoPro bled dry after hackers exploited an exposed wallet during a May 8 upgrade. They drained the exchange’s funds, pilfering Ethereum , Tron, and Solana before disappearing through Tornado Cash’s swirling depths. Do you want to explain to the community why multiple of your hot wallets saw suspicious outflows of ~$11.5M on May 8, 2025 where you still have not disclosed the security incident on X or Telegram several weeks later? pic.twitter.com/HlD0c93Or4 — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 2, 2025 This wasn’t just another hack. It was a lesson in how not to handle one. The breach showcases the large gap between crypto exchanges’ promises and their patchy security, particularly during routine upgrades. While BitoPro scrambles to reassure users, the stolen millions continue their whirl through privacy pools, proving once again how money moves faster than the truth in crypto. Upgrade Failures: Why Crypto Exchanges Keep Repeating the Same Mistakes BitoPro’s mishandling of the recent security breach exposes serious flaws in how crypto exchanges manage crises. When the hack occurred on May 8, the exchange initially dismissed the resulting service disruptions as routine “maintenance” the following day. This vague explanation left users confused, especially when USDT withdrawals suddenly froze without warning. BitoPro confirmed that its old hot wallet was compromised during a recent wallet system upgrade and asset migration. The platform responded by immediately transferring assets to a new wallet and halting the attack, with support from a third-party cybersecurity firm. A new wallet… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 2, 2025 The three-week delay in publicly acknowledging the breach only deepened suspicions, showing how poor communication can amplify security failures. Though BitoPro eventually assured users it had “sufficient reserves” to cover losses and brought in external security teams to track the stolen funds, the damage to its reputation was irreversible. By the time the exchange pledged to publish new wallet addresses for verification, rumors about its financial stability had already begun to circulate. The incident fits a pattern of systemic crypto vulnerabilities. For example, weeks earlier, the decentralized exchange Cetus lost $220 million but froze $162 million within days, returning the funds via a community vote. In contrast, BitoPro’s sluggish response showed the bureaucratic paralysis of centralized exchanges. Alert Announcement There was an incident detected on our protocol and our smart contract has been paused temporarily for safety. The team is investigating the incident at the moment. A further investigation statement will be made soon. We are grateful for your patience. — Cetus (@CetusProtocol) May 22, 2025 The same day BitoPro went public, hackers stole over $3 million from Nervos Network’s Force Bridge, laundering the proceeds through Tornado Cash, which was also used in BitoPro’s breach. Security Alert Nervos Network's ForceBridge was exploited due to Access Control vulnerability for $3.9m worth of assets ($3.1m on ETH and $800k on BNB Chain)!

The divide is becoming clearer. While centralized exchanges falter due to slow disclosures, DeFi faces agile cross-chain attacks. Without transparency and adaptability, crypto risks losing user trust entirely. Are Declining Hack Numbers a Mirage? The Hidden Spike in Small Breaches PeckShield reports $244 million stolen across 20 attacks, down 39% from April, and the improvement came from fewer big heists, not better security. #PeckShieldAlert In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M—a 39.29% decrease from April. Notably, @CetusProtocol & #SUI have frozen a combined $157M of stolen funds (representing 71% recovery from the $220M theft). #Top 5 Hacks in… pic.twitter.com/ZJmGZvbthS — PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) June 1, 2025 The $220 million Cetus attack alone made up nearly all of May’s losses. Smaller thefts still added up: $12 million from the Cork Protocol, $5.2 million from North Korean hackers, $2.2 million from MBU tokens, and $1.2 million from MapleStory Universe. The crypto industry’s response to mounting security threats reveals both genuine progress and concerning gaps. Exchanges have stepped up their defenses. Coinbase, Kraken, and BitMEX now enforce two-factor authentication for all users, while Binance and OKX keep more than 90% of funds in offline cold storage. Bitstamp also requires multiple approvals for withdrawals. Regular security testing and bug bounty programs help uncover weaknesses before hackers can exploit them, yet breaches keep happening. BitoPro’s recent hack was the result of lax security during a system upgrade. No amount of advanced technology can prevent such human errors. This inconsistency hurts crypto’s credibility. Research shows that current safeguards could dramatically reduce attacks if properly implemented. However, with $2.2 billion stolen in 2024, public trust remains low. Many potential investors still see crypto as too risky, and the BitoPro case made things worse. Even after the hack, delayed warnings and confusing statements undermined confidence. Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs) Why was BitoPro’s hack disclosure delayed for weeks? BitoPro’s three-week delay likely reflected internal assessments of the damage and adequacy of its reserves. However, this delay violates industry best practices and may breach Taiwan’s transparency expectations for crypto exchanges, potentially triggering regulatory scrutiny. How can user funds remain safe when USDT withdrawals were frozen? The contradiction between BitoPro’s safety claims and frozen USDT withdrawals suggests either liquidity constraints or internal mismanagement. While the exchange blamed security protocols, the discrepancy undermines confidence in their reserve adequacy claims. Can the stolen funds be recovered after using Tornado Cash and THORChain? Recovery is unlikely, and privacy tools like Tornado Cash obscure trails. BitoPro’s reliance on external tracking suggests a weak cross-chain monitoring system, a common flaw in centralized exchanges.

This comes amidst calls for an immediate L1 scaling amongst the community. Buterin’s Implementation Strategy The Ethereum co-founder confirmed the plans during a panel discussion at ETHGlobal Prague. “My view is generally I think we should scale L1 by about 10x over the next year and a bit based on delayed execution,” he said. When asked why he preferred a slower approach, Buterin said a year would be the best implementation timeline. While acknowledging that some people are more aggressive and want to skip the pause and commit to scaling 1,000 times right away, he emphasized that he supports a more cautious and structured strategy. He further explained that this execution depends on upgrades like mobile log-level access lists, networking-level improvements, and distributed history storage. Buterin noted that after this is done, it would be a good time to “take a breather” and check if decentralization is still strong. During this pause, he suggested a hard fork to fix remaining issues like account abstraction, censorship resistance, VM improvements, protocol simplification, and switching to SSL. However, he clarified that when zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines are ready, the network can progress further and faster. The 31-year-old has also previously supported using partially stateless nodes to help grow Ethereum. This would let the chain validate blocks without storing all historical data, which makes it easier for users to run nodes without needing large amounts of storage. Calls for Urgent Scaling After a weak Q1 marked by falling ETH prices and declining on-chain metrics, some key voices in the community have been advocating for immediate L1 scaling. Top Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist has proposed EIP-7938, a plan that would raise Ethereum’s gas limit. His goal is to boost the blockchain’s capacity by 100 times over the next four years, which would allow for more activity on the network. He maintains that Ethereum can still keep its privacy and decentralized features under this plan. According to him, backing the proposal would show a strong commitment at a time when it is facing major challenges. Meanwhile, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has said Ethereum might not survive the next decade. He compared its future to that of Myspace and Blackberry, once-popular platforms that eventually lost relevance. The developer blamed “parasitic” Layer-2s for weakening the network’s core.

Just days later, Pakistan’s Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal denied any official shift in crypto policy. He emphasized that cryptocurrencies remain illegal unless formally approved by the government. This contradiction has caused confusion, especially as Pakistan’s newly formed Digital Assets Authority aims to align policies with global standards, including FATF compliance. Bitcoin Reserve Chaos: Pakistan’s Big Reveal Crushed by Own Government https://t.co/gQ9uET4spN — Metatron Apps-OTC $MRNJ (@MetatronInc) June 2, 2025 While Saqib’s proposal sparked enthusiasm, critics—especially from the IMF—flagged concerns about energy use and financial risks. In the short term, mixed signals from the government have sparked both optimism and skepticism. However, Pakistan’s steps toward structured regulation point to longer-term opportunities for Bitcoin’s integration. Czech Minister Resigns Over $45M Bitcoin Scandal The crypto world was rocked when Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek stepped down after it emerged that his ministry sold nearly $45 million in Bitcoin, donated by convicted drug trafficker Tomas Jirikovsky. Intended to fund prison projects and digital justice reforms, the funds were accepted without proper vetting, under the assumption that Jirikovsky was trying to make amends.

Despite impending elections, Blazek resigned, and an investigation is now underway. Although this scandal has dampened sentiment, the Czech Republic’s broader move to align with the EU’s MiCA framework might restore investor confidence in the long run. South Korea’s Crypto Industry Could Win Big, Regardless of Election Outcome In South Korea, more than 18 million people actively participate in crypto markets. With the June 3 snap presidential election approaching, both frontrunners—Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo—have pledged support for crypto-friendly policies.

BOTH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE PRO-DIGITAL ASSETS. pic.twitter.com/5jcvBj2JxR — The Moon Show (@TheMoonShow) June 2, 2025 Lee’s proposals include legalizing spot Bitcoin ETFs, introducing a won-backed stablecoin, and allowing the national pension fund to invest in crypto. Kim has similarly championed ETF approval and regulatory easing. This rare bipartisan alignment reflects growing public demand and positions South Korea as a crypto hub in the making. Regardless of who wins, legal clarity and institutional support could drive long-term adoption and fuel Bitcoin’s price growth. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: A Breakout to $109K or Reversal? On the charts, Bitcoin is navigating a descending wedge pattern on the 2-hour timeframe—a setup that often precedes a bullish reversal. Resistance looms at $105,352, aligning with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-period EMA. Candlestick patterns near $104,514 (23.6% Fibonacci) suggest market indecision, with the MACD histogram narrowing and signal lines converging—signs of waning bearish momentum. If Bitcoin breaks decisively above $105,352 with solid volume, it could climb toward $106,719 (61.8% Fibonacci) and even target $109,000 in the coming sessions. However, failure to break through could send prices back toward $103,149 or even $101,275. Long Setup: Buy on a confirmed breakout above $105,352, target $106,719–$109K, stop below $104,514. Short Setup: Enter on rejection at $105,352, target $103,149–$101,275, stop above $105,500. Patience is essential—wait for clear price action and volume confirmation before making your move.

According to an 8-K Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week, the vast majority of Meta shareholders voted against a BTC treasury proposal as a hedge against inflation. “On May 28, 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) held its annual meeting of shareholders via live audio webcast… At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s shareholders voted on fourteen proposals, each of which is described in more detail in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025… At the beginning of the Annual Meeting, there were 1,769,720,699 shares of Class A common stock and 342,865,499 shares of Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, which represented 92.61% of the combined voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (voting together as a single class), and which constituted a quorum for the transaction of business.” According to the filing, 3.9 million shares voted for the proposed treasury, while 4.9 billion shares voted it down. Since founder Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 60% of the shares, it can be reasonably assumed that Zuckerberg voted against the measure. Despite the BTC Treasury vote, Meta is still reportedly eyeing a venture into stablecoins amid growing interest and demand for digital assets.

Smart Whales Are Investing Millions in This “DOGE 2.0”,https://nulltx.com/should-you-buy-pepe-during-this-dip-smart-whales-are-investing-millions-in-this-doge-2-0/,"As traders hunt the market in search of the best altcoin to buy during the dip, the current Dogecoin price and Pepe coin rally appear as promising memecoins to buy. However, Unilabs (UNIL) $1.7 million presale is shifting the spotlight from memecoin giants with its fast-growing blockchain finance backed by AI and a blend of premium trading tools within the platform. Dogecoin Price Analysis for June: What’s Next For DOGE In 2025? In general, Dogecoin (DOGE) has always been the fan favourite among memecoin traders. As the memecoin market has experienced a strong bullish action this month, taking a look at Dogecoin price action has become a standard. Notably, this segment has added approximately 15% to its portfolio, pushing it to $62.58 billion from $56.18 billion. Source: TradingView Following this, the top memecoins have displayed mixed price action during this period. However, with the exit of Elon Musk from Donald Trump’s administration, the Dogecoin price today has crashed by approximately 8% with an intraday trading volume of $2.33 billion, reflecting a change of 52.31%. Looking at the positive side of things, the Dogecoin price has added a strong 15% to its valuation this month. With the largest memecoin hanging by a thread around the $0.20 mark, analysts show concerns whether the Dogecoin price will record a strong bullish reversal and form a parabolic rise this altcoin season or not. Pepe Coin Trend Analysis Shows PEPE Could Soar Ahead The PEPE coin currently hovers around a crucial resistance zone near $0.000013, just beneath its recent high. Based on Fibonacci projections and historical price behavior, breaking through this barrier could open the path to higher targets, such as $0.000017 and potentially $0.000020. According to the latest PEPE coin price chart, support remains firm around $0.000012. Source: TradingView A decisive weekly close above $0.000016 would likely validate the bullish trend for Pepe coin, while a drop below $0.0000095 could unravel current momentum and spark a broader correction. Meanwhile, Pepe coin momentum indicators are turning positive. The RSI stands at 59.37, approaching overbought territory but still with room to grow. The Pepe coin MACD has flipped bullish, and open interest in PEPE futures has jumped from $650 million to $735 million. These trends suggest that buying pressure is building for Pepe coin holders. The long/short ratio has also improved over the past 48 hours, climbing from 0.96 to 1.0016, indicating a growing tilt toward long positions. Unilabs (UNIL) Positioned to Become the Most Coin This Cycle? While the Dogecoin price and PEPE coin dominate headlines as the kings of memecoin, Unilabs (UNIL) is quietly becoming their biggest rival, offering stability over speculation. With over $30.5 million in assets under management and an edge powered by AI-backed decision-making, Unilabs is offering the next viral token in the market with long-term gains. While DOGE and PEPE rely heavily on viral tweets and meme culture, Unilabs is built on solid fundamentals, real-time data, and a powerful algorithm that filters through thousands of crypto projects to find early-stage gems before they explode. Presale Rockstar Unilabs Dominates DOGE and PEPE As memecoins swing wildly, Unilabs (UNIL) is soaring ahead on a pure AI-powered mechanism. With over 365 million UNIL tokens sold and a presale raise of $1.74 million, investor confidence is gaining serious momentum. Unilabs next token price is set to rise to $0.0062, and if current demand holds, analysts speculate that UNIL could 3x post-launch. Unilabs AI-driven systems and memecoin identification tools give it a unique edge, allowing even high-risk investors to navigate the market with smart, automated insights instead of guesswork. The platform also goes beyond hype with four specialized investment funds, including AI, BTC, RWA, and Mining, giving users diversification and passive income. Conclusion: Dogecoin and PEPE may rule the memecoin sector, but Unilabs sets the new standard for smart DeFi investing in crypto. With AI models analyzing trends, early-stage access to viral projects, and a governance token that unlocks dividends, voting rights, and exclusive deals, Unilabs is positioned to skyrocket in Q3 of 2025.

45428636,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=739099,1748894400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45428636.jpeg,5 Reasons Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could Be the Next 50x Crypto Gem,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/5-reasons-mutuum-finance-mutm-could-be-the-next-50x-crypto-gem/,"As the crypto space shifts toward real-world utility and sustainable passive income, few projects stand out like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With a live presale price of just $0.03, over $9.72 million already raised, and a roadmap aimed at delivering a functional decentralized lending platform, MUTM is quickly attracting attention from prudent investors. Let’s explore five reasons why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be the next 50x opportunity in 2025. 1. Early-Stage Valuation: $0.03 Entry Price With Room for Exponential Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 5 of its presale at just $0.03 per token—three times higher than its Phase 1 price of $0.01. Early participants have already made a 200% gain. With six more presale phases to go, the price will rise to $0.06 by Phase 11, effectively doubling from here even before the token goes public. The total token supply is capped at 4 billion, and with over 11,450 holders already onboarded, the early valuation creates a strong upside narrative. An investment of $1,000 now would fetch 33,333 MUTM. When the token hits $1.00, which is realistic considering its utility, that investment becomes $33,333. That’s a 33x return—and many investors believe the 50x milestone is within reach. 2. CertiK-Audited Security: Investor Trust Ensured With Top-Tier Smart Contract Review Security isn’t optional in DeFi—it’s the foundation of trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) underwent a full audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the industry. The audit process included static analysis and a manual review of the smart contract, resulting in a solid Token Scan Score of 70.00. The team has shown accountability with revised submissions and updates, addressing vulnerabilities before launch. This proactive approach assures users that their funds are secured by battle-tested, non-custodial smart contracts on-chain. In a space where exploits can destroy value overnight, Mutuum’s security-first philosophy stands out. 3. Lending Innovation: P2P and P2C Decentralized Lending With Real-World Application Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another clone of existing DeFi protocols—it’s pushing the boundary of decentralized lending through both P2P (peer-to-peer) and P2C (peer-to-contract) models. P2C allows users to deposit tokens like ETH or DAI into liquidity pools and earn dynamic interest based on pool utilization. For instance, depositing $2,000 in ETH could earn a passive return of up to 12% annually when utilization rates are high. The P2P model, on the other hand, lets users lend directly to others and set custom terms. This opens the door for lending tokens not usually accepted on other platforms—such as memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), or Dogecoin (DOGE). This flexibility dramatically expands use cases and empowers lenders to chase higher yields based on personal strategies. Borrowers also gain the freedom to unlock liquidity without selling their long-term assets, enabling hedging, leveraging, or even tax-efficient access to funds. 4. Beta Launch Coming: Working Product Builds Credibility and Utility From Day One According to the roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a beta version of its platform as soon as the token goes live. This is not a promise years down the line—it’s a confirmed milestone that adds credibility to the entire ecosystem. A working product out of the gate ensures that MUTM isn’t just another hype token—it’s a tool with functionality, smart contract logic, and actual financial impact. Beta testing will allow the community to interact with core features like deposits, borrowing, and staking using real mechanics. 5. Community and Momentum: $100K Giveaway, Organic Hype, and Rising Presale Volume The community behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly expanding thanks to organic traction and a generous $100,000 giveaway campaign. With over 11,450 holders and nearly $9.72 million already raised, the market has clearly validated the project’s fundamentals. This is no small feat in a bear-biased cycle where investor capital is selective and cautious. Momentum is building fast. Users who joined in Phase 1 already tripled their money. Those who wait for later phases will pay up to 100% more per token than current participants. That’s why now is the time to move. Buying in at $0.03 and holding until the exchange launch offers one of the most attractive profit windows in the 2025 DeFi space. The Utility and Passive Income of MUTM Tokens The MUTM token isn’t just for speculation—it’s the backbone of the Mutuum ecosystem. Staking mtTokens—earned by depositing assets—allows users to participate in passive dividend distributions paid in MUTM. The protocol uses revenue from borrowing fees to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market and distribute them to users who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. Final Thought: If 50x Is the Goal, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Checks Every Box Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is everything a serious investor looks for: early entry pricing, audited smart contracts, working products on the horizon, a clear utility model, and an enthusiastic user base. It delivers passive income, lending innovation, and market-beating tokenomics that reward early adopters. A $1,000 investment today at $0.03 will be worth $15,000, $20,000, or even $35,000 if the token climbs to just $0.45 to $1.05—well within range given its utility and roadmap. Few tokens on the market offer this balance of upside, security, and community momentum. That’s why, for those aiming for 50x returns in 2025, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a name you can’t afford to ignore.

According to a Monday filing with the SEC, the stablecoin issuer and some of its backers are now offering 32 million shares at a price range of $27 to $28 per share. Before, they planned to sell 24 million shares at a range of $24 to $26 each. Companies have shown strong interest in owning Circle stocks The sale of Circle’s stocks at the current price range could rake in as much as $896 million, handing Circle a market capitalization of nearly $6.2 billion. Taking into account employee stock options, restricted share units and warrants, the company would have a fully diluted value of about $7.2 billion. The IPO has drawn orders for stock in double-digit multiples of the shares available, people familiar with the matter have said, and there is still some time before the offering closes to orders at 4 PM New York time on Tuesday. Various companies have already shown interest in Circle stocks since the talk of the IPO went public. ARK Investment Management, a technology-focused firm founded by Cathie Wood, may reportedly buy as much as $150 million of shares, according to the filing. Meanwhile, BlackRock Inc. plans to acquire about 10% of the IPO shares. The IPO is being led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co., and the deal is set to price on June 4, according to documents seen by Bloomberg News. The company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CRCL. The US IPO scene seeks an activity resurgence Circle’s decision to increase the funding goal for its upcoming IPO coincides with a period of increased IPO activity in the US. The first quarter of the year saw US IPO activity at robust levels, with 59 listings raising $8.9 billion, making it the third strongest Q1 on record. Unfortunately, after Trump announced sweeping US tariffs in early April, severe market volatility set in, which led to a sharp decline in the S&P 500, with a year-to-date loss reaching 13% by early April, including a two-day 10% selloff. The tariffs, which included a 10% universal tariff and higher rates on specific countries, created uncertainty around global trade, supply chains, and corporate earnings, and forced companies to pause IPO plans. For example, eToro Group Ltd., an Israel-based online trading platform, was forced to postpone its US IPO in early April due to this “Liberation Day” volatility. Market conditions have been stabilizing since May, partly due to a 90-day pause on some tariffs (except for China), which alleviated immediate financial pressures. That pause, plus strong corporate earnings and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, triggered a market rally, with the S&P 500 recouping nearly all April losses by month-end. And as volatility eased, IPO activity started showing signs of revival. For example, eToro eventually went public in New York last month and many other IPOs that have launched have been successful, highlighting a healing market.

This week, the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of crypto. Following a significant period of price action, several key indicators and external factors are converging, potentially signaling the next major move for the flagship cryptocurrency. Staying informed on these crucial Bitcoin market trends is vital for navigating the volatile landscape. Our latest Bitcoin analysis dives deep into five pivotal factors that traders and investors should be closely monitoring. From technical signals on the charts to macroeconomic influences and the movements of large holders, these elements provide valuable insights into the potential trajectory of the Bitcoin price in the coming days. Let’s break down what’s happening. Understanding Bitcoin Price Action: The RSI Signal One of the most widely followed technical indicators in the world of trading, including for Bitcoin , is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This momentum oscillator measures the speed and change of price movements. It typically ranges from 0 to 100. Readings above 70 usually suggest an asset is overbought, while readings below 30 indicate it might be oversold. However, the story gets more nuanced when we talk about divergence. Recently, Bitcoin experienced a record monthly close, a bullish sign in itself. Yet, this strong price performance has been accompanied by what some analysts are pointing to as RSI divergence. A bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a higher high, but the RSI makes a lower high. This pattern can suggest that the upward momentum is weakening, even as the price continues to climb. It’s like the engine is starting to lose power even though the car is still accelerating. Why is this important? Divergence, particularly after a strong rally or a significant price milestone like a record close, can act as a cautionary signal. It doesn’t guarantee a price reversal, but it does suggest that the buying pressure might be waning and that a slowdown or even a correction could be on the horizon. For those performing crypto market analysis , spotting these divergences is a key part of anticipating potential shifts in trend direction. Key Takeaway: While Bitcoin’s price remains robust, the potential bearish RSI divergence is a technical indicator suggesting traders should exercise caution and watch for signs of weakening momentum. Macro Forces Shaping Crypto Market Analysis: US Fed and Labor Data The cryptocurrency market, despite its decentralized nature, is increasingly influenced by traditional macroeconomic factors, especially those originating from the United States. This week, attention is heavily focused on U.S. labor market data and the subsequent implications for Federal Reserve monetary policy. Why does this matter for Bitcoin news? The Fed’s primary tools are interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening. When the labor market is strong (low unemployment, rising wages), it can signal potential inflation. To combat inflation, the Fed typically raises interest rates. Higher interest rates make traditional, safer investments like bonds more attractive compared to riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a weakening labor market might give the Fed reason to pause or even cut rates, which can be bullish for risk assets. Upcoming labor data releases, such as non-farm payrolls and unemployment rates, will provide crucial clues about the health of the U.S. economy. If the data is stronger than expected, it could lead to expectations of the Fed keeping rates higher for longer, potentially putting downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . If the data is weaker, it might increase hopes for rate cuts, which could be a positive catalyst. Moreover, commentary from Federal Reserve officials throughout the week will be scrutinized for any hints about their future policy intentions. Their words can significantly impact market sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Actionable Insight: Keep a close eye on U.S. economic calendar releases, particularly labor data, and any statements from Federal Reserve members. These events can trigger volatility in the Bitcoin market trends . Tracking Bitcoin Market Trends: Stablecoin Flows and Sentiment Stablecoins play a critical role in the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat currencies. They are often used by traders to move in and out of positions quickly without converting back to fiat. Analyzing stablecoin movements on exchanges can offer valuable insights into market sentiment. A significant trend observed recently is the outflow of over $1 billion in stablecoins from the Binance exchange. Binance is one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, so large movements there can be indicative of broader market sentiment. When stablecoins flow onto exchanges, it often suggests traders are bringing capital in, ready to buy volatile assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, when stablecoins flow off exchanges, it can signal a ‘risk-off’ sentiment. What does ‘risk-off’ mean in this context? It means market participants are potentially reducing their exposure to volatile assets. They might be cashing out into stablecoins to sit on the sidelines during uncertain times, or they might be moving those stablecoins off-exchange to hold them securely or deploy them elsewhere (though large outflows often suggest a desire to exit volatile positions). This large outflow suggests a significant amount of capital that was potentially ready to buy or was recently holding stable value on the exchange has now left, indicating reduced immediate buying pressure or increased caution among a large group of users. This trend aligns with a potential pause or pullback scenario, reinforcing some of the technical signals like the RSI divergence. It’s a tangible sign of market participants reacting to current conditions by reducing risk. Observation: Large stablecoin outflows from major exchanges like Binance often point towards a cautious or ‘risk-off’ sentiment prevailing in the market, which can impact the immediate Bitcoin price outlook. Bitcoin Analysis: What Whale Activity Tells Us In the world of crypto, ‘whales’ are entities or individuals holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Tracking whale activity is a key component of sophisticated Bitcoin analysis . Recent data indicates that some whales have started engaging in profit-taking. After a substantial rally in the Bitcoin price , it’s natural for long-term holders or those who bought at lower prices to realize some gains. Profit-taking involves selling a portion of their holdings, converting it into stablecoins or fiat. While some degree of profit-taking is healthy and expected after a rally, a significant increase in whale selling can add selling pressure to the market. Analysts watch on-chain data closely to distinguish between minor distribution and large-scale selling that could signal a potential top or a deeper correction. Tools that track whale wallets and exchange flows are essential for this type of monitoring. The fact that whales are beginning to take profits suggests they may see the current price levels as opportune for exiting positions or reducing risk. This doesn’t necessarily mean they are bearish long-term, but it indicates a potential pause or a need for the market to absorb this selling pressure before moving higher. Insight: Whale profit-taking adds selling pressure and is a sign that large holders may believe current price levels represent a good opportunity to realize gains, impacting short-term Bitcoin market trends . Bitcoin Price Prediction Factors: Profitability and Potential Targets Beyond technical indicators and market participant behavior, on-chain metrics related to profitability also offer clues about the market’s state and potential future moves. One such metric looks at the percentage of Bitcoin supply currently in a state of profit (meaning the current price is higher than the price at which the coins were last moved). Historically, when a very high percentage of the Bitcoin supply is in profit, it can sometimes precede periods of increased selling pressure as more holders have an incentive to realize gains. However, high profitability also reflects a strong upward trend and overall positive sentiment. Some analysts are pointing to the current profitability levels, combined with other factors, as potentially leading Bitcoin toward a local top around the $120,000 mark. It’s crucial to understand that ‘local top’ doesn’t necessarily mean the absolute peak of a bull cycle. It suggests a potential temporary high point where the price might consolidate, pull back, or face significant resistance before potentially attempting to move higher later. Price targets like $120,000 are often derived from various models, historical patterns, or extensions of previous price movements. While such targets can be exciting, they should be viewed as possibilities based on certain conditions holding true, rather than guaranteed outcomes. The path to any target is rarely a straight line and is subject to the interplay of all the factors discussed above. Perspective: High on-chain profitability is typical of a strong market but can also increase the likelihood of profit-taking. The potential for Bitcoin to target $120,000 is an optimistic outlook based on certain models, but it would likely represent a significant resistance level or a ‘local top’ where price action could become challenging. Bringing It All Together: What to Watch This Week Navigating the crypto market analysis landscape this week requires a careful balancing act. On one hand, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable strength, reaching significant milestones. On the other hand, several signals suggest caution is warranted. Technical Signals: The potential RSI divergence highlights weakening momentum despite price strength. Macro Headwinds: Upcoming U.S. labor data and Fed commentary could introduce volatility based on inflation and interest rate expectations. Sentiment Check: Large stablecoin outflows from major exchanges signal a clear ‘risk-off’ sentiment among a segment of the market. Whale Movements: Whales beginning to take profits add potential selling pressure that the market needs to absorb. Profitability & Targets: High on-chain profitability could incentivize more selling, while ambitious price targets like $120K represent significant potential resistance zones. These five factors are not operating in isolation. They interact and influence each other. For example, negative macro news could exacerbate risk-off sentiment, leading to further stablecoin outflows and potentially more whale selling. Conversely, positive developments could override these cautionary signals. For investors and traders, the key this week is vigilance. Pay close attention to how the market reacts to the incoming U.S. data. Monitor on-chain metrics for changes in whale behavior and stablecoin flows. Observe how the Bitcoin price interacts with key support and resistance levels, especially if the RSI divergence plays out. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Informed Bitcoin Analysis The path forward for the Bitcoin price this week appears to be at a critical juncture. While the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish for many, the short-to-medium term presents a complex picture influenced by technical signals, macroeconomic forces, and significant market participant behavior. The potential for a slowdown indicated by RSI, combined with risk-off signals from stablecoin flows and whale activity, suggests that navigating the market requires careful consideration. Staying informed about these crucial Bitcoin market trends , coupled with a sound understanding of your own risk tolerance and investment goals, is paramount. Whether these factors lead to a temporary pullback or simply a period of consolidation before the next move, being aware of the potential headwinds and tailwinds allows for more informed decision-making in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

Zhao noted that considering the current market conditions, it is time to develop a dark pool-based perpetual DEX (decentralized futures exchange). CZ, in his post on X (formerly Twitter), pointed out that the fact that orders are public on decentralized exchanges poses serious risks for large investors. Zhao said that the market can be manipulated due to the visibility of liquidation points, especially in perpetual DEXs, and that this situation can expose users to MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) attacks, high slippage, and bad transaction prices: “In the traditional financial world, big investors prefer dark pools because they can secretly execute large orders. For perpetual trades, this secrecy is even more important because someone who sees your liquidation level can turn the market against you.” According to Zhao’s proposal, a next-generation DEX could solve this problem by hiding the order book or making investments in smart contracts visible with a delay. CZ argued that zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) or similar cryptographic techniques could be used in the development of this platform. *This is not investment advice.

NLH is led by Gin Chao, an independent Board member of Binance.US and former Strategy Officer of Binance.com , and was founded on the mission to accelerate value creation through blockchain technology globally. The firm launched CVP NoLimit Fund I (Fund I) in 2022, which invested into 40+ projects and has significantly outperformed Bitcoin with top decile DPI (distributed to paid-in capital) and MOIC (multiple on invested capital) metrics to date. This performance was achieved through disciplined underwriting into the fast-evolving infrastructure and DeFi landscapes as well as new sectors such as DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks). Fund I led the pre-seed round of Wynd Labs, a core contributor to Grass Protocol, one of the most successful DePIN projects developed to date. Grass allows users to earn rewards by sharing their unused internet bandwidth and verified institutions to access public web data through the network. Fund I also supported new L1s, Sei and Sui, as well as next-generation synthetic stablecoin Ethena. “NLH backed us when Grass was just an idea. Their conviction and early support helped Grass grow from concept to fueling some of the largest AI data pipelines in the world,” says Andrej Radonjic, Co-founder & CEO of Wynd Labs. NLH expects continued growth in the blockchain industry over the next five years, with total market capitalization approaching $15 trillion by 2030 as the regulatory environment stabilizes and institutional adoption accelerates. While leading Binance Labs in early 2019, Chao predicted Bitcoin’s 2021 cycle high of $50-100k after Bitcoin had declined 75% from $20k to $5k. When Bitcoin was under $20k after the FTX meltdown in late 2022, he called a Bitcoin high of around $150k for 2025. NLH anticipates a Bitcoin high of $400-500k in the upcoming cycle, gaining further market share against gold as both a hedge against sovereign risk and a more efficient store of value. “With increasing institutional adoption, our conviction in this industry is stronger than ever,” says Chao. “We’re not just investing in technical protocols – we’re backing systems that will underpin the next era of global finance, governance, authentication and transactions.” Fund II is positioned to lead early-stage investments into the latest generation of mission-first founders in the upcoming cycle. Fund I was an early investor into the cross-section of blockchain and AI, which continues to be one of several core pillars for Fund II. The team also sees significant opportunities emerging in B2C applications and recently launched its inaugural business plan competition in conjunction with leading FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) executives to develop blockchain solutions for global enterprises serving billions of consumers. “The CVP NoLimit funds have built an institutional franchise in three short years. We are excited about the partnerships with NLH, investors and industry leaders to drive use cases and adoption for the new economy,” says Harry Hui, co-founder of CVP.

The Sky (SKY) token, which recently became the sole governance token of the Sky Ecosystem protocol following a rebranding from Maker ( MKR ), ranked among top gainers as price spiked to highs of $0.073. A significant portion of the gains for SKY came amid the decentralized finance platform’s announcement that staking rewards with the USDS stablecoin were now live for SKY stakers. USDS rewards are now live for SKY Staking. SKY stakers gain access to USDS rewards based on protocol performance, while continuing to participate in governance through direct voting or delegation. pic.twitter.com/b0wWie1V8I — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) June 2, 2025 SKY sharply rose from lows of $0.065 to break above $0.073, recouping most of the losses seen when the altcoin plunged alongside the broader market on May 29.

Majority of Voters Want Fresh Crypto Laws, Poll Shows According to a poll conducted by Change Research spanning 1,825 participants, only 15% of voters believe existing federal regulations are suitable for the current crypto climate, while nearly 60% of respondents believe new regulations are needed across the digital asset sector. Today, we released a poll showing strong support for Congressional action and new laws for the Crypto industry. See the key findings below: pic.twitter.com/iqvWvxSNuo — CEDAR Innovation Foundation (@CIFonX) June 2, 2025 “The message from the poll is clear: The mandate voters delivered in the fall is still as strong as ever, and voters want Congress to act to create clear rules of the road for crypto,” Josh Vlasto, spokesperson for the Cedar Innovation Foundation , said in a June 2 press release. The organization’s poll further showed that strong support for new crypto legislation is found across the ideological spectrum, with 71% of Democrats, 56% of Independents, and 51% of Republicans all backing a new crypto regulatory framework. Meanwhile, 55% of voters of color expressed a desire for Congress to enact new digital asset laws as opposed to just applying existing legislation to the blockchain sector . “With strong support from Democrats, and key constituencies like young men and voters of color, these results demonstrate the feeling across the country and on Capitol Hill that this issue isn’t unique, but is a top concern for many Americans,” Vlasto added. “Congress needs to act now.” GENIUS Act Could See Key Senate Vote This Week The results of the Cedar Innovation Foundation’s latest poll come during an important week for crypto regulation stateside , with the Senate preparing to potentially vote on the GENIUS Act. The stablecoin legislative framework has garnered formidable bipartisan support despite political polarization over U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures in recent weeks. However, it is still unclear whether U.S. lawmakers can generate enough support to formally advance the legislation in the coming days.

This impressive figure extends a remarkable streak, pushing the total inflows over the last seven weeks to a staggering $10.9 billion. This sustained interest, detailed in a recent Medium blog post by James Butterfill of CoinShares Research, underscores a prevailing positive sentiment in the crypto market, particularly among investors utilizing regulated investment vehicles like ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) and funds. What’s Driving Crypto Fund Inflows? The latest report from CoinShares highlights the continued appetite for digital assets, channelled through structured investment products. These products offer investors, particularly institutions and those seeking regulated access, a familiar way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. The consistent inflows over the past seven weeks suggest that the recent price consolidation and upward movements have bolstered investor confidence, rather than leading to widespread profit-taking. Key data points from the CoinShares report: Total Weekly Inflows: $286 million Total Inflows Over 7 Weeks: $10.9 billion Leading Asset (Past Week): Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum Weekly Inflows: $321 million Bitcoin Weekly Flow: $8 million outflows Source: CoinShares Research (James Butterfill) While the overall picture is overwhelmingly positive with significant Crypto Fund Inflows , a closer look reveals interesting shifts in investor preference within the digital asset space. Ethereum Investment Takes the Lead Breaking down the weekly figures, Ethereum (ETH) emerged as the star performer, attracting a substantial $321 million in inflows. This marked a significant shift from recent weeks where Bitcoin typically dominated the inflow charts. The strong interest in Ethereum Investment could be attributed to several factors: Anticipation surrounding potential future upgrades or developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. Market rotation as investors look for opportunities in large-cap altcoins after significant runs in Bitcoin. Increased activity and interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors, which primarily reside on the Ethereum network. Growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition as the leading smart contract platform. This surge in ETH-focused products indicates a diversifying trend within the market, where investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital beyond just Bitcoin. Understanding the Nuances of Bitcoin Investment While the overall inflow number is high, the report noted a temporary shift in momentum for Bitcoin (BTC) mid-week, resulting in minor outflows totaling $8 million by the week’s end. This doesn’t necessarily signal a bearish turn for Bitcoin Investment but rather could reflect: Some investors taking profits after Bitcoin’s strong performance in previous weeks. A temporary rotation of capital into Ethereum and other altcoins, seeking higher potential short-term gains. Specific trading strategies employed by institutions or large investors using these products. Despite this small weekly outflow, Bitcoin products still account for the vast majority of the $10.9 billion accumulated over the past seven weeks, underscoring its continued dominance as the primary gateway for institutional crypto exposure. What CoinShares Data Tells Us About Market Sentiment? The consistent inflow trend, as highlighted by the latest CoinShares Data , serves as a powerful indicator of current market sentiment. A seven-week streak of positive inflows, culminating in nearly $11 billion, suggests strong underlying demand and confidence among investors accessing the market via regulated products. This level of sustained inflow hasn’t been seen for a considerable period and points towards: Increased Institutional Adoption: Regulated products are often the preferred route for institutional players, suggesting growing participation from larger funds and wealth managers. Positive Market Outlook: Investors are seemingly buying the dips and adding to positions, indicating a belief that the current price levels represent opportunities rather than peaks. Maturity of the Market: The availability and popularity of these investment vehicles reflect the increasing maturity and accessibility of the digital asset class. While individual weekly flows can fluctuate between assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the overarching trend of significant net inflows into the sector remains a compelling narrative. Benefits and Challenges of Investing via Digital Asset Products Investing in cryptocurrencies through Digital Asset Products offers several benefits: Accessibility: Easier access for traditional investors and institutions. Regulation: Products are often regulated, providing a layer of oversight. Custody: Removes the burden of self-custody for the investor. However, challenges exist: Fees: These products typically charge management fees. Tracking Error: The product’s performance may not perfectly mirror the underlying asset. Limited Options: Product availability may be limited compared to direct market access. Despite these points, the continued inflows indicate that for many investors, the benefits outweigh the challenges, making these products a preferred method for gaining exposure. Actionable Insights from the Inflow Data For investors watching the market, the latest CoinShares Data provides valuable insights: Broad Market Strength: The overall $10.9 billion inflow signals strong underlying demand for the crypto asset class as a whole. Potential for Rotation: Ethereum’s strong performance this week suggests potential investor rotation into large-cap altcoins. While Bitcoin saw minor outflows, its dominance over the streak indicates its foundational role. Sentiment Indicator: Sustained inflows via regulated products are a positive long-term sentiment indicator, pointing towards increasing mainstream acceptance and investment. Keeping an eye on these inflow trends can help investors gauge market sentiment and potential areas of interest within the digital asset ecosystem. Conclusion: A Streak of Confidence The digital asset market continues its impressive run of positive inflows into investment products, extending the streak to seven weeks and accumulating nearly $11 billion. While Bitcoin saw a slight pause with minor outflows last week, the significant $321 million inflow into Ethereum products highlights diversifying investor interest and strength in the broader market. The sustained flow of capital into these regulated vehicles, as reported by CoinShares, is a strong testament to growing institutional and mainstream confidence in the digital asset class, painting a bullish picture for the sector’s near-term trajectory.

It’s not just about internal crypto trends; the broader global economic landscape, often referred to as macro factors , plays a significant role. Think of it like a ship navigating both internal engine performance and external ocean currents and weather patterns. Here are some of the key macro headwinds impacting Bitcoin and the wider market: Renewed U.S. Tariffs: Imposing tariffs on goods from other countries can disrupt global supply chains, potentially leading to increased costs for businesses and consumers. This can dampen economic activity and lead investors to become more cautious, pulling back from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Surging U.S. Treasury Yields: When the yields on government bonds rise, they offer investors a relatively safe return. Higher bond yields make riskier investments, like Bitcoin, comparatively less attractive. This can lead to capital flowing out of crypto and into traditional safe havens. General Economic Uncertainty: Beyond specific policies, a general climate of economic uncertainty, influenced by inflation concerns, geopolitical events, and shifts in monetary policy, can lead to reduced risk appetite across financial markets. These external pressures create a less favorable environment for assets that have experienced rapid appreciation, making them more susceptible to pullbacks. Market Overheating: Signs from Derivatives and On-Chain Data While macro factors provide the external context, internal market indicators were also flashing warning signs that a correction might be on the horizon. The rapid 50% rally created conditions ripe for a reset. Key indicators pointed towards potential overheating: Derivatives Market Activity: The open interest in BTC options, a measure of the total number of outstanding options contracts, hit an all-time high of $49.4 billion. This massive figure indicates a significant amount of speculation and hedging activity. High open interest can signal leverage building up in the system, which can lead to cascading liquidations during price drops, accelerating the correction. On-Chain Indicators: Analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain itself provides valuable insights into investor behavior. Indicators like the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) or Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) can signal when a large portion of the market is sitting on significant unrealized profits. When these indicators reach certain thresholds, they suggest a state of ‘euphoria’ and historically precede ‘local tops’ – temporary peaks before a price decline as investors take profits. Combined, the high leverage in derivatives and the ‘euphoria’ signals from on-chain data suggested the market was technically primed for a cooldown. The rally was strong, but perhaps too fast, leading to an unsustainable level of speculative positioning. Is This Correction Structural Weakness or a Healthy Reset for BTC Price? A crucial question during any significant price drop is whether it signals fundamental problems with the asset or market, or if it’s a normal part of the market cycle. According to the Bitfinex report and many analysts focused on Bitcoin analysis , the current decline appears to be the latter – a healthy reset. Here’s why it’s viewed as a normal, rather than structural, correction: Profit-Taking: After a 50% rally, many investors who bought at lower prices are naturally looking to lock in gains. This selling pressure is a primary driver of the initial price drop. Leverage Unwinding: As the price falls, leveraged positions (trades made with borrowed funds) start to incur losses. If losses exceed margin requirements, these positions are automatically closed (liquidated), forcing more selling onto the market. This ‘unwinding’ process is painful in the short term but flushes excessive risk out of the system. Lack of Fundamental Issues: The correction isn’t being driven by a problem with Bitcoin’s underlying technology, security, or adoption trajectory. The network is functioning as intended, and long-term adoption trends remain positive. Corrections are a natural and often necessary part of asset markets, especially volatile ones like crypto. They shake out speculative excess, allow prices to consolidate, and can create healthier conditions for future growth by bringing prices back to more sustainable levels based on fundamental value and adoption. Beyond the Pullback: The Enduring Story of Global Bitcoin Adoption Despite the short-term price volatility and macro headwinds, the long-term trend of global Bitcoin adoption continues unabated. This underlies the argument that the current correction is not structural. Here are some recent examples highlighting crypto’s continued integration into global finance: GameStop’s $513M BTC Buy: The video game retailer announced a significant purchase of Bitcoin for its corporate treasury. This follows a trend of publicly traded companies adding BTC to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, signaling increasing institutional confidence. U.S. Easing 401(k) Crypto Restrictions: Regulatory moves in the U.S. are making it potentially easier for individuals to include crypto investments in their retirement plans. This opens up a massive pool of capital to the crypto market and signals a growing acceptance by financial regulators (though challenges remain). Russia Allowing Crypto-Linked Instruments: Reports indicate Russia is moving towards allowing certain financial instruments linked to cryptocurrencies for qualified investors. While potentially driven by geopolitical factors and a desire for alternative financial rails, it nonetheless represents a significant step towards legitimizing crypto within a major global economy. Continued Infrastructure Development: Payment processors, financial institutions, and technology companies continue to build infrastructure around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making them easier to buy, sell, and use. These developments demonstrate that while the price may fluctuate due to market cycles and macro events, the underlying trend of integration and adoption into mainstream finance and commerce remains strong. This is a critical factor for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Navigating a Bitcoin correction can be challenging, but understanding the context provides clarity. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of both crypto-specific news (on-chain data, development updates) and global macro trends (interest rates, inflation, geopolitical events). Understand Market Cycles: Corrections are normal. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Focus on your long-term investment strategy. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aligns with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Volatility is inherent in this market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider using a DCA strategy, investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. Corrections can be opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices. Reduce Leverage: If you are using leverage in derivatives markets, be acutely aware of the liquidation risks during periods of high volatility and potential corrections. Focusing on the long-term potential and the fundamental adoption trends, rather than getting caught up in short-term price swings, is key to successful participation in the crypto market. Conclusion: A Necessary Pause in Bitcoin’s Journey The recent Bitcoin correction , following a substantial rally and reaching notable highs, is a complex event driven by a confluence of factors. Macroeconomic headwinds, including U.S. tariffs and rising Treasury yields, have created a less favorable environment for risk assets. Simultaneously, signs of overheating within the crypto market itself, such as record high options open interest and on-chain euphoria signals, indicated that a pullback was technically overdue. However, the analysis suggests this is a healthy, albeit sharp, reset driven by natural market forces like profit-taking and the unwinding of excessive leverage, rather than any fundamental structural weakness in Bitcoin or the broader crypto ecosystem. The continued global adoption by corporations like GameStop, easing regulatory stances, and integration into traditional finance underscore the enduring strength and potential of Bitcoin beyond short-term price volatility. For investors, understanding these dynamics and focusing on long-term strategy, rather than reacting emotionally to price swings, is paramount during such market phases. This correction, while potentially uncomfortable, serves to strengthen the market foundation for future growth.

Ex-CFTC Official Joins Blockchain Association as CEO, Calls for Pro-Crypto Unity According to a June 2 X thread from Mersinger, the one-time CFTC commissioner is pushing for collaboration across the digital asset sector as it reaches a “critical juncture for crypto policy.” 1/ Today is my first day as CEO of @BlockchainAssn – and I couldn’t be more excited to join this powerful and growing community. — Summer Mersinger (@SKMersinger) June 2, 2025 “There’s a growing crypto caucus in Congress, we have an executive branch that sees the inherent benefits of digital assets, and our regulatory agencies have turned the page from antagonism to collaboration,” Mersinger said. “But we need to capture this moment and push pro-crypto policy across the finish line,” she added. Mersinger then noted that she will kick off the Blockchain Association’s Summit Series in Washington, D.C., on June 5 as one of her first stops as CEO of the crypto collective and the event’s keynote speaker. Fellow speakers slated to attend include Congressman French Hill (R-AR), Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI), and United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce. “Today marks a new chapter for this community and for the Blockchain Association,” Mersinger added. “One built on shared purpose, collective energy, and a clear direction.

Dogecoin, the original meme coin, continues its reign as a community-driven digital currency. However, the rise of Ruvi AI , a blockchain-powered tech pioneer with real-world utility, is drawing attention from serious investors. With an ambitious $1 token target and growing holder enthusiasm, Ruvi AI appears to offer a path to more substantive, long-term growth. Could this give it an edge over Dogecoin?

Ruvi AI, by contrast, appeals to investors who value practicality and innovation over viral popularity. Its technology-driven solutions, coupled with scalable infrastructure, make it a serious contender as crypto markets mature. While Dogecoin’s popularity largely depends on social media buzz and endorsements, Ruvi AI builds its case on concrete achievements and forward-focused strategies.

The best long term cryptos are no longer just about hype, but about real infrastructure, scalability, and community momentum. From established giants like XRP to meme-driven names such as PEPE and WIF, the landscape is filled with diverse contenders. Each brings something different, from regulatory progress to viral traction, creating a wide field of opportunity. One project that is starting to rise above the noise is BlockDAG (BDAG) . With a powerful tech stack, aggressive roadmap, and over $281 million raised, it is shaping up to be one of the best long term cryptos to watch in 2025. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): $0.0018 Window Closes Soon as $1 Target Gains Steam BlockDAG is gaining serious momentum, with over $281 million raised and 21.8 billion BDAG coins already sold. The current price is still locked at just $0.0018 until June 13, offering a rare chance to secure a position before it jumps back to presale batch pricing. With Batch 28 priced at $0.0262, early-stage buyers already saw a 2,520% ROI, placing BlockDAG among the best long-term cryptos available in presale right now. What sets BlockDAG apart is its real utility. The X1 Miner App already has over 1 million users mining BDAG from their smartphones, turning mobile devices into revenue tools. Combined with its EVM compatibility, the platform is attracting Ethereum developers looking for faster, lower-cost deployment across DeFi, NFT, and GameFi ecosystems. Scheduled for June 13, BlockDAG’s GO LIVE reveal will announce 15 upcoming centralized exchange listings, joining the five already confirmed. As visibility skyrockets and the tech ecosystem expands, BlockDAG continues to check every box for those seeking the best long-term cryptos in 2025. 2. Dogwifhat (WIF): Meme Power Meets Long-Term Potential Dogwifhat is trading near $1.08 and gaining traction as one of the best long-term cryptos in the meme space. Despite recent minor pullbacks, WIF has shown notable price stability. Analysts expect it to hover between $0.82 and $0.88 through June and July, with bullish technical signs beginning to flash. Momentum is building thanks to a strong RSI and BBP setup, suggesting WIF could be gearing up for another breakout. Backed by a dedicated community and deep liquidity, Dogwifhat is emerging from meme status to become a serious contender. For those eyeing long-term speculative plays, WIF is proving hard to ignore. 3. Pepe (PEPE): Technical Setup Could Trigger the Next Meme Rally Pepe is holding steady near $0.0000142 and continues to dominate conversations across social platforms. Though its recent gains have been modest, technical formations like the cup-and-handle are hinting at a possible breakout. June projections range between $0.00001060 and $0.00001133, keeping PEPE firmly in focus. Its consistent engagement and strong meme coin identity keep it among the best long-term cryptos within this segment. PEPE is more than just market noise. It is quietly building a technical base that could launch the next leg of growth. Speculators looking for timing plays may want to keep this one close. 4. XRP: Regulatory Momentum Could Send XRP into Overdrive XRP is trading around $2.26 and is once again making headlines as one of the best long-term cryptos to watch. Analysts are forecasting a near-term target of $2.60, with more aggressive outlooks pushing toward $10 if favorable conditions continue. The key driver here is regulation. With legal clarity emerging, XRP is poised to benefit from increased institutional attention. Its cross-border payment utility gives it a use case few tokens can match. If the current momentum continues, XRP may be gearing up for one of its strongest runs in years. Final Thoughts In a market overflowing with short-term noise, the best long-term cryptos are defined by real utility and lasting growth potential. While XRP leads with regulatory momentum and meme coins like WIF and PEPE capture social firepower, BlockDAG is building something much bigger. With over $281 million raised, a live mobile miner app used by more than a million active users, and an EVM-compatible Layer 1 architecture, BlockDAG is delivering both tech and traction. At just $0.0018 until June 13, it offers one of the clearest setups for exponential gains, firmly earning its place among the best long-term cryptos of 2025.

According to real-time market monitoring, BTC price has fallen below the significant $104,000 threshold, a level closely watched by traders and investors alike. This movement is fresh Bitcoin news impacting the broader crypto market . Why Did the Bitcoin Price Just Fall Below $104,000? The recent price action saw Bitcoin falls to $103,959.88 on the Binance USDT market, confirming the breach of the $104,000 mark. While a drop below a specific number might seem minor, $104,000 has acted as a psychological and potentially technical level for market participants. Understanding the factors behind such movements is key to navigating the volatile crypto market . Several potential factors could contribute to a sudden drop in Bitcoin price : Market Sentiment Shifts: General fear, uncertainty, or doubt (FUD) can quickly spread, leading to sell-offs. Macroeconomic Factors: News related to inflation, interest rates, or global economic stability can influence investor risk appetite, affecting assets like Bitcoin. Profit-Taking: Traders who bought at lower prices may decide to sell as the price approaches or reaches certain levels, triggering a cascade effect. Technical Resistance: Price levels can act as resistance points where selling pressure increases. A failure to break convincingly above $104,000 might have led to a pullback. Regulatory News: Updates or rumors about cryptocurrency regulations in major economies can significantly impact market confidence. Pinpointing a single cause is often difficult in the complex crypto market , but a combination of these elements likely played a role in the recent Bitcoin falls . Understanding the Significance of the $104,000 Level for BTC Price Why is $104,000 a level worth mentioning? Round numbers often hold psychological importance in financial markets. Traders and algorithms may place orders around these levels, making them temporary support or resistance points. For the BTC price , breaching such a level can signal a shift in short-term momentum. Technically, $104,000 might align with specific chart patterns, moving averages, or Fibonacci retracement levels that technical analysts follow. A confirmed break below a significant level like this can sometimes lead to further downward movement as stop-loss orders are triggered. Level Type Significance Potential Impact if Broken $104,000 Psychological/Minor Technical Support Increased selling pressure, test of lower support levels Next Potential Support Historical Price Levels, Moving Averages Potential area for price stabilization or bounce Previous Resistance Levels BTC struggled to break above recently Could become new resistance if retested from below Monitoring how the Bitcoin price interacts with levels immediately below $104,000 will provide more clues about the market’s short-term direction. This is crucial Bitcoin news for anyone tracking market dynamics. What Does This Bitcoin News Mean for the Crypto Market and Your Portfolio? When Bitcoin falls , it often has a ripple effect across the entire crypto market . Altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead, though some may react more or less dramatically depending on their own fundamentals and market cycles. This dip in BTC price can present both challenges and opportunities for investors. Challenges: Increased volatility and potential for further price drops. Emotional stress for holders seeing portfolio values decrease. Uncertainty about the short-term market direction. Opportunities: Potential buying opportunity for long-term investors at a lower price. Chance to rebalance portfolios. Learning experience about market reactions to key price levels. It’s important not to make impulsive decisions based solely on this piece of Bitcoin news . A single price dip, even below a notable level like $104,000, is part of Bitcoin’s characteristic volatility. Long-term perspective is often advised in the crypto market . Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights Following Bitcoin Falls Reacting calmly and strategically is essential when the Bitcoin price experiences a drop. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand why the price might be falling and assess the overall market conditions beyond just the $104,000 level. Review Your Investment Strategy: Are you a long-term holder or a short-term trader? Your strategy should dictate your response. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market bottom, consider buying a fixed amount of Bitcoin regularly, regardless of the BTC price . A dip can be an opportunity to buy at a discount using this method. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. If you use leverage, be aware of liquidation risks during volatile periods. Stay Informed: Keep track of relevant Bitcoin news and broader market analysis. Avoid Panic Selling: Selling impulsively during a dip often locks in losses. Unless your original investment thesis has fundamentally changed, consider holding or even accumulating. The history of Bitcoin falls shows that dips are a normal part of its price journey. While this specific drop below $104,000 is the current focus, understanding the underlying market dynamics is more valuable than fixating on a single price point. The Broader Crypto Market Reaction and Future Outlook for BTC Price How the rest of the crypto market reacts to the Bitcoin price dip below $104,000 will be telling. If altcoins see significant sell-offs, it might indicate broader market weakness. Conversely, if they hold relatively strong, it could suggest that this particular dip is more Bitcoin-specific or a short-term correction. Predicting the future BTC price is notoriously difficult. However, analysts will be watching key technical levels below $104,000 for potential support. A quick bounce back above $104,000 could indicate that the level acted as a ‘fakeout’ or a short-lived dip before continuation upwards. A sustained period below this level might signal further downside potential towards the next major support zones. Ultimately, the long-term trajectory of Bitcoin is influenced by adoption, technological development (like the Lightning Network or potential ETFs), regulatory clarity, and its role as a potential store of value or digital gold. Short-term fluctuations, like the current Bitcoin falls below $104,000, are part of the journey. Conclusion: Navigating the Dip in Bitcoin Price The news that the Bitcoin price has fallen below $104,000 is a key development in the current crypto market cycle. While the exact cause is multifaceted, likely involving market sentiment, technical factors, and broader economic influences, this event highlights the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency investments. For investors, this moment serves as a reminder to adhere to a well-defined strategy, practice sound risk management, and stay informed through reliable Bitcoin news sources. Whether this dip represents a fleeting moment or the start of a larger correction remains to be seen, but understanding the context and potential implications is crucial for making informed decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets.

45430377,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69463,1748898236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Journalist Calls This Ripple CTO Statement the Biggest News of the XRP Las Vegas,https://timestabloid.com/journalist-calls-this-ripple-cto-statement-the-biggest-news-of-the-xrp-las-vegas/,"At the recently concluded XRP Las Vegas event, a powerful revelation emerged, but surprisingly, it has yet to make the front pages of Ripple news coverage. Journalist and well-known XRP community voice VincentScott took to X to declare what he believes was the most groundbreaking moment of the conference: a clear, confirmed statement from Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, that Ripple has indeed built a comprehensive financial system. VincentScott’s Revelation at XRP Las Vegas VincentScott recounted the moment in a now widely circulating post on X. According to him, he posed a precise and technical question directly to Schwartz: whether what Ripple has built constitutes a financial system where the unit of account, RLUSD, transmits over a decentralized method of payment- the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and uses XRP as either gas or a money processor to convert. Schwartz’s answer was unambiguous: “Yes, you can consider those things a financial system.” Recorded within 3minutes of the interaction after I maneuvered to get to him when he was swarmed by people https://t.co/fEZw76pRyR — VincentScott (@VincentSco72192) June 2, 2025 VincentScott, recognizing the significance of this confirmation, shook Schwartz’s hand, walked away, and immediately recorded a video to document the encounter. While many in the XRP community had long deduced or speculated that Ripple’s technological framework essentially constitutes a financial system, receiving that clear acknowledgment from the company’s CTO is, as VincentScott put it, “a horse of a different color.” Understanding the Confirmation: Why It Matters For years, Ripple has been positioning itself as a central player in the evolution of global finance. Its core offering – cross-border payments using the XRP token- leverages the power of the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain that enables rapid, low-cost transfers across currencies and jurisdictions. The introduction of RLUSD, Ripple’s real-world asset-backed stablecoin, has added another layer to this framework, providing a stable unit of account that integrates seamlessly with the XRPL. What VincentScott’s report underscores is the cohesive architecture Ripple has built: RLUSD as the unit of account, XRPL as the payment rails, and XRP as the bridge or gas that facilitates value conversion. This alignment effectively mirrors the components of a full-fledged financial system, something not all blockchain projects can claim. While crypto networks often handle specific pieces of the puzzle, Ripple’s design integrates the three essential elements: unit, rails, and conversion mechanism. Ripple’s Quiet Power Play Despite the magnitude of this revelation, VincentScott pointed out the irony that it has not dominated Ripple’s media headlines. “Crazy it’s not front page Ripple news,” he commented, capturing the sentiment that sometimes the most profound confirmations can slip under the radar simply because they formalize what many already assumed. But formal acknowledgment matters, especially in an industry where regulatory scrutiny, technological promises, and market speculation often collide. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s work with central banks has placed it under a magnifying lens. Confirming that it has constructed a full financial system, not just a payments protocol, positions Ripple even more centrally in discussions about the future of finance, digital money, and decentralized infrastructure. What This Means for the XRP Ecosystem For XRP holders, developers on the XRPL, and institutional partners watching Ripple’s progress, this confirmation is a key validation point. It means that Ripple is not merely building tools or applications on top of a ledger; it has constructed an interconnected financial ecosystem. RLUSD will likely play a pivotal role as Ripple expands its stablecoin strategy, and XRP’s dual function, both as a means of gas and a liquidity bridge, cements its role at the heart of the system. This comprehensive architecture gives Ripple a unique edge as global financial institutions increasingly look toward blockchain solutions that can offer scalability, regulatory compliance, and interoperability. While competitors like Stellar, SWIFT, and other cross-border initiatives work on similar solutions, Ripple’s fully integrated system, now publicly confirmed by its top technical architect, marks a powerful statement of maturity and readiness.

The data is in, and it paints a picture of booming activity in the stablecoin sector. We’re seeing record numbers that highlight the increasing importance of these digital assets and the infrastructure supporting them. Let’s dive into the details behind these impressive milestones. Why is Stablecoin Usage Skyrocketing? Recent data reveals a significant surge in stablecoin usage , reaching unprecedented levels. According to Wu Blockchain, citing figures from Artemis, active stablecoin addresses climbed to a staggering 33.1 million in May. This isn’t just a small bump; it’s an all-time high, signaling robust and growing participation in the stablecoin ecosystem. But why are so many people actively using stablecoins? Several factors contribute to this growth: DeFi Activity: Stablecoins are the lifeblood of decentralized finance (DeFi). Increased participation in lending protocols, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and yield farming requires stablecoins for trading pairs, collateral, and liquidity provision. Trading and Arbitrage: Traders frequently use stablecoins to move quickly between different cryptocurrencies or to hold value during volatile market periods without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely. Payments and Remittances: While still nascent compared to traditional systems, stablecoins are increasingly being explored and used for faster, cheaper cross-border payments and remittances, especially in regions with unstable local currencies. Accessibility: Stablecoins offer a relatively easy entry point into the crypto world, providing a digital dollar (or other fiat peg) that feels more familiar than volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Multi-Chain Expansion: Stablecoins are available on a growing number of blockchain networks, making them accessible to users across various ecosystems. The sheer volume of active addresses underscores that stablecoins are moving beyond just speculative trading tools and becoming fundamental infrastructure for a wide range of financial activities within the digital asset space. Circle CCTP Volume Reaches New Heights Adding to the positive trend, Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) also achieved a significant milestone in May. CCTP volume hit an all-time high, recording an impressive $7.7 billion transferred across various chains. This represents a massive 83.3% increase compared to the volume seen in April. For those unfamiliar, Circle is the issuer of USDC , one of the largest and most widely used stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. CCTP is their native solution designed specifically to facilitate fast, secure, and capital-efficient transfers of USDC between different blockchain networks. Unlike traditional bridges that might involve locking and minting wrapped assets, CCTP ‘burns’ USDC on the source chain and ‘mints’ equivalent native USDC on the destination chain. The dramatic increase in Circle CCTP volume highlights the growing demand for seamless interoperability within the crypto landscape. As users and applications spread across multiple blockchains (like Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Avalanche, etc.), the need to move assets, particularly stable assets like USDC, efficiently becomes paramount. The Growing Need for Seamless Cross-Chain Transfers The crypto ecosystem is no longer confined to a single blockchain. We live in a multi-chain world, with different networks offering unique advantages in terms of speed, cost, and functionality. This fragmentation, while beneficial for innovation, creates a challenge: how do you move assets and data between these isolated environments? This is where cross-chain transfers become crucial. Historically, moving assets between chains often involved using third-party bridges. While effective, these bridges can sometimes introduce risks, such as smart contract vulnerabilities or reliance on centralized relayers. They can also be slower or less capital-efficient. Circle’s CCTP offers a more direct and potentially more secure method for transferring native USDC. By burning and minting, it reduces reliance on wrapped assets and minimizes some of the risks associated with traditional bridging mechanisms. The record volume on CCTP clearly indicates that users and developers are increasingly leveraging this native solution for their interoperability needs, preferring a streamlined way to move USDC across the digital asset landscape. What These Records Tell Us About Crypto Market Trends The simultaneous record highs in active stablecoin addresses and Circle’s CCTP volume are powerful indicators of underlying crypto market trends . They suggest: Increased Adoption & Activity: More active addresses mean more individuals and entities are interacting with stablecoins, pointing towards broader adoption and utilization beyond just speculation. Maturing Infrastructure: The surge in CCTP volume shows that the infrastructure supporting cross-chain movement of assets is gaining traction and becoming more essential for ecosystem growth. Demand for Interoperability: The multi-chain future is here, and there’s a clear demand for efficient, reliable ways to move value between networks. CCTP is filling a vital role in meeting this demand for USDC. Confidence in Stablecoins: The high usage numbers also reflect a level of confidence in stablecoins as a reliable store of value and medium of exchange within the crypto space, despite past market volatility. These trends are not isolated events but rather interconnected developments showcasing the evolution and expansion of the decentralized economy. As more applications are built across different chains, the need for robust stablecoin infrastructure and seamless cross-chain capabilities will only continue to grow. Looking Ahead: The Future of Stablecoins and Cross-Chain Solutions The record-breaking numbers in May suggest a positive trajectory for both stablecoin adoption and cross-chain technology. As the crypto market matures, the utility of stablecoins in facilitating transactions, enabling DeFi, and providing stability is becoming undeniable. Simultaneously, the demand for efficient cross-chain transfers will likely increase as more Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks gain prominence. Solutions like Circle’s CCTP are at the forefront of enabling this multi-chain future. Their success indicates that users are actively seeking out reliable and efficient ways to navigate the complex blockchain landscape. While challenges remain, including regulatory clarity and further technological advancements, the current trends paint an optimistic picture for the role of stablecoins and interoperability protocols in the future of finance. Conclusion: A Milestone Month for Stablecoins and Interoperability May proved to be a landmark month for the stablecoin ecosystem and cross-chain technology. With active stablecoin addresses hitting a record 33.1 million and Circle’s CCTP volume surging to an all-time high of $7.7 billion, the data clearly demonstrates increasing activity and demand. These milestones underscore the growing importance of stablecoins as foundational elements in the crypto economy and highlight the critical need for efficient cross-chain transfers to connect the expanding multi-chain world. As these trends continue, we can expect stablecoins and interoperability solutions like CCTP to play an even more central role in shaping the future of digital finance.

The shake-up comes as the Switzerland-based nonprofit grapples with ongoing criticism over its management and strategic direction . Some in the Ethereum community have warned for over a year that failure to address key technical hurdles could threaten Ethereum's status as an industry leader , and the organization has already undergone leadership changes in part to address these concerns. The foundation is rebranding its Protocol Research and Development division under the simplified name “Protocol,” and is repositioning the group around three main priorities: scaling Ethereum’s base layer, expanding blobspace (a key part of its data availability strategy), and improving user experience. “The changes we’re announcing today are a departure from our previous ways of working, but we feel these set us on a more responsive and effective path,” the foundation said in its post. The EF did not disclose how many staff were affected by the layoffs. “[S]ome members of PR&D won’t be continuing with the Ethereum Foundation,” the blog stated. “We hope these individuals continue on in the Ethereum ecosystem and encourage others building out their teams to seek them out.” A spokesperson for the foundation did not respond to a request for comment. The restructured Protocol team will serve as a hub for Ethereum’s core development efforts, aiming to improve public visibility into upgrade timelines, technical documentation, and research. “We're hopeful that this new structure will empower our internal teams to focus more clearly and drive key initiatives forward,” said Hsiao-Wei Weng, the co-executive director at the EF in a post on X .

Bitcoin’s recent dip below $104K triggered over $600 million in liquidations, rattling markets and flushing out high-leverage players. Meanwhile, XRP has stunned the crypto world with projections aiming for a $1.5 trillion market cap, and Hedera finds itself battling stiff resistance at current levels. But beneath these high-profile moves lies a project generating serious traction from the ground up— Qubetics , a Web3 infrastructure play with a unique toolkit and a presale already over $17.6 million raised. While XRP and Hedera spark headlines, Qubetics ($TICS) is building quietly—and methodically. By offering interoperable development environments and a frictionless cross-chain user experience, it’s solving practical headaches many still ignore. The project’s emphasis on developer usability and enterprise-grade deployment tools could be exactly what the market rewards next. For those tracking real fundamentals, Qubetics is becoming a clear contender for the best crypto to invest in June 2025. QubeQode and Qubetics IDE: The Toolkit Driving a Multi-Chain Future Qubetics brings something to the table few others have: a practical toolkit for real blockchain deployment. Its application suite—headlined by QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE (Integrated Development Environment)—was built to solve one of crypto’s biggest barriers: the complexity of building, testing, and launching across different blockchains. Let’s break this down with some real-world relevance. A fintech startup in Austin can build a dApp on Ethereum, test it on Binance Smart Chain, and deploy it on Polygon—all from one clean dashboard. Meanwhile, a solo developer in Toronto could fork smart contract templates, simulate trades, and publish to multiple testnets without writing deployment scripts from scratch. That’s the kind of workflow Qubetics is offering—and it’s why engineers are quietly taking notice. This all runs on Qubetics’ Web3 aggregator infrastructure, which allows seamless switching between blockchains for both front-end users and backend developers. As multi-chain functionality becomes not just a feature but a requirement, Qubetics is already offering a professional-grade suite. It’s no surprise that more early adopters are identifying it as the best crypto to invest in June 2025 , especially for those betting on dev-first ecosystems that can scale. Presale Surges to $17.6M—Here’s Why Qubetics May Be the Best Crypto to Invest in June 2025 The Qubetics presale has become a data-backed case study in how to do early-stage funding right. Now in Stage 37, each stage runs only 7 days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. The current token price stands at $0.3370, and the project has already raised over $17.6 million, with more than 514 million $TICS tokens sold to a growing base of 27,400+ participants. Here’s where it gets compelling: early buyers are seeing projected returns that beat most of what’s on the market. If $TICS hits: $1, that’s 196.65% ROI $5 means 1,383.25% $10 delivers 2,866.51% And $15 brings a staggering 4,349.76% Take a simple $100 purchase at the current price. That turns into nearly $1,483 if $TICS hits $5, or $2,966 at $10. With the Qubetics mainnet scheduled for Q2 2025, that timeline aligns with realistic growth cycles, and many are treating this as the best crypto pre sale on the market today. It’s not just about ROI though. The Qubetics presale is tied directly to platform development benchmarks. Unlike other pre-sales that gamble on hype, $TICS buyers are funding ecosystem tools that already have active builds and user cases. That direct utility is a major reason Qubetics is considered the best crypto to invest in June 2025. Hedera Trades Near Resistance—Analysts Watch for Reversal or Breakout Hedera (HBAR) is facing a technical stalemate. According to CryptoDaily, HBAR is currently trading near its key resistance level of $0.11, where price action has repeatedly failed to sustain upward momentum. Recent charts show the token forming a tight range pattern with descending volume, a common signal that a larger move may be brewing—but it’s unclear whether it will be up or down. Analysts are watching closely for confirmation signals. A strong breakout above the $0.11 mark could send HBAR toward the next resistance at $0.13, but failure to break may trigger a retest of support around $0.096. Current indicators are mixed: the MACD shows convergence, and the RSI is neutral, offering little clarity on directional bias. Despite the uncertainty, Hedera’s strength lies in its enterprise partnerships and layer-1 architecture, which continue to attract attention. But in a market increasingly focused on near-term performance and user-level impact, HBAR’s sideways structure may cause some to explore alternatives like Qubetics that combine infrastructure ambition with token momentum. XRP Eyes $1.5 Trillion Market Cap Amid Growing Institutional Focus According to Disrupt Africa, XRP is being modeled by some analysts to reach a market cap of $1.5 trillion, a projection grounded in Ripple’s growing dominance in institutional and cross-border payments. This valuation implies XRP achieving a price of $27.63 per token, assuming current supply models remain constant. The core thesis behind this forecast is Ripple’s increasing traction with banking institutions and regulators, as well as rising demand for scalable, legal-compliant blockchain frameworks. The report highlights Ripple’s ongoing push into developing markets, with adoption accelerating in regions like Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, where traditional remittance systems are expensive and slow. However, analysts also caution that these gains are contingent on regulatory clarity and macro conditions, which remain fluid. If Ripple can overcome these barriers and cement its role in international banking infrastructure, XRP may become a dominant force in the next cycle. Still, many in the community believe that newer projects like Qubetics—focused on decentralization and developer access—could offer more balanced upside for early adopters hunting for the best crypto to invest in June 2025.

This isn’t just a thought experiment; it’s a real possibility highlighted by a prominent Bloomberg analyst regarding Satoshi Nakamoto , the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto and Why Do They Hold So Much Bitcoin? The mystery surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto is as foundational to Bitcoin as the blockchain itself. Nobody knows their true identity, whether they are a single person or a group. What we do know, based on blockchain analysis, is that the earliest Bitcoin miner, widely believed to be Satoshi, controls a significant amount of Bitcoin. Estimates vary, but figures around one million BTC are commonly cited as belonging to Satoshi’s early mining activities, much of which remains unspent in original wallets. This untouched hoard forms the basis of any discussion about Satoshi’s potential wealth. Unlike typical founders who cash out or use their holdings for various purposes, Satoshi’s estimated stash has remained dormant since the early days of Bitcoin. This dormancy adds to the mystique but also means the value of these holdings fluctuates directly with the Bitcoin price . How Bitcoin Price Growth Fuels Satoshi’s Potential Wealth Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently drew attention to this fascinating scenario. He noted on X that if Bitcoin maintains its historical annual growth rate, particularly its typical 50% year-over-year increase, the value of Satoshi’s estimated holdings would skyrocket. This consistent growth is the engine that could propel Satoshi up the ranks of the world’s richest people . Consider the math: If Satoshi holds around 1 million BTC, their wealth is directly 1 million times the current Bitcoin price . As Bitcoin’s value appreciates, so does the theoretical net worth of its creator. Balchunas’s prediction isn’t just about hitting a certain price point; it’s about the *trajectory* of that price relative to the wealth accumulation of existing billionaires. Let’s look at a simplified hypothetical based on a 50% annual growth rate (this is purely illustrative and not financial advice): Year Hypothetical Starting BTC Price Ending BTC Price (50% Growth) Satoshi’s Hypothetical Wealth (1M BTC) Year 1 $50,000 $75,000 $75 billion Year 2 $75,000 $112,500 $112.5 billion Year 3 $112,500 $168,750 $168.75 billion As you can see, even starting from a significant price point, a consistent 50% growth rate rapidly increases the value of a large BTC holding. This kind of growth rate, if sustained, could quickly see Satoshi’s theoretical wealth challenging and potentially surpassing the fortunes of individuals who have built their empires over decades in traditional industries or tech. Challenging the Ranks of the Richest People: Buffett and Zuckerberg Balchunas specifically named two prominent figures Satoshi could potentially overtake: Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg. Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, built his immense wealth through value investing over many decades with Berkshire Hathaway. Mark Zuckerberg, on the other hand, created Meta (formerly Facebook) and amassed his fortune rapidly in the digital age. The analyst’s projection suggests that with continued strong Bitcoin price performance, Satoshi’s estimated wealth could surpass Warren Buffett’s net worth within the current year and then overtake Mark Zuckerberg’s by the following year. This would theoretically place the anonymous Bitcoin creator behind only Elon Musk, currently the world’s wealthiest person, on the global rich list. It’s a remarkable thought: the founder of a decentralized digital currency, whose identity remains unknown and who has never spent their coins, potentially outranking titans of traditional finance and modern technology on the list of the world’s richest people . This scenario underscores the unprecedented wealth creation potential unlocked by Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto vs. Other Crypto Billionaires While Satoshi is the ultimate figurehead, the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has already created a new class of ultra-wealthy individuals – the crypto billionaires . Figures like Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao (founder of Binance), Brian Armstrong (CEO of Coinbase), and early investors or developers have seen their net worth soar with the market. However, Satoshi Nakamoto’s position is unique. Their estimated fortune dwarfs that of most other crypto billionaires , and critically, it remains untouched. This sets Satoshi apart not just from traditional billionaires but also from those who have profited immensely from the ecosystem Satoshi created. It raises profound questions about motivation, legacy, and the nature of value itself. The Philosophical Stance: Why Hasn’t the Bitcoin Creator Cashed Out? Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this potential wealth milestone is the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto has never accessed or spent their estimated million Bitcoins. This decision, or lack thereof, stands in stark contrast to how founders typically interact with the value they create. Eric Balchunas drew a compelling comparison to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle. Jack Bogle built Vanguard into one of the world’s largest investment firms, famous for its low-cost index funds. However, Bogle structured Vanguard as a mutual company owned by its funds, meaning it was effectively owned by its investors. Bogle himself did not amass a massive personal fortune from Vanguard’s ownership structure; his focus was on maximizing returns for the fund holders. Balchunas suggests Satoshi’s actions (or inaction) with their Bitcoin holdings share a similar spirit – the creator not personally profiting from the asset they created, allowing its value to exist independently. Several theories attempt to explain why Satoshi’s coins haven’t moved: Security/Anonymity: Spending or moving the coins could potentially reveal Satoshi’s identity. Lost Keys: It’s possible the private keys to these early wallets are lost forever. Philosophical Commitment: Satoshi might genuinely believe the coins should remain untouched as a symbol or to avoid concentrating power. Already Wealthy: Satoshi might have been wealthy already and didn’t need the money. Deceased: Satoshi might no longer be alive. Regardless of the reason, the untouched nature of this massive fortune adds a layer of mystique and philosophical depth to the discussion of Satoshi’s potential wealth. It suggests a motivation beyond mere financial gain for the Bitcoin creator . Challenges and Considerations for the Prediction While Balchunas’s projection is thought-provoking, it’s based on certain assumptions that are worth noting: Sustained 50% Growth: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile. While it has shown incredible growth over the long term, a consistent 50% annual increase year after year is not guaranteed. Exact Holdings: The estimate of 1 million BTC belonging to Satoshi is widely accepted but not definitively proven. The actual amount could be slightly higher or lower. Other Billionaires’ Wealth: The net worth of figures like Buffett and Zuckerberg also fluctuates based on market performance, investments, and other factors. Accessibility of Satoshi’s BTC: The prediction assumes the BTC holdings are theoretically accessible, even if they remain unspent. These factors mean the timeline is a projection, not a certainty. However, the underlying point remains: the sheer scale of Satoshi’s estimated holdings, combined with Bitcoin’s historical and potential future growth, places them in a unique position to rival the world’s wealthiest individuals. Conclusion: The Ghost in the Machine and the Future of Wealth The possibility of Satoshi Nakamoto becoming one of the world’s richest people is a stunning illustration of Bitcoin’s impact. It highlights the immense value created by the decentralized digital currency and underscores the unprecedented nature of its creation story. Whether the prediction comes true this year, next year, or ever, the theoretical wealth tied to the anonymous Bitcoin creator serves as a powerful symbol. It represents a fortune generated purely from the success of a technological and economic innovation, held by a figure who seemingly prioritized the project’s integrity and independence over personal enrichment, drawing comparisons to altruistic figures like Jack Bogle. The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto endures, but the potential scale of their theoretical wealth is a concrete indicator of the revolution Bitcoin has unleashed, reshaping not just finance but our very understanding of value and wealth accumulation in the digital age. The ghost in the machine might just become one of the wealthiest ‘individuals’ on paper, all thanks to the enduring power and growth of the network they brought into existence.

The White House stated in an emergency motion to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that stopping the tariffs poses a danger to crucial trade talks already underway with dozens of countries. The legal fight centers on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the statute Trump invoked to justify forcing aggressive tariffs on America’s trading partners. The latest request comes after two rulings, first from the U.S. Court of International Trade in Manhattan and then from a federal court in Washington, D.C., which stated the administration went beyond its authority under IEEPA. The most recent ruling by Judge Rudolph Contreras stated clearly that IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of tariffs, a more direct rebuke than the earlier trade court decision. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trade Representative Jamieson Lee Greer were among the four senior Trump officials who submitted affidavits in support of the tariffs. They stressed that the legal uncertainty threatens fragile negotiations with dozens of other countries. The administration has also sought a broader, longer-term pause, though it has won a temporary stay in the first court ruling on appeal. Among the tariffs under scrutiny are April “Liberation Day” measures levied against a broad range of imports and earlier ones imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China. All three nations deny contributing to fentanyl flow into the U.S., an allegation the administration has pressed. China dispute escalates as U.S. seeks trade concessions Tensions with China have intensified following new U.S. export restrictions and visa policies. Beijing responded by accusing Washington of breaching the fragile May 12 truce reached after months of tariff battles increases. The Chinese Commerce Ministry said the US undermined the agreement by limiting chip technology access and canceling student visas. Uncertainty on who’s steering trade policy further clouds the U.S. position. Analysts note an apparent disconnect between the president, his negotiators, and the national security apparatus. “Beyond showing raw power, it’s unclear what the endgame is,” Arthur Kroeber of Gavekal Research said. Despite the turmoil, the Trump administration continues to press forward with trade talks under a tight, self imposed deadline. Leaked this week, a draft letter from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative asks negotiation partners to submit their best offers by next Wednesday and agreements by early July. Demands include tariff and quota concessions on US industrial and agricultural goods, digital trade commitments, and new economic security measures. USTR officials said discussions are underway with the European Union, Japan, Vietnam, and India. Tariff strategy faces political and market pressure Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed on Sunday that Trump does not intend to extend a 90-day pause on tariffs that were put in place in April to give volatile financial markets a breather. Lutnick said on national television that the president is still committed to high-impact tariffs ranging from 11% to greater than 100%. U.S. companies and markets are still feeling the effects. The lawsuit was brought by the toy makers Learning Resources Inc. and hand2mind, who say they will battle any further delay in blocking the tariffs. Trump’s advisers say multiple deals are close to completion despite legal and diplomatic headwinds. “We could sign lots of agreements right now,” Lutnick said. “But we want better ones—first-class deals for the American worker.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Economy|China|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-02 21:25:08

After facing criticism and a sharp drop in token value, the team believes interactive games and useful apps can help revitalize its ecosystem. Pi Network To Start New Chapter Begins with Games On May 30, the Pi Core Team announced a new strategy. They want to use games to increase user activity and make the Pi token more useful in the real world. Their first step is the launch of FruityPi, a game now live on the Pi Browser. Players must drop and merge fruits into more significant, rarer ones in the game without overflowing the bin. The game shows how developers can build apps using Pi tools like the Pi Wallet, Pi Ad Network, and the Pi token, the currency used in the Pi ecosystem. It also highlights how developers can attract users by building on the Pi platform. Along with FruityPi, the team revealed that five new apps were added to the Pi Mainnet Ecosystem Interface. These include a snake-themed arcade game, two shopping platforms, an app that shares Pi token updates, and a tool for exploring crypto data. The Pi Network team noted that all these apps passed new function, utility, and legal compliance rules. This move is part of a broader industry trend where blockchain projects like Polygon use games and fun apps to drive user engagement and grow their communities. Pi Team To Support Builders Through Pi Network Ventures To support this new gaming push, the team is offering help to developers. If a project brings real adoption, it can apply for support from Pi Network Ventures, a $100 million fund created in April. This fund gives grants in Pi tokens and is part of a bigger plan to grow Pi’s real-world use. The tokens come from 10% of Pi’s total supply for developing the ecosystem. Community Worries Grow as Pi Token Drops Sharply This new pivot plan comes as Pi Network faces a lot of backlash. In recent months, community members have raised concerns about the Pi Network. Some users argued that the project lacks clear communication about its plans and may use significant events to hype the token and sell their own, accusing the project of running a rug-pull scheme. This loss of confidence in the project has hurt trust, causing the Pi token price to drop sharply over 16% in a week to $0.64, down 99.7% from its all-time high of over $200. However, the team hopes the new games and apps recently added will help bring users back and boost engagement on the Pi ecosystem. This comes as blockchain gaming is gaining traction .

These are the participants who have weathered previous cycles, held through significant volatility, and often represent a large, illiquid portion of the supply. When these seasoned Bitcoin holders decide to move their coins, it can signal important shifts in market dynamics. Recently, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shed light on a specific cohort whose actions warrant close attention, revealing a potentially significant signal for the market. What Does Glassnode Data Tell Us About Long-Term Holders? Glassnode is a leading provider of on-chain data and intelligence for the cryptocurrency space. Their platform analyzes transactions directly on the blockchain, offering unique insights into network activity, holder behavior, and market structure that traditional financial data cannot provide. Their recent report, shared via their X account, focused on a specific group: Bitcoin holders who have held their coins for a period of three to five years. According to the latest Glassnode data, this particular cohort currently controls a substantial 11.9% of the total circulating BTC supply. To put this into perspective, Glassnode noted that this figure is well above the cycle low, which hovered around 3%. This significant increase in the proportion of supply held by this group over the past few years highlights their accumulation during previous market phases and their current prominence in the market structure. Key takeaways from the Glassnode finding include: The 3-5 year holding cohort represents a large and growing segment of the BTC supply. Their current share (11.9%) is more than triple their lowest point in the recent cycle. This concentration of supply in the hands of experienced holders can have significant implications for market liquidity and potential selling pressure. Who Are These Key Bitcoin Holders and What Are They Doing? The 3-5 year Bitcoin holders are individuals or entities who acquired their BTC sometime between three and five years ago. This timeframe roughly corresponds to the post-2020 bull run accumulation phase or early parts of the subsequent bear market. They are distinct from short-term traders or even longer-term ‘HODLers’ who have held for five years or more. While their large holdings are noteworthy, their recent behavior is even more critical. Glassnode’s Glassnode data indicates that this group hasn’t just been passively holding. They began initiating significant selling activity around November of the previous year. This selling paused for a period but then resumed in April. This pattern suggests a strategic distribution phase, likely capitalizing on recent price strength. Their actions are significant because: They represent a large block of dormant supply becoming active. Their selling adds liquidity to the market, which can absorb buying pressure but also contribute to downward price movements if selling accelerates. The timing of their selling (during price rallies) aligns with typical profit-taking behavior after a multi-year holding period. Why Does 11.9% of BTC Supply Matter? Understanding the “Overhang” The term “overhang” in financial markets refers to a large block of securities that is likely to be sold, potentially depressing the price. In the context of BTC supply held by the 3-5 year cohort, the 11.9% figure represents a significant potential overhang. Why is this percentage particularly relevant? Because it signifies a large amount of Bitcoin that was acquired at significantly lower price levels than today. These holders are sitting on substantial unrealized gains. While not all of them will sell, the sheer volume they control means that even a fraction of this group deciding to distribute their holdings can inject a considerable amount of BTC supply onto exchanges or directly to buyers. Consider the impact: A sudden increase in sell orders can outpace buying demand, leading to price corrections. Knowing that such a large block exists can influence market sentiment, making buyers more cautious. The distribution from this cohort could potentially offset the demand from new entrants or institutional buyers. Despite the recent slowdown in their selling mentioned by Glassnode, their continued large share of the BTC supply suggests that this potential selling pressure is not going away anytime soon and could resume or intensify. How Does This Fit Into Broader On-Chain Analysis? The behavior of the 3-5 year Bitcoin holders is just one piece of the complex puzzle that is on-chain analysis. This discipline involves examining publicly available data on the blockchain to understand market participants’ actions and motivations. On-chain analysis looks at various metrics, such as: SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio): Indicates if coins being moved are, on average, in profit or loss. Accumulation Trends: Are wallets accumulating or distributing BTC? Exchange Flows: Is BTC moving onto exchanges (potential selling) or off exchanges (potential holding/cold storage)? dormancy: How long have coins been dormant before being moved? (This is where the 3-5 year cohort analysis fits in). The Glassnode finding about the 3-5 year holders’ supply and selling activity is a crucial dormancy metric. It tells us that a significant amount of previously dormant coins is now showing signs of life. When combined with other on-chain analysis metrics, such as increasing exchange inflows or a high SOPR for long-term holders, it paints a clearer picture of potential supply-side pressure. What Could This Mean for Crypto Market Analysis and Future Prices? For anyone involved in crypto market analysis, the Glassnode report on the 3-5 year Bitcoin holders is a signal that cannot be ignored. While on-chain analysis is not a crystal ball and doesn’t provide definitive price predictions, it offers valuable insights into the underlying supply and demand dynamics. The fact that a cohort controlling 11.9% of the BTC supply has shown a propensity to sell during recent price strength suggests that future rallies could face headwinds as these holders continue to distribute. This doesn’t necessarily mean the market is headed for a crash, but it indicates that there is a significant source of potential selling pressure that could cap upside movements or contribute to corrections. Potential implications for crypto market analysis: Increased Volatility: Large selling from this cohort can lead to sharp price movements. Resistance Levels: Areas where this cohort accumulated heavily might act as resistance as they sell into strength. Supply Absorption Test: The market’s ability to absorb this selling pressure will be a key test of underlying demand. It’s important to combine this Glassnode data with other forms of analysis, including technical analysis, macroeconomic factors, and sentiment analysis, for a comprehensive view. However, the message from the blockchain, as interpreted by Glassnode, is clear: a large, profitable group of Bitcoin holders is active, and their substantial share of the BTC supply represents a potential source of selling pressure that should be factored into any serious crypto market analysis. Conclusion Glassnode’s recent finding that Bitcoin holders who have held for three to five years now control a significant 11.9% of the BTC supply is a crucial data point derived from expert on-chain analysis. This cohort, having accumulated during earlier periods, represents a substantial potential “overhang” of supply. Their observed selling behavior since November, with a resumption in April, suggests a strategic distribution phase. While not a guarantee of future price action, this piece of Glassnode data provides valuable insight for crypto market analysis , highlighting a potential source of selling pressure that market participants should monitor closely.

That move shifted the global conversation, prompting other countries like Brazil to consider similar measures through legislation. However, in February, Poland’s central bank ruled out adding Bitcoin to its national reserves . Poland’s central bank rejects Bitcoin as a reserve asset, citing security concerns and volatility. As elections near, will policies shift? #Cryptocurrency #Blockchain https://t.co/L57Ng7mUAL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 7, 2025 NBP President Adam Glapiński made it clear during a press conference that reserve assets must remain “absolutely secure,” and Bitcoin doesn’t meet that standard. Poland will continue holding reserves in traditional assets like gold, U.S. dollars, and euros, prioritizing financial stability over crypto exposure. Should Poland pursue a national Bitcoin reserve, it would join a growing list of states experimenting with crypto as a hedge against inflation, a reserve diversification tool, or a geopolitical statement. Nawrocki has not confirmed such a plan, but the combination of political momentum, ideological alignment, and global precedent makes it a live possibility. In the short term, observers expect Nawrocki’s administration to support crypto startups and blockchain development zones, potentially offering tax or regulatory relief to firms in Web3. His win may also embolden local governments or parliamentary factions to explore municipal-level digital asset adoption or partnerships with blockchain firms. EU Tensions, Global Precedents, and Strategic Pressure Across Europe, countries like Germany and France have leaned toward cautious digital asset oversight. Poland could now move in the opposite direction, following in the steps of nations like El Salvador or Switzerland, which have carved independent paths. Within Poland, crypto ownership remains relatively modest compared to global averages, but interest is rising, particularly among younger voters and the tech sector. If Nawrocki’s leadership successfully creates a favorable climate, Poland could emerge as Central Europe’s leading crypto jurisdiction. For now, industry stakeholders await Nawrocki’s cabinet picks, early policy indications, and potential alliances with figures like Mentzen. Whether Poland adopts a national Bitcoin strategy or focuses on broader crypto ecosystem support, the 2025 election outcome has already placed the country on the map for digital asset observers worldwide.

The post draws on a newly surfaced document that articulates how Ripple’s technology positions itself as a serious alternative to the SWIFT messaging system — the decades-old backbone of cross-border financial communication. While SWIFT has long been the dominant network used by over 11,000 financial institutions worldwide to transmit payment instructions, it has also faced persistent criticisms over slow settlement times, high transaction costs, and a lack of integrated settlement. The document SMQKE references highlights a central weakness: SWIFT’s role is largely limited to messaging, while the actual value transfer between banks still relies on correspondent banking networks and legacy systems. This separation creates inefficiencies, delays, and potential points of failure. Yes, Ripple and XRP utilize a messaging system similar to SWIFT for transmitting payment instructions and settlement data between financial institutions. Documented 4x. pic.twitter.com/H89apVALcB — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 2, 2025 Ripple’s Vision for a Blockchain-Powered Messaging and Settlement System Ripple proposes a radical upgrade: replacing or overhauling SWIFT’s messaging layer with a peer-to-peer (P2P) system built on distributed ledger technology (DLT). By using the XRP Ledger, Ripple offers a public blockchain that integrates both the messaging flow (which includes transaction details, status updates, and compliance checks) and the actual flow of value (denominated in XRP). This dual-layered approach is designed to allow banks and financial institutions to synchronize payment instructions with real-time settlement, reducing the transaction time from days to mere milliseconds. The document emphasizes that, unlike SWIFT’s current system, where the messaging and the actual funds settlement are handled in separate layers, Ripple’s solution fuses these functions into a seamless process. As a result, two banks can connect, communicate, and complete settlement almost instantly, with the system providing a wealth of information before and after the transaction, including confirmation of success or failure. Leveraging ISO 20022 for Interoperability and Flexibility A key technical advantage outlined in the document is Ripple’s adherence to ISO 20022 standards, a globally recognized framework for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. Ripple’s ISO 20022-compliant messaging ensures interoperability with a growing number of systems across the global banking landscape, positioning XRP and the Ripple network as highly adaptable within existing financial infrastructures. Ripple’s modular approach, combined with ISO 20022, provides flexibility for financial providers, enabling them to integrate Ripple’s services without a complete overhaul of their internal systems. This extensibility makes Ripple’s solution more appealing to banks and payment providers who are seeking greater certainty and speed in cross-border transactions without sacrificing compliance or technological compatibility. Addressing Settlement, Compliance, and Transparency The document also touches on how Ripple’s system incorporates key commercial rules, regulatory obligations, and payment format standards to ensure robust compliance. For example, the receiving party in a Ripple-facilitated transaction retains strict obligations regarding the use and disclosure of confidential information, mirroring the compliance frameworks seen in traditional banking. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, Ripple’s design allows payment service providers to identify payees, payment methods, and the destination bank — all critical factors for ensuring transparency, reducing fraud, and streamlining payment flows. This heightened clarity not only satisfies regulatory requirements but also bolsters trust between counterparties, which has historically been a challenge in cross-border payments. The Road Ahead: Can XRP Replace SWIFT? While Ripple’s technological framework presents a compelling case for modernization, replacing SWIFT entirely is a monumental challenge. SWIFT’s entrenched position, regulatory backing, and deep-rooted institutional relationships mean that Ripple must navigate not only technical hurdles but also geopolitical and regulatory complexities. However, the document brought forward by SMQKE makes it clear that Ripple is not merely proposing incremental improvements. It is advocating for a full-stack transformation: a blockchain-powered financial system where messaging, compliance, and settlement are unified on a single distributed ledger, offering speed, transparency, and cost efficiency unmatched by today’s legacy systems. As financial institutions worldwide look to upgrade their cross-border payment capabilities in line with evolving global standards, Ripple’s model could become an increasingly attractive alternative. The combination of blockchain technology, real-time settlement, ISO 20022 compliance, and integrated messaging positions Ripple and XRP at the forefront of the next generation of global finance. Whether Ripple’s ambitious vision can overcome the inertia of established systems like SWIFT remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the conversation is no longer hypothetical. With detailed technical proposals and live use cases already underway, Ripple is laying the groundwork for a future where global payments are instant, transparent, and seamlessly interoperable, a sharp contrast to the fractured systems of the past.

A major move is underway that sees a China-based transportation giant diving deeper into the world of cryptocurrencies, specifically focusing on XRP . This isn’t just a small investment; it’s a substantial commitment that highlights the growing trend of institutional crypto adoption. Who is Webus and Why This Deal Matters? The company making waves is Webus, a transportation firm based in China. While perhaps not a household name in the global crypto space until now, their recent action speaks volumes. According to a report from BWE News on X (formerly Twitter), Webus has entered into a significant agreement with Samara Alpha, an institutional digital asset management firm. The core of this agreement? Entrusting Samara Alpha with the management of a staggering $300 million XRP treasury. This deal is far more than just a simple allocation of funds. It’s described as part of Webus’s broader strategic initiative aimed at supporting its payment infrastructure. For a large transportation company, efficient and potentially cross-border payments are crucial. This suggests that Webus might be exploring how XRP can play a role in streamlining its financial operations, perhaps leveraging its speed and lower transaction costs compared to traditional methods. The sheer size of the $300 million figure is noteworthy. It signals a serious level of confidence from Webus in both the potential utility of XRP and the capabilities of Samara Alpha to manage such a significant digital asset holding. It also adds another data point to the narrative of corporations looking beyond traditional fiat or even just Bitcoin for their treasury management and payment needs. Why Did Webus Choose XRP for Its Treasury? Choosing a specific digital asset for a corporate treasury isn’t a decision made lightly. While the exact reasons behind Webus’s selection of XRP haven’t been fully detailed, several factors could be at play: Focus on Payments: XRP Ledger is designed with payments in mind, aiming for fast and low-cost transactions. Given Webus’s goal to support its payment infrastructure, XRP ‘s design principles align well with this objective. Potential for Cross-Border Use: Transportation often involves international operations. XRP has been explored and used in cross-border payment solutions, which could be a key driver for Webus. Liquidity: As one of the older and more established cryptocurrencies, XRP generally possesses reasonable liquidity across various exchanges, which is important for managing a large treasury. Specific Use Cases or Partnerships: While speculative, Webus might see potential in specific use cases built on the XRP Ledger or perhaps future integrations that align with their business model. It’s important to distinguish that holding XRP in a treasury doesn’t automatically mean Webus is using Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service, which specifically leverages XRP for cross-border payments. However, having a significant XRP holding managed by a professional firm could certainly be a precursor or a complementary strategy to integrating such payment solutions in the future. The Growing Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption Webus is not operating in a vacuum. This deal is indicative of a broader, accelerating trend: the increasing willingness of traditional institutions and corporations to engage with cryptocurrencies. What started primarily with Bitcoin as a ‘digital gold’ or store of value is now expanding to other assets like XRP , driven by various factors: Inflation Hedging: Companies are looking for alternative assets to potentially hedge against inflation eroding the value of their cash reserves. Payment Efficiency: Exploring how blockchain and digital assets can reduce costs and increase the speed of payments, both domestically and internationally. Investment and Diversification: Allocating a portion of treasury funds to digital assets as a potential high-growth investment class. Technological Exploration: Positioning the company at the forefront of financial technology innovation. This move by Webus, a company in a non-financial sector like transportation, underscores that institutional crypto adoption is spreading beyond fintech and investment firms into diverse industries globally. Samara Alpha’s role highlights the growing demand for specialized services to help these institutions navigate the complexities of the crypto market. Managing a $300M Crypto Treasury: What Does it Entail? Handling a crypto treasury of this magnitude is no simple task. It involves a sophisticated set of processes and considerations that differ significantly from managing traditional fiat reserves. This is precisely where firms like Samara Alpha come into play. Their responsibilities likely include: Secure Custody: Protecting the private keys associated with the $300 million worth of XRP is paramount. This requires robust, institutional-grade security solutions, often involving cold storage and multi-signature wallets. Risk Management: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Samara Alpha will need strategies to manage price risk, potentially including hedging techniques or setting risk tolerance parameters. Compliance and Regulation: Navigating the complex and ever-evolving regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets, especially across different jurisdictions. Reporting and Accounting: Providing clear and accurate reporting on the treasury’s performance, value, and transactions for Webus’s internal accounting and external audits. Execution: Managing the logistics of acquiring, holding, and potentially using or trading the XRP as per Webus’s strategy. Outsourcing this function to a firm specializing in digital asset management allows Webus to leverage expert knowledge and infrastructure without building this complex capability in-house. It’s a common approach for traditional companies venturing into the digital asset space. The Role of Digital Asset Management Firms Like Samara Alpha The rise of institutional interest in crypto has fueled the growth of specialized service providers. Samara Alpha, as an institutional digital asset management firm, represents this crucial piece of the ecosystem. These firms provide the bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world, offering services tailored to the needs of large corporations and investment funds. Their expertise covers a wide range of areas, including secure custody solutions, trading execution, portfolio management, risk assessment, and regulatory guidance. For a company like Webus, partnering with Samara Alpha provides access to the necessary infrastructure and knowledge base to manage a significant crypto treasury effectively and compliantly. This partnership highlights the increasing maturity of the crypto market infrastructure, making it more accessible and manageable for large traditional enterprises. It’s a positive signal for the overall health and future growth potential of the digital asset space. Key Takeaways from the Webus XRP Treasury Deal This $300 million agreement offers several valuable insights: Expanding Institutional Adoption: The deal confirms that institutional interest in crypto is broadening, both in terms of the types of companies involved (transportation, not just finance) and the specific assets being considered (including XRP ). Focus on Utility: Webus’s stated goal of supporting payment infrastructure suggests a focus on the functional utility of digital assets, not just speculative investment. Professional Management is Key: The reliance on a digital asset management firm like Samara Alpha underscores the complexity of managing large crypto holdings and the need for specialized expertise. Significant Commitment to XRP: A $300 million allocation is a substantial vote of confidence in XRP specifically, placing it firmly on the radar for corporate treasury consideration. While challenges remain, including market volatility and regulatory clarity, deals like this demonstrate that large corporations are actively exploring and implementing strategies that involve significant digital asset exposure. What’s Next? The focus will now likely turn to how this partnership unfolds. Will Webus integrate XRP into its actual payment flows? How will the treasury perform under Samara Alpha’s management? The success or challenges encountered by Webus could serve as a case study for other corporations considering similar moves into the crypto treasury space. This development is a powerful signal for the ongoing convergence of traditional business operations and the innovative potential of digital assets. It reinforces the narrative that cryptocurrencies are moving beyond the realm of individual investors and becoming a legitimate consideration for corporate balance sheets and operational strategies.

XRP Price Prediction After 44M Tokens Leave Exchange,https://cryptonews.com/news/whale-signal-or-exit-xrp-price-prediction-after-44m-tokens-leave-exchange/,"The XRP price has slipped by 8.2% to $2.14 amid a broader market cooldown following last month’s rally. Yet fresh signs of accumulation are emerging, with one XRP community member on X reporting a major exchange withdrawal just days ago. It appears that the Turkish crypto exchange Paribu has taken out of circulation 44.1 million XRP tokens worth nearly $100 million that were moved to an external wallet. BREAKING 44,100,000 XRP Acquired from Turkish Exchange Paribu and Moved to Unknown Wallet! The giants are waking up This is not just a move… it's a message. #XRP #xrplasvegas2025 pic.twitter.com/FKHSlJAAFK — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 31, 2025 This kind of move reduces the token’s liquidity in the short term and typically supports a bullish XRP price prediction. The market also interprets whales’ decision to move XRP tokens out of exchanges as supportive of a price uptick as it means that deep-pocketed investors are positioning for an upcoming rally. The move occurred just days after the CME Group launched two futures contracts linked to XRP . In addition, the market has been waiting for the SEC’s nod to multiple XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. The approval of these ETFs could result in significant liquidity flowing to the cryptocurrency, which favors a bullish XRP price prediction . XRP Price Prediction: XRP Finds Support at 200-day EMA – Is the Pullback Over? XRP broke its trend line support a couple of weeks ago and has been dropping since then. The price action also shows that a ‘death cross’ has emerged in the daily chart after the 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) crossed below the 21-day EMA. The last time this happened, it resulted in an 18% loss for the token. If a similar decline takes place this time, a bearish XRP price prediction would set a first target of $1.9 for the token in the near term. For now, XRP has found support at its 200-day EMA and has bounced off that key indicator in the past few days. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been in a downtrend for days, which supports a bearish outlook as well. However, this still qualifies as a normal pullback during what still is a bull market. If that’s the case, XRP could soon recover as late buyers will take advantage of these declines to buy the token. Apart from XRP, the best crypto presales of the year like SUBBD offer significant upside potential to early buyers who take advantage of these events to buy their tokens at a discounted price. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises $500K to Create a Better Home for Influencers SUBBD (SUBBD) is a decentralized content distribution platform created to provide a better environment in which influencers can thrive. The platform lets influencers keep a higher share of their earnings and gives them a say on moderation policies and other key rules through the $SUBBD governance token. Creators can also share AI-generated content to produce passive income and will be compensated almost immediately through the use of smart contracts and the $SUBBD token. Fans will also get discounts, early access to features, and the possibility of making custom requests by using this utility token. As a result, the demand for $SUBBD will likely skyrocket after the platform is launched. To buy $SUBBD at its discounted presale price, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Microsoft has announced that it will be pouring $400M into enhancing Switzerland’s digital infrastructure. The company is especially focused on expanding the country’s cloud and AI capabilities, empowering startups, developing digital skills, and reinforcing responsible AI governance. The announcement came on June 2, 2025, by Microsoft’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith alongside its Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin and Microsoft Switzerland’s CEO Catrin Hinkel. Microsoft commits $400M to Switzerland According to Smith, the million-dollar investment emphasizes Microsoft’s continued dedication to supporting Switzerland’s innovation-driven economy and regulatory standards. “For more than three decades, we have stood by our Swiss customers’ side,” he said. “This latest investment helps further strengthen Switzerland’s long-term economic resilience and competitiveness.” Microsoft intends to upgrade its four data centers located near Zurich and Geneva with advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). This investment is in response to a surge in demand for AI-powered services in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and government. Over 50,000 existing customers will benefit from this upgrade, and Microsoft’s cloud services will continue to ensure that data remains within Swiss borders. UBS, Switzerland’s leading financial institution, is one of the major organizations that make use of Microsoft’s cloud services due to its scalability, compliance, and innovation as driving factors. According to Microsoft’s 2025 Q1 data, AI adoption in Switzerland has been accelerating rapidly. The country currently ranks second globally in the GitHub AI contributor share, and Microsoft usage metrics show a significant increase in customer engagement with AI tools. Investing in innovation Microsoft will also reinforce its support for startups, SMEs, and national digital skilling efforts. The company has pledged to help skill one million people in Switzerland by 2027. To foster innovation, Microsoft will deepen its partnership with Switzerland Innovation Parks. This collaboration will accelerate the transition from research to commercial application in industries ranging from manufacturing to public services. The goal is to equip SMEs with tools to compete in the current AI era. Since 2019, Microsoft has supported over 1,500 local startups through its Microsoft for Startups program and has created more than 11,000 jobs in the process. The upcoming 2025 cohort of the Swiss AI Tech Accelerator will offer selected startups expert mentorship, technical training, and community networking opportunities. Microsoft is also launching a series of targeted skilling initiatives in collaboration with partners such as FH Schweiz, Innovate Switzerland, and chambers of commerce. Digital literacy platforms like AI-Fitness.ch and LerneKI.ch will help broaden AI access to the general population, while Microsoft’s partnerships with organizations like the CyberPeace Institute and PoliSync aim to close digital divides both locally and globally. The 2025 Work Trend Index stresses the importance of this kind of initiative. 80% of Swiss business leaders currently identify 2025 as a year for redefining business strategies around AI. The company aims to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. In Switzerland, Microsoft already sources 100% of its electricity from renewable energy and continues to source clean energy across Europe. In 2024, it signed a biogenic carbon removal deal with Swiss startup Neustark to support local sustainability solutions. “Every investment represents trust in the future. This initiative is putting trust into Switzerland, in our people, and in our ability to push the boundaries of AI.” The Federal Councillor, Guy Parmelin, said.

DOGE does remain down by 16% in the past week, but the meme token also retains a 7% increase in a month and a 20% gain in the past year. While these are fairly modest percentages in comparison to certain alts and meme coins, the possibility of incoming news could send it much higher soon. And with the ongoing support of Elon Musk and its steadfast community, the long-term Dogecoin price prediction remains very strong. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Mysterious Tweet Revives Speculation of $1 DOGE It was an extremely simple tweet, but its minimal content was enough to provoke the Dogecoin community’s curiosity. Sup chat — Dogecoin (@dogecoin) June 1, 2025 Most posters responded with a reciprocal ‘sup’, but some took the post as a bullish sign of future Dogecoin price moves, including to $1 and to “ two digits before 2030 “. Of course, Dogecoin hasn’t actually announced any news or developments, so there’s no fundamental reason to think DOGE will have a massive rally anytime soon. And if we look at its chart today, dips seem likelier in the near term, given the direction of the coin’s indicators. For instance, its 30-day average (orange) has just dropped below the 200-day (blue) again, a sign of incoming dumps and losses. Source: TradingView We also see that DOGE’s relative strength index (purple) has dipped to 40 today, and it may not be until it sinks below 30 that we see the token bottom out and recover. Despite this, the coin’s trading volume remains healthy enough at just below $1 billion, while the past week has witnessed some big buys from whales . DOGE’s fundamental position therefore remains solid, especially when it continues to have a backer in Elon Musk, who now that he has removed himself from government may be more able to pump the coin’s price. It could reach $0.25 by the end of the month, $0.30 by the end of July, and $0.70 by the end of the year. Newer Coins with Stronger Prospects If Dogecoin is a little too sleepy at the moment, you may prefer to look at newer cryptos, including certain presale tokens. The biggest presales can translate into big post-listing rallies, particularly if a sale has generated lots of interest and momentum. And one of the biggest presale tokens right now is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that has now raised $6.7 million in its ongoing ICO. The Bull's on a roll. pic.twitter.com/gvGzcP1W0R — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 30, 2025 Bitcoin Bull is a deflationary token with a difference, in that it has attached its tokenomics to the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC) itself. It has a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, and it will burn a portion of this supply whenever BTC reaches new price milestones, beginning with $125,000 and continuing with each additional $25,000. Additionally, it will conduct airdrops that will give away BTC, doing so whenever the latter reaches a new $50,000 milestone, starting from $150,000. This could make Bitcoin Bull very lucrative to hold, particularly when owners will be able to stake the token for a passive income. Bitcoin hit $111K. The first BTCBULL burn milestone is getting closer. pic.twitter.com/1iHi376vQl — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 22, 2025 Its sale doesn’t have too long left to run, but investors can join by going to the Bitcoin Bull website .

The call comes amid renewed attention to Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), the practice of manipulating transaction ordering for profit. The Dark Pool Argument In a June 1 post on X, CZ questioned why DEXs continue to expose user orders in real-time, noting that such transparency often invites predatory tactics like front-running and liquidation targeting, particularly in the perpetual futures markets. “For perps (or futures), it is even more important to not let others know/see your orders,” CZ wrote. “If others can see your liquidation point, they could try to push the market to liquidate you. Even if you got a billion dollars, others can gang up on you.” The former crypto executive drew a direct parallel to traditional finance (TradFi), where large institutional traders routinely use so-called “dark pools,” private exchanges that hide order books. He claimed such services are often “10 times bigger” than normal order books. To that end, Zhao proposed that on-chain platforms could use zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography or similar encryption technologies to obscure trade data, including orders and deposits, until they are executed. In his opinion, this would create a trading experience that shields participants, especially whales, from MEV attacks and coordinated manipulation. CZ’s suggestion comes after a series of dramatic bets by crypto trader James Wynn, who staked over $1 billion on BTC before being liquidated across four different positions, totaling more than $100 million. Following the event, Wynn tweeted that his experience had exposed the corruption in the crypto market, and he advised traders to buy and hold BTC instead of using it for high leverage. Emerging Solutions Several projects jumped on CZ’s post to announce they were actively working in the privacy space. Sam, from Tristero, revealed that for the last two years, his team has been developing a concept similar to what the ex-Binance CEO had outlined. Others like 0x0 and SKALE are also tackling the challenge. 0x0 teased its upcoming Spectre platform, which enables privacy-preserving spot and leverage trading, while SKALE recently launched its BITE Protocol, a consensus-layer encryption tool designed to eliminate MEV entirely by preventing transaction visibility before block finalization. “Rather than applying band-aids, BITE addresses MEV at its root,” said SKALE CEO Jack O’Holleran. However, not everyone is singing from the same hymn book. X User Cedric Beau countered CZ’s proposal, arguing that dark pools fundamentally contradict the ethos of crypto: “Dark pools in crypto? That’s exactly the stuff we came here to avoid,” stated the decentralization enthusiast. “The moment you hide the order book, you recreate insider games.” He further warned that importing TradFi’s “shadowy tricks” risks losing DeFi’s core value proposition of openness. “Transparency’s messy, but at least everyone plays on the same field.” The post CZ Calls for Dark Pool Perp DEX to Shield Traders from Front-Running in DeFi appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Changpeng Zhao (CZ Binance)|DeFi,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-06-02 21:46:59

Projects with strong utility and promising growth potential have collapsed overnight due to poorly written code or malicious backdoors. Countless hyped tokens, despite massive community support, failed solely because they overlooked this critical component: a professional audit. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart. The project recently completed a full-scale audit by CertiK, the most respected name in blockchain security. This milestone puts Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in an elite league of DeFi projects that prioritize investor protection from day one. With a Token Scan Score of 70.00 and rigorous analysis methods including static checks and manual reviews, CertiK has confirmed that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts are secure and production-ready. This audit outcome eliminates a significant layer of investment risk, especially for institutional players and large-scale crypto investors. With trust in the protocol now backed by an industry-leading auditor, investor confidence is surging—and for good reason. As a project offering real DeFi utility through passive income, custom lending models, and platform dividends, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting the stage for exponential returns. The Path to 25x Gains Is Not Just Hype—It’s Math The current price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 5 of the presale is $0.03, up 200% from its starting point of $0.01 in Phase 1. Over $9.72 million has already been raised, and more than 11,450 holders are now part of the ecosystem. These early backers have already seen solid returns, and those entering at later phases will still benefit—just with a lower margin. That’s why entering now, before price hikes in Phase 6 and beyond, is the smartest move. A simple investment of $1,000 today would buy approximately 33,333 MUTM tokens. When the token hits $0.75—a realistic 25x from its current price—that stake would be worth $25,000. With the combination of real revenue, passive rewards, and a growing user base, this isn’t just speculation. It’s a well-founded projection based on current momentum and utility. How You Earn Passive Income on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates through two core lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C system, users deposit tokens like ETH or DAI into a common liquidity pool, which automatically allocates them to borrowers. Returns are generated based on the pool’s utilization rate—so when demand rises, so do your earnings. Depending on market activity, you will earn competitive APYs without the need for active trading or complex strategies. For those looking to maximize returns, the P2P model allows you to lend directly to borrowers and set your own terms. This opens up opportunities for lending tokens that aren’t typically supported by P2C platforms—like memecoins such as Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). These custom arrangements can yield higher returns and give you greater control over your assets. When you deposit into Mutuum Finance, you receive mtTokens—interest-bearing assets that represent your share in the protocol. These tokens automatically accumulate value over time, offering a seamless way to track your growing passive income. You can even stake your mtTokens into the platform’s safety module and receive regular MUTM dividend payouts funded by protocol revenue. MUTM Token Utility: Built to Reward Holders The MUTM token isn’t just a presale asset—it’s your key to unlocking all of Mutuum Finance’s features. Holding MUTM enables staking for dividend rewards. A portion of the protocol’s revenue is routinely used to buy MUTM from the market, which is then distributed to long-term participants. This creates steady buy pressure and ensures that loyal users benefit from the project’s growth. Moreover, the borrowing functionality allows you to use your existing crypto—such as ETH or SOL—as collateral to take out loans in stablecoins. This is ideal for users who want to keep exposure to appreciating assets while unlocking liquidity for other opportunities. Loans are open-ended and flexible, giving users the freedom to repay at their convenience without forced liquidations or fixed repayment deadlines. Roadmap Momentum and a $100K Giveaway According to the official roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch the beta version of its platform by the time the token becomes tradable on public exchanges. This positions the project for real-world adoption from day one. With over $9.72 million already raised, the community is eagerly anticipating the beta launch as a catalyst for even greater demand. To further accelerate user acquisition, the team has launched a generous $100,000 giveaway campaign, offering early adopters a chance to win big just for participating in the ecosystem. These incentives are timed perfectly with the presale momentum, creating a powerful mix of hype and value that’s driving new users into the fold daily. Why Now Is the Time to Act The math doesn’t lie. From Phase 1 at $0.01 to the current Phase 5 price of $0.03, early buyers have already tripled their money. As the presale progresses through Phase 6 ($0.035) and beyond, the same $1,000 investment will purchase fewer tokens—and the upside will shrink accordingly. For anyone looking to maximize gains, this is the window to jump in before broader public exposure drives the price much higher. With a secured CertiK audit, multiple income-generating mechanisms, institutional-grade borrowing tools, and real token utility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers one of the most compelling investment cases in the 2025 DeFi world. Everything points to a breakout trajectory—and smart investors are already positioning for it.

Currently priced at $104,115, the cryptocurrency has declined approximately 5.2% in the past 7 days, marking roughly a 7% drop from its peak price. This sudden decrease has sparked considerable attention among market participants, who closely observe potential signals that might clarify Bitcoin’s next move. A recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk has shed some light on the internal dynamics influencing this price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Sees Drop as Altcoin Traders Face Increased Pressure Binance’s Dominance and Its Market Implications In his report, titled “Divergence of Binance Taker Buy/Sell Behavior From Other CEXs — Sellers Outnumber Buyers on the Market’s Main Venue,” the analyst provides detailed insights into recent trading behaviors observed across major cryptocurrency exchanges, with a particular emphasis on Binance. The analysis highlighted a divergence between Binance and other major centralized exchanges (CEXs). While a brief spike in overall buying activity was recorded across various exchanges, Binance, which accounts for around 60% of global Bitcoin spot trading volume, exhibited a contrasting scenario. Data revealed a significant tilt towards selling, with Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio falling below 1.0. This indicates a clear preference among Binance traders to sell rather than purchase Bitcoin, in contrast to the net-buy behavior observed elsewhere. Given Binance’s considerable market share, this divergence is notable. Binance’s trading volume and futures open interest typically guide broader market sentiment and price discovery. Historical data support this correlation, as past events where Binance’s market behavior diverged from other exchanges, such as in February 2024 and August 2023, resulted in notable Bitcoin price corrections of between 5% and 10% shortly thereafter. Bitcoin Current Market Dynamics and Near-Term Expectations Notably, the latest metrics illustrate Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell ratio hovering around 0.98, representing approximately a 12% decline over the past week and a 25% decline over the past month. Despite a brief surge in overall market buying activity across exchanges, with the aggregate Taker Buy/Sell ratio peaking at about 1.35, Binance’s bearish stance has dampened this bullish signal, causing the broader indicator to revert downward rapidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tipped For $340,000 Target If This Support Level Holds – Details This scenario suggests the possibility of heightened market volatility in the short term. The dominance of Binance’s trading behaviors potentially amplifies the effects of this selling pressure through futures market funding rates, which can intensify market moves. In conclusion, the CryptoQuant analyst wrote: Because the largest liquidity pool is net-selling, today’s aggregate uptick risks turning into a bull trap. Unless Binance’s Taker Buy/Sell flips decisively above 1.05—and stays there—expect heightened volatility and a greater probability of a near-term price decline as broader sentiment realigns with the market leader’s flows.

Here’s Analysts Take,https://timestabloid.com/will-ruvi-ais-ruvi-100x-surge-eclipse-ripples-xrp-stability/,"The cryptocurrency world continues to be a battleground between trailblazing innovations and market-old giants. XRP , one of the most established cryptocurrencies, is applauded for its stability and relatively consistent performance. Yet, for investors seeking explosive growth over a shorter timeline, visions are shifting toward projects like Ruvi AI . With its potential to deliver a 100x surge by the end of 2025, Ruvi AI has captured the attention of analysts and early adopters alike. Will Ruvi AI’s innovative approach to blockchain and AI position it as a better bet for high returns over XRP? Here’s what analysts are saying. XRP’s Stability Versus Ruvi AI’s Explosive Potential XRP is undoubtedly a staple in the crypto ecosystem, largely due to its utility in cross-border payments and Ripple’s established partnerships with financial institutions. However, its pace of growth has mirrored that of a mature asset, delivering consistency but not the explosive returns often sought by high-risk, high-reward investors. On the other hand, Ruvi AI presents an irresistible opportunity for growth-oriented investors. Combining blockchain and artificial intelligence, this newcomer is leveraging real-world applications to drive both adoption and demand. Analysts predict that Ruvi AI’s focus on healthcare, logistics, and finance could propel the token to far greater heights in the coming years. Ruvi AI’s Record-Breaking Presale and Promising Metrics Ruvi AI’s ongoing presale is a clear sign of the project’s traction and market excitement. Having just entered Phase 2 , the project has achieved several key milestones: Over $1.5 million raised in funding from enthusiastic investors. Nearly 135 million tokens sold , signaling strong community backing. An upcoming 33% price increase after Phase 2, offering early participants a lucrative entry point. These figures indicate that Ruvi AI is poised for substantial growth, underscored by its practical applications and innovative technology. Real-World Applications That Drive Ruvi AI Forward Unlike speculative cryptocurrencies that rely on volatility, Ruvi AI is laying a foundation of tangible utility and scalability . The project is finding use cases in industries that affect billions of lives: Healthcare: Providing AI-driven tools for faster diagnostics and informed decision-making in medical environments.

Ruvi AI’s focus on solving real-world problems makes it not only a forward-thinking project but also a more stable long-term investment compared to speculative tokens. VIP Investment Tiers Offering High ROI Ruvi AI’s VIP investment structure makes its presale even more enticing by providing generous bonuses for early participants. Here’s a breakdown of the key tiers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. Whether you’re a small-scale investor or someone ready for a high-stakes bet, these tiers offer unparalleled potential to multiply your holdings. Strategic Partnerships Enhancing Visibility Driving accessibility and trust further, Ruvi AI has partnered with WEEX Exchange , a renowned crypto platform. By collaborating with a trusted name, Ruvi AI ensures better token visibility and trading options for global investors. This strategic step cements its readiness to scale sustainably and gain traction worldwide. Innovation Gives Ruvi AI an Edge Over XRP Despite XRP’s established position, its slower growth curve may not satisfy investors aiming for exponential gains in the next two years. Ruvi AI’s focus on solving pressing challenges with blockchain-powered AI technology positions it as a disruptive force in the crypto landscape. A target price of $1 per token by Q4 2025 aligns with Ruvi AI’s growth trajectory, offering potential returns exceeding 13,000% for early adopters. With its ability to merge innovation, scalability, and real-world applications, Ruvi AI is emerging as a high-growth opportunity that outpaces the steady, incremental gains of XRP. Final Thoughts For investors on the hunt for the next big win in crypto, Ruvi AI offers a fresh, fast-moving alternative to XRP’s safer but slower path. With an extensive presale track record, a focus on real-world impacts, and the potential for explosive growth, Ruvi AI could very well eclipse XRP in delivering massive returns before 2025 ends. Don’t miss out on your chance to be part of this AI-powered revolution.

This strategic decision, executed through the Crypto.com Exchange, highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies embracing cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury and infrastructure strategies. For anyone following the crypto market , this acquisition is a notable development. Why is BTCS Making This Significant Ethereum Acquisition? BTCS revealed it purchased 1,000 ETH for approximately $2.63 million. This single acquisition represents a significant boost, increasing their total Ethereum stash to around 13,500 ETH . According to the company’s statements, this represents a 50% increase in their ETH holdings since the first quarter of 2025. The company framed the acquisition as a move directly supporting its broader blockchain infrastructure and treasury strategy. But what does that actually mean? Let’s break it down: Treasury Strategy: Companies like BTCS are exploring ways to diversify their corporate treasury beyond traditional fiat and low-yield assets. Holding Ethereum can be seen as a hedge against inflation or a potential source of appreciation, similar to how some companies hold gold or other commodities. Blockchain Infrastructure: Ethereum is the backbone of a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). As a blockchain company, increasing their ETH holdings could also be tied to their operational needs, staking activities, or participation in the Ethereum network’s evolution. This move isn’t just about speculation; it’s presented as an integral part of their business model and future growth plans within the blockchain space. It reinforces their commitment to being active participants in the decentralized economy. Exploring the Crypto Investment Strategy Behind the 50% Boost A 50% increase in holdings is substantial for any asset, let alone a volatile one like ETH . This suggests a deliberate and potentially long-term crypto investment strategy by BTCS . Several factors might influence such a decision: Belief in Ethereum’s Future: The acquisition size indicates strong conviction in Ethereum ‘s continued dominance as a smart contract platform and its potential for future value appreciation, driven by network upgrades (like the transition to Proof-of-Stake), increasing adoption, and its central role in Web3. Timing the Market: While specific market timing is always speculative, the price point of $2.63 million for 1,000 ETH gives us a rough average price per ETH around $2,630. This suggests BTCS may have viewed the market conditions at the time of the purchase as favorable. Liquidity and Execution: Executing a $2.63 million purchase requires a platform with sufficient liquidity. Using Crypto.com Exchange facilitated this large-volume transaction efficiently, allowing BTCS to acquire the desired amount of ETH without significant price slippage. This action positions BTCS with a significant stake in one of the most prominent digital assets, aligning their balance sheet more closely with the industry they operate within. Why Crypto.com Exchange? The choice of platform for such a large acquisition is also noteworthy. Crypto.com is a major player in the cryptocurrency exchange space, known for its retail platform but also offering services for institutional and corporate clients. Using Crypto.com Exchange for this transaction likely provided BTCS with: Deep Liquidity: Essential for executing large orders without drastically affecting the price. Institutional Services: Access to specific trading tools, account management, and potentially OTC (Over-The-Counter) services suitable for corporate transactions. Regulatory Compliance: As a Nasdaq-listed company, BTCS must adhere to strict regulatory requirements. Choosing a reputable and compliant exchange like Crypto.com is crucial for executing such trades legally and transparently. This transaction underscores the role major exchanges play in facilitating corporate entry and expansion within the crypto market . What Does This Mean for BTCS and the Crypto Market? For BTCS , this crypto investment significantly increases their exposure to Ethereum ‘s price movements. While this offers potential upside if ETH appreciates, it also adds volatility to their balance sheet. However, as a blockchain company, this might be seen as a calculated risk aligned with their core business. For the broader crypto market , especially Ethereum : Validation: Corporate acquisitions like this provide further validation for Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class beyond retail speculation. Increased Demand: While 1,000 ETH is a fraction of the total supply, consistent corporate buying adds to overall demand, potentially influencing market dynamics over time. Investor Confidence: Such moves from publicly traded companies can bolster confidence among other institutional and retail investors in the asset’s long-term prospects. This isn’t the first time a public company has added crypto to its balance sheet, but each instance, particularly involving a significant boost like 50% in Ethereum , reinforces the trend of digital assets becoming mainstream components of corporate finance. Potential Benefits and Challenges of BTCS’s ETH Holdings Like any investment, holding a large amount of a volatile asset like ETH comes with its own set of pros and cons for BTCS . Benefits: Potential Appreciation: If Ethereum ‘s value increases, the value of BTCS ‘s holdings grows, positively impacting their balance sheet and potentially their stock price. Staking Yields: With 13,500 ETH , BTCS can participate in Ethereum staking, earning passive income on their holdings, further enhancing their treasury strategy. Alignment with Business: As a blockchain company, holding core digital assets like ETH aligns their financial strategy with their operational expertise and market focus. Inflation Hedge: Some view cryptocurrencies as a potential hedge against traditional currency inflation. Challenges: Market Volatility: Ethereum ‘s price can be highly volatile. Significant downward price swings could negatively impact BTCS ‘s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could pose risks to companies holding large amounts of digital assets. Security Risks: Managing and securing large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security protocols to prevent loss due to hacking or operational errors. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for digital assets are still developing, which can create complexities for publicly traded companies. BTCS must carefully manage these aspects to leverage the benefits while mitigating the risks associated with their significant Ethereum holdings. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors take away from BTCS ‘s move? Research Corporate Adoption: Pay attention to which companies are adding crypto to their balance sheets and why. This can provide insights into perceived value and institutional confidence. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just look at *what* they bought ( ETH ), but *why*. Was it for treasury, operations, or a specific strategic goal? This helps differentiate speculative moves from integrated business strategies. Evaluate Your Own Strategy: While you might not have a corporate treasury, consider how digital assets like Ethereum might fit into your own long-term investment goals, risk tolerance, and diversification strategy. Use Reputable Platforms: Just as BTCS chose Crypto.com , ensure you are using secure, regulated, and liquid exchanges for your own crypto activities. Corporate actions like this serve as valuable case studies in the evolving world of digital asset investment. Conclusion: BTCS Bets Big on Ethereum’s Future BTCS ‘s decision to acquire 1,000 ETH via Crypto.com , dramatically increasing its Ethereum holdings by 50%, is a clear signal of the company’s strategic direction and strong belief in the future of the Ethereum network and the broader crypto market . This substantial crypto investment move not only bolsters their treasury but also aligns their assets with their core business in blockchain infrastructure. While volatility remains a factor, BTCS is positioning itself to potentially benefit significantly from the continued growth and adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. This action provides further evidence that digital assets are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative tools but as legitimate components of corporate financial and operational strategies.

In its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report , CoinShares finds that last week’s institutional crypto inflows have fallen compared to previous weeks. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows of US$286m last week, bringing this 7-week run of inflows to US$10.9bn. Despite this, total assets under management (AuM) declined from the all-time high of US$187bn to US$177bn by the weekend, as prices softened amid market volatility triggered by uncertainty over US tariffs.” Source: CoinShares Regionally, the US led internationally with $199 million in inflows. Hong Kong, Germany and Australia followed with $54.8 million, $42.9 million and $21.5 million in inflows, respectively. “Switzerland saw outflows of US$32.8m, being one of the only countries to be in a net outflow position year-to-date.” Ethereum ( ETH ) has been on a six-week inflow streak, summing up to $1.19 billion, adding $321 million in inflows last week. Meanwhile, XRP experienced its second consecutive week of outflows at $28.2 million. Unusually, Bitcoin ( BTC ) products experienced outflows while the overall market experienced inflows. “The week began with strong inflows for Bitcoin, this reversed mid-week following the New York Court decision to declare US tariffs as illegal, ending the week with minor outflows of US$8m.

A key piece of Crypto Legislation , known as the GENIUS Act, is reportedly nearing a floor vote this week, according to sources tracking the intricate dance of Washington politics. This potential vote signals a critical moment for US Senate Crypto engagement and the broader landscape of US Crypto Policy . What Exactly is the GENIUS Act and Why Does it Matter for Stablecoin Regulation? At its core, the GENIUS Act (or whatever its final official name might be, as bill titles can evolve) is primarily focused on bringing clarity and structure to the world of stablecoins. These digital assets, pegged to the value of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, have grown exponentially, becoming a vital bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy. However, their rapid growth has also raised questions about stability, consumer protection, and systemic risk. This proposed Crypto Legislation aims to establish a clear regulatory framework. The key pillars often discussed include: Issuer Licensing: Requiring entities that issue stablecoins to obtain specific licenses, likely from federal or state regulators, ensuring they meet certain operational and compliance standards. Reserve Requirements: Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold reserves (like cash, short-term government bonds, etc.) that fully back the value of the stablecoins in circulation. This is crucial for ensuring that holders can redeem their stablecoins at par value, even during times of market stress. The nature and quality of these reserves are often points of intense debate. Auditing and Transparency: Requiring regular audits of reserve holdings and mandating clear, public disclosure about the composition and status of those reserves. Implementing robust Stablecoin Regulation is seen by many as a necessary step for the long-term health and adoption of stablecoins, potentially unlocking their use in mainstream payments and financial services. Without clear rules, innovation can be stifled by uncertainty, and risks to consumers and the financial system can grow unchecked. What Amendments Are Heating Up the Debate? As is typical with major pieces of legislation in the Senate, the GENIUS Act is facing numerous proposed amendments. These additions or changes reflect the diverse concerns and priorities of senators and various stakeholders. Some notable amendments reportedly being discussed include: Enhanced Disclosure Rules: Beyond just reserve transparency, proposals might include requiring more detailed disclosures about the business models of issuers, potential risks associated with the stablecoin, and how consumer funds are handled. Foreign Ownership Restrictions: Amendments could seek to limit or scrutinize ownership or control of U.S.-dollar pegged stablecoin issuers by foreign entities, citing national security or financial stability concerns. Interoperability Standards: Some lawmakers might push for requirements that stablecoins be interoperable across different blockchain networks, promoting competition and innovation. Consumer Redress Mechanisms: Proposals could include establishing clearer pathways for stablecoin holders to seek recourse if an issuer fails or mismanages reserves. These amendments add layers of complexity to the legislative process and are the subject of intense bipartisan negotiations. Finding common ground on these details is essential for the bill to gain enough support to pass the US Senate Crypto hurdle. Are There Roadblocks on the Path to a Vote? Even with bipartisan support building for core Stablecoin Regulation , the legislative calendar and competing priorities in the Senate always present challenges. One significant point of contention that could potentially delay progress on the GENIUS Act is its interaction with or proximity to other major bills, such as the Credit Card Competition Act. The Credit Card Competition Act, which aims to route credit card transactions over multiple networks, is a separate piece of legislation with its own set of supporters and opponents. Sometimes, unrelated bills can become linked or used as leverage in negotiations, potentially slowing down or complicating the path for others. Ensuring the GENIUS Act can move forward on its own merits, or finding a way to navigate potential linkages, is a key task for proponents of Crypto Legislation . Navigating the legislative process requires careful coalition building, compromise, and strategic timing. The ability of senators to resolve differences on amendments and side issues will dictate whether the bill is truly ready for a floor vote this week. Why Should You Care About This US Crypto Policy Development? Whether you hold stablecoins, other cryptocurrencies, or are simply interested in the future of digital finance, the outcome of this potential vote has significant implications: Market Certainty: Clear rules can provide much-needed certainty for businesses looking to build on stablecoin technology, potentially attracting more institutional investment and fostering innovation. Consumer Protection: Robust reserve requirements and transparency can help protect users from potential stablecoin collapses, similar to bank runs. Global Competitiveness: Establishing a thoughtful regulatory framework could position the U.S. as a leader in digital asset innovation, rather than falling behind other jurisdictions. Precedent for Other Crypto Assets: The approach taken for Stablecoin Regulation could set a precedent for how other types of crypto assets might be regulated in the future, shaping overall US Crypto Policy . This is not just about a niche financial product; it’s about how the U.S. government approaches technological innovation, financial stability, and consumer welfare in the digital age. The decisions made now regarding this Crypto Legislation will have lasting effects. What Happens Next? The focus is now on the Senate floor and backroom negotiations. If key senators can reach agreements on the proposed amendments and clear potential procedural hurdles, a vote on the GENIUS Act could indeed occur before the week concludes. However, legislative timelines in Washington are notoriously difficult to predict, and delays are always possible. Keep a close watch on reports from Capitol Hill. The outcome of this legislative push will be a major indicator of the direction of US Crypto Policy and the willingness of lawmakers to create a dedicated framework for digital assets. In Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Stablecoins and US Crypto Policy The potential US Senate Crypto vote on the GENIUS Act represents a pivotal moment for Stablecoin Regulation and the broader landscape of US Crypto Policy . With bipartisan negotiations intensifying over key provisions like issuer licensing and reserve requirements, alongside various proposed amendments, the path to passage is complex but potentially nearing a breakthrough. While challenges like competing legislative priorities exist, the drive to establish clear Crypto Legislation for stablecoins reflects a growing recognition of their importance and the need for a robust regulatory framework. The coming days in the Senate could very well shape the future of stablecoins in America and set important precedents for the digital asset space.
