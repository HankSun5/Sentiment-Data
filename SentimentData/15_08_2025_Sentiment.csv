Speaking to Reuters, Biswarup Chatterjee, Citi’s global head of partnerships and innovation for its services division, said the bank is looking at providing custody for the high-quality assets that back stablecoins. Citi’s Stablecoin Plans Could Reshape Digital Asset Payments and Settlement Under the GENIUS Act signed into law this year, issuers must hold safe assets like U.S. Treasuries or cash to support their tokens, creating an opening for traditional custody banks to step in. “Providing custody services for those high-quality assets backing stablecoins is the first option we are looking at,” Chatterjee said. Citi’s services arm, which includes treasury, cash management, and payments for major corporations, has been a core part of the bank even as it undergoes a sweeping restructuring. The interest comes as the stablecoin market grows beyond crypto trading into mainstream payments and settlements. McKinsey estimates about $250 billion in stablecoins have been issued, but usage is still largely concentrated within the crypto sector. Citi sees the recent legislation as a turning point. Citigroup @Citi is weighing its own stablecoin and diving into tokenized deposits, CEO Jane Fraser said during the Q2 earnings call, signaling a deeper digital pivot. #Citi #Stablecoins https://t.co/95SaJd4U7k — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 16, 2025 Citi is also considering issuing its own stablecoin, an idea CEO Jane Fraser confirmed in July during the bank’s second-quarter earnings call. “We are looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin, but probably most importantly is the tokenized deposit space, where we’re very active,” Fraser told analysts at the time. She said the goal was to modernize infrastructure and deliver “the benefits of advancements in stablecoin and digital assets to our clients in a safe and sound manner.” Citi’s ambitions extend beyond stablecoins. The bank is examining custody services for the crypto assets underpinning exchange-traded funds. Since the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs last year, the largest, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, has amassed a market cap of around $90 billion. “There needs to be custody of the equivalent amount of digital currency to support these ETFs,” Chatterjee noted. Coinbase currently dominates the ETF custody space, serving more than 80% of issuers. On the payments front, Citi already offers “tokenized” U.S. dollar transfers via blockchain between accounts in New York, London, and Hong Kong, operating 24 hours a day. The bank is now developing services to let clients send stablecoins between accounts or instantly convert them into dollars for payments. Chatterjee said discussions with clients are underway to identify use cases. Regulators, once cautious about traditional banks entering the crypto sector, have adopted a more accommodating stance under the current U.S. administration. Still, Citi will need to comply with anti-money laundering rules and international currency controls. Custody operations, Chatterjee stressed, must ensure assets were used for legitimate purposes before acquisition and must be backed by robust cyber and operational security. Fraser has framed Citi’s approach as a response to client needs and the broader shift toward always-on, instant settlement. “Digital assets are the next evolution in the broader digitization of payments, financing, and liquidity,” she said. “Ultimately, what we care about is what our clients want and how do we meet that need.” With $2.57 trillion in assets under custody, Citi’s entry into stablecoins and ETF crypto custody could reshape how traditional finance integrates with the digital asset economy. U.S. Banking Groups Urge Congress to Ban Stablecoin Yield Payments by Affiliates Major U.S. banking trade associations are urging Congress to bar stablecoin issuers’ affiliates from paying interest to token holders, warning it could drain deposits from banks and limit lending. U.S. bank groups seek to expand GENIUS Act limits on stablecoin interest, raising broader questions over global payments policy. #stablecoin #geniusact https://t.co/dhN9j0X3QZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 In a joint letter, the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said the GENIUS Act’s current language prohibits issuers from offering yield but leaves a gap that allows exchanges and related entities to do so. They cited Treasury estimates that interest-bearing stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, increasing funding pressure on banks and money market funds. The groups stressed that bank deposits remain a key source for loans, while stablecoins are not designed for lending and lack equivalent oversight. They warned that joint marketing between issuers and exchanges could accelerate withdrawals in times of stress, raising borrowing costs for households and businesses. They called for extending the prohibition to all intermediaries handling stablecoin transactions. The push comes amid rapid sector growth. CertiK reports stablecoin supply rose from $204 billion to $252 billion in early 2025, with USDT dominating and USDC expanding to $61 billion. PayPal’s PYUSD doubled via a Solana integration and launched a 3.7% yield program. Coinbase and PayPal maintain their reward programs, arguing the ban applies only to issuers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicts the market could grow to $2 trillion , driven by institutional adoption and regulation.

Dominance just dropped to a six-month low. Money is shifting. Alts are running faster. Ethereum leads. New, crypto-friendly regs loosen the path for institutions and funds. That opens wallets, ETFs, and custody flows. The result is capital rotating into ETH and other majors. The dominance chart printed its first monthly bearish cross since January 2021. That cross mattered before. In 2021, it prefaced four months of alt strength. If the pattern repeats, markets could see an “up-only” stretch into December 2025. Bitcoin dominance hits 6-month low Altcoin market growth is beginning to outpace #Bitcoin , fueled by renewed strength in #Ethereum following the introduction of crypto-friendly regulations that support broader global adoption. pic.twitter.com/WeoIWW5bVx — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) August 14, 2025 Bitcoin still makes headlines. It logged a fresh all-time high this week, pushing prices into the mid-$124k range. The breakout tightened the narrative: BTC rallies, institutions cheer, and headline flow accelerates. From the August 3 low of $111,982, Bitcoin has bounced more than 9%, a clean reward for dip buyers. Some analysts now voice targets as high as $200,000 by year-end. SpaceX’s crypto position sits at the center of the story. Arkham’s on-chain tracking ties an address to SpaceX that holds 8,285 BTC. After the recent ATH, that stash crossed the $1 billion mark. The math is simple. SpaceX bought between December 31, 2020, and June 10, 2022. BTC traded near $30k when the firm last reshuffled. Today, at six-figure prices, that position has climbed more than 300% in value and now reads roughly $1.02 billion on the books. Arkham’s record also shows the company moved 17,314 BTC into Coinbase Prime across late May to early June 2022, a transfer market watchers treat as a past sell or custody reallocation. Three weeks ago the wallet moved 1,308 BTC to a new address labelled “bc1q8,” but Arkham flags that move as a relocation, not a liquidation. The coins remain on-chain and unsold. Musk’s Tesla Still Holds Bitcoin Position Tesla rounds out the Musk crypto picture. The carmaker still holds 11,509 BTC. At today’s prices that stake sits in the low-to-mid-billion range, bringing Elon-linked corporate BTC to roughly $2.4 billion combined. Arkham and corporate filings show the pair bought their positions at an average price near $32,000. That cost basis amplifies the unrealized gains on their balance sheets and normalizes the idea of corporate crypto allocation for other firms. Elon Musk’s SpaceX #Bitcoin Holding Exceeds $1B Amid $BTC Rally to New All-Time High. The SpaceX Bitcoin holding has surpassed $1 billion following the cryptocurrency’s rally to a new record high. Data from Arkham highlighted this, as SpaceX’s diamond hand continues to pay off.… pic.twitter.com/vQwdy6pZG2 — TheCryptoBasic (@thecryptobasic) August 14, 2025 Token data points punctuate the move. CoinMarketCap shows Bitcoin trading with a multi-trillion dollar market cap and Ethereum moving higher on the rotation. Quick drops matter. When a token is named, toss a snapshot. BTC: price in the six figures, market cap in the trillions. ETH : price in the low-to-mid thousands, market cap in the hundreds of billions, flows and yield chase now tilt toward smart-contract collateral and ETFable infrastructure. Why this feels structural: three forces line up. First, regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions reduces frictions for big money. Second, corporate treasuries with “diamond hands” sit on huge unrealized profits and show no intent to sell. Third, a bearish cross on BTC dominance signals rotation, not rejection. The net effect is broader market participation. Assets that were once niche now sit on institutional radars. Early entrants reap gains. Late entrants chase performance. What to expect next. Volatility stays high. Rotations accelerate. Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and other majors can run hard while BTC consolidates at new highs. If the 2021 pattern holds, altcoins could enjoy multi-quarter upside that stretches into late 2025. That does not mean smooth sailing. Pullbacks and headlines will yank price action daily. But the macro setup leans bullish: clearer rules, corporate HODLers, and fresh capital seeking growth beyond a single coin. Quick facts: Bitcoin dominance at a six-month low with a monthly bearish cross; BTC ATH this week near $124k; SpaceX holds 8,285 BTC (~~$1.02B); Tesla holds 11,509 BTC (~~$1.4B); combined Musk firms sit on roughly $2.42B in Bitcoin at an average buy-in near $32k. The market is no longer a one-horse race. Bitcoin still leads the parade. But altcoins now sprint beside it. Institutions and corporate treasuries are watching. December 2025 looks set to be a defining checkpoint, and right now the tape favors a broad, multi-asset rally. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Many of the biggest opportunities for outsized gains are coming from altcoins with strong fundamentals, active ecosystems, and catalysts that could trigger substantial upside. As traders look beyond Bitcoin for the next breakout candidates, Ethereum, XRP and Toncoin are consistently appearing on analysts’ buy lists. Ethereum Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs, and smart contract innovation. The current Ethereum 2.0 updates have eased the gas a lot and also enhanced the scalability which are some of the major challenges that ETH network is facing. Solutions within the L2 sector – such as Arbitrum and Optimism – are also attracting additional users with cheaper and faster transactions . Institutional uptake is picking up pace, with ETFs and mega-partnerships fulfilling the status of Ethereum as a blue – chip crypto. Being the most popular platform among the developers, ETH will continue to become the main asset of those who plan to take part in the great market rally. XRP XRP has re-entered the spotlight following regulatory clarity in its case against the SEC. With that hurdle cleared , Ripple is focusing on expanding its global payment network, RippleNet, which enables fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Financial institutions are already adopting it in various parts and the layers of infrastructure have been supplied to it to go wider. Among the most interesting altcoins, which investors can consider, XRP would be one of the rare ones that combine an established utility and new activities levels. While established leaders like Ethereum and XRP provide stability, some of the highest percentage gains historically have come from early-stage projects just before their breakout moments. MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for showing patterns similar to ETH and XRP in their formative stages – rapid community growth, limited early supply, and consistent sellouts in funding rounds . The project’s roadmap includes utility-driven features designed to support long-term adoption, rather than relying on hype alone. For traders looking to position ahead of a potential Q4 surge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a strategic addition alongside more established assets. Toncoin Toncoin’s unique advantage lies in its deep integration with Telegram, one of the largest messaging platforms in the world. By embedding blockchain functionality directly into an app used by hundreds of millions, TON lowers the barrier to entry for new crypto users . Features like in-app payments, DeFi tools, and NFT marketplaces are already live or in development, potentially bringing Web3 capabilities to a massive mainstream audience. This ease of access and built-in user funnel give TON a distinct growth path that few other projects can match. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, Toncoin, and Sei each bring unique strengths to the table – from established networks to emerging adoption models. Such balance (by the means of pairing them with early stage plays such as MAGACOIN FINANCE) enables one to capture the savour of two worlds in one, having both the low volatility and the huge upside potential . As market sentiment is already improving and new money is getting into altcoins – the next breakout could be well rewarding systematic positioning prior to the crowd.

The on-chain trail shows a basket of major and layer-2 assets. Here’s a quick price snapshot from CoinMarketCap at reporting time: ETH — ~$4,692 AVAX (Avalanche) — ~$24.11. ARB (Arbitrum) — ~$0.53. OP (Optimism) — ~$0.78. MNT (Mantle) — ~$1.11 MATIC / POL (Polygon) — ~ $0.24. Those tokens moved in slices across chains. The attacker then routed many of them through swaps and liquidity paths that end in ETH — a common laundering tactic because ETH offers deep liquidity on DEXs and easier aggregation. Lookonchain’s thread documents swaps and shows the piecemeal conversion into ETH. Why this matters now: converting to ETH lets an attacker fragment value across pools and DEX routes, then layer transfers through many addresses or services. That increases the chance of slipping funds into privacy rails or into centralized platforms that may be harder to freeze unless quickly alerted. Rapid cross-chain movement also raises the chance some portions slip out of easy reach. What BtcTurk users should know: deposits and withdrawals from hot wallets are paused. Trading and Turkish-lira operations continue. Check only official BtcTurk announcements for status updates. Do not follow unverified links or third-party instructions that claim to “fix” your account. What investigators are likely doing: security teams from major exchanges and chain-analysis firms typically coordinate fast. They try to trace the funds, identify known mixer or exchange on-ramps, and request freezes where possible. Public trackers and firms like Lookonchain and CyversAlerts are already mapping the flow; their threads present the real-time breadcrumbs. Bottom line: this is an active laundering event with clear signs of a hot-wallet compromise. $48M worth of assets moved across ETH, AVAX, ARB, BASE, OP, MNT and MATIC — most ending up in two addresses and being swapped into ETH. BtcTurk has paused crypto deposits/withdrawals while it investigates and promises to restore services once secure.

Market signs seem to support that view. Today, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, exactly one month after its previous historic peak of $122,838, suggesting bullish momentum is stirring. On the policy front, President Trump last month approved the GENIUS Act, the first federal framework requiring stablecoins to be fully backed by reserves. Soon after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rolled out Project Crypto , a major modernization plan for securities regulation aimed at clearing up long-standing ambiguities in digital asset oversight. Together, these developments show the administration’s intent to follow through on its pledge to make America the global hub for blockchain innovation. With optimism building, some analysts expect the next gold rush across meme coins and altcoins could top 2021’s heady highs, led, if DeepSeek is correct, by XRP, Pepe, and Shiba Inu. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Model Predicts 3× Gains, Possibly Hitting $10 by December DeepSeek’s AI models suggest XRP ($XRP) could climb toward $10 before the end of 2025, more than tripling its current $3.12 price tag. XRP’s momentum has been strong. On July 18, it reached $3.65, beating its 2018 record of $3.40, before retracing about 14%. Still, the token has posted a 9% advance on last month, outperforming Bitcoin, which has remained static after falling 4.2% from its ATH over the last few hours. Global recognition for Ripple’s payment technology has been growing. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund named XRP a top contender for efficient international transactions. Ripple also closed a multi-year legal battle with the SEC this year after regulators dropped their case, cementing a key 2023 court decision that retail XRP sales are not securities. Should XRP reclaim its ATH and break higher, DeepSeek believes $5 is easily achievable, with $10 possible in a sustained bull market. Technical metrics are also promising: RSI is trending higher from 56, indicating increased buying. Over the past year, XRP has soared 452%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% and Ethereum’s 76% rallies. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Heavyweight Could Jump 6× Before Year-End Debuting in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly become one of the top three meme cryptocurrencies, now boasting a $4.8 billion market cap and leading all non-dog-themed meme tokens. Despite fierce rivalry in the meme sector, Pepe’s active community and deep liquidity keep it competitive. Elon Musk has hinted at holding Pepe alongside Dogecoin, occasionally teasing fans with subtle nods on X, including a brief stint using a Pepe avatar. Trading at $0.00001133, Pepe has gained 5% over the last seven days, outperforming Bitcoin. A 6% dip over the past 24 hours mirrors corrections across other meme leaders, with DOGE falling 5% and the entire sub-sector shedding 4% of its value to command a collective market cap of $77.3 billion. DeepSeek estimates a year-end target of $0.00005, just under five times the current price, well above its previous high of $0.00002803 set late last year. A descending wedge pattern on its chart, typically a bullish setup, between November and March, hints at a breakout. If market conditions remain favorable, Pepe could even exceed DeepSeek’s baseline forecast before 2025 begins. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum’s Most Handy Meme Coin Could 76× in a Bull Run, according to DeepSeek AI Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has cemented its place as Dogecoin’s largest rival, with a market capitalization of roughly $7.7 billion. Currently priced near $0.00001312, SHIB is edging out of two notable bullish setups, a bullish falling wedge and a flag pattern formed earlier this year. If it breaks resistance around $0.000025, DeepSeek projects a move into the $0.0003–$0.001 range, representing potential 23× to 76× gains. The RSI is climbing from 42, pointing to rising buying interest. Token burns are also accelerating scarcity: over the course of one week last month, over 1.3 billion SHIB were destroyed, spiking the burn rate above 2,000%. Beyond its meme roots, Shiba Inu now features the Shibarium Layer-2 network, designed to enhance scalability, cut transaction costs, and support decentralized applications. The coin has also added privacy features in a bid to enhance utility and make it a standout among meme coins. Maxi Doge Presale Nears $1M as Hype Grows Around Potential 100× Play For those chasing high-risk, high-reward meme plays, presales could yield potentially more substantial upside than the multibillion coins under analysis by DeepSeek AI. Maxi Doge (MAXI) , a Dogecoin-inspired newcomer, has already drawn over $904,000 just days after launch. Running on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI emphasizes community building through active social channels, trading competitions, and promotional partnerships. A quarter of its total 150.24 billion token supply is set aside in the “Maxi Fund” for marketing and collaborations. Stakers can currently earn up to 318% APY—though rates will decline as more participants join. Priced at $0.000252 during its current presale stage, the token will increase in price in under 48 hours as it enters the next round, giving early buyers extra value before listing. Interested investors can purchase via the Maxi Doge website using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Follow Maxi Doge on X and Telegram to keep up to date with developments.

It hit $124,128 before declining 2.1% to its current price of $121,100. The achievement has reignited speculation that a long-anticipated post-halving bull run may finally be underway. Investor interest has expanded beyond Bitcoin, spilling into major altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the past year, assets like XRP, TRON, Solana, Sui Network, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each set new price records. U.S. policymakers further boosted sentiment recently when they took major steps toward cohesive crypto regulation. Just four days after BTC’s milestone, on July 18, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first comprehensive stablecoin law. Meanwhile, the SEC rolled out “ Project Crypto ,” a sweeping initiative to modernize securities laws and deliver long-awaited regulatory clarity for digital assets. With optimism running high, we take a look at how these high-performing altcoins could soon retest or surpass their historical peaks. Ripple (XRP): Ripple’s Signature Crypto Eyes New Price Highs Amid Growing Global Recognition Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a fresh record of $3.65 on July 18, the day the GENIUS Act became law, eclipsing its 2018 peak of $3.40. Since then, it has eased to roughly $3.22, about 11% down from its historic peak. XRP remains a favorite for long-term investors thanks to its ability to facilitate fast, inexpensive cross-border payments without relying on traditional, slow-moving systems like SWIFT. Its competitive advantage has drawn notice from high-profile entities, including the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was one of just two crypto executives invited to a presidential summit on digital assets. A pivotal win came in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not breach securities laws, effectively ending a lengthy SEC battle and restoring market confidence. In the last 12 months, XRP’s value has surged 459%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 99% gain. A bullish flag formation from January to April broke upward in June, and momentum is holding. Over the past week, XRP has climbed 7.6%, topping Bitcoin’s 5.4% rise despite the latter achieving an ATH. With its relative strength index (RSI) uptrending from 56 and price consolidating near its 30-day moving average at $3 at the start of August, the charts suggest a push toward $4 could happen as soon as September.

Launched in 2023, Sei ($SEI) boasts it is “at the pinnacle of high-speed blockchain platforms.” It utilizes a specialized consensus mechanism called Tendermint , which prioritizes low-latency, high-throughput transactions, making it validate blocks in 6 seconds, half the time of Ethereum. This makes it attractive for developers looking to build decentralized exchanges, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces where speed and price fairness are crucial. While the race for “fastest chain” is crowded, Sei’s infrastructure-first approach and its backing by prominent venture firms indicates a lofty ambition to become the default settlement layer for on-chain trading activity. In the last seven days, Sei has surged 17% to hit a price of $0.3469, outperforming both Bitcoin and XRP along the way. The intraweek price surge is down to support from MetaMask , a bullish indicator that Sei’s ecosystem is growing. Sei hit an ATH of $1.14 in mid-March last year, which it has since pulled away from by about 69.6%. Still, Sei’s focus on delivering high-quality tech, along with increasing market appetite for altcoins that can outperform Ethereum, are strong indicators that it could be primed for a run soon. It’s likely to face resistance at $0.50 but once cleared, a run up to its December 2024 high of $0.71 is not inconceivable before the end of the year. OKB ($OKB): Price Surged 170% in Intraday Trading as OKX Team Executes Massive Crypto Burn OKB ($OKB) is the native utility token of OKX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume. Just yesterday, it surged 170% in intraday trading to hit an ATH of $135.32, after months of trading sideways. This was thanks to the OKX team executing a $7.6 billion $OBK token burn and announcing a major upgrade With this robust upgrade, we’re building the world’s most interoperable, accessible & compliant onchain ecosystem — and XLayer is the OS powering it all. https://t.co/d09izmHx5I pic.twitter.com/jH16wrK839 — OKX (@okx) August 14, 2025 Launched in 2019, OKB underpins a loyalty and rewards ecosystem that offers holders fee discounts, passive income opportunities, and access to exclusive trading events. The token also fuels OKX’s “Jumpstart” platform for new project launches, and holders can use it for payment across an expanding list of partner merchants. Periodic “buy-back and burn” programs reduce circulating supply, a strategy aimed at long-term value support. However, in the near term, OKB will struggle to maintain its current price of $102.11. That’s because the token is due for a correction. While it could still consolidate at a price significantly higher than it’s $2024 peak of $72.22, there will be a lot of traders taking profits from this overnight run. Its RSI is cooling from a way overscorched 92, which suggests the token is vastly overvalued right now, placing significant sell pressure on holders. Still, it’s likely any subsequent crash will bottom out around $70, where the token enjoys strong support. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Meme-Powered Layer 2 for Bitcoin Among the newest presale projects, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has turned heads as the first Layer 2 network for Bitcoin that blends scalability tech with meme-driven viral marketing and community-building appeal. Its mission is to accelerate BTC transactions, expand use cases, and maintain an approachable, community-led ethos.

The idea? Use government cash to prop up Intel’s struggling chip business and keep advanced manufacturing on U.S. soil. The news hit the markets fast, and traders responded even faster. That one headline alone was enough to shoot Intel’s stock straight up. The deal , if it happens, would send federal money straight into Intel’s new manufacturing sites in Ohio, a project that’s already faced delays and cuts. Trump has been loud about wanting more chips built in the U.S., and Intel remains the only American company still capable of building the most advanced processors in the country. Foreign rivals like TSMC and Samsung have factories on U.S. ground, but they’re not domestic players. Trump wants an American company leading that race, and right now, Intel’s the only one even remotely qualified. Trump slammed the CEO, then invited him to talk Just days before the equity stake talk broke, Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO, was publicly called out by Trump, who demanded he step down. Trump accused him of being “highly conflicted” over investments in Chinese tech firms. He posted it straight to his Truth Social platform. But even after that, Tan still went to the White House for a Monday meeting with Trump, where the equity idea was discussed. That detail was later confirmed by Wall Street Journal . The deal isn’t locked in, and it could still collapse. But the fact that they’re even talking about it, especially after the president’s attacks, says everything. Intel’s team is trying to stay quiet. A spokesperson said, “We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.” When pressed about Tan’s loyalty, the company said he’s “deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests.” That’s as far as they went. Tan took over as CEO earlier this year after Intel completely botched its attempt to grab a piece of the AI chip market. While competitors like Nvidia were blowing past benchmarks, Intel was stuck with old products and an identity crisis. To pivot, it dumped billions into a new foundry business, building chips for others. But the results haven’t shown up. No major customers have signed on. Without those deals, the entire foundry plan looks like a long, expensive gamble. Intel cuts back as Trump expands government control In July, Tan made a tough call: Intel canceled factory plans in Germany and Poland and said it would slow down spending in Ohio. That same Ohio development is now at the center of this new White House plan. The government stake would keep it alive… for now. But investors know Intel’s troubles run deeper. This isn’t just about buildings or machines. Intel lost $2.9 billion in Q2, and it hasn’t figured out how to fix its broken lineup. AI chips? Still behind. Business model? Still clunky. Trump’s not just watching. He’s getting involved. His administration already forced Nvidia and AMD to hand over 15% of their China chip sales just to keep their export licenses. Last week, the Pentagon took a $400 million stake in MP Materials, a rare-earth mining firm. Then came the “golden share” in U.S. Steel, giving Trump control in the Nippon Steel acquisition. Now he’s eyeing Intel as the next big move. Inside Trump’s camp, Intel is seen as the only real shot the U.S. has at challenging Taiwan Semiconductor. Everyone else is playing catch-up or building in foreign territories. Even though Intel is now up 19% for 2025, it’s coming off the worst year in its history, a brutal 60% drop in 2024. Wall Street hasn’t forgotten. Investors want to believe, but they want results more. One bad product cycle, one failed factory deal, and the government stake could turn into dead weight. Trump’s growing control of tech and heavy-handed intervention in private business isn’t slowing down. But Intel? Still trying to prove it can turn this thing around. They put out a final statement saying, “Intel is deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” while refusing to say a word about the equity stake.

The health insurance giant UnitedHealth, which had lost nearly half its value in 2025, suddenly surged 7% on Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission published Berkshire’s 13F filing. The buy included more than 5 million shares, placing UnitedHealth as the 18th largest stock holding in Berkshire’s $300 billion portfolio. That puts it right after Amazon and Constellation Brands. The trade happened during the second quarter but was only made public now. While Warren Buffett’s name sits at the top of the company, it’s widely assumed his two deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, pulled the trigger on this one. Warren said back in 2019 that it was one of his managers who took the Amazon position. This feels similar. Berkshire team grabs falling stock while DOJ investigation hits UnitedHealth Before this trade surfaced, UnitedHealth was a disaster. Its stock had been obliterated, down 50% year-to-date, and its reputation had been wrecked. The Department of Justice is currently investigating how the company billed Medicare. The scrutiny comes as part of the federal crackdown on inflated claims across the health sector. In May, CEO Andrew Witty resigned, and the company pulled its earnings guidance for the rest of the year. That move alone triggered panic selling. Then in July, UnitedHealth released a new outlook for 2025 that missed expectations. The result? The stock kept sinking. There was no recovery in sight. The timing of the Berkshire purchase, then, was shocking. But it also fits a clear pattern: buy big names when everyone else is terrified. Warren once called the U.S. healthcare system a “tapeworm” on the economy. Back in 2018, he even teamed up with Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon to try and fix it through a joint health venture for employees. That project collapsed. But now, five years later, the team at Berkshire is buying in again; not to fix the system, but to own a piece of it while it’s dirt cheap. Other trades emerge as Apple gets sliced, markets rebound off inflation report UnitedHealth wasn’t the only move in Berkshire’s latest disclosure. The firm also picked up new stakes in Nucor, Lamar Advertising, and Allegion. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, jumped 8% in extended trading after the news. Homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton, both of which Berkshire had previously exited, were also back on the list. Their shares climbed 3% apiece. While all that buying was happening, there was selling too. The firm trimmed its Apple position by 7%. Apple is still the largest stock holding in the portfolio, followed by American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and Chevron. But the reduction shows that Berkshire is adjusting. It also reduced its exposure to Bank of America, tightening its grip on the financial sector. This flurry of trades came on the same day U.S. indexes had to fight back from a brutal morning. A nasty wholesale inflation report hit just before the open. The Producer Price Index jumped 0.9% in July, smashing the 0.2% forecast. In June, the number had been flat. The spike spooked investors and instantly crushed hopes for a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were both down 0.4% at their lows. The Dow dropped more than 200 points. But dip buyers showed up late in the day, dragging the S&P back up to 6,468.54, a 0.03% gain. That tiny lift was enough for the S&P to notch its third straight record close. The Nasdaq closed at 21,710.67, down 0.01%, while the Dow slipped just 11 points to finish at 44,911.26. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Recently, it bounced back at the mark of $120,000. It is again starting to gain momentum as institutions start to flow in again. Market experts at Matrixport and VanEck predict a cycle-top price of $180K–$220K for BTC by 2026’s first quarter. While Bitcoin offers long-term confidence for investors, it is smaller altcoins that provide the trend of asymmetric upside that early-stage investors crave. A project creating some waves currently is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently impressed hype coin veterans and DeFi traders. Bitcoin Faces Resistance But Eyes $200K Institutional confidence remains strong as Bitcoin ETFs see above $1.2 billion in net inflows over the last 10 days. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC are leading the way, seeing demand build at levels that most would not have thought possible in Q3 2025. On-chain metrics are also supportive. Since August 1, over 92,000 BTC have left exchanges, suggesting investors are preparing to hold Bitcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is retracting from the overbought territory, and many analysts now believe that the BTC value could retest the $130K mark before a move towards $200K in 2026. Small-Cap Altcoin Eyes 55x Upside Despite the 65% potential upside presented by Bitcoin, it may not be enough for retail traders to flip five figures to seven. The select small-cap altcoins are now perking up! Analysts are focusing on low-market capitalization altcoins that have viral community potential and sound fundamentals. It will be ideal if they also possess security audits and tokenomics designed to ensure scarcity. Projects that fit these criteria often deliver 30x–80x in bull runs, especially if they are listed on Tier-1 exchanges when the hype is at its peak. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Forecast Models Predict a 61x Return MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining traction among both institutional players and retail investors. Forecast models predict a 61x return for early backers positioning before the next market expansion, with rising whale accumulation, increasing liquidity inflows, and a strategically timed roadmap ahead of key exchange listings, amplifying market confidence. As anticipation builds and momentum strengthens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as a high-potential play for those aiming to lock in substantial gains before the broader market rally takes shape. Final Thoughts As Bitcoin continues to grind toward $200,000 with institutional momentum behind it, early retail investors are looking for faster multipliers elsewhere. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in — offering a uniquely timed opportunity at the presale stage. With strong fundamentals, social buzz, and whale accumulation on the rise, this altcoin could be the standout story of the next market expansion.

The stablecoin issuer, which started trading in early June, has seen its stock explode by 349%, and now insiders, including CEO Jeremy Allaire, are unloading fast. The planned sale includes 10 million shares, with 2 million coming from Circle itself and the rest from shareholders like Allaire. This offering was announced on Tuesday, only a day before crypto exchange Bullish skyrocketed 84% in its own public debut. The move is happening way earlier than expected (Circle’s insiders were supposed to be under lock-up until year-end), but JPMorgan, the lead underwriter and the one with the final say, gave the green light. According to Bloomberg, this all unfolded while investor demand for crypto IPOs was peaking. JPMorgan allows early selling amid record gains This new sale is moving quickly. It’s a two-day marketed offering and has already been oversubscribed, with pricing expected by Thursday. Circle hasn’t made any public comment, but the numbers speak for themselves. Even though the stock is now trading at less than half of its $298.99 peak from June 23, it’s still way up from the IPO price. And this $1.4 billion figure is larger than what the company brought in during the IPO itself. David Erickson, a finance professor at Columbia Business School and former co-head of equity capital markets at Barclays, called the move “a cash-in exercise,” pointing to the massive run-up since the IPO. He said that even though the shares are being dumped, they’ll probably sell at a steep discount compared to pre-deal trading levels. But after a 400% gain, the discount hardly matters; everyone selling is still walking away with profits. Sales like this, so soon after an IPO, used to be standard in the dot-com boom era. Erickson said he was surprised more 2025 IPOs hadn’t done the same this year, considering how many stocks have spiked. Circle joins a wave of early post-IPO offerings Circle may be moving fast, but they’re not alone. Just last month, Karman Holdings Inc. had its shareholders offload 21 million shares at over double the IPO price. That came six months after its February debut. In 2024, other firms like Viking Holdings, UL Solutions, and StandardAero also jumped the gun, selling shares before lock-ups expired. But Circle’s speed beats them all. Even with how fast this sell-off came, investors aren’t panicking. The stock has had two full months of heavy, high-volume trading, and the market seems used to the volatility. Jeff Zell, senior analyst at IPO Boutique, said the company’s wild debut and steady performance gave the market time to price things properly. “After such an enthusiastic IPO debut and two months of steady, high-volume trading at elevated levels,” he said, “the market has had time to price the company rationally.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Meanwhile, BTC reserves on Binance have surged significantly, raising concerns about a potential price correction. Bitcoin Reserves Spike On Binance: Time To Worry? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Binance’s Bitcoin reserves have seen a sharp increase in recent months. The exchange holds the largest BTC reserves, supported by its high liquidity and the largest trading volume in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Eyes ATH With Falling Average Executed Order Size And Rising Retail Activity From the end of July until today, Binance-based BTC reserves have reversed a previous downtrend, climbing to 579,000 BTC. Arab Chain shared the following chart illustrating how BTC reserves – after a period of scarcity – have reversed course and now signal a short-term warning. Notably, BTC reserves on Binance had previously declined by approximately 50,000 to 60,000 BTC, a 9% to 10% drop from the 2024 peak to the July 2025 low. Recently, reserves recovered slightly, rising by 25,000 to 30,000 BTC, an increase of 5% to 6%. Despite this recovery, BTC reserves remain well below the peaks of late 2024, indicating that structural scarcity has not yet fully dissipated. Arab Chain highlighted two potential reasons for the recent spike in reserves. First, profit-taking or short-term supply could increase when traders – including whales and market makers – deposit BTC on exchanges. They may do this to sell part of their holdings or to use the digital asset as collateral in derivatives markets. Second, a liquidity boost for BTC can occur when growing demand leads to the replenishment of liquidity pools. Market makers may also rebalance their portfolios to help smooth price spreads. The analyst concluded: In practice, if daily or weekly reserve increases persist alongside high positive funding rates and rising open interest, the likelihood of a short-term correction grows. However, if reserves stabilize or decline quickly, this would suggest renewed scarcity and a continuation of the uptrend. BTC Rally Losing Momentum? BTC pulled back from its recent ATH, trading slightly above $118,000 at the time of writing, signaling a short-term price correction. Some analysts warn that this might indicate the flagship cryptocurrency is losing momentum. Related Reading: Two Forces Can Launch Bitcoin To $1 Million, Says Mike Novogratz In addition to rising exchange reserves, the Binance whale-to-exchange flow metric also points to increased selling pressure. The spike in Binance miner distributions reinforces this signal. That said, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Axel Adler notes that BTC’s current market structure makes a severe price correction unlikely. At press time, BTC trades at $118,464, down 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

USDT Most Used Crypto On CoinGate Overall, Bitcoin Second Cryptocurrency payments processor CoinGate has shared new data breaking down digital asset payments preferences around the world. First, below is a table showing how the composition of overall cryptocurrency orders has changed during the last few years. It would appear that Bitcoin was leading in payments on CoinGate back in 2023, with 35.4% of all orders involving it. In 2024, however, the original cryptocurrency lost dominance as its share dropped to just 21%, while Tether ‘s stablecoin grew from 25.5% to 39.7% and became the top choice on the platform. In the first half of 2025, though, USDT shed its gains with its payment share plunging back to 24.8%. That said, the stablecoin still kept the first place, as Bitcoin only recovered to 23.3%. One cryptocurrency that has shown consistent growth through the years is Litecoin . From the table, it’s visible that LTC has tightly held onto its third-place spot, with its share rising from 9.3% in 2023 to 13.6% in 2025. Thus, it seems the blockchain’s cheap and fast transactions are slowly attracting a consistent user base. Now, here is an infographic that shows the top 10 countries in terms of crypto payment usage in 2025: As displayed above, the US is the number one nation in terms of digital asset payments, with 23.28% of the world’s CoinGate orders occurring within it. Germany is second at 6.57% and the UK third at 4.88%. While this chart highlights the overall transaction share for each country, it doesn’t answer one important question: which cryptocurrencies are being used in these countries? According to CoinGate data, the distribution is different between the various regions. Bitcoin is the top choice of American users, finding use in 40% of transfers. “The U.S. is also the global leader in Lightning Network usage — more than half (54%) of all Lightning transactions come from American shoppers,” says CoinGate. Europe is more mixed in usage, with no coin in particular dominating and preferences varying across countries. When it comes to Asia, however, there is indeed a strong preference: stablecoins. USDT occupies 50% of all orders in Hong Kong and 43% in India. In terms of altcoin usage, one country that stands out is the African nation of Nigeria, making up for 8% and 7% of global BNB and Shiba Inu orders, respectively.

The most promising picks blend solid fundamentals, clear growth drivers, and active communities, and several names are emerging as front-runners. BlockDAG is drawing attention with its record-setting presale and advanced Layer-1 design, Dogecoin continues to show staying power with meme-driven appeal, Pepe benefits from whale-fueled momentum, and Shiba Inu is eyeing a possible technical breakout. While each asset has different strengths, they share one important factor: sustained momentum going into 2025. BlockDAG: Strong Presale and Rapid Growth Path BlockDAG is becoming a leading contender for the best crypto to invest in 2025, having already raised over $373 million in its presale while targeting $600M. Now in Batch 29 at $0.0276, it offers what may be one of the last early entry points before final stages lift prices higher. Forecasts suggest BlockDAG (BDAG) could reach $1 during its first major bull run, representing potential triple-digit gains. Its hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work structure enables fast transactions while maintaining decentralization, positioning it as a serious competitor in the Layer-1 market. With EVM compatibility, Ethereum-based dApps can integrate smoothly, speeding up adoption. The scale of engagement is already significant: 2.5 million X1 app miners, more than 200,000 holders, and 19,000 ASIC miners sold ahead of mainnet launch. Global visibility is increasing through campaigns like the Inter Milan sponsorship. At $0.0276, demand is building quickly, and this presale stage may be one of the most critical opportunities before 2025’s major market shift. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin’s resilience within the meme coin space keeps it positioned as one of the best crypto to invest in 2025. With a 17% gain over the past week and strong liquidity supporting a $34.5 billion market cap, DOGE continues to draw active market participants. That said, with 84% of holders currently in profit, profit-taking remains a possibility. Analysts are divided, with some expecting DOGE’s deeply established community to drive it toward the $1 mark, while others highlight the risk of volatility ahead. For those committed to long-term meme coin exposure, DOGE still holds a central place. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe’s recent rally, marked by a 12.6% single-day surge, reinforces its presence in discussions about the best crypto to invest in 2025 among meme-focused traders. Trading at $0.000012 with close to $900 million in daily volume, PEPE’s momentum is currently supported by whale accumulation and strong market sentiment. While its high volatility leaves room for quick reversals, its active meme culture, sustained momentum, and consistent trading levels suggest it could remain competitive in the near to medium term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu is trading near the $0.000014 resistance level, with market analysts watching for a possible breakout that could yield a 156% rally. A bullish falling wedge pattern also points to potential gains of up to 30% in the shorter term. However, a drop in whale activity underscores the need for a decisive break above resistance. Despite this, its active ecosystem and loyal base continue to support SHIB’s status as a potential best crypto to invest in 2025 for those betting on meme coin durability. Conclusion The best crypto to invest in 2025 will ultimately depend on individual risk profiles and market strategies, yet these four stand out for different reasons. BlockDAG is notable for its early pricing, advanced design, and substantial presale progress, offering a mix of innovation and growth potential. Dogecoin and Pepe highlight the enduring influence of meme coin culture, while Shiba Inu is positioned for possible gains backed by technical setups and community support. In a fast-moving market, acting early on strong projects with defined growth pathways can be decisive. With fundamentals, momentum, and adoption aligning, these four are worth close attention, and for some, active positioning ahead of 2025’s market shifts.

With Bitcoin smashing past $120,000 and Ethereum holding over $4,600, altcoins are loading up for the next price surge. But while mainstream investors are still chasing the headlines, early movers are quietly securing positions in high growth Defi projects with massive ROI potential before the herd arrives. Four standouts Polkadot, VeChain, Litecoin and RTX, the explosive newcomer are creeping into crypto headlines and portfolios with strong fundamentals. Here’s all you need to know. Polkadot Price Predictions: Closing In on $10 Breakout Polkadot’s upgrade to Polkadot 2.0 has supercharged its interoperability edge. The top altcoin has ignited strong bullish momentum after recently breaking out, smashing through short positions and hitting its first target at $4.18. The momentum remains firmly in Polkadot bulls favor with no major selling pressure visible so far. In the future, analysts observe that DOT remains close to the lower end of its mid-range price band and therefore there remains substantial upside potential to the price, up to $5 in the near future and up to $8.20 by 2026 . VeChain: Supply Chain Adoption Pushes Higher VeChain’s bounce from $0.02220 to $0.0263 shows clear accumulation. Its real-world applications in supply chain verification, plus enterprise partnerships in food, pharma and fashion, give VET a powerful edge. Analysts see an 18% rally to $0.030575 this month as whale activity picks up and staking rewards expand. Litecoin: ETF Speculation and Adoption Spike Litecoin is up 6.4% in 24 hours, breaking $125 resistance and eyeing $180. With ETF filings from Grayscale and CoinShares in motion and network activity at record highs, LTC is attracting both institutional and retail investors. If momentum holds, a surge into the $200–$220 range isn’t off the table. Remittix: The Sleeper High Growth Crypto Set to Leave Top Altcoins Behind Forget chasing yesterday’s winners, Remittix is the next 100x crypto play that whales are loading up on now. Priced at just $0.0944 with over $19.3M already raised, RTX is weeks away from its September 15th beta wallet launch and once that drops, everything changes. Remittix isn’t hype; it’s infrastructure. It enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries with 40+ supported tokens, real-time FX rates and institutional-grade security. And with whales already shifting millions from Solana and Ethereum into RTX, the early-stage window is about to slam shut. Why you need RTX before the listing: First-mover advantage in the $19T global payments market Beta wallet launch in weeks Institutional security via CertiK audit Business-ready API for instant adoption Deflationary model = rising scarcity Remittix’s $20M presale milestone will trigger the first major exchange listing announcement and end the 40% bonus promotion. The $250,000 giveaway is the icing on the cake, every purchase now gets you entries. When that listing drops, the price will reprice instantly as liquidity floods in.

50101741,https://cryptonews.com/?p=408841,1755214200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50101741.jpeg,"Bitcoin Mining Not Causing Any Energy Issues, Says Paraguay Power Provider",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-paraguay-fears-allayed-power-provider/,"Bitcoin mining operators are putting less of a strain on Paraguay’s power grid than engineers initially feared, the nation’s power provider says. Per the Spanish-language news outlet Criptonoticias , the comments came from Félix Sosa, the President of the National Electricity Administration (ANDE). Speaking at a recent blockchain technology -related conference, the power chief said that crypto mining in Paraguay does not affect the population’s electricity supply. The Itaipú Dam. (Source: Wutzofant [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Bitcoin Mining: Paraguay Expansion Planned Sosa explained that BTC and crypto miners’ operations in Paraguay require just over 700 MW of energy. But the ANDE chief said that miners are required to operate in designated areas of the country. This ensures they do not put strains on areas that might otherwise experience power shortages. Sosa said that projected crypto mining-related electricity consumption for 2025 would be equivalent to the output of just one and a half turbines of the Itaipú Dam. Paraguay’s central bank held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6% a week after it raised its outlook for inflation and economic growth https://t.co/V31pTte10p — Bloomberg (@business) July 22, 2025 Itaipú: Playing a Key Role The dam is one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world, and houses 20 turbines. However, the most powerful of these turbines (which operate at 60 Hz), produce power for Brazil. The Itaipú Dam straddles the river that separates the two Latin American nations. Despite the fact that Briazil takes the lion’s share of the dam’s energy output, the remaining 10 50 Hz turbines produce surplus power for Paraguay. The Paraná River, the waterway that separates Paraguay and Brazil. (Source: Deni Williams [CC BY 2.0]) In recent years, ANDE has agreed to let Bitcoin miners use much of this power, claiming that it is “abundant, renewable, and affordable energy.” The provider also says that as well as offering clean power, it also offers miners electricity at highly competitive rates. Paraguayan law stipulates that miners must pay differentiated rates based on their required electrical voltage level. The lowest rates apply for the sub-23 kV (medium voltage) group. The next level is sub-66 kV (high voltage), with users over 220 kV (very high voltage) making up the final category. Sosa said: “Our priority is to ensure responsible energy use, consistent with the capacity of the Paraguayan system.” While miners are now using just over 700 MW, ANDE plans to expand this to a capacity of 1,000 MW by the end of 2025.

The planned capacity expansion, the firm said, is set to generate revenues of approximately $240 million for ANDE. But Criptonoticias quoted an engineer named Axel Benítez as pouring scorn on Sosa’s claims. Benítez said that, per 2024 data, the actual consumption billed to crypto mining companies was only 255.5 MW. The engineer said: “If they are planning to go from 700 to 1,000 MW by the end 2025 and ANDE is set to collect $240 million, a simple math calculation results in a rate of $80 per megawatt hour. That is almost double the current rate for [crypto miners]. So, that means that either a rate hike is coming, or ANDE does not know how to use a calculator.” Communities Unhappy With Miners The media outlet added that some Paraguayans have also expressed their displeasure at the rise of Bitcoin mining in the nation. It reported that residents of the Santa Lucía District in Villarrica complain of “constant noise from fans and mining equipment.” The noise, they claim, is affecting families’ mental health, sleep patterns, and their quality of life. The problem is particularly acute for children with special needs, residents said. While ANDE has taken a welcoming stance to legal crypto miners, it has also been waging a war against illegal operators. Last year, the provider conceded that it loses about one third of all the energy it produces, with illegal miners responsible for at least some of these losses. It has also seized over 10,000 Bitcoin mining rigs from operators. Last year, a group of 14 senators petitioned the government to temporarily ban crypto mining in the country .

With both AVAX and BNB riding strong technical and fundamental momentum, analysts say this coordinated accumulation could signal an explosive catalyst once the presale concludes. BNB Poised for Breakout While Expanding Its RWA Footprint BNB has maintained a powerful upward trend, currently trading near $855 after a 5.5% surge in the latest session. Technical charts show a clear resistance at $919 — a breakout here could open the door to $1,036 and ultimately the ambitious $1,225 target, pushing its market capitalization close to $150 billion. The relative strength index (RSI) at 64 suggests room for further gains before overbought conditions emerge. Fundamentals remain equally bullish. BNB Chain’s rapid 1,500% monthly growth in the tokenized asset market has lifted its total value to $42.9 million, attracting more institutional attention. With open interest in BNB futures climbing to $1.18 billion and ongoing Binance token burns supporting scarcity, the network’s dominance in the exchange token sector (81% market share) remains unmatched. The combination of technical strength, expanding RWA presence, and limited exchange inflows creates a favorable environment for sustained accumulation — particularly from whales looking to capitalize on upcoming catalysts like MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Tier-1 listing. AVAX Targets Major Rally With Web3 Gaming Push Avalanche (AVAX) is on the verge of a significant technical breakout, testing the key $26 resistance that could propel it toward $74–$110 based on wave count analysis. The daily chart reveals an extremely bullish 1-2/1-2 wave formation — a pattern that recently preceded sharp gains in PENDLE and LINK. A close above $26 would put AVAX above its channel midline, triggering bullish momentum on both the RSI and MACD. Beyond the charts, Avalanche’s fundamentals are heating up. The $50 million accelerator program launched with Helika aims to onboard high-quality gaming projects, increasing on-chain activity and user engagement. The Octane upgrade, which drove a 40% rise in total value locked, further enhances AVAX’s network capabilities. With gaming narratives historically acting as powerful bull market catalysts, AVAX’s combined technical setup and fundamental growth are drawing in strategic whale buyers — many of whom are allocating fresh liquidity into MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale before its potential Tier-1 launch. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Drawing AVAX & BNB Whales MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a prime accumulation target for AVAX and BNB holders seeking high-upside plays ahead of a Tier-1 exchange listing. Its ongoing presale has already attracted substantial whale participation, driven by expectations of strong post-listing momentum. Market chatter suggests that large addresses are quietly positioning now, anticipating a liquidity surge once the presale transitions into open trading. With Tier-1 listing rumors gaining credibility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most closely watched presale opportunities in the current market cycle. Bottom Line Both AVAX and BNB are in strong bullish phases, and their whale holders appear to be converging on the same high-conviction play: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale. If the Tier-1 exchange debut materializes, early accumulators could be perfectly positioned for outsized gains. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

50101710,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78438,1755214219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected Timeline for $7 XRP,https://timestabloid.com/projected-timeline-for-7-xrp/,"Market analysts and industry observers have put forward different expectations for when XRP might climb to the $7 price point, a level viewed as a major milestone for the asset. Although the token remains within the $3 range, trading at approximately $3.07 at the time of writing, it has already delivered a year-to-date gain of about 59%. Many market commentators suggest that XRP’s current trading behavior reflects a period of consolidation aimed at establishing strong support before attempting a significant rally. Reaching $7 from current levels would require an increase of just over 110%. Estimates for when this could occur vary widely, with predictions ranging from the coming months to several years ahead. Analyst and Institutional Forecasts Some of the more optimistic short-term projections came earlier in the year. In July, commentator Zach Rector suggested XRP could trade between $7.01 and $15.14 over the mid to long term, with a potential breakout period between August 23 and September 7, 2025. Meanwhile, a report from digital asset manager Bitwise presented a longer-term outlook. In its bullish scenario, Bitwise forecast that XRP could reach $6.25 by 2027, before advancing toward $7.91 in 2028. Market analyst Crypto Bitlord took a more immediate stance earlier this month. Following XRP’s recovery from recent price dips, he suggested that the rebound could be the start of an advance toward the $7 mark within the current year. On the other hand, the crypto trading platform Changelly offered a more conservative timeline. Its analysis indicates that XRP might only approach $7 in early 2027, with a potential peak around $7.04 in March of that year. Researchers at Telegaon expect faster progress than Changelly’s projections. Their forecast anticipates XRP reaching $7 as early as 2026, with the average price for that year estimated at $7.53. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Google Gemini’s Three-Phase Projection In a separate analysis, Google’s Gemini AI outlined a hypothetical path for XRP to hit $7 during the current bullish cycle. Its scenario is divided into three stages. Phase One (Late August to Early September 2025): A potential regulatory win or major corporate partnership could drive prices toward $4.50. This would likely attract a wave of new retail investors, pushing trading activity higher. Phase Two (September to October 2025): XRP could move between $4.50 and $5.50, as profit-taking occurs, but overall market sentiment remains positive. Phase Three (November to December 2025): A combination of favorable macroeconomic conditions, a possible altcoin market surge, and heightened institutional activity could send prices from $5.50 to $7 or beyond in a short time frame. Across forecasts, the $7 level is widely recognized as a significant target for XRP, though opinions differ greatly on when it will be achieved. Some see it as a near-term possibility, while others expect it to take several years. Much will depend on broader market trends, regulatory developments, and the strength of investor demand in the coming cycles.

Shiba Inu is surfing the wave, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is also getting its fair share of attention. The two coins have dedicated communities and an increasing number of applications. However, when the next bull run hits, which one will take the crown? Shiba Inu Price Action Shows Strength but Faces Mixed Signals Shiba Inu has been on an ascending trend and has gained almost 4% in the past 24 hours. In the last week, it has increased by approximately 15%. The rally has been supported by a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern breakout, which is an indicator of great technical momentum. A sign that the coin is doing well is the decline in the exchange reserves. SHIB balances on exchanges decreased to 121.31 trillion on August 11 compared to 122.54 trillion on July 31. Lower reserves are usually associated with lower sell pressure, and they allow bulls more space to move the price up. Interestingly, SHIB surged right after the August 11 supply dip. This is similar to what happened on July 24 and August 6. Nevertheless, exchange supply has increased modestly since the recent low. Another increase in supply may restrict upward momentum. At the time of writing, the breakout has held firm, and SHIB is trading above $0.00001368. A break above $0.00001438 may reinforce the rally. Nonetheless, mixed on-chain indicators suggest the trend of the token is not fully evident. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as a Top Contender MAGACOIN FINANCE has been making headlines as a presale with strong utility. Many see it as more than just another meme token. Industry watchers even say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the top memecoin with real-world use in the next bull run. It is popular due to a combination of practical elements and a developing community. They plan to bridge the gap between meme culture and practical blockchain applications. This makes it stand out in the market. Meanwhile, PEPE and DOGE holders are locking in profits and looking for the next big move. Many of them are shifting capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE before the market rotation wave. Although SHIB has demonstrated resilience, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the new point of entry before the explosive growth may occur. Its combination makes it difficult to overlook among early investors eyeing 2025. Which Could Dominate the Next Bull Run? Shiba Inu possesses a massive following and has been resilient. The fact that it has recently broken out is a bullish indicator. However, it remains subject to unpredictability caused by fluctuating exchange reserves. MAGACOIN FINANCE is less established but has a high intensity of utility and adoption. It is rapidly grabbing the attention of investors. Both might do well in the next bull market. SHIB has history in its favor, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has momentum going forward. A balanced approach could work best for those pursuing the upside.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/galaxy-digital-ceo-praises-xrp-community-heres-why/,"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has once again highlighted the resilience of the XRP community, stating that their dedication is on par with that of Bitcoin advocates. In a recent interview with Natalie Brunnell on Coin Stories, he described XRP supporters as one of the most committed groups in the cryptocurrency space. During the discussion, Novogratz questioned why XRP has remained relevant for so long. Brunnell attributed its longevity to effective marketing and strong financial resources. When he asked where those resources originated, she pointed to token sales and an initial coin offering (ICO). While Ripple never conducted an ICO, the company has funded operations by selling portions of the XRP it received as a gift early in the token’s history. Stories and lessons from a decade in crypto with Mike @Novogratz . We talk about $GLXY , the 80,000 bitcoin transaction, whether Mike has any investing regrets, maxis and altcoin communities, Bitcoin's roadmap to $1 million and much more. Timecodes: 00:00 Meet Mike Novogratz:… pic.twitter.com/4HrOi1juE5 — Natalie Brunell (@natbrunell) August 12, 2025 Community Strength as a Driving Force Novogratz emphasized that the XRP community, often referred to as the XRP Army , demonstrates a level of loyalty that matches Bitcoin’s strongest supporters. This view is consistent with his earlier remarks, suggesting that XRP’s survival is largely due to the dedication of its holders. He characterized the cryptocurrency sector as highly “tribal,” noting that communities are often built around shared beliefs and identity. Using himself as an example, Novogratz mentioned having tattoos of both Bitcoin and Terra Luna, reflecting his connections to different crypto communities. Novogratz also shared that his early perspective centered on Bitcoin as the sole form of “digital gold,” while he believed other cryptocurrencies needed tangible use cases to succeed. Over time, his outlook changed, recognizing that the broader appeal of crypto is rooted in declining trust in traditional systems, a sentiment that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis and the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. Recognition of Key Figures in the XRP Ecosystem The Galaxy Digital CEO credited Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse with fostering a strong and engaged community, though Garlinghouse himself has admitted uncertainty about the origins of the XRP Army. Novogratz also commended attorney John Deaton, who, despite no prior association with Ripple, became a vocal advocate for XRP holders during the SEC lawsuit, providing consistent legal updates and public commentary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of Community in Crypto’s Longevity According to Novogratz, the crypto market has introduced a sense of community into investing that traditional equities rarely replicate. He compared the loyalty of XRP holders to that seen among Tesla and Palantir supporters, noting that this level of engagement is absent in major companies like Oracle despite their financial success. He believes that such loyalty is fueled by public distrust in legacy financial systems and cannot be artificially created by corporate efforts alone. While not every cryptocurrency will endure over the long term, Novogratz acknowledged that XRP’s position among the top digital assets is a testament to the commitment of its supporters, who invest both financially and emotionally in the asset. These comments mark a significant change from Novogratz’s earlier stance . Two years ago, he openly doubted XRP’s staying power and raised concerns about Ripple’s large holdings of the token. Since then, he has repeatedly admitted that his skepticism was misplaced, crediting the XRP Army for proving him wrong. Following XRP’s rally after Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory, he reiterated that the token’s community has been the main reason for its sustained relevance over more than a decade. Novogratz’s remarks reinforce the importance of community in shaping the longevity and relevance of digital assets. For XRP, its survival and growth over the years highlight how committed supporters can be a decisive factor in a cryptocurrency’s enduring presence in a competitive market.

The move pushed the overall crypto market cap to a record $4.18 trillion. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Comments On Rising XRP Ledger Competition From Fintechs The rally followed a decisive breakout above key technical levels, including the 7-day SMA at $118,892 and the 200-day EMA at $101,566. The MACD histogram widened to its most bullish reading since July 2025, while the RSI14 at 68.5 suggests there’s still room before hitting overbought conditions. Fibonacci projections now place BTC’s next major resistance near $126,870. However, after briefly surpassing $124K, Bitcoin retraced to around $121,800, prompting traders to ask whether this is simply consolidation before the next surge. Institutional Demand and Policy Support Driving Momentum Corporate and institutional accumulation remains a major driver. SpaceX continues to hold 8,285 BTC worth over $1 billion, while Thumzup Media recently announced a $50 million crypto treasury. These moves mirror Metaplanet’s purchase of 2,205 BTC earlier this week. Political tailwinds are also in play. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has rolled back banking restrictions on crypto firms and signed legislation opening retirement accounts to digital asset investments. The GENIUS Act, introducing the country’s first federal stablecoin framework, has further boosted market confidence. ETF inflows have accelerated, with U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs pulling in over $1 billion in net weekly inflows. Total ETF holdings now stand at $154 billion, signaling deep institutional interest. BTC's price records some losses after a major spike on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin (BTC) Pundits Eye $150K If Momentum Holds Despite a notable July sell-off by long-term holders, the largest since 2021, market analysts see the pullback as a healthy pause. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, views $120K as a new “sturdy floor” and $126K as the breakout point that could open the path toward $150,000. “With strong macro tailwinds, robust ETF demand, and rising corporate adoption, every dip may be viewed as a buying opportunity rather than a reversal signal,” noted Himanshu Maradiya, Chairman of CIFDAQ.

50103563,557011,1755216053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50103563.jpeg,"BNB Surges on $2B Investment: Analysts Debate If $1,000 Target Is Within Reach",https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-2b-in-investment-analysts-debate-1000-target/,"Binance Coin (BNB) has hit fresh record territory after Abu Dhabi-based MGX announced a historic $2 billion investment in Binance on August 12. The deal, entirely funded in stablecoins, marks the largest single investment ever made in a cryptocurrency company. Within 48 hours of the news, BNB surged more than 15%, breaking through key resistance levels and reaching a new all-time high of $864. The rally comes amid strong corporate demand for major altcoins, as Ethereum and BNB both approach record valuations alongside Bitcoin’s latest all-time high. Technical Outlook: Bullish but Overbought Despite the excitement, technical indicators suggest caution in the short term. BNB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits above 70, placing it firmly in overbought territory and hinting at the potential for a short-term pullback. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains bullish, with the MACD line well above the signal line and green histogram bars signaling ongoing momentum. Key resistance lies at $861.10, a level that, if broken convincingly, could trigger momentum buying toward the psychological $900 mark and possibly the $950–$1,000 range within the next 30 days. Immediate support is found near $820–$830, with stronger levels at $730.01 and $639.16. Volume remains strong, with over $345 million traded in the past 24 hours, suggesting there is still liquidity to sustain larger moves. Moving averages from the 7-day ($819.47) to the 200-day ($652.67) all trend upward, confirming the strength of the broader uptrend. BNB Price Target: $1,000 Within Reach or Due for a Cooldown? Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Bullish scenarios see BNB pushing toward $950–$1,000 within a month, provided it holds above $850 and breaks through the $861 resistance. A mild pullback to cool the RSI could create an attractive entry point before the next leg higher. However, a failure to maintain above $850 could open the door to a 13% drop toward $730. A deeper correction to $639 remains a low-probability scenario given current fundamentals but cannot be ruled out if the broader market turns bearish. For now, the development of record-breaking investment news, strong technical momentum, and strong market sentiment keeps the $1,000 milestone firmly on the radar, but traders should expect volatility on the way up.

Over the past three days, blockchain trackers have caught billions of dollars quietly flowing into altcoins. Bitcoin is still hovering just below record highs, but the smart money has already begun to move on. This is the same slow build we’ve seen before every major altseason – the quiet phase when whales slip in early, stack their positions , and wait. And buried among the big-name plays they’re loading up on, one lesser-known project keeps showing up in their ledgers: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Storm anticipation Ahead of the storm Look at the statistics and the scene is clear. Aug 7-10, whales purchased $3.8 billion worth of XRP cooling the price of the token by moving it up to $3.3. That was no loosely-knit purchase, that was conviction. This type of accumulation puts a token in range of fresh highs and already there are analysts murmuring over $34 targets in this cycle . Ethereum has been showing off too, jumping more than 40 percent in a single month to bust through $4,500 in a move not seen since early in 2018. Other inflows are experiencing heavy inflows into ETFS with giants such as BitMine Immersion Technologies promising to put another $20 billion worth of ETH in their coffers. When whales make moves like this, they’re not chasing – they’re positioning. Now this is where it starts to become interesting. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is another name quietly being sneaked into the carts of some whales despite the dominance of ETH and XRP when it comes to the headlines. The fun, instantly identifiable branding remains, too easy to share with friends that it can go viral in group chats but with actual, lasting utility that ensures it does not go out of fashion days after it hits the stores. Such combination is unusual, and anyone who saw PEPE or BONK before they became famous will be familiar with the trend. In recent weeks, whale wallets have been adding to their positions in slow, deliberate waves – not chasing spikes, but building patiently . It’s the exact rhythm you see before a project flips from under-the-radar to can’t-ignore-it. Insiders call this MAGACOIN FINANCE’s final allocation phase, and that phrase alone has traders paying attention . Supply is tightening, buzz is growing, and if history is any guide, the quiet part won’t last long. Reading the bigger picture Take a step back, and you could observe the whole set up. Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins have space to breath and money finally begins to move in a way that suggests that the intelligent money is getting positioned to take the next leg higher.It is not about riding out Ethereum to $5K, or watching XRP scaling a lifetime peak, it is about identifying the moves that will multiply long before the rest of the market soundly piles in. That is why MAGACOIN FINANCE has already entered into the same discussion with the majors. Nor is it the business motive in contesting with them on a hand-to-hand basis; but the idea is to provide an alternative upside. Whales do not play the guessing game either, by the time they begin to circle a project they have crunched the numbers and are liking what they see. Conclusion We’ve seen this play out before. One week the market is calm, the next it’s running, and those who waited for the “perfect time” are left chasing green candles . Whales move early because they know that once the breakout is obvious, the best entry points are gone. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s final allocation phase now approaching, the entry window is narrowing by the day. The whales are already in motion – the question is whether you’ll be in the water with them when Altseason 2025 comes rushing in.

In a strategic move that has caught the attention of the entire crypto community, Nakamoto, a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) holding company, has officially merged with KindlyMD, a leading healthcare data firm. This exciting collaboration aims to bolster their collective Bitcoin holdings , marking a unique cross-industry convergence. What Does the Nakamoto KindlyMD Merger Mean for Bitcoin Holdings? This isn’t just another corporate announcement; it’s a powerful statement about the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Nakamoto, co-founded by BTC Inc.’s David Bailey, has been a dedicated player in the Bitcoin space, focused purely on accumulating and securing BTC reserves. KindlyMD, on the other hand, operates within the healthcare data sector, making their pivot towards significant Bitcoin accumulation particularly noteworthy. The newly combined entity will operate under the KindlyMD name, as reported by The Block. This means a healthcare data firm now officially has a direct mandate to build substantial Bitcoin holdings , leveraging the expertise of Nakamoto’s team. This innovative approach could set a precedent for other companies looking to diversify their treasury reserves with digital assets. Why This Strategic Crypto Investment Matters The strategic intent behind the Nakamoto KindlyMD merger is clear: to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. This move highlights a growing trend where non-traditional finance companies are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and an inflation hedge. For the crypto market, this signifies a deeper integration of digital assets into diverse corporate strategies. Think about the implications: a healthcare data firm, typically focused on patient information and analytics, is now actively pursuing a robust crypto investment strategy. This isn’t just about a company buying some Bitcoin; it’s about a fundamental shift in how corporations view and utilize their capital. It showcases confidence in Bitcoin’s future and its role beyond speculative trading. The Financial Power Behind Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation To fuel their ambitious goal of increasing Bitcoin holdings , KindlyMD has already made significant financial strides. The company successfully raised an impressive $540 million through a private placement of public equity. This substantial capital infusion provides a strong foundation for their acquisition strategy. Furthermore, KindlyMD plans to complete a $200 million convertible note offering in the near future. This additional funding will further empower their efforts in Bitcoin accumulation , demonstrating a clear, well-funded roadmap for their digital asset strategy. Such large-scale financial maneuvers underline the seriousness of this venture and its potential impact on the overall market. Exploring the Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The Nakamoto KindlyMD merger represents more than just a single company’s strategy; it reflects a broader trend towards institutional Bitcoin adoption. As more companies witness successful integration of Bitcoin into corporate treasuries, we may see a ripple effect across various industries. Key aspects of this evolving landscape include: Diversification: Companies are seeking alternative assets to traditional cash reserves, especially in volatile economic climates. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, appealing to long-term treasury management. Innovation: Forward-thinking companies are embracing digital assets as part of their innovative growth strategies. Market Maturation: The increasing involvement of established firms lends credibility and stability to the cryptocurrency market. This merger serves as a powerful example of how diversified sectors are beginning to embrace Bitcoin, moving beyond initial skepticism to strategic integration. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing role in the global financial ecosystem. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin Holdings The combination of Nakamoto’s expertise in Bitcoin management and KindlyMD’s substantial financial backing and innovative approach creates a formidable entity poised for significant Bitcoin accumulation . This strategic alliance is a clear indicator of Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a treasury asset for companies across different sectors.

On August 15, nearly $4.7 billion worth of BTC options are set to mature, a moment that often draws considerable attention from traders and investors alike. This isn’t just about Bitcoin; a substantial $1.3 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options will also reach their expiry on the same day. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone involved in the digital asset space, especially concerning the upcoming BTC options August 15 event. Understanding Bitcoin Options Expiration What exactly happens when Bitcoin options expire ? Options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price before a certain date. When these contracts reach their expiration date, they either get exercised, closed, or become worthless. The sheer volume of this upcoming Bitcoin options expiration means it could potentially influence market dynamics. It’s a key date for many participants looking at market movements. Decoding the “Max Pain Price” A term often discussed around options expiry is the “max pain price.” This is the price point where the largest number of options contracts would expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for the majority of options holders. For the upcoming Bitcoin options expiration , the max pain price is currently noted at $117,000. Similarly, for Ethereum options, the max pain price stands at $4,000. While not a definitive price prediction, it offers a fascinating insight into market positioning and where the market might gravitate as the expiry approaches. The Scale of Crypto Options Expiry on August 15 The figures involved in this particular crypto options expiry are substantial. Deribit data indicates that nearly $4.7 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) options will expire at 08:00 UTC on August 15 . This is a significant amount, representing a large portion of the open interest in the Bitcoin options market. Alongside this, approximately $1.3 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options will also mature. The put/call ratio, which indicates the sentiment of traders (more puts suggest bearish sentiment, more calls suggest bullish), is 0.90 for BTC and 1.02 for ETH. These ratios offer a snapshot of current market sentiment leading into the expiry of these massive Ethereum options expiration contracts. Potential Market Impact and What to Watch While a large options expiration event can create volatility, it doesn’t automatically guarantee a massive price swing. Sometimes, the market has already “priced in” the expiry. However, the unwinding of these contracts can lead to increased trading volume and short-term price movements as positions are closed or exercised. Here’s what market participants often observe: Increased Volatility: Prices might become more erratic leading up to and immediately after the expiry. Volume Spikes: Trading volume often surges as traders adjust their positions. Max Pain Price Gravitation: Some analysts believe the price tends to gravitate towards the max pain price as expiry approaches, though this is not a universal rule. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the period around a major Bitcoin options expiration . Navigating Your Strategy Around Options Expiry For traders and investors, being aware of such large crypto options expiry events is important. It’s not about predicting the exact price movement, but rather understanding the potential for increased market activity. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and analytics platforms for real-time data. Risk Management: Ensure your positions are well-managed, especially if you hold options contracts yourself. Observe Volume: High volume can indicate strong conviction in a price direction or simply a lot of position closing. Avoid Over-Leverage: Given potential volatility, excessive leverage can lead to quick liquidations. This August 15 expiry, with its substantial Bitcoin options and Ethereum options expiration components, serves as a crucial reminder of market mechanics. The impending Bitcoin options expiration , coupled with the significant Ethereum options expiration on August 15 , represents a pivotal moment in the crypto calendar. While the max pain price offers an interesting data point, the true impact will unfold as these billions in contracts settle. Market participants should remain vigilant, focusing on sound risk management and informed decision-making during this period of heightened activity around the crypto options expiry . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin option? A Bitcoin option is a financial derivative contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) Bitcoin at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specific date (expiration date). What does “max pain price” mean for options? The “max pain price” is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing the maximum financial loss for options holders. It’s a point of interest for analysts, as some believe the underlying asset’s price may gravitate towards it near expiry. How significant is the August 15 Bitcoin options expiration? The August 15 Bitcoin options expiration is highly significant due to its massive scale, involving nearly $4.7 billion worth of BTC options. Such large expirations can lead to increased market volatility and trading volume as positions are closed or exercised. Will the market crash after options expire? Not necessarily. While options expirations can cause short-term volatility and price movements, they do not automatically lead to a market crash. The market often anticipates and prices in these events. However, it’s wise to be prepared for potential fluctuations. How can traders prepare for options expiry? Traders can prepare by staying informed about market data, practicing sound risk management, avoiding over-leverage, and observing trading volume. Understanding the dynamics of the max pain price and put/call ratios can also provide valuable insights. Did you find this article helpful in understanding the upcoming Bitcoin options expiration ?

Nasdaq-listed Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions (BTCS) has made headlines by revealing its substantial BTCS Ethereum holdings , totaling an impressive 70,140 ETH. This amounts to a staggering $320 million, as reported in their Q2 earnings by The Block. This bold move highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies embracing digital assets as strategic reserves, signaling a profound shift in corporate finance. What Are BTCS Ethereum Holdings All About? BTCS, a company known for its blockchain infrastructure and digital asset operations, has officially adopted Ethereum (ETH) as a strategic reserve asset. This means they are not just holding ETH speculatively but as a core part of their treasury management strategy. The sheer volume of their BTCS Ethereum holdings —70,140 ETH—positions them as a notable corporate holder in the cryptocurrency space. This decision reflects a forward-thinking approach, recognizing Ethereum’s potential beyond its current market value. By integrating ETH into their balance sheet, BTCS is demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. This move could inspire other companies to consider similar strategies for their own corporate ETH reserves . Why Adopt Ethereum as a Strategic Asset? Many traditional companies are now exploring cryptocurrencies, but why specifically Ethereum as an Ethereum strategic asset ? Ethereum’s robust network supports a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Its utility and ongoing development make it a compelling choice for a long-term holding. Utility and Innovation: Ethereum is more than just a digital currency; it’s a foundational platform for innovation across various sectors. Network Effect: Its widespread adoption and massive developer community provide strong network effects, enhancing its value. Deflationary Mechanism: Recent upgrades, like EIP-1559, have introduced burning mechanisms, potentially making ETH a deflationary asset over time. For Nasdaq-listed BTCS , holding Ethereum aligns seamlessly with their core business, which is deeply rooted in blockchain technology. This strategic alignment can offer unique advantages and potentially unlock new revenue streams for the company. Implications of Corporate ETH Reserves on the Market When a Nasdaq-listed BTCS company makes such a significant cryptocurrency investment , it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It legitimizes digital assets further and could pave the way for more institutional adoption. The ripple effect can be substantial: Increased Legitimacy: Large corporate holdings lend undeniable credibility to the entire digital asset class. Price Stability: As more companies hold crypto as reserves, it can reduce volatility and provide a more stable foundation for the market. New Investment Avenues: It opens doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto through publicly traded companies. The trend of corporate ETH reserves is gaining momentum, following in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy with Bitcoin. This suggests a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly viewed as viable treasury alternatives for forward-thinking corporations. What Are the Challenges of Cryptocurrency Investment for Corporations? While the prospects are exciting, corporate cryptocurrency investment , particularly in an Ethereum strategic asset , comes with its own set of challenges. Companies must carefully navigate: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets can be complex and requires constant monitoring. Volatility: Despite growing maturity, cryptocurrencies can still experience significant price swings, which requires robust risk management. Security Risks: Protecting large digital asset holdings from cyber threats requires state-of-the-art security protocols and vigilance. Accounting Treatment: How to properly account for and report these assets on financial statements is a new frontier for many traditional finance departments. BTCS, as a Nasdaq-listed BTCS entity, likely has robust frameworks in place to manage these risks, setting a precedent for others considering similar ventures. Their transparent reporting of BTCS Ethereum holdings provides valuable insight. The substantial BTCS Ethereum holdings represent more than just a balance sheet entry; they signify a bold vote of confidence in the future of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. As more corporations follow suit, we may witness a transformative shift in how traditional finance interacts with the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic move by Nasdaq-listed BTCS underscores the growing importance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate and valuable assets for corporate treasuries. It’s an exciting time to watch the convergence of traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTCS Ethereum holdings? BTCS Ethereum holdings refer to the significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency held by Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions (BTCS), a Nasdaq-listed company, as a strategic reserve asset. In their Q2 earnings, they reported holding 70,140 ETH, valued at $320 million. Why did BTCS adopt Ethereum as a strategic asset? BTCS adopted Ethereum as an Ethereum strategic asset due to its robust network, utility in decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi, strong network effect, and potential deflationary mechanisms. This aligns with BTCS’s core business in blockchain technology. How do corporate ETH reserves impact the crypto market? Corporate ETH reserves , like those held by Nasdaq-listed BTCS , increase the legitimacy of digital assets, potentially contribute to price stability by reducing circulating supply, and open new avenues for traditional investors to gain crypto exposure through public companies. What are the risks associated with corporate cryptocurrency investment? Key risks for corporate cryptocurrency investment include regulatory uncertainty, price volatility, security threats, and complex accounting treatment. Companies must implement strong risk management strategies to mitigate these challenges. Is BTCS the only Nasdaq-listed company holding significant crypto?

Dogecoin whales are moving fast, but their latest target is not another meme coin. Instead, they are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE. The token has started getting attention for its low price and strong presale momentum. Many retail investors are now watching closely. They want to see if this move will trigger a wave of new demand. Bitcoin remains steady, which gives traders some breathing room. Ethereum is holding its ground too, keeping market sentiment positive. When big players move funds during a calm phase, smaller investors tend to follow. That is exactly what is happening with DOGE whales right now. Their activity is pulling fresh eyes toward a token that most had not heard of until this month. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Gains Big Whale Support DOGE whales are quietly securing MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.004 in advance of its first major exchange approvals. This early buying activity has sparked more curiosity in the market. Investors like the idea of entering before a possible listing bump. The project has been marketed as a mix of strong utility and early growth potential. Analysts have noted that such a low entry price gives room for significant upside. This is why experienced players are getting in before the public rush. It feels like a calculated move rather than blind speculation. The token’s appeal comes from more than just hype. The team behind MAGACOIN FINANCE has been actively promoting its use cases. They aim to give the project real adoption beyond the launch period. This has helped build confidence among both whales and small investors. In the past, early whale interest has often been a signal for potential growth. However, it does not guarantee returns, so smaller buyers still need to weigh risks. Dogecoin whales tend to act with strategic timing. They usually move into assets that are close to a major catalyst. A first exchange listing is exactly that kind of event. It can boost visibility, attract more volume, and push the price upward. That is why their MAGACOIN FINANCE accumulation is attracting headlines. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is clearly on the radar of big players, and that alone is turning heads. Whale activity often hints at market shifts, but timing matters. For now, $0.004 feels like a rare entry point before the bigger stage. Whether you are a whale or a small trader, this is one token worth keeping on your watchlist. The next move could belong to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

While the momentum has been strong, Severino emphasizes that traders should now prioritize risk management and establish clear exit plans. XRP’s Current Price Action and Technical Outlook XRP has recently attempted to break into a price discovery phase after moving out of a long-standing symmetrical triangle that had constrained its growth since 2018. The cryptocurrency reached $3.66 in July, marking a seven-year high, before experiencing a slight pullback. As of now, XRP trades at $3.11. Severino points to technical indicators, including the Fisher Transform, which is approaching levels observed during previous major peaks in 2017 and 2021. Both past instances were followed by substantial declines, suggesting that caution is warranted even amid the rally. Based on this pattern, Severino advises setting sell-limit orders in advance to secure profits before potential price exhaustion. The end is near in XRP, but it will be a glorious finale Make sure your sell limit orders are set up in advance pic.twitter.com/v7ot0t9B8O — Tony ""The Bull"" Severino, CMT (@TonyTheBullCMT) August 12, 2025 Potential Peak and Historical Comparisons Severino’s analysis draws parallels between the current movement and XRP’s late-2017 surge, when the token rose from under $0.01 to more than $3 within approximately nine weeks. He projects that the ongoing rally could follow a similar, compressed timeframe. In his previous commentary, Severino suggested that XRP’s “final wave” might reach as high as $12.73 within roughly 40 days, indicating a possible peak between late August and early September. Other market observers are even more optimistic, placing end-of-year targets in the $50 to $99 range. Despite these projections, Severino underscores the importance of measured trading, particularly for retail investors. Importance of an Exit Strategy While Severino maintains a bullish outlook, he stresses disciplined profit-taking. His personal target range for exiting trades lies between $8 and $13. He is not alone in warning of a potential reversal following a peak. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Jaydee cautions that although XRP may experience a sharp surge reminiscent of its 2017 performance, only a small fraction of investors are likely to capture substantial gains. He notes that many participants could be left vulnerable if they fail to exit strategically. EGRAG, another cryptocurrency analyst, shares this concern, projecting similar downturn scenarios once XRP reaches a peak. He has outlined two possible outcomes. One scenario sees the token reaching $27 before declining roughly 97% to $0.80 , while a more moderate scenario anticipates a high of $9 followed by an 85% drop to $1.30. EGRAG also notes that a fall below $0.30 remains within the realm of possibility based on historical cycle patterns. Although some experts, including Michael Saylor and Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, argue that institutional involvement has altered market dynamics, analysts like EGRAG contend that cyclical trends remain relevant and that price corrections are likely to occur. While projections for XRP’s peak vary widely, analysts agree that the current rally is in an advanced stage. Historical trends suggest that significant corrections often follow sharp gains, making disciplined exit strategies essential for protecting profits.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely recognized barometer of investor emotion, offers a fascinating glimpse into this sentiment. As of August 15, this key indicator, provided by the software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 60. This figure marks a 15-point drop from the previous day, yet it impressively holds its ground within the ‘Greed’ zone. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a straightforward scale from 0 to 100. A score closer to 0 signals ‘extreme fear,’ suggesting investors are highly apprehensive and potentially overselling their assets. Conversely, a score nearing 100 indicates ‘extreme greed,’ often hinting at an overheated market where prices might be unsustainable due to excessive buying. Despite its recent dip, the index’s continued presence in the ‘Greed’ territory (typically above 50) suggests that overall crypto market sentiment remains positive. This indicates that even with some weakening, a significant portion of market participants still feel optimistic about future price movements. Investors often monitor this index to gauge collective emotions, which can sometimes precede significant price shifts. Understanding the Drivers of Crypto Market Sentiment How does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index arrive at its daily reading? It synthesizes data from six distinct factors, each contributing a specific weight to the final score. These components provide a holistic view of the prevailing crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin price fluctuations and maximum drawdowns compared to average values over 30 and 90 days. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for cryptocurrency-related hashtags, analyzing their volume and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Currently paused, which means its weight is distributed among other factors). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. A rising dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be moving into the perceived ‘safer’ asset. Google Trends (10%): Examines search query trends for crypto-related terms, indicating public interest and emotional responses. How Does Bitcoin Dominance Influence the Index? It might seem counterintuitive, but Bitcoin dominance plays a crucial role in the Fear & Greed Index. When Bitcoin’s market share increases, it often suggests that investors are shifting their capital from altcoins into Bitcoin. This movement is frequently interpreted as a flight to safety, indicating a more cautious or fearful market outlook. Conversely, a decreasing Bitcoin dominance can signal a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to explore altcoins, which often carry higher risk but also higher potential rewards. This factor helps provide a nuanced perspective on broader market dynamics beyond just price action, offering deeper insights into the collective investor mindset. Navigating Cryptocurrency Trends with Market Sentiment Analysis The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable tool for market sentiment analysis , helping investors understand the psychological state of the crypto market. While it is not a predictive tool, it offers crucial context. When the index shows ‘extreme fear,’ it can sometimes present a potential buying opportunity for contrarian investors, as prices might be undervalued due to panic selling. Conversely, ‘extreme greed’ can be a warning sign, suggesting that the market might be due for a correction. For those tracking cryptocurrency trends , integrating this index into their analysis provides an emotional layer often missed by purely technical or fundamental approaches. It reminds us that markets are driven not just by data, but also by human emotions. However, it is essential to remember that the index is just one data point and should be used in conjunction with comprehensive research and risk management strategies. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a powerful snapshot of investor psychology, even as it fluctuates. Its current position in the ‘Greed’ zone, despite a recent dip, underscores persistent optimism within the market. By understanding its components and implications, investors can gain valuable insights into prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping them make more informed decisions when navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trends . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘extreme fear’ (0) to ‘extreme greed’ (100). 2. How is the index calculated? It’s calculated by analyzing six key factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. 3. What does ‘Greed’ sentiment mean for investors? A ‘Greed’ sentiment suggests that investors are optimistic and may be buying aggressively, potentially leading to an overvalued market. It can be a signal for caution. 4. Can the index predict future crypto prices? No, the index is not a predictive tool. It reflects current sentiment and can offer insights into potential market reversals, but it should be used alongside other analytical methods. 5. Why are surveys paused in the index calculation? The index provider, Alternative, occasionally pauses the survey component, likely due to data collection or methodological adjustments. Its weight is then distributed among the other factors.

This strategic acquisition of 16,299 Bitmain Antminer rigs, valued at approximately $314 million, signals a major expansion and a bold statement in the competitive landscape of digital asset investment . What Does This Massive Crypto Mining Rig Purchase Mean for American Bitcoin? This isn’t just any purchase; it represents one of the largest single acquisitions of crypto mining rigs in recent memory. American Bitcoin’s investment in these Bitmain Antminer rigs positions them for substantial growth in their operational capacity. This kind of scale indicates a strong belief in the long-term profitability and stability of Bitcoin. The company, American Bitcoin (ABTC), aims to solidify its presence as a key player. Such an extensive order of high-performance mining equipment directly translates to increased hash rate and, consequently, a greater share of the Bitcoin block rewards. Increased Hash Rate: More rigs mean more computational power dedicated to solving complex cryptographic puzzles. Market Dominance: This move could help ABTC gain a more significant share of the global Bitcoin hash rate. Strategic Positioning: Investing heavily now prepares the company for future market cycles and potential network difficulty adjustments. Why Are Bitmain Antminer Rigs So Crucial for Profitable Bitcoin Mining? The choice of Bitmain Antminer rigs is strategic. Bitmain is a leading manufacturer of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, known for their efficiency and power. These machines are specifically designed to perform the intensive calculations required for Bitcoin mining , making them a preferred choice for large-scale operations. Acquiring such a large fleet of these advanced machines suggests American Bitcoin is prioritizing operational efficiency and maximizing its return on investment. The performance of these rigs directly impacts the company’s ability to mine Bitcoin profitably, especially as network difficulty continues to rise. This substantial investment also highlights a broader trend: the increasing institutionalization of digital asset investment . Large capital injections are becoming more common, signaling a maturing market where significant players are making long-term commitments. What Are the Broader Implications for Digital Asset Investment? The sheer scale of American Bitcoin’s purchase has several implications for the broader digital asset investment landscape. Firstly, it underscores the continued confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a viable asset for long-term holding. Despite market fluctuations, major players are still pouring significant capital into the infrastructure supporting the network. Secondly, it points to the ongoing centralization concerns within the Bitcoin mining industry. As larger entities acquire more hash rate, the distribution of mining power can become more concentrated.

A groundbreaking proposal from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) could reshape how we view digital asset security. Researchers at the BIS have put forward an innovative idea: a BIS AML compliance score system for crypto tokens. This system aims to enhance anti-money laundering efforts while respecting the core principles of decentralized finance. What is the Proposed BIS AML Compliance System? Imagine a world where every crypto token carries a reputation score, not unlike a credit rating. That is precisely what the BIS researchers are envisioning. Their proposal suggests assigning anti-money laundering (AML) compliance scores to crypto tokens. These scores would be based on the token’s transaction history. DL News reported that this system would allow exchanges to block conversions to fiat currency for assets falling below a specific threshold. The primary goal is to target tokens linked to illicit activity. Moreover, the system seeks to preserve the permissionless nature of blockchains. Crucially, it aims to do this without requiring the collection of user data. This approach marks a significant shift. Instead of focusing on individual users, it evaluates the inherent risk associated with the token itself. This method could streamline compliance for institutions dealing with a wide array of digital assets. It also introduces a new layer of scrutiny for all digital transactions. This could lead to more reliable crypto compliance scores across the ecosystem. How Will Crypto Compliance Scores Impact the Market? The introduction of crypto compliance scores could have far-reaching implications for the digital asset market. On one hand, it promises to clean up the space, making it less attractive for money launderers and criminals. This could foster greater trust among traditional financial institutions and regulators, potentially accelerating mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Benefits could include: Enhanced Security: Reduced flow of illicit funds through the crypto ecosystem. Increased Trust: Greater confidence for institutional investors and traditional finance. Regulatory Clarity: A standardized approach to assessing token risk. However, challenges are also apparent. Determining accurate scores while avoiding false positives will be critical. Furthermore, the impact on privacy-focused tokens or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remains a key discussion point. The system’s effectiveness hinges on its ability to differentiate legitimate transactions from suspicious ones. It must do so without stifling innovation or penalizing innocent users. This delicate balance is vital for the success of any new anti-money laundering framework. Addressing Anti-Money Laundering Concerns Without Compromising Privacy One of the most compelling aspects of the BIS proposal is its stated commitment to privacy. The system aims to combat anti-money laundering without requiring the collection of user-specific data. This is a crucial distinction from traditional financial surveillance methods. Instead, it focuses on the inherent characteristics and historical movements of the tokens themselves. The researchers propose a method that analyzes the “taint” or risk associated with a token’s past transactions. This could involve tracing funds linked to known illicit addresses or activities. By assigning a token scoring system based on these on-chain patterns, the system attempts to flag problematic assets. It avoids directly identifying the individuals holding or transacting with them. This approach seeks to maintain the pseudo-anonymous nature of blockchain transactions. It offers a potential path forward for effective regulation that respects user privacy. This is a significant step towards balancing security with individual liberties in the digital age. The Future of Blockchain Regulation and Token Scoring The BIS proposal is a clear signal that global financial bodies are actively exploring sophisticated methods for blockchain regulation . This token scoring system represents a proactive step towards creating a more secure and compliant crypto environment. It acknowledges the unique challenges and opportunities presented by decentralized technologies. The implementation of such a system would require significant collaboration among exchanges, regulators, and blockchain analytics firms. Key considerations for the future: Global Consensus: Achieving widespread adoption and consistent application across jurisdictions. Technological Advancement: Continuous improvement of analytics tools to accurately assess token risk. Industry Adaptation: Crypto projects and exchanges will need to adapt to new compliance standards. This initiative could set a precedent for future regulatory approaches. It moves beyond traditional “know your customer” (KYC) requirements to a “know your token” paradigm. This shift could make the crypto space safer and more accessible for broader adoption. It highlights the growing maturity of the industry and the increasing focus on responsible innovation. Revolutionizing Compliance: The Impact of a Token Scoring System The BIS’s proposed token scoring system has the potential to revolutionize how we approach compliance in the crypto world. It offers a pragmatic solution to a complex problem: how to prevent illicit financial flows without stifling the very innovation that makes blockchain technology so powerful. By focusing on the token’s history rather than individual users, it seeks to strike a delicate balance. This initiative could lead to a cleaner, more trusted crypto ecosystem. It would pave the way for greater institutional participation and broader acceptance of digital assets. While challenges remain, the conversation around such intelligent regulatory tools is a positive development. It underscores a commitment to both security and the permissionless spirit of blockchain. The future of crypto regulation looks set to be more nuanced and technologically driven. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the core idea behind the BIS’s proposed system? A1: The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) proposes assigning anti-money laundering (AML) compliance scores to crypto tokens based on their transaction history. This aims to identify and restrict tokens linked to illicit activities. Q2: How would the AML compliance score be determined? A2: The score would be determined by analyzing a token’s transaction history, looking for links to known illicit activities or addresses. Tokens with a higher risk profile would receive lower scores. Q3: What is the main goal of this token scoring system? A3: The primary goal is to combat money laundering and illicit finance within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It also aims to achieve this while preserving the permissionless nature of blockchains and avoiding user data collection. Q4: Will this system require collecting user data? A4: No, a key aspect of the BIS proposal is that the system would evaluate tokens based on their on-chain transaction history, not by collecting personal user data. This maintains a degree of privacy for users. Q5: How might this impact cryptocurrency exchanges? A5: Exchanges would play a crucial role, potentially blocking the conversion of low-scoring tokens to fiat currency. This would require them to integrate the scoring system and adapt their compliance procedures. Q6: What are the potential challenges of implementing such a system? A6: Challenges include accurately determining scores without false positives, ensuring global consensus and consistent application, and adapting to the evolving nature of blockchain technology and new privacy solutions.

Onchain Lens reported a significant event: an address associated with the Ethereum Foundation recently executed further ETH sales , offloading an additional 2,099 ETH. This transaction, valued at 9.61 million DAI, adds to a larger trend observed over the past two days, where the address collectively sold 6,194 ETH, totaling 28.36 million DAI. This movement of digital assets naturally sparks questions about its potential impact on the wider crypto market . What Do Recent Ethereum Foundation ETH Sales Reveal? The Ethereum Foundation plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum ecosystem, supporting its development and research. Therefore, any significant movement of digital assets from addresses linked to them often draws considerable scrutiny. The recent transactions highlight a pattern of strategic asset management. Specifics of the Sales: An additional 2,099 ETH was sold for 9.61 million DAI. This follows previous sales, bringing the two-day total to 6,194 ETH. The cumulative value of these ETH sales reached 28.36 million DAI. This activity is not entirely unprecedented. Entities like the Ethereum Foundation periodically adjust their holdings for various reasons, including funding ongoing projects, covering operational costs, or rebalancing portfolios. Understanding these movements requires a closer look at the underlying on-chain data . How Does On-Chain Data Inform Our Understanding? Analyzing on-chain data provides transparency into these large transactions. Public blockchain ledgers allow anyone to track the movement of funds, offering valuable insights into the activities of major holders. When an entity like the Ethereum Foundation conducts substantial ETH sales , it becomes a crucial data point for analysts and investors. Transparency and Traceability: Every transaction is recorded and immutable, allowing for precise tracking. Market Sentiment Indicators: Large sales can sometimes be interpreted as a signal, potentially influencing short-term market sentiment. However, it is crucial to consider the context. Impact on Liquidity: Such sales introduce liquidity into the market, which can be absorbed by demand or, in some cases, contribute to price volatility if demand is low. These transactions are often executed via decentralized exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks to minimize immediate market impact. The conversion to DAI, a stablecoin, suggests a move to de-risk or prepare for future expenditures in fiat or other stable assets, rather than a direct exit from the crypto market . What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? The immediate reaction to large ETH sales can vary, but the broader implications for the crypto market depend on several factors. It is important to distinguish between routine treasury management and a signal of fundamental shifts. For example, if the Ethereum Foundation were consistently liquidating significant portions of its digital assets without clear communication, it might raise more concerns. Market Stability: Despite the size, these sales represent a small fraction of Ethereum’s total market capitalization, meaning their direct impact on price is often limited unless combined with other bearish factors. Funding Development: Often, these sales fund crucial development work, research, and community initiatives that ultimately strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem. This long-term benefit can outweigh short-term market jitters. Investor Perspective: Savvy investors look beyond the headline, examining the overall health of the network, development progress, and wider adoption trends rather than reacting solely to individual large transactions. The continued transparency from entities like the Ethereum Foundation regarding their financial activities helps maintain trust within the ecosystem. This openness, coupled with the inherent transparency of on-chain data , allows the community to form informed opinions. The recent ETH sales by an Ethereum Foundation -linked address, totaling 6,194 ETH, are a notable event within the digital asset landscape. While significant in volume, understanding these movements through the lens of on-chain data and considering the broader context of the crypto market is essential. These transactions likely represent strategic financial management aimed at supporting the ongoing growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem. Rather than a cause for alarm, they often reflect the operational realities of a large, well-funded project. The transparency inherent in blockchain technology allows the community to monitor and understand these developments, fostering a more informed environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and growth of the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. 2. Why would the Ethereum Foundation sell ETH? The Ethereum Foundation sells ETH primarily to fund its ongoing operations, research, development projects, and grants for ecosystem initiatives. It is part of their treasury management. 3. How do these ETH sales impact the market? While large sales can cause short-term fluctuations in market sentiment, their overall impact on the vast crypto market is often limited, especially when they represent a small fraction of the total supply. The funds generated typically support long-term ecosystem growth. 4. Can I track these transactions myself? Yes, because Ethereum is a public blockchain, all transactions are recorded on-chain. Anyone can use blockchain explorers (tools that allow viewing on-chain data) to track these movements transparently. 5. What is DAI? DAI is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The Ethereum Foundation converting ETH to DAI suggests a move to a stable asset to manage funds without exposure to crypto market volatility, preparing for future expenditures.

Analysts are putting forward some bold year-end targets — some seeing Bitcoin at $200,000 and Ethereum heading towards $10,000. These projections have traders debating the best crypto to buy now, but there’s a twist. A growing number of market watchers believe a new altcoin 2025 contender could outperform both. That coin is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising star in the market. It’s being ranked among the few projects that could outpace the big names, making it one of the top crypto picks 2025 for those hunting the highest ROI. Bitcoin’s 2025 Price Outlook: $80,840 to $200K+ Bitcoin is showing strong momentum after climbing back above $121,000, gaining more than 5% in the last week. Institutional demand is a big driver here, with forecasts ranging from a conservative $80,840 to an aggressive $200,000+ before year-end. InvestingHaven expects a base range of $80,840–$151,150, with a “stretched” target as high as $181,000. A consensus of seven top forecasters puts BTC around $200,000. Standard Chartered is in the same camp with a $200,000 projection. These numbers keep Bitcoin in the spotlight for long-term investors weighing Bitcoin vs Ethereum, but also open the door to comparing how other coins might perform in this bullish cycle. Ethereum’s 2025 Targets: $7,500 to $10,000 Ethereum has surged nearly 30% in the past seven days, bouncing from $3,600 to $4,700. With ETF inflows, network upgrades, and stablecoin growth, analysts are predicting a strong year ahead. Standard Chartered now sees ETH at $7,500, up from its earlier $4,000 target. ETF-focused analysts believe $10,000 is possible, especially with the momentum from post-ETF approval buying. This makes Ethereum a contender for the best crypto to buy now — yet some traders are shifting their attention to emerging projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts’ Dark Horse for 2025 Leading analysts rank MAGACOIN FINANCE among the few projects capable of outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the next cycle. They see it as a fresh, high-growth opportunity in a market still dominated by the big two. While BTC and ETH are expected to deliver solid returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is viewed as a new altcoin 2025 candidate with a better risk-to-reward profile for those seeking maximum upside. The project is touted by the analysts as one of the top crypto picks 2025 for aggressive investors. It’s still early in its growth phase, which is exactly why some traders believe the percentage gains could eclipse even the most optimistic BTC or ETH predictions. Where the Smart Money Might Flow in 2025 Bitcoin vs Ethereum will remain a central debate for crypto investors in 2025. Both are backed by strong technical and institutional narratives, and both have bullish forecasts. But while their potential gains may be substantial, their market caps make triple-digit percentage surges harder to achieve. This is where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE enter the conversation. For investors aiming to spot the best crypto to buy now for outsized returns, this rising project is becoming hard to ignore.

The company said it will buy mining rigs and add assets such as XRP, BTC, ETH, SOL, LTC, USDC and DOGE to its balance sheet. The move comes after Thumzup set an internal target to grow a digital asset pool to $250 million and authorized up to 90% of its liquid assets to be held in cryptocurrencies. Thumzup Expands Crypto Treasury Robert Steele, Thumzup’s CEO, called the raise a step toward a “strategically managed” digital asset treasury. According to the company, Coinbase Prime will remain custodian and prime broker for the new holdings. The firm also disclosed a Bitcoin-backed credit facility arranged with Coinbase Prime in May 2025 that is meant to provide flexible capital to support its treasury plan. This is a bold pivot for a publicly traded firm and will draw close scrutiny from investors and regulators alike. Mining Push And Capital Use Based on reports, the $50 million proceeds will be split toward mining equipment purchases and direct crypto accumulation. Mining requires machines, space, and power, and Thumzup says it will deploy capital to expand operations. That’s the part that could either add steady revenue if done well or become a heavy drain on cash if costs rise or market prices tumble. The company didn’t give a detailed commissioning schedule in the initial release, so the timing of any meaningful hash rate increase remains unclear. Peers And Market Moves Reports have disclosed a string of similar corporate moves in recent days. Vivopower announced a partnership with Crypto.com for institutional custody. Metaplanet Inc. of Japan reported a 468% Bitcoin yield in the second quarter of 2025, after holding 18,113 BTC valued at $2.1 billion following a $61 million BTC purchase. Thumzup’s action sits squarely alongside these shifts as Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high. A Risky Bet For Shareholders? If cryptocurrency prices keep rising and margins in mining are still healthy, the plan could deliver very strong returns. But pooling as much as 90% of liquid assets into digital tokens will expose the company’s balance sheet to sudden swings. The mining expansion will be a big-ticket item that needs to be executed with care. Given that the company is associated with US President Donald Trump’s family , the expansion will draw increased media and political scrutiny.

Here’s what could happen next, according to history. Bitcoin Realized Price Has Overtaken 200-WMA For First Time This Cycle As pointed out by analyst James Van Straten in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Realized Price and 200-week MA have seen a crossover. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on the BTC network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Don’t Expect Volatility: Contrarian Signal Brewing? When the value of this metric is higher than the spot price, it means the holders as a whole are in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under BTC’s value suggests the average investor is underwater. The 200-week MA, the other metric shared by the analyst, is a technical analysis (TA) pricing model that averages BTC’s closing price over the last 200 weeks. Since 200 weeks roughly equal four years, this indicator is used to gauge BTC’s trend shifts over a classic four-year cycle. Now, here is the chart shared by Van Straten that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price and 200-week MA over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price has gone up over the past year, a natural result of BTC’s spot price following an uptrend. As investors trade at the higher prices, they reprice the cost basis of their coins higher as well, thus raising the market average. After the latest increase in the indicator, its value has surged above the 200-week MA. The last time that the former was higher than the latter was in the previous cycle. Back then, the crossover occurred in 2020, and the orientation was maintained until 2022. Interestingly, the timing of the crossover coincided with the start of that cycle’s bull run. In the 2017 cycle, no crossover preceded the bull run as the Realized Price never dipped under the 200-week MA, but a retest did occur, which sent the metric flying up alongside the spot price. “When the uptrend begins, so does the bull market,” notes the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether something similar as in the past would occur, with the Bitcoin Realized Price seeing a sustained surge above the 200-week MA.

Speaking of bullish signals, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has revealed that institutional buying represented 75% of Coinbase volume recently. Edwards has noticed an interesting pattern related to this metric. “All readings above 75% have seen higher prices one week later,” explains the analyst. BTC Price Bitcoin set a new all-time high above $124,000 on Wednesday, but the coin has plunged since then as its price is back at $118,300.

The $2.9 billion deal, first announced in May, officially closed this week. Deribit recorded over $1 trillion in trading volume in 2024, drawing a dedicated base of institutional and sophisticated traders. Coinbase said the platform’s strong client loyalty and market leadership made it a strategic addition to its expanding suite of services. Building a One-Stop Crypto Hub Coinbase has been steadily growing its offerings to serve diverse segments within the crypto sector. The exchange now provides a perpetual futures platform, prime brokerage services, retail spot trading, institutional lending, and secure asset custody. By integrating Deribit’s operations, Coinbase aims to bolster its derivatives capabilities while reinforcing its ambition to become a one-stop destination for digital asset services. Despite the milestone, Coinbase’s stock slipped by roughly 2.5% in intraday trading following the deal’s closure. This minor dip follows a broader pattern of market adjustments after major acquisitions. Six Acquisitions in 2025 The Deribit purchase is one of six acquisitions made by Coinbase so far in 2025. In January, the exchange acquired Spindle, a blockchain-based advertising platform designed to help creators boost their visibility online. The same month, Coinbase brought on the team behind Roam, a blockchain-based web browser project. In July, it added Liquifi, a platform focused on supporting early-stage token startups with management tools and resources. These deals reflect Coinbase’s strategy of expanding into complementary areas of blockchain and crypto infrastructure. Industry-Wide Expansion Trends Coinbase’s aggressive growth mirrors a wider trend among major crypto exchanges branching into adjacent markets. Kraken, for instance, launched tokenized stock trading for non-US residents in May, tapping into the emerging tokenized securities space. The company also offers crypto futures, staking, asset custody, and over-the-counter services for institutions. Robinhood has been blurring the line between traditional and digital finance by providing mixed-asset trading and announcing a layer-2 blockchain for tokenized stock trading in Europe. Meanwhile, Binance continues to diversify its portfolio with retail and institutional offerings, including options, futures, and token launch platforms. Since 2018, Binance has been actively acquiring crypto wallets, blockchain development teams, exchanges, and analytics firms. Coinbase’s move for Deribit underscores the competitive race among major exchanges to expand capabilities and secure market share in the evolving global crypto economy.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-08-15 01:09:20

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a new performer is expanding on-chain lending and yield opportunities. At $0.035, the new DeFi token has picked interest in presale. Existing holders are setting themselves for a minimum of a 300% rally. Mutuum Finance has reached more than $14.35 million raised in funds and more than 15200 investors. As SOL’s price action continues to hover within a tight range, on-chain data shows increased activity in Solana-based lending markets, while Mutuum Finance is seeing notable upticks in user engagement. Solana Holds Under $200, Setting Up for a Bullish Breakout Solana (SOL) is currently trading around $176, holding just above key support near the $160–$165 range after a recent pullback from July highs. Analysts note that this consolidation forms a rounded base, echoing Bitcoin’s structure before its pre-rally surge, and suggests momentum may build toward a breakout past the $200 level. Overall, Solana’s technical posture and on-chain strength appear intact, positioning the network for potential upside even as the focus widens to include emerging DeFi projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Phase 6 Mutuum Finance has initiated presale round 6 at $0.035. The next phase will see a 14.29% price rise to $0.04. Presale has drawn over 15200 investors and raised over $14.35 million already. Mutuum Finance pursues a twin-model approach towards achieving maximum flexibility and effectiveness using Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract uses self-executing smart contracts, which carry out the lending independently without any human intervention at all. They have been programmed to operate at variable speeds within the market with an unknown interest rate based on the then-prevalent demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and allows lenders to communicate directly with borrowers. Mutuum Finance Increases Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is going to release a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum network. It will be robust and secure product to end risk and uncertainty associated with algorithmic stablecoins. The project is also authenticated with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. Mutuum Finance initiated its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool amount carrying the value of $50,000 USDT. It has a severity level of four. They are critical, major, minor, and low. The project is also organizing a $100,000 giveaway to grow the project’s community. 10 investors have the opportunity to win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Solana’s consolidation phase below $200 is fueling speculation that the network could be on the verge of a significant breakout, yet Mutuum Finance is already in an active growth phase that has tangible results to show. The project’s presale has brought in over $14.35 million from more than 15,200 investors, locking in a 16.17% gain from the previous stage and setting up for another 14.29% price increase to $0.04 in phase 7. The introduction of a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, a 95.0 CertiK trust score, and substantial community incentives such as a $100,000 token giveaway and a $50,000 bug bounty program highlight that this is more than a speculative play; it is a security-conscious, utility-driven ecosystem in the making. As Solana eyes its next technical breakout, MUTM’s presale stage offers a rare chance to secure early exposure to a project positioned for potentially exponential gains in 2025. Investors can explore the presale and participate before the next price move takes effect.

Analysts and investors are once again taking a closer look at Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). It’s not just the usual large-caps drawing attention; new projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also making significant waves among whales. AVAX Eyes $55 Amid Breakout Strength Avalanche is making fresh bullish momentum; currently, it trades at $25.28 after reclaiming $24.50. Analysts are eyeing the $27 area. A breakout here would confirm short-term targets of $26.50–$27.50 and the potential to head toward $55 by year-end. The price uptick in the cryptocurrency market may not be an accident as institutional inflows and an increase in on-chain activity are supporting this rise. AVAX has a market cap of over $10.6 billion and a daily trading volume of almost $840 million, suggesting the crypto may be gearing up for a big rise. Cardano Rebounds With Eyes on $0.72 Cardano has registered a considerable recovery, currently trading at $0.885, following a 4.56% rise in the past 24 hours and a 17.88% increase in the previous week. Although it is 73% under its all-time high of $3.09, traders remain bullish. Some predict a run to $0.70-$0.72, especially if the market improves. With a trading volume exceeding $2.8 billion and a current market cap of more than $30 billion, ADA has been in the green, possibly signalling a trend reversal. But overall sentiment is mixed, and analysts caution against any linear progress. Those who are confident in the long-term growth of stocks are investing more and betting towards small-cap stocks to increase growth. Solana Holds Above $200 as Momentum Builds Solana has been dominating the headlines in the year 2025. At present, Solana is trading at $201.05 after gaining over 22% in the last week and over 36% in the last year. The trading volume rose above $12 billion, and experts believe it may push towards $230 before ultimately retesting its $295 all-time high. This network’s transaction capacity and lead in decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) activity fuel a bullish case. Larger players are also signalling confidence through whale activities and treasury accumulation. MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to attract whales capital Halving momentum is prompting AVAX, ADA, and SOL holders to position early in MAGACOIN FINANCE for a potential 40x return , as cross-chain capital rotation accelerates ahead of the next market leg. Analysts note that whale accumulation from these major altcoin communities is driving sustained buy pressure, with strategic positioning aligning ahead of anticipated exchange listings. As liquidity inflows grow and market sentiment strengthens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a key beneficiary of this early-cycle capital shift. Final Thoughts AVAX, ADA, and SOL are flashing bullish signals, and long-term investors are preparing for what could be a historic run-up post-halving. But for those seeking outsized gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the small-cap to watch. Its security framework, growing community, and accelerating accumulation suggest it may not stay under the radar much longer.

After the announcement was made public, the statistics bureau in Taipei vowed to share Taiwan’s new growth estimate figures as soon as they were released. Following their May prediction, they anticipated a 3.1% growth rate this year; however, 22 economists speculated that the chipmaking hub could surpass this and record a growth rate of 4.1%. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that in Taiwan’s new growth estimate, the bureau will expose details on the nation’s 2026 initial gross domestic product (GDP) prediction and inflation estimates for 2025 and 2026. Taiwan’s impressive economic growth raises controversy among individuals Just recently, analysis from sources revealed that the island economy has been experiencing a surge in demand for its advanced chips export , triggered by increased adoption of AI among companies. Considering the uncertainties surrounding Trump’s tariff policies, these companies rushed to purchase Taiwan’s tech products before Trump decided to put a 20% tariff rate into effect. This led to a significant economic growth rate in the final quarter. At that time, Taiwan’s export revenue amounted to $154 billion. Trump did not take this lightly, as it increased the trade gap between the two trading partners and pressured the local currency to increase in value. Apart from concerns about Trump’s reaction to this positive outlook, the biggest question among individuals is whether the nation could keep up with this impressive economic growth, sparking endless debates. Hyosung Kwon, Korea Economist for Bloomberg Economics, weighed in on the topic of discussion. According to Kwon, there is a high likelihood that Taiwan’s economy may experience a decline. He added that this may result in Trump’s threatening tariff rates and a decrease in front-loading. Although Kwon acknowledged that the growing demand for AI will significantly benefit the nation’s economic status, he pointed out the tech market’s uncertainties, which threaten economic growth. Trump announced a 100% tariff rate on semiconductor imports to the US After US President Donald Trump announced a 20% tariff rate on exports from Taiwan to the US, tension among tech companies increased. To address this, the Taipei government stated that the tariff rate was only temporary and promised manufacturers to stay calm as they negotiated with the US to find a suitable solution. Despite this assurance, analysts have pointed out a more serious incident: Trump announced a 100% tariff rate on semiconductor imports to the US. For Taiwan, this is a terrifying situation. However, to avoid this huge tariff rate, Trump has set up a condition to invest in the US. An example of a semiconductor company in the world’s leading semiconductor producers is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. This firm is highly reputed for its advanced chips. It supplies these chips to Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc. According to research from sources, it may not be subject to 100% tariff rates because it has industries in the US.

This month, the firm cashed in its option to purchase nearly the most units obtainable from Chinese mining giant Bitmain . This included a cumulative 16.29k units of Antminer U3S21EXPH bought for around $314 million based on data by The Miner Mag. The machines are high-performance application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) created strictly for Bitcoin operations. Together, they produce around 14.02 exahashes per second (EH/s) of hashing power, allowing them to increase the portion of global mining for American Bitcoin in a possible way. The original version was for as many as 17,280 units. American Bitcoin has locked in the purchase of equipment to avoid potential cost hikes related to US tariffs on Chinese-made mining equipment. Exclusive American Bitcoin has finalized a $314M deal with Bitmain for 56,000 ASIC machines. The agreement further solidifies American Bitcoin as one of the largest mining operators in North America. At the same time, it marks a significant refrain on where miners can expect their margins in the future. It takes a bullish position on the potential continued success of mining operations despite downward fluctuation in Bitcoin prices and increasing competition. According to industry trackers, fewer orders of the same scale have been outsourced to US miners this year. Though American Bitcoin has not publicized its specific deployment plans, sources familiar with the firm claim they intend to place the machines in several large-scale locations for operational risk mitigation. The deal came before the Trump administration’s plans to enforce politically motivated tariffs for imported Chinese mining hardware. The administration imposed a trade policy of blanket import tariffs on technology goods, which included ASIC miners. The duties supplement those attempting to transfer manufacturing back to the US, while costing companies reliant on Chinese suppliers. Bitmain acted swiftly to fight this pressure. The firm indicated that it operates the first operational ASIC production in the enterprise, which was scheduled to start in early 2026, in the United States. Additionally, by year-end, the company will open a US headquarters in Texas or Florida. Bitmain’s goal is to avoid tariffs and keep prices competitive for US customers while moving some of its production to America. US tariffs are a production push for the mining supply chain There are three main players in the Bitcoin mining supply chain: Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan. According to a University of Cambridge study, Bitmain controls about 82% of the global ASIC market alone. Trade tariffs and macroeconomic pressures have these manufacturers rethinking their operations. However, analysts say some would move production capacity to North America to continue serving the US market. However, critics argue the steel tariffs could prove counterproductive. Such price jumps could push up USA mining costs so high that it destroys demand from users in the land of the free, the home of many pretty dumb regulators,” Jaran Mellerud, CEO at BTC mining company Hashlabs, said. This would lead to the dumping of surplus stock abroad at lower prices, and a return to mining activity in nations with more competitive operating costs if domestic demand drops. Wouldn’t that contradict the administration’s mission to move the crypto industry onshore?

This development offers a fascinating look into how major players are navigating the evolving digital economy. Unveiling Bit Digital’s Impressive ETH Holdings Strategy In their latest quarterly update, Bit Digital disclosed holding a substantial 121,076 ETH. This figure isn’t just a number; it reflects a deliberate and sophisticated strategy in managing their digital asset portfolio. A significant portion of these Bit Digital ETH holdings , specifically 105,015 ETH, is actively staked.

How Ethereum Staking Rewards Are Driving Growth? The decision to stake a vast majority of their ETH has already yielded tangible benefits for Bit Digital. The company proudly reported earning 166.8 ETH in Ethereum staking rewards during Q2 2025 alone. These rewards represent a consistent and valuable revenue stream, effectively diversifying their income beyond traditional cryptocurrency mining operations. Consider the advantages this brings: Consistent Income: Staking provides predictable returns, offering a stable financial component compared to volatile market trading. Network Support: By contributing to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism, Bit Digital directly strengthens the network’s integrity and efficiency. Strategic Growth: The ability to reinvest these earned rewards can further expand their digital asset base, fostering long-term growth. This steady flow of Ethereum staking rewards is a clear testament to the viability of staking as a core component within a comprehensive digital asset strategy for institutional players.

Moreover, it underscores the growing importance of passive income generation in the crypto sector. Investors and market watchers alike often scrutinize these reports for signs of sustainable growth and operational efficiency. The consistent generation of substantial Ethereum staking rewards certainly positions Bit Digital favorably within a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market, making their performance a benchmark for others.

50106353,https://cryptonews.com/?p=409194,1755222087,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50106353.jpeg,"US Treasury Doubles Down, Hits Crypto Exchange Garantex with Second Sanction",https://cryptonews.com/news/us-treasury-doubles-down-hits-crypto-exchange-garantex-with-second-sanction/,"The United States Treasury Department has escalated its crackdown on illicit crypto activity, redesignating the Russian-linked cryptocurrency exchange Garantex Europe OU and sanctioning its successor platform, Grinex. The move follows years of allegations that Garantex processed more than $100 million in transactions tied to ransomware groups, darknet markets, and other cybercriminal operations. OFAC Targets Garantex Leaders in Crackdown on Crypto Crime The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has sanctioned three senior executives of crypto exchange Garantex and six associated companies in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. The measures, announced Thursday under OFAC’s cyber authorities, cite the platform’s role in laundering digital assets for cybercriminals. Treasury officials said Garantex has continued to serve ransomware operators despite being sanctioned in April 2022 for operating in Russia’s financial services sector. “Exploiting cryptocurrency exchanges to launder money and facilitate ransomware attacks not only threatens our national security, but also tarnishes the reputations of legitimate virtual asset service providers,” said John K. Hurley, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. Authorities say the exchange handled transactions for groups behind the Conti, LockBit, and Black Basta ransomware strains, as well as sanctioned money launderer Ekaterina Zhdanova. The new action follows a March 6 coordinated operation involving the U.S. Secret Service and German and Finnish authorities, which seized Garantex’s web domain, froze $26 million in cryptocurrency, and disrupted its infrastructure. Tether has frozen $27 million in USDT held in wallets on the Russia-based Garantex Exchange. #TetherFreezes #TetherUSDT https://t.co/EdaS60FDE3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 6, 2025 The U.S. Department of Justice has also unsealed indictments against executives Aleksandr Mira Serda and Aleksej Bešciokov, charging them with money laundering conspiracy, operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, and violating U.S. sanctions. Bešciokov was arrested in Kerala, India , while on vacation with his family. Mira Serda, a Russian national and co-owner of Garantex, remains at large. Garantex operator arrested in India on US money laundering charges. #Garantex #CryptoLaw https://t.co/UaTmqvUvt9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 12, 2025 Prosecutors allege Garantex moved wallets to evade detection and provided misleading data to conceal account ownership, even in cases where Russian law enforcement sought information. If convicted, both face up to 20 years in prison for money laundering, another 20 for sanctions violations, and five years for operating without a license. Additionally, the Department of State has announced two reward offers under the Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Mira Serda and up to $1 million for other key leaders of Garantex. U.S. Treasury Says Garantex Shifted Funds to Grinex to Evade Sanctions Following the March seizures, U.S. Treasury officials say Garantex moved its customer funds to a newly created exchange, Grinex, in an effort to bypass sanctions. Promotional materials for Grinex openly stated it was formed in response to the freezes and restrictions. Since its launch, it has processed billions in cryptocurrency transactions. Investigators also uncovered that Garantex and Grinex used a ruble-backed digital token, A7A5 , to return funds to Russian customers whose assets were frozen. A7A5, a stablecoin pegged to the Russian ruble, has processed over $9.3 billion in transactions on Grinex, the successor to Garantex. #A7A5 #Russia https://t.co/svrr75EywL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 The token was tied to Russian firm A7 and its subsidiaries, which U.S. officials say are controlled by sanctioned individuals, including Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shor and Russian bank Promsvyazbank. OFAC has now sanctioned Grinex, A7, its subsidiaries, and Old Vector for aiding Garantex’s sanctions evasion efforts. Treasury officials say Garantex’s leadership was key to enabling the exchange’s illicit operations. Co-founder Sergey Mendeleev, co-owner Mira Serda, and regional director Pavel Karavatsky allegedly procured infrastructure, registered trademarks, and engaged in business development to maintain the appearance of legitimacy. Two other companies, InDeFi Bank and Exved, were also sanctioned. Both are controlled by Mendeleev and are accused of helping facilitate cross-border crypto transactions that bypass U.S. restrictions. The new sanctions mean all property and interests in property of the named individuals and entities that fall under U.S. jurisdiction are blocked. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with them unless authorized. Financial institutions that continue to do business with the sanctioned parties risk enforcement actions. The Treasury stressed that sanctions are intended to change behavior, not simply punish. OFAC maintains a process for removal from its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) List for those who demonstrate compliance with U.S. laws. Garantex Action Follows Takedowns of BidenCash, BlackSuit Ransomware The Garantex case comes amid a series of recent U.S. operations targeting cybercriminal infrastructure. On June 5, law enforcement seized crypto linked to BidenCash , a dark web marketplace accused of selling over 15 million stolen credit cards and personal data. BidenCash generated over $17 million in revenue from selling over 15 million stolen credit cards and personal data. #BIdenCash #CryptoSeizure #DarknetMarketplace https://t.co/WYZqZOAIgp — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 5, 2025 The international operation, involving U.S., Dutch, and other agencies, took down around 145 domains linked to the site. Officials also disrupted the BlackSuit ransomware group , seizing over $1 million in digital assets tied to the malware scheme. BlackSuit is accused of targeting critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S. and abroad. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took down multiple servers and domains belonging to the BlackSuit Ransomware group. #DOJ #BlackSuit https://t.co/hreZp6OC5k — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 U.S. authorities have repeatedly highlighted the growing nexus between ransomware, illicit crypto use, and state-linked actors. The United Nations has estimated that North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen more than $3 billion in digital assets worldwide, with much of the money funding weapons programs.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Hong Kong begins its trading day, ETH is changing hands above $4600, down 3% on-day. As ETH is up nearly 16% in the last week, and 45% in the last month, this probably isn't a concern for most traders. After all, the ETH/BTC ratio has broken above its 365-day moving average, a signal that has historically marked extended periods of ETH outperformance, and spot ETF flows are reinforcing the move. However, the same data shows early warning signs of near-term cooling, as CryptoQuant argued in a recent report. Daily ETH inflows to exchanges have surpassed Bitcoin’s, suggesting some holders are positioning to take profits. ETH’s MVRV ratio against BTC has risen from 0.4 in May to 0.8, approaching historical overvaluation territory. CryptoQuant warns that in past cycles, such levels have preceded pauses or pullbacks in ETH’s relative strength. Trading desks echo this view. In a recent note, France-based FlowDesk reports that while there were $1 billion in single-day ETH ETF inflows on Monday, with broad client buying versus BTC and SOL, there were also increased call overwriting in ETH options at the $7K–$8K strikes for December — a sign some are capping upside expectations. QCP framed ETH’s rally within a macro backdrop of softer headline CPI in its daily Asia Color telegram update, with strong expectations for a September Fed cut, and geopolitical easing, but flags upcoming Jackson Hole remarks and remaining CPI/NFP prints as potential sentiment pivots. Market maker Enflux added in comments to CoinDesk that a hotter-than-expected PPI print reminded traders that inflation risks remain uneven, and that ETH’s outsized performance could invite consolidation. While the structural drivers remain intact, ETF demand, institutional participation, and favorable on-chain signals, the market is entering a phase where stretched positioning and macro event risk could test ETH’s momentum. As CryptoQuant’s data shows, the rally is strong, but so are the early signs of profit-taking. Market Movers BTC: Bitcoin fell over 3% from record highs after hotter U.S. inflation dampened rate cut hopes and the Treasury signaled it will not expand Bitcoin purchases for its strategic reserve. ETH: ETH is down 3.3% as sell pressure increases, as traders take profit after a record rally. Gold: Gold fell 0.62% to $3,336.6 as hotter U.S. inflation and strong jobs data boosted the dollar and yields, trimming expectations for a large September Fed rate cut. Nikkei 225: The Nikkei 225 opened higher as Japan’s economy grew an annualized 1.0% in Q2, beating forecasts on strong exports and capital spending, though analysts warn U.S. tariffs could slow growth in the coming months. S&P 500: U.S. stocks stalled Thursday as a hotter-than-expected PPI dampened hopes for a large September rate cut. Goldman Sachs warns its models show elevated odds of an S&P 500 drop, citing low volatility and growing tariff risks.

Recently, the crypto community witnessed a stark reminder of these dangers as three prominent Hyperliquid whales suffered devastating crypto trading losses . These powerful traders, known for their substantial market influence, saw their fortunes vanish, offering crucial on-chain insights into the perils of high-stakes speculation. Who Are These Hyperliquid Whales, And What Went Wrong? On-chain analyst @EmberCN recently brought to light the unfortunate fates of three major traders on the Hyperliquid platform. These individuals, often referred to as ‘whales’ due to their massive holdings and trading volumes, exemplify the high-risk, high-reward nature of the crypto market. James Wynn: Once boasting an impressive $87 million in profits by late May, Wynn’s journey took a dramatic turn. He not only lost all his accumulated profits but also his entire principal of $21.77 million. A key factor was his colossal Bitcoin (BTC) long position, valued at up to $1.23 billion, opened at the end of May. This massive bet ultimately led to his downfall. @qwatio: Another insider whale, @qwatio, had previously turned a modest $3 million principal into a remarkable $26 million profit. Despite this success, the tides turned, and @qwatio ultimately lost their entire initial principal. AguilaTrades: This trader faced continuous liquidations over recent days, leaving them with a mere $30,000. Their experience highlights the relentless nature of market movements against highly leveraged positions. The Peril of Leverage Trading and Its Consequences The stories of these Hyperliquid whales underscore the extreme dangers associated with leverage trading . Leverage allows traders to open positions much larger than their actual capital, amplifying both potential profits and, critically, potential losses. While it can accelerate gains, it also means a small adverse price movement can wipe out an entire account. When a trader’s losses on a leveraged position exceed their collateral, the exchange automatically closes their position to prevent further losses. This process is known as liquidation. For these whales, their massive leveraged positions meant that even minor market fluctuations could trigger catastrophic outcomes, leading to significant crypto trading losses . What Does Whale Liquidation Mean for Traders? The whale liquidation events on Hyperliquid provide valuable lessons for all market participants. When large positions are liquidated, it can create cascading effects, adding selling pressure to the market. This can lead to further price declines, impacting other traders. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in crypto. These incidents are not isolated; they are a constant reminder that even the most experienced and well-capitalized traders are vulnerable to market volatility, especially when engaging in high-risk strategies like aggressive leverage trading . It’s a stark illustration of how quickly fortunes can reverse. Lessons from These Devastating Crypto Trading Losses The unfortunate experiences of James Wynn, @qwatio, and AguilaTrades offer critical takeaways for every crypto investor and trader: Risk Management is Paramount: Never risk more than you can afford to lose. Implement stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes carefully. Understand Leverage: While enticing, leverage is a double-edged sword. Use it cautiously and only if you fully comprehend its mechanics and associated risks. Diversify Your Portfolio: Putting all your capital into one highly leveraged trade, as seen with James Wynn’s BTC long, concentrates risk. Stay Informed with On-Chain Insights: Following reputable analysts like @EmberCN can provide valuable context, but always conduct your own research and exercise caution. These incidents serve as a powerful cautionary tale. Even those with substantial capital and prior success are not immune to the market’s unpredictable nature. Prudent risk management and a clear understanding of the tools you use are essential for navigating the often-turbulent waters of cryptocurrency trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a crypto whale? A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. Their actions are often tracked for market insights. What is Hyperliquid? Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies with leverage, offering high liquidity and low fees. How does leverage trading work? Leverage trading involves borrowing funds to increase your trading position beyond what your actual capital allows. For example, with 10x leverage, a $1,000 deposit lets you control a $10,000 position. This amplifies both potential profits and losses. What is liquidation in crypto trading? Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin (collateral) falls below a certain level due to losses on their leveraged position. The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, often resulting in the loss of the initial capital. Can small traders be affected by whale liquidation? Yes, large-scale whale liquidations can create significant selling pressure, leading to rapid price drops that can affect all traders, regardless of their position size.

This rapid accumulation has captured the attention of market watchers, hinting at significant movements within the digital asset space and raising questions about the identity and intentions behind such a substantial investment. Unveiling the Enormous ETH Wallet Acquisition According to insights shared by Lookonchain on X, a fresh wallet address, specifically 0x2A92, recently made headlines with a significant transaction. This address acquired an additional 30,069 ETH, valued at approximately $138.46 million, directly from the Kraken Exchange. This particular transaction is part of a much larger trend for this specific address. Over just two days, this new ETH wallet has managed to amass a staggering total of 53,434 ETH. This cumulative Ethereum purchase translates to an impressive $242.34 million. Such a rapid and large-scale acquisition immediately signals the presence of a major player in the market, prompting widespread discussion and analysis among crypto enthusiasts and experts alike. Decoding the Mysterious Crypto Whale’s Strategy When an individual or entity accumulates such a massive amount of cryptocurrency, they are often referred to as a “ crypto whale .” These whales possess enough capital to significantly influence market prices through their buying or selling activities. The swiftness of this particular large ETH acquisition suggests a strategic move, possibly anticipating future price appreciation for Ethereum. The identity behind the 0x2A92 address remains unknown, but its actions speak volumes. This kind of substantial investment could belong to a high-net-worth individual, a hedge fund, or even an institutional investor making a strategic entry into the Ethereum market. Understanding the motives behind such a large move is crucial for anticipating market trends. Market Implications of This Kraken ETH Purchase The decision to execute this massive Ethereum purchase via the Kraken ETH platform is also noteworthy. Kraken is a well-established and highly liquid centralized exchange, capable of handling such large volumes without significant slippage. This choice indicates a preference for security and efficiency in executing the trade. Historically, significant whale movements can act as strong market signals. A large accumulation, like this one, is often perceived as a bullish indicator, suggesting confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. It can inspire other investors, both large and small, to consider increasing their own ETH holdings, potentially driving up demand and price. What This Means for Ethereum’s Future Trajectory This substantial investment by a new ETH wallet underscores the ongoing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem. Ethereum continues to be a foundational blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and various Web3 applications. Its ongoing developments, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade, aim to enhance scalability and efficiency, making it even more attractive to investors. Observing the movements of significant players, like this newly active crypto whale , provides valuable insights into market sentiment. While no single transaction guarantees future outcomes, a large ETH acquisition of this magnitude certainly adds to the optimistic outlook for Ethereum, reinforcing its position as a leading digital asset. In conclusion, the emergence of a new ETH wallet making an astonishing Ethereum purchase of over $242 million within two days is a compelling story in the crypto world. This massive large ETH acquisition from the Kraken ETH platform by a mysterious crypto whale signals strong conviction in Ethereum’s future. It highlights the continued institutional and high-net-worth interest in the digital asset space, reinforcing Ethereum’s status as a key player in the evolving financial landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an ETH wallet? An ETH wallet is a digital tool, either hardware or software, used to store, send, and receive Ethereum (ETH) and other ERC-20 tokens. It holds your private keys, which are essential for accessing and managing your cryptocurrency. What does it mean to be a ‘crypto whale’? A ‘crypto whale’ is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price through their significant buying or selling activities. Why is this large ETH acquisition from Kraken significant? This large ETH acquisition is significant because it represents a substantial investment of over $242 million in Ethereum by a single, newly active wallet. Executing such a large trade on a major exchange like Kraken ETH also highlights the liquidity and trust in the platform. How can I track large crypto transactions like this Ethereum purchase? You can track large crypto transactions using blockchain explorers (like Etherscan for Ethereum) or on-chain analytics platforms such as Lookonchain, Whale Alert, or Arkham Intelligence, which provide real-time data on significant movements. Does a large ETH purchase guarantee price increase? While a large ETH purchase by a significant investor often indicates bullish sentiment and can contribute to positive price momentum, it does not guarantee a price increase. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment.

While established names still hold trust among market participants, it is the fast-growing, disruptive projects gaining the most attention. Analysts and casual traders are hunting for coins that blend strong fundamentals, compelling stories, and scalable technology, the recipe that can deliver major returns. Projects making notable headlines include BlockDAG, which is showing unmatched presale growth, alongside Filecoin, VeChain, and Stellar, all proving their technical value and adoption power. Each of these assets brings something unique, from decentralized file storage to enterprise-level blockchain solutions, yet all are positioned for possible strong rallies in 2025. Here is why these cryptos are gaining such attention from the community. BlockDAG: A Presale Force Ready to Lead BlockDAG is attracting worldwide attention, with its presale already raising $373 million and aiming for an impressive $600 million. Currently in Batch 29 at $0.00276, this stage is considered one of the best entry points before possible price surges. Analysts suggest it could climb to $1 in its first major bull cycle, which would mean early participants have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since Batch 1. The project’s technical design is ambitious. Its DAG plus Proof-of-Work hybrid model offers ultra-fast transaction speeds with complete decentralization. Full EVM compatibility ensures easy migration for Ethereum-based dApps, boosting the potential for a thriving ecosystem. Adoption numbers are already remarkable: 2.5 million X1 app miners, over 200,000 holders, and 19,000 ASIC miners sold, even before its mainnet is live. High-profile campaigns such as the Inter Milan sponsorship are building BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s global recognition. For those looking at the highest potential cryptos in 2025, the current presale price could be the last window before valuations rise sharply. Filecoin: Decentralized Storage Gains from AI Growth Filecoin is holding its position as one of the highest potential cryptos in 2025 within the decentralized storage market. Currently trading around $2.47 after a recent dip, it remains steady at key support while aiming for resistance at $2.68. Partnerships in AI and Web3 are fueling demand, with the storage sector projected to hit $17.5 billion by 2032. Charts show a bullish fractal setup that could lead to a breakout if the wider market sentiment improves. As the leader in decentralized storage, Filecoin could see strong gains as privacy and scalable infrastructure become bigger priorities. VeChain: Enterprise Solutions Driving Breakout Potential VeChain’s focus on enterprise applications makes it a top contender among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. It has gained 12.1% in the past week, forming a bullish cup-and-handle pattern near $0.043 resistance. Experts believe it could push past $0.050 if momentum stays strong. With active adoption in supply chain tracking and staking rewards, VeChain’s real-world usage backs its chart signals. If the bullish pattern plays out, VET could see solid upward moves in the coming year. Stellar: Institutional Partnerships Lifting Price Outlook Stellar has surged over 10% in the last week, moving toward $0.47 resistance. Its integration into the DTCC’s $2.5 quadrillion institutional blockchain framework gives it a major credibility push. Trading activity and open interest have jumped sharply, and if this trend continues, Stellar could cross $0.50. With both institutional interest and retail participation growing, XLM stands among the highest potential cryptos in 2025. Final Words The race for the highest potential cryptos in 2025 shows a mix of exciting presale projects and seasoned market leaders. BlockDAG’s unmatched fundraising success, advanced technology, and rapid adoption make it a serious leader in the conversation. At the same time, Filecoin’s strength in storage, VeChain’s enterprise traction, and Stellar’s institutional integration point to multiple sectors ready for growth. With the bull market approaching, early positioning in these assets could deliver strong returns. Whether it is BlockDAG’s high-reward presale or proven projects with expanding use cases, the opportunities for gains in 2025 are already shaping up strongly.

With DOGE and SHIB both flashing bullish setups, seasoned holders are reallocating some gains into this fast-moving presale, seeking exposure before potential major exchange listings. Dogecoin Whales Fuel Bullish Momentum Dogecoin is enjoying one of its strongest months in 2025, recently rallying above $0.24 amid a broader market rebound. Whale investors have accumulated over 680 million DOGE since August 1, pushing large-holder ownership near half the supply. This accumulation trend has tightened market liquidity and bolstered support levels, setting up the possibility of a breakout to $0.28 or even $0.30. Traders are watching the $0.220 support band closely, as sustained whale demand could keep the rally intact despite broader market volatility. Shiba Inu Eyes a Technical Breakout Shiba Inu, trading at $0.00001382, is currently testing a multi-month falling wedge pattern that many analysts believe could trigger a strong upside move. Projections range from a near-term push to $0.000018 to a longer-term rally toward $0.000033 and beyond. The higher-low formations on recent charts suggest momentum is building. Market sentiment around SHIB remains optimistic, with several top traders calling for a triple in market cap if key resistance levels are cleared in the weeks ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Target for Meme Coin Gains Many early DOGE and SHIB holders are now allocating into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a next-generation meme-meets-DeFi project currently in presale. The token has already attracted significant attention thanks to its audited security, fair tokenomics, and early metrics that some analysts say mirror the early days of top meme coins. With listings on major exchanges rumored and analysts projecting the potential for large-multiple gains, the project has emerged as a favored reinvestment destination for those looking to compound recent profits from DOGE and SHIB rallies. Bottom Line With Dogecoin whales pushing prices higher and Shiba Inu primed for a potential breakout, profit-takers from both camps are strategically positioning in MAGACOIN FINANCE before its presale window closes.

50107789,557235,1755223229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50107789.jpeg,Justin Sun Vs Bloomberg: Clash Escalates Over TRON Founder’s Crypto Holdings,https://bitcoinist.com/justin-sun-vs-bloomberg-clash-escalates/,"Justin Sun, the controversial crypto billionaire and founder of the Tron (TRX) blockchain, has ignited a new legal dispute by filing a lawsuit against media company giant Bloomberg on Monday. The lawsuit , submitted in Delaware, accuses Bloomberg of “improperly” disclosing sensitive financial information about Sun’s cryptocurrency holdings in a recent article, which he claims could lead to significant and irreparable harm. Justin Sun Battles Bloomberg’s Financial Disclosure The crux of the matter lies in a series of interactions between Sun and Bloomberg earlier this year. Bloomberg had approached Sun for potential inclusion in its “Billionaires Index,” a compilation of the world’s wealthiest individuals. To feature in the index, Bloomberg required Sun to disclose his financial information for net worth verification . However, Sun allegedly raised concerns about the confidentiality and security of his data. Assurances from a Bloomberg representative, Ms. Shen, led Sun to believe that only general details about his assets, particularly his cryptocurrency holdings, would be shared in the Billionaires Index. It is alleged that Sun scrutinized existing profiles on the index to gauge the extent of financial disclosures, especially concerning cryptocurrency assets . Despite initial reservations, Sun eventually agreed to participate, trusting Bloomberg’s commitment to confidentiality. However, the situation took a contentious turn when Sun discovered Bloomberg’s intention to publish detailed financial information beyond his expectations. In response, Sun’s legal team accused Bloomberg of breaching promises of confidentiality and privacy, emphasizing that any unauthorized disclosure could lead to severe consequences. Bloomberg Cites First Amendment Rights In response to Justin Sun’s lawsuit, Bloomberg issued a letter asserting that granting a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the publication of this information would infringe upon its First Amendment rights. In its defense, the media company argues that such prior restraint is only justified in rare circumstances, which they contend do not apply in this case. Bloomberg maintains that Justin Sun cannot demonstrate a likelihood of success on his claims of invasion of privacy or promissory estoppel, and they assert that the publication is in the public interest. According to the controversial publication made on August 13, Sun reportedly holds over 60 billion TRX tokens, the native cryptocurrency of the Tron blockchain, based on financial details disclosed by his representatives in February 2025. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that Justin Sun’s cryptocurrency portfolio extends beyond TRX, encompassing approximately 17,000 Bitcoin (BTC), 224,000 Ethereum (ETH), and 700,000 Tether. Notably, Sun’s ownership of the cryptocurrency exchange HTX comes into play. Bloomberg’s insights suggest that HTX, under Sun’s ownership, generated an estimated revenue of around $1.3 billion in 2024, factoring in its spot and derivative trading volumes and fee structures.

50108700,https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-presale-2025-cold-wallet-bitcoin-hyper-maxi-doge-snorter-bot/,1755223235,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50108700.jpeg,"Top Crypto Presale 2025: Cold Wallet, Bitcoin Hyper, Maxi Doge & Snorter Bot",https://thecoinrise.com/top-crypto-presale-2025-cold-wallet-bitcoin-hyper-maxi-doge-snorter-bot/,"Crypto presales are proving to be an early testing ground for projects aiming to deliver strong gains before exchange listings. They give early participants access to tokens at significantly lower prices, often well below future market value. With momentum building in 2025, the search for the top crypto presale is heating up. Some projects are standing out not only for their hype but also for their clear utility, solid fundraising, and active adoption. These projects are raising millions in early rounds and building strong communities ahead of launch. Here are four presales drawing attention, each offering a distinct angle through technology, branding, or utility. From a cashback-enabled wallet to a Bitcoin Layer-2 platform, a high-energy meme coin, and a trading bot concept, these are the ones to keep on your watchlist this year. 1. Cold Wallet: A Wallet That Rewards Every Action Cold Wallet is emerging as one of the most notable picks in the top crypto presale category for 2025. Designed as a self-custody wallet with real-world use, it changes the typical fee-heavy approach into one that rewards users. Gas fees, swaps, and fiat on/off ramps processed through the wallet return CWT tokens, creating a cashback system that encourages ongoing use. Holding more CWT increases reward rates, with the highest tier returning up to 100% of gas fees. Its listing on CoinMarketCap has added visibility, reinforcing its presence in the market. Currently in Stage 17, CWT is priced at $0.00998, with $6 million raised so far. The steady growth suggests that the combination of practical benefits and early pricing is resonating with buyers. There is no staking requirement, simply holding CWT boosts rewards. With its halving model and reserves for long-term operations, Cold Wallet is structured for ongoing relevance. For those looking at the top crypto presale options, it meets both the practical use case and strong ROI potential criteria. 2. Bitcoin Hyper: Bringing Smart Contracts to Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper is designed to expand Bitcoin’s capabilities by introducing programmability similar to what’s seen on Ethereum and Solana. Using a Layer-2 system compatible with the Solana Virtual Machine and connected through a Canonical Bridge, it supports smart contracts, DeFi platforms, NFTs, and other blockchain applications on Bitcoin’s network. This setup allows developers to launch fast, low-cost applications while maintaining Bitcoin’s security and liquidity. The presale is advancing quickly, with over $7.6 million raised and tokens priced around $0.012575. Whale participation has been notable, including a $96K purchase, showing confidence in its direction. Recent U.S. policy changes, such as allowing retirement accounts to hold crypto, add further momentum. For those searching for the top crypto presale, Bitcoin Hyper presents a clear technological proposition combined with increasing market interest. If execution aligns with the vision, early participants could benefit when the token reaches exchanges. 3. Maxi Doge: Meme Branding With Strong Presale Results Maxi Doge channels the meme coin appeal with a bold identity, positioned as Dogecoin’s over-the-top cousin. Its presale started at $0.00025, increasing with each stage, and encouraged early engagement. The response was immediate, with $100K raised within minutes, $150K in the first day, and over $450K in under two weeks, reflecting the strength of its branding and early-stage structure. Its tokenomics reserve substantial allocations for marketing, liquidity, and project growth, signaling a plan to maintain visibility and prepare for exchange listings. A clear roadmap and potential integration plans give the project more structure than many meme coins. The combination of high APYs and an engaging theme has helped attract participants beyond casual traders. For those considering the top crypto presale in the meme coin category, Maxi Doge’s branding impact, structured rollout, and community traction make it a notable option ahead of launch. 4. Snorter Bot: Streamlining Automated Crypto Trading Snorter Bot aims to simplify algorithmic trading, offering market scanning, automated buy/sell execution, and multi-exchange integration without requiring coding skills. The goal is to provide both speed and ease of use, making it suitable for experienced traders seeking efficiency and beginners wanting a hands-off approach. Although full technical details are still being revealed, the presale has already attracted interest due to its blend of trading-focused utility and approachable community branding. The project targets users who want to stay active in the market without constant monitoring. For those looking for the top crypto presale with a technology-first approach, Snorter Bot offers potential in combining precision, automation, and user accessibility. If it delivers on its functionality, early adopters could hold a token that benefits from the growing demand for automated trading solutions. Closing View Presales are where early commitment can meet the highest upside potential. In 2025, standout projects combine strong narratives with tangible value. Cold Wallet offers direct, functional benefits through its rewards system. Bitcoin Hyper presents a unique route for DeFi and dApp growth on Bitcoin. Maxi Doge shows how meme projects can still attract substantial funding when the branding resonates. Snorter Bot illustrates the draw of practical trading tools before launch. While each option carries its own balance of risks and rewards, all four have the activity, structure, and community engagement that define promising early-stage crypto. For those monitoring the market, these presales remain ones to watch before prices climb and listings shift entry opportunities.

50107101,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=804840,1755223255,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50107101.jpeg,Q4 Will Decide If The 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle Is Dead: Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/q4-will-decide-if-the-4-year-bitcoin-cycle-is-dead/,"Bitcoin’s fresh record above $124,000 on Thursday set the stage for a stark test of one of oldest heuristics, according to Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at Theya. In a video published today, August 14, Consorti argued that the fourth quarter will reveal whether the market’s long-observed four-year halving cycle still governs price behavior—or whether the asset has entered a new regime shaped by deep, patient pools of traditional finance capital. “Bitcoin just hit a brand new all-time high of more than $123,700,” he said at the top of the segment. “It’s since corrected slightly…but we’re still pushing higher.” That print aligns with Wednesday’s tape across major dashboards: Bitcoin price topped above $124,4000 today as macro traders leaned into a prospective Fed easing path and risk sentiment firmed. Q4 Could Bury The 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle For Good Consorti framed the breakout against a month-long tug-of-war around $118,000–$120,000, describing how “longs and shorts have been fighting back and forth for market control,” with bulls “slowly but surely” grinding out the upper hand. He tied the setup to the seasonal transition out of the “summer doldrums,” and to a policy backdrop he expects to turn supportive: “As Wall Street returns from vacation… the Fed is positioned for its first maintenance rate cut in a year as the US economy rebounds.” Futures markets have increasingly priced a September cut, a shift that has underpinned risk assets broadly alongside dollar softness. The heart of Consorti’s thesis is that this expansion is structurally different. “This is also Bitcoin’s longest bull market ever… at 21 months compared to 13 months,” he said, using that duration to pose the key dilemma: “That begs the question, is the 4-year cycle dead? Well, at the very least, the 4-year cycle will be tested in Q4 of this year.” Related Reading: The Grand Bitcoin Roadmap: Crypto Expert Says $160,000 Still In The Works He pointed viewers to analysis from on-chain researcher James Check (Checkmate) at CheckOnChain. “If we see a massive run-up and blow-off top at 4-year end, the theory remains intact… but if not, Bitcoin’s behavior through market cycles has probably changed forever.” Check, for his part, has recently written that “if there was ever a time for the 4yr Bitcoin halving cycle to break, this market environment is likely it,” underscoring how veteran on-chain analysts are also bracing for a pattern shift. What’s changed, in Consorti’s view, is the buyer base. “Traditional finance capital pools have entered the picture, and they play by different rules.” He highlighted spot Bitcoin ETFs as the prime conduit: “These are purchased by retirees, pension funds, and endowments… These are allocators with no near-term intention of selling. They plan to hold it for years, even decades, and only gradually shave down positions over time.” To illustrate, he cited Harvard University’s endowment: “Their endowment purchased 1.9 million shares of iShares Bitcoin Trust, valued at $116.7 million in Q2.” That position—disclosed in a recent 13F—impressively demonstrates the institutional adoption of BlackRock’s IBIT. Related Reading: Two Forces Can Launch Bitcoin To $1 Million, Says Mike Novogratz Consorti extended the long-horizon argument to treasury adopters: “These are firms holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets with no plan to sell. Ever… the serious players… are permanent fixtures in the market.” The implication, he said, is a visible evolution in market structure and tempo: “Instead of the violent booms and busts of earlier cycles, we’re seeing something new, which is a consistent uptrend punctuated by periods of consolidation, then rapid expansion, then consolidation again.” As supply becomes increasingly lodged with long-duration holders and the asset’s capital base thickens, “volatility naturally compresses, but upside doesn’t vanish. It just plays out in longer arcs, with bigger dollar moves and a slower tempo.” He added that this maturation is already noticeable as Bitcoin grows “beyond its current $2.4 trillion market cap,” even as he acknowledged that the fourth quarter will be the crucible for the cycle debate. “In Q4, that dynamic could be on full display,” Consorti concluded. A “mix of easing financial conditions, renewed institutional inflows post-summer, and persistent structural demand from ETFs, corporates, and high net worth allocators could set the stage for another leg higher and a banner Q4.” But his sign-off was deliberately non-deterministic: “Only after the fourth quarter of this year will we truly know whether or not the four-year cycle is truly dead and buried… We’ll just have to wait and see.” At press time, BTC traded at $119,068.

The fund continues to attract investors and build its market share, even as Bitcoin’s price drops from its recent all-time highs. The milestone comes as IBIT’s total net inflows reached $58.04 billion by August 13, showing strong investor interest even though there were no new inflows on that specific day. On the same date, the ETF ended trading at $69.84 per share, which was 0.57% higher than its net asset value, reflecting steady demand in the market. BlackRock grows its Bitcoin ETF to record assets and widens its lead BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust secured its position as the undisputed leader in the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market after reaching an unprecedented $91.06 billion in assets under management. IBIT has proved investors’ trust in BlackRock and its ability to capture market share in a fiercely competitive space by holding 3.72% of the total Bitcoin supply (roughly 54.82 million shares valued at $3.79 billion). IBIT has displayed incredible momentum and attracted all types of investors from large institutions to retail participants since its debut in January 2024. The ETF set a record for any new U.S. ETF launched in its first month by achieving over $5 billion in net inflows. IBIT had already crossed the $80 billion mark in cumulative net inflows by mid-July 2025. The jump to $91.06 billion in August further underscored its unmatched ability to attract and retain investor capital even in volatile market conditions. Other spot Bitcoin ETFs have posted solid growth figures, but none have come close to matching IBIT’s scale. Fidelity’s FBTC ranks second and manages $24.77 billion in assets with $12.07 billion in cumulative net inflows. Even though its performance is exceptional, it still represents less than one-third of BlackRock’s total. Grayscale’s GBTC holds $22.18 billion in assets but recorded $23.72 billion in cumulative outflows since its conversion to an ETF. Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB remain relatively small players, catering to narrower investor segments with $5.58 billion and $5.02 billion, respectively. Hot U.S. inflation data pushes Bitcoin down and triggers $1B in losses Bitcoin’s latest rally reached a dramatic high of $124,000 on Wednesday, largely due to investor optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve would soon deliver a 25 basis point interest rate cut. Traders believed this move would strengthen demand for cryptocurrencies, encourage risk-taking, and inject fresh liquidity into financial markets. However, the Federal Reserve had to maintain a more cautious approach to monetary easing when the month’s U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) data came in hotter than expected. As a result, Bitcoin’s price plunged below $118,000 in a matter of minutes and sparked a chain reaction that rippled through spot markets, futures contracts, and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Automatic liquidation systems on major exchanges closed positions to meet margin requirements and prevent further losses to lenders as Traders slipped into loss territory. The total crypto liquidation amount crossed the $1 billion mark in less than 24 hours, with more than $930 million in leveraged Bitcoin positions alone. The price drop translated almost immediately into a downward adjustment of IBIT’s net asset value since each share rises and falls with changes in the spot price. However, many of the ETF’s holders view such price dips as opportunities to accumulate more shares at relatively lower prices because it still managed to attract investor inflows even during heightened volatility. This distinction between IBIT and many of its competitors reinforces the idea that IBIT’s investor base comprises participants committed to long-term exposure rather than short-term speculation.

What Drove DeFi Technologies Profit in Q2? DeFi Technologies, the parent company of Swiss crypto ETP provider Valour, has clearly demonstrated robust financial performance. Their impressive DeFi Technologies Q2 results, detailed in a recent PR Newswire release, highlight a period of substantial growth and operational efficiency. This success is not just about the bottom line; moreover, it reflects a broader positive trend in the adoption and institutional interest in digital assets. A key indicator of their strength is the company’s assets under management (AUM). As of June 30, 2025, Valour’s AUM stood at approximately $773 million . This substantial figure showcases investor confidence in their structured products, particularly their Valour ETPs , which provide accessible exposure to various cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the growth in AUM directly correlates with increased management fees, contributing significantly to the overall revenue. Understanding the Impact of Crypto Financial Performance This strong crypto financial performance from DeFi Technologies offers valuable insights into the current state of the digital asset market. Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) have emerged as a preferred vehicle for both institutional and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. Valour’s success with its ETPs, contributing significantly to the overall DeFi Technologies profit , suggests increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. These regulated products offer distinct advantages: Simplicity: They provide easy access to crypto markets through traditional brokerage accounts, removing the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Regulation: Valour ETPs operate within established financial frameworks, offering a layer of security and compliance that many investors seek. Diversification: They can provide exposure to a range of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, allowing for portfolio diversification within a familiar investment structure. The net profit also indicates effective cost management and operational leverage within DeFi Technologies, enabling them to convert revenue into significant earnings. How Does Strategic Digital Asset Management Drive Success? How does a financial technology firm achieve such impressive results in a dynamic market? DeFi Technologies has focused on strategic initiatives in digital asset management and product innovation. Their commitment to developing secure and regulated investment products has clearly paid off. For instance, expanding their range of ETPs to include new digital assets or innovative strategies has likely attracted a wider investor base. While the market has its ups and downs, the consistent growth in AUM and the reported DeFi Technologies Q2 net profit signal effective risk management and a forward-thinking approach. This allows them to capitalize on opportunities while mitigating potential volatility. Furthermore, their ability to adapt to market trends and investor demands plays a crucial role in maintaining their competitive edge. Navigating Challenges and Future Prospects Despite the strong performance, the digital asset landscape presents its own set of challenges. These include: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: New regulations can emerge rapidly, potentially impacting operations and product offerings. Market Volatility: Crypto markets remain susceptible to significant price swings, which can affect AUM and investor sentiment. Intense Competition: A growing number of players are entering the ETP and broader digital asset management space, increasing competitive pressures. However, DeFi Technologies appears well-positioned to navigate these challenges. Leveraging its established brand, robust infrastructure, and strong financial base, the company can continue its growth trajectory. The positive crypto financial performance serves as a strong foundation for future expansion, potentially into new geographies or offering new types of digital asset products. Their ongoing commitment to innovation and compliance will be key. In conclusion, DeFi Technologies’ reported $17.4 million net profit for Q2 2025 is a testament to its robust business model and effective strategy in the evolving digital asset landscape. Their subsidiary, Valour, plays a pivotal role in this success through its well-received crypto ETPs and significant assets under management.

According to reports from the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, a staggering 300,000,000 USDT has moved from the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave to an unidentified digital wallet. This substantial Aave transaction , valued at approximately $300 million, represents a notable whale movement and raises questions about its purpose and potential impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. Understanding This Significant Aave Transaction This isn’t just any ordinary crypto transaction ; it involves one of the largest stablecoins by market capitalization, USDT, and a prominent DeFi platform, Aave. Aave allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies, earning interest or accessing liquidity. When such a colossal sum, equivalent to $300 million, exits a well-known protocol like Aave and lands in an unknown wallet, it naturally sparks curiosity and analysis within the community. The anonymous nature of the recipient wallet is a key factor here. While blockchain transactions are transparent, revealing the addresses involved, the identity behind these addresses often remains private. This particular USDT transfer highlights the dual nature of blockchain: open ledgers but often cloaked identities. Why Does a Whale Movement Matter? Large transfers, often dubbed “whale movements,” are closely watched because they can signal various intentions, potentially influencing market sentiment or liquidity. When 300 million USDT changes hands, it could indicate several possibilities: Institutional Rebalancing: A large entity might be reallocating funds or preparing for a major investment. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Such large sums are often moved for private, off-exchange transactions to avoid market disruption. Consolidation: A large holder might be consolidating assets from multiple sources into one wallet. Security Measures: Moving funds from a protocol to a cold storage wallet for enhanced security. Understanding the “why” behind such a significant digital asset transfer is crucial for analysts attempting to gauge market trends and potential shifts in investor behavior. Implications of the Unknown Digital Asset Transfer While the immediate impact on USDT’s peg or Aave’s operations might be minimal, the sheer size of this digital asset transfer warrants attention. It underscores the immense capital flowing through the DeFi space and the increasing sophistication of large-scale participants. For Aave, such an outflow, while large, does not necessarily indicate a problem. Protocols like Aave are designed to handle significant liquidity movements. However, the unknown destination means the market will monitor subsequent activity from this wallet. Is it preparing for a massive buy order, or is it simply moving funds to a secure, private location? This event also reinforces the importance of on-chain analytics tools like Whale Alert, which provide valuable transparency into these otherwise opaque movements. Without such tools, tracking these significant shifts in liquidity would be nearly impossible. What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Consider? For everyday crypto users and investors, this USDT transfer serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the digital asset market. While specific actions by whales can sometimes precede market shifts, it is important to avoid drawing hasty conclusions from a single transaction. Instead, focus on: Staying Informed: Keep an eye on reputable sources for further developments. Understanding Context: A single large transaction is one data point; look at broader market trends. Risk Management: Always be aware of the inherent volatility and risks in the crypto space. This Aave transaction , while mysterious, is part of the ongoing evolution of the decentralized financial landscape, where transparency of movement coexists with anonymity of identity. In conclusion, the 300 million USDT transfer from Aave to an unknown wallet is a compelling event that highlights the scale and complexity of large-scale operations in decentralized finance. While the exact motives remain shrouded in mystery, this significant whale movement underscores the constant flow of capital within the crypto ecosystem and the vital role of on-chain monitoring in understanding these powerful forces. As the crypto market continues to mature, tracking such substantial crypto transaction activities becomes increasingly important for both market participants and observers alike. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Aave? A1: Aave is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to lend their cryptocurrencies to earn interest and borrow cryptocurrencies by providing collateral. Q2: What does “whale movement” mean in crypto? A2: In cryptocurrency, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. A “whale movement” indicates a significant transfer of assets by such a large holder, which can sometimes influence market sentiment. Q3: Why is a 300,000,000 USDT transfer significant? A3: This amount, equivalent to $300 million, is substantial and can indicate large institutional activity, major rebalancing, or a significant over-the-counter (OTC) trade, potentially signaling future market moves or shifts in liquidity. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions? A4: Services like Whale Alert provide real-time tracking of large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. You can also use blockchain explorers to view transactions directly on the network. Q5: Does this transfer affect USDT’s stability? A5: A single large USDT transfer does not typically affect USDT’s peg to the US dollar. USDT is designed to maintain its value through reserves. Such transfers are common as liquidity moves within the crypto ecosystem. Did you find this analysis of the mysterious USDT transfer insightful?

Holders of XRP, BNB, and Solana are already placing bets on a new token before it even lists. They want early entry and bigger upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the focus of that attention. The name is showing up more in trading groups, and many believe it could deliver one of the biggest runs this year. MAGACOIN FINANCE Set for 35x Surge After Next Listing Market momentum is accelerating, with projections for MAGACOIN FINANCE to surge 35x following its next listing. The project team has been releasing regular updates, each one drawing more eyes. A clear listing roadmap and early liquidity plans are already in place. Social media activity is climbing, and community engagement is strong. For investors, this is the stage where prices are still low enough to allow for bigger gains if momentum continues after listing. XRP investors are no strangers to volatility. Many of them now see value in spreading risk across smaller, early-stage projects. Getting in before a listing can change the size of returns. BNB traders have seen this pattern before. They remember how smaller projects have multiplied in value after hitting major exchanges. Solana holders have also joined the search. Even though SOL has done well this year, they know that smaller coins can sometimes outperform in shorter timeframes. A well-timed pre-listing entry is one way to catch that upside. The pre-listing phase is where early decisions count most. Once a token lists, the price can move fast. Early buyers often enjoy the widest profit window. Missing this stage can mean chasing higher prices later. That is why experienced traders act while the window is still open. In crypto history, projects with strong communities, active development, and clear roadmaps have posted sharp rallies after listing. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to fit those traits. It has community momentum, visible progress, and exchange plans in motion. Conclusion Opportunities like this do not remain unnoticed for long. More XRP, BNB, and Solana investors are getting involved each week, adding to early demand. For traders looking for a setup with potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a mix of timing, market buzz, and community strength that could make it one of this cycle’s most talked-about plays.

The U.S. banking giant also evaluates alternative ways to help clients accelerate payments. The push comes on the heels of new U.S. legislation enabling banks to issue stablecoins directly—provided they are backed 1:1 by risk-free reserve assets such as U.S. Treasuries or cash. This creates fresh opportunities for major custody banks like Citi to expand their offerings in the regulated digital finance arena. Biswarup Chatterjee, Citigroup’s Global Head of Partnerships and Innovation within its services division, revealed the bank may start by providing custody solutions for the high-value collateral backing stablecoins. These reserves could include U.S. government bonds and cash-equivalent holdings. Citigroup’s services arm already manages treasury, cash, and payment operations for some of the world’s largest corporations. Adding stablecoin custody would deepen its role in safeguarding client assets while aligning with regulatory requirements. Other heavyweight financial institutions, including Bank of America and Fiserv, are also exploring stablecoin opportunities. To date, McKinsey estimates that one stablecoin issued has a value of around $250 billion. Most still serve as a vehicle for speculation rather than practical payments. Citi expands blockchain payments and eyes crypto ETF custody market Citigroup has been using blockchain technology to transfer tokenized U.S. dollars between its accounts in New York, London, and Hong Kong. Through its Distributed Ledger Technology (DTC) platform, these transfers are available 24/7—unlike traditional banking systems that operate within set hours. The next step could see customers instantly moving stablecoins from one account to another. Citi is also developing solutions to convert stablecoins into U.S. dollars for same-day settlements. According to Chatterjee, the bank is already discussing practical, real-world use cases for these innovations with clients. The expansion could significantly streamline cross-border payments for companies by cutting costs and removing delays. In addition, the bank is exploring digital asset custody solutions linked to cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other services. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year prompted several asset managers to launch funds tracking Bitcoin’s price. These ETFs require secure custody of the underlying assets—a space dominated by Coinbase, which holds assets for more than 80% of crypto ETF issuers. For example, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust has a market value of around $90 billion. Citigroup’s entry into the custody arena could intensify competition and reshape the ETF custody market. Citi eyes stablecoins as regulatory green light spurs big bank crypto moves Citigroup’s plans come amid a more permissive regulatory environment. That contrasts with the Biden administration, which signaled that legacy financial companies are relatively agnostic about jumping into crypto. The GENIUS Act created clarity and new definitions that industry insiders say will prompt major institutions to enter the game. Still, compliance will be strict. Banks must comply with anti-money-laundering laws and KYC measures and undergo the necessary checks to ensure all cryptoassets involved are clean from nefarious activities. Security and fraud prevention will be essential to gain trust in this new market. While Citi has yet to make an official announcement, it is reportedly exploring its stablecoin offering. That would put it in good company with banks like JPMorgan, which has its own JPM Coin for institutional payments. Just recently, Citi CEO Jane Fraser confirmed that the bank is exploring tokenized deposits and digital settlement options.

The prospect of an ETF tied to one of the most recognizable meme coins has pushed trading volumes higher and sent DOGE prices climbing.

Investors are seeking fresh opportunities with higher upside potential, turning their attention toward some of the best crypto presale options available. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining momentum as a rising contender with bold upside forecasts. Dogecoin ETF Talk Sends Price and Interest Soaring Optimism over a Dogecoin ETF has been building through August 2025.

DOGE has been climbing steadily, and trading activity has picked up as traders position ahead of any decision. This surge in sentiment has a ripple effect, with investors also scouting the best altcoin presale projects that could deliver explosive gains if broader crypto market momentum holds. MAGACOIN FINANCE: 85x Forecast Driving Investor Curiosity MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most talked-about names in the altcoin presale space. Fueled by speculation around the Dogecoin ETF, traders are broadening their exposure to newer projects that could ride the wave of meme coin enthusiasm. Analysts and community chatter suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could see an upside as high as 85x from its early-stage pricing. The project’s appeal lies in its blend of meme coin culture and utility-driven tokenomics—positioning it as more than just hype. In a market where investors are looking for the best crypto presale opportunities with strong narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is ticking the right boxes.

Trading activity was up, with about $2 billion in volume reported in the last 24 hours. The move came alongside broader crypto gains, but LINK’s own narratives — from real-world assets to cross-chain tools — are getting a lot of attention. Related Reading: Dogecoin Draws New Attention As Open Interest Tops $3 Billion Community Momentum And Market Moves Reports have highlighted a spike in bullish talk from Chainlink’s community, often called “marines,” and on-chain activity that traders are watching closely. Based on Etherscan data, one token contract reportedly bought back roughly 40,000 LINK units in an hour via Uniswap V3, which traders said added fuel to the rally. Sentiment trackers show a notable upswing, and trading charts reflect a string of green days that pushed prices into the mid-twenties. Chainlink’s Role In RWA And Policy Debates Based on reports, Chainlink now secures over $62 billion in total value that relies on its oracle feeds, a figure that was put at about 60% of the oracle market. The project is reported to provide data for 450 projects across 21 chains. LINK’s exposure to real-world assets also gets attention: reports place Chainlink-linked RWAs at nearly $16 billion out of a $57 billion RWA space. The project was mentioned in recent White House digital asset frameworks as an example of oracle usage, which added another layer to the story driving interest. Price Signals And Technical Readouts According to short-term forecasts cited by some providers, LINK could rise by 7% to reach $25 by September 13, 2025. Market indicators shown in those reports mark current sentiment as Bullish, with the Fear & Greed Index at 75 (Greed).

According to Arkham Intelligence data reported by multiple outlets, the aerospace firm holds 8,285 BTC, worth about $1 billion at recent price levels. SpaceX Moves And Holdings According to on-chain trackers, SpaceX built up those coins between December 31, 2020, and June 10, 2022, and later moved a chunk of its earlier stash to Coinbase Prime in mid-2022. Recent on-chain activity shows the company relocated 1,308 BTC to a new address three weeks ago, a transfer that analysts treated as a shuffle rather than a sale. According to Arkham data, SpaceX’s Bitcoin holdings have exceeded $1 billion. The company holds a total of 8,285 BTC, having first acquired Bitcoin on December 31, 2020, and making its last purchase on June 10, 2022, after which it has held the coins to date.… pic.twitter.com/u54i0LUVkz — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 14, 2025 Price Drop After Treasury Announcement Based on reports , US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent — serving under US President Donald Trump — said the government will not be buying additional Bitcoin for its strategic reserve, and that comment weighed on crypto markets. Bitcoin fell from its roughly $124,000 peak and slipped below $119,000 in the hours after the disclosure. That drop trimmed market gains and cut the headline valuations of corporate holdings. JUST IN: Treasury Secretary Bessent says the US Government is “not going to be buying” Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/vL79P531CP — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 14, 2025 Market Context And Past Reductions According to Arkham, SpaceX once held a much larger position — roughly 28,000 BTC at its April 2021 peak — and pared back the size of its on-chain balance during the market turmoil of 2022. The mid-2022 moves came amid shocks like the Terra-Luna collapse and the FTX bankruptcy, events that pushed many firms to rework crypto exposure. Those earlier shifts help explain why SpaceX’s present on-chain total is smaller than the peak it carried. Tesla And Combined Figures According to reports, Tesla continues to hold 11,509 BTC, worth about $1.4 billion at current prices. Combined, the two Musk-linked companies now hold roughly $2.42 billion in Bitcoin on paper, a figure that depends entirely on the price snapshot used to value the coins. Reports say the Treasury’s plan to rely on confiscated crypto for any government reserve rather than buying new BTC could keep selling pressure off the market short term, but price action will follow many signals — macro moves, on-chain flows, and public remarks from big holders. According to multiple reports, SpaceX’s remaining 8,285 BTC is worth about $1.02 billion, but that headline number is now sensitive to fast price swings after the Treasury’s announcement.

Hong Kong-based family office Avenir Group has made a groundbreaking move, disclosing a massive $1.01 billion holding in BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). This substantial investment underscores a powerful trend: the accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption within the global financial landscape. It’s a clear signal that major players are increasingly confident in digital assets. What Does Avenir Group’s BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holding Mean? A recent 13F filing revealed Avenir Group’s impressive stake. They now hold approximately 16.55 million shares of IBIT, BlackRock’s highly popular BlackRock Bitcoin ETF . This figure represents a notable increase from the 14.7 million shares they reported just last May, showcasing a continued commitment to their crypto investment strategy. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it’s a substantial commitment that positions Bitcoin firmly within their diversified portfolio. This move by Avenir Group highlights a growing confidence among traditional financial entities in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The transparency provided by 13F filings offers a glimpse into how sophisticated investors are navigating the evolving digital asset space. Such large-scale commitments can significantly influence market sentiment and potentially attract even more capital into the crypto ecosystem. Why Are Institutions Embracing Bitcoin ETF Investment? The rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly those offered by financial giants like BlackRock, has simplified access to Bitcoin for institutional investors. These ETFs provide a regulated and familiar investment vehicle, removing many of the complexities associated with direct Bitcoin ownership, such as custody and security. This ease of access is a key driver for the increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption we are witnessing. For family offices and other large funds, a Bitcoin ETF investment offers several compelling benefits: Regulatory Clarity: Investing through an ETF operates within established financial frameworks. Ease of Access: No need for complex crypto wallets or exchanges. Diversification Potential: Bitcoin can act as a hedge against traditional market volatility. Liquidity: ETFs are traded on major stock exchanges, offering good liquidity. However, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. While ETFs mitigate some risks, Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility remains a factor. Investors must conduct thorough due diligence and understand the risks involved with any crypto investment . Avenir Group: A Leader in Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Avenir Group , a prominent Hong Kong-based family office, is not new to strategic investments. Their decision to significantly increase their BlackRock Bitcoin ETF holdings suggests a long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future. This kind of move by a well-established entity can set a precedent, encouraging other family offices and institutional players to consider similar allocations. This increased stake in IBIT also reflects broader crypto investment trends. We are seeing a shift from speculative retail trading to more structured, long-term institutional strategies. The demand for regulated products like the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is a testament to this maturation of the digital asset market. It demonstrates a move towards integrating digital assets into mainstream financial portfolios. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETF Investment? The actions of firms like Avenir Group serve as powerful indicators. As more 13F filings become public, we expect to see further evidence of significant institutional Bitcoin adoption . This ongoing influx of capital from major financial players could provide a strong foundation for Bitcoin’s continued growth and stability. For investors, monitoring these institutional moves can offer valuable insights into market sentiment and potential future directions. The increasing mainstream acceptance, facilitated by products like the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , is paving the way for a new era of crypto investment. It’s an exciting time to observe how traditional finance continues to embrace the digital revolution.

On August 14, both asset classes experienced significant positive flows, marking a remarkable period of sustained investor interest. This consistent inflow highlights a pivotal shift in how traditional finance views cryptocurrencies, transforming them into more accessible investment vehicles. What’s Driving the Surge in Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows? U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a combined net inflow of $639.74 million on August 14. This marked the eighth consecutive trading day of positive flows for these products, according to data shared by @thepfund on X. This sustained momentum suggests a strong appetite among investors for direct exposure to Ethereum through regulated investment products. The consistency of these Crypto ETF Inflows is a bullish signal for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Let’s break down the key players in this impressive surge: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund led the charge with a massive $519.81 million in inflows, demonstrating significant institutional backing. Grayscale’s mini ETH: It followed with $60.73 million, indicating continued interest in Grayscale’s offerings. Fidelity’s FETH: Fidelity’s fund attracted $56.94 million, showing its strong competitive position. Invesco’s QETH: This ETF contributed $2.26 million, adding to the overall positive trend. These figures underscore a clear trend: major financial institutions are actively embracing Ethereum-based investment products, making Digital Asset ETFs increasingly mainstream. Spot Bitcoin ETF Momentum: Who Led the Charge? While Ethereum ETFs stole some of the spotlight, U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs also posted a robust performance on the same day, logging a total net inflow of $230.55 million. This represented their seventh consecutive trading day of positive flows, reinforcing the consistent demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. This positive trajectory in ETF market trends for Bitcoin is a testament to its enduring appeal as a foundational digital asset. However, the picture for Bitcoin ETFs was more nuanced, with some notable divergences: BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund was the clear winner, witnessing a substantial net inflow of $523.34 million. BlackRock continues to dominate the inflow charts, solidifying its position in the Bitcoin ETF space. Grayscale’s mini BTC: It also saw positive movement with $7.32 million in inflows. Conversely, several other prominent Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows, highlighting competitive dynamics and investor reallocation: ARK Invest’s ARKB: Recorded a net outflow of $149.92 million. Fidelity’s FBTC: Saw outflows of $113.47 million. Bitwise’s BITB: Noted $30.87 million in outflows. VanEck’s HODL: Experienced $5.85 million in outflows. The remaining Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day. This mixed performance within the Bitcoin ETF segment suggests that while overall demand remains strong, investors are becoming more selective about their preferred investment vehicles. Understanding Digital Asset ETFs: Why Does This Matter? The consecutive days of positive Crypto ETF Inflows for both Bitcoin and Ethereum are incredibly significant. They signal increasing institutional adoption and broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes. For everyday investors, Digital Asset ETFs provide a regulated, familiar, and often more accessible way to gain exposure to the crypto market without directly owning the underlying assets. This ease of access can significantly reduce barriers to entry for new participants. The sustained positive flows reflect a growing confidence among investors that these products offer a secure and efficient pathway into the digital economy. As ETF market trends continue to evolve, we can expect more innovation and diversification in these offerings, potentially attracting an even wider range of investors. This development is not just about numbers; it’s about the mainstreaming of digital assets. In conclusion, August 14 proved to be another strong day for U.S. spot crypto ETFs. The significant inflows into both Spot Bitcoin ETF and Spot Ethereum ETF products, particularly those from major players like BlackRock, underscore a robust and growing interest from the investment community. While some ETFs experienced outflows, the overall trend points towards sustained positive momentum and increasing maturity of the digital asset investment landscape. This ongoing institutional embrace is a powerful indicator of crypto’s expanding role in global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a Spot Bitcoin ETF? A Spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. This allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without needing to buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why are consecutive positive flows important for Crypto ETF Inflows? Consecutive positive flows indicate sustained investor demand and confidence. It suggests that institutional and retail investors are consistently putting money into these products, signaling a healthy and growing market for digital asset investments. Q3: How do Spot Ethereum ETFs differ from Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The primary difference lies in the underlying asset they hold. A Spot Ethereum ETF holds actual Ethereum, while a Spot Bitcoin ETF holds actual Bitcoin. Both aim to provide direct price exposure to their respective cryptocurrencies through a regulated investment vehicle. Q4: What does the term ‘Digital Asset ETFs’ encompass? ‘Digital Asset ETFs’ is a broad term that includes any exchange-traded fund that invests directly in or tracks the performance of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. This can include ETFs holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, or baskets of various digital assets. Q5: What impact do these ETF market trends have on the broader cryptocurrency market? Positive ETF market trends often lead to increased liquidity, broader adoption, and enhanced legitimacy for cryptocurrencies.

Whether you’re holding Bitcoin, Ethereum, or even smaller altcoins, there are now multiple passive income opportunities available. While these methods focus on generating yield from existing assets, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum as a different kind of opportunity . Crypto passive income takes plenty of forms, such as staking and lending to yield farming and liquidity staking. It is important to identify how each works, their probable returns, and risk involved to enable you to select those that suit your targets. Staking Staking appears to be one of the more well-liked, and beginner friendly ways to generate a passive cryptocurrency income. It implies betting your coins in a blockchain proof-of-stake network in the quest to offer safety to blockchain and verify payments. In return, you will earn returns at regular intervals based on your participation which will typically be in the same cryptocurrency that an individual stakes. When you stake, the beauty of it is that you are predictable. You can estimate your returns based on the annual percentage yield (APY) of the network and you do not need to do much once you lock your coins. However, staking risks of losing money as the initial investment might be large; in others, the money might remain locked up within a certain period and hence limiting liquidity. Yield-Farming Yield farming takes things up a notch in the world of passive crypto income. Here, you provide liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in exchange for interest, additional tokens, or both. The flexibility of yield farming is a major draw – you can move your funds between platforms to chase higher yields. On the negative side, yield farming is associated with more risks. Any vulnerabilities of smart contracts, impermanent loss, and price volatility of tokens can rapidly bite into your gains. It is a risky but potentially lucrative approach that is most suitable to investors who can familiarize themselves with the DeFi space and closely track their holdings. Lending Crypto lending may become your preferred pick, in case you need a more sustainable and predictable income. On platforms such as Aave, Nexo, or BlockFi, you can lend your assets to other users in order to gain an interest and not to have to sell them. This means you keep ownership of your crypto while it generates returns for you. The associated risks here are counterparty and platform risk. If the borrower defaults or the lending platform runs into liquidity problems your money might be at risk. That is why it is necessary to entrust the most reliable platforms and distribute your financing among many services. Liquidity Pools Liquidity pools are the backbone of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and SushiSwap. By depositing your crypto into these pools, you help facilitate trades – and in return, you earn a share of the trading fees plus any additional incentives the platform offers. Returns can be strong, especially in high-volume trading pairs, but there’s a catch: impermanent loss. This happens when the price of the assets in the pool changes compared to when you deposited them, potentially leaving you with less value than if you’d simply held the assets. An Early-Stage Opportunity You Shouldn’t Miss While these methods focus on generating yield from existing assets, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are gaining momentum as a different kind of opportunity. With limited early allocations, strong community backing and great tokenomics, the project has been compared to crypto giants during their formative stages. Analysts suggest that early positioning in MAGACOIN FINANCE could offer incredible returns as adoption grows, making it a unique addition to your crypto portfolio. Masternodes Masternodes are specialized servers that perform advanced functions for a blockchain, such as enabling instant transactions or governance voting. In return, operators receive generous rewards. This can be one of the most profitable forms of passive income in crypto – but it comes with steep entry requirements like a big up-front investment in the network currency, and continual technical process. Dividend-Paying Tokens The dividend token shares are very similar to the dividend stocks. They also pay profits to holders on a regular basis such as providing extra tokens depending on the profits of the project. An example would be NEO (Gas) and KuCoin (KCS). The interest is simple, by having the token in possession, you will receive a portion of the projects success. But your profits are pegged to the performance of the project – i.e. bad performance on the project could result in smaller and even no dividends being paid. NFT Royalties NFTs also present a special passive income source to the artists and creators. Fixing royalties on your NFTs, you win the percentage of each of the resales. This will imply that even years later after selling the original NFT, you can still capitalize on its activity in the market. The downside is that NFT markets are volatile and demand-driven. Only NFTs with lasting appeal tend to generate meaningful long-term royalties. Crypto Savings Accounts Savings accounts are similar to crypto accounts with set interest rates in which one may deposit digital money. It is possible to earn interest with little efforts via a platform such as Nexo, Binance, or Celsius. Rates are often lower than other crypto income strategies, and you still face risks such as platform insolvency or hacking. But for beginners seeking a hands-off option, they’re a simple way to start earning. Conclusion Passive income is something that can be as simple or as complicated as you would want it to be with the use of cryptocurrency. The combination of the strategies enables investors to create a diversified source of income. And opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE are rare. You can make a fortune with early-stage breakout altcoins like this if you just time it right.

Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), and XRP are all flashing strong bullish signals — both from a technical and narrative standpoint. But while these leaders dominate headlines, small-cap outliers like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also entering high-conviction watchlists. Retail and whale investors alike are keeping a close eye as capital begins to rotate. Ethereum Reclaims Dominance Amid ETF Momentum Ethereum is once again demonstrating its status as the primary smart contract platform. ETH is presently trading at over $4,600. In the previous week, it has recorded gains of over 9%. Overall, the performance of ETH or Ethereum in 2025 makes it one of the best-performing large caps this year. ETF inflows have been responsible for the current momentum in the cryptocurrency market. It appears that BlackRock’s ETHA is the apex ETF driving the trend. Daily trading volumes exceed $18 billion, and on-chain activity – particularly in DeFi and L2 ecosystems – has increase sharply since FTX collapse. Avalanche Breaks Out as Institutions Accumulate Avalanche (AVAX) has jumped in open trading around $25.50, showing substantial upside after a technical breakout above $24. In the short term, examiners see a move to $27.50, while year-end targets extend to $55 depending on broader market conditions. The platform is making progress towards Web3 gaming and real-world assets (RWA), bringing in fresh liquidity from venture firms and institutional treasuries. With a daily trading volume of $838 million and a growing TVL across its DeFi protocols, AVAX is well-positioned for expansion. XRP Holds Strong Despite Volatility XRP is now trading in the $3.10 to $3.15 region after hitting a local high of $3.67 after the settlement with the SEC. After dropping by 4% in the recent sessions, analysts are still positive on the asset’s outlook as clarity emerges and strong institutional demand keeps price buoyant. A major part of the narrative driving Ripple’s growth is its ongoing expansion in global remittance corridors, especially in Asia and the Middle East.

This figure not only marks an all-time high for the platform but also generated an impressive $7.7 million in fee revenue, setting another new record. This monumental surge in Hyperliquid volume highlights the platform’s growing influence and the increasing appetite for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. What Propelled This Unprecedented Hyperliquid Trading Volume? Several factors likely contributed to Hyperliquid’s recent surge in DEX trading volume . The broader cryptocurrency market has seen renewed bullish sentiment, often leading to increased trading activity across all platforms, centralized and decentralized alike. However, Hyperliquid’s specific architecture and offerings play a crucial role in attracting such significant capital flow.

Market Responsiveness: Adapting quickly to market demands and introducing relevant products. Ultimately, Hyperliquid’s performance underscores the immense potential of decentralized finance to revolutionize how we interact with financial markets. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Hyperliquid and Broader DeFi Growth? While hitting crypto trading records is a monumental achievement, the path forward for Hyperliquid and the broader DeFi sector involves continuous evolution. Maintaining such high Hyperliquid volume will require ongoing innovation in scaling solutions, enhanced security measures, and compliance considerations as the regulatory landscape develops. The platform’s ability to sustain this momentum will be a key indicator of its long-term success. The implications for overall DeFi growth are significant.

Speaking on Fox News on Thursday, Bessent told anchor Maria Bartiromo that while Washington intends to develop a reserve “to get into the 21st century,” it will not be buying coins outright. Instead, the government plans to use confiscated Bitcoin and stop liquidating those holdings. “We’re not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up,” he said. “We’re going to stop selling that.” He estimated the value of the current reserve at between $15b-$20b US dollars. Bessent Moves To Reassure On Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Approach Later in the day, Bessent appeared to soften his stance. In an X post , he said Bitcoin forfeited to the federal government will serve as the foundation of the reserve established under President Donald Trump’s March executive order. Bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government will be the foundation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Trump established in his March Executive Order. In addition, Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more… — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) August 14, 2025 He added that the Treasury is “committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world.’” The remarks contrasted with his earlier categorical dismissal of Bitcoin purchases, sparking confusion among market observers and political critics. The Trump administration has shifted positions on crypto policy before. On the campaign trail, Trump spoke of a dedicated Bitcoin stockpile. The initiative later expanded to include other tokens such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP and Cardano. Ultimately, his executive orders created two separate pools, a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a broader digital asset stockpile that holds other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Hits $124k Before Reversing On Inflation Fears The clarification came on the same day Bitcoin surged to a record high above $124,000 before quickly reversing. The milestone showed how sentiment around policy can move in step with broader financial conditions. Doug Colkitt, a founding contributor at Fogo Chain, said the new peak showed “how much momentum and liquidity were building in risk assets ahead of the PPI print.” But he warned the reversal shows that “even the strongest crypto rallies remain tethered to macro forces, especially when inflation surprises force investors to rethink rate-cut timelines.” For Bessent, the balancing act is clear. He must show the administration is serious about building a Bitcoin reserve without rattling financial markets or opening the government to accusations of reckless spending. His repeated clarifications reflect the political sensitivity of the issue. They also show how deeply the Trump administration has tied its crypto stance to a broader economic message of sovereignty and modernization.

Recent data from Bitcoin World market monitoring reveals a truly remarkable development: the BTC price has surged dramatically, pushing past the significant $119,000 mark. This impressive move has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a potentially robust period for the broader cryptocurrency market . Currently, Bitcoin is actively trading at $119,000 on platforms like the Binance USDT market, showcasing strong momentum and a powerful shift in sentiment. What’s Driving the Incredible BTC Price Surge? Understanding what propels a significant jump in the BTC price requires looking at several key factors. Market sentiment plays a crucial role; positive news or widespread optimism can quickly lead to increased buying pressure. We are currently seeing a renewed confidence among both retail and institutional investors in digital assets , which is a major catalyst for this upward trend. Increased Demand: A growing number of individuals and large entities are looking to allocate capital into Bitcoin. This rising demand naturally pushes prices higher, creating a competitive environment among buyers. Limited Supply: Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity, with a capped supply of 21 million coins, means that as demand increases, the available supply tightens. This fundamental economic principle further supports price appreciation. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, such as inflation concerns or a weakening traditional financial system, can often drive investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin as a hedge against instability. This confluence of factors creates a powerful upward trajectory for Bitcoin, reinforcing its position as a leading digital asset in the global financial landscape. Understanding the Broader Cryptocurrency Market Momentum The recent jump in Bitcoin price is not an isolated event. It often reflects a broader positive trend across the entire cryptocurrency market . When Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experiences significant gains, it frequently pulls other digital assets, known as altcoins, along with it. This phenomenon is often referred to as a general market uptrend, benefiting various sectors of the crypto ecosystem. Many investors view Bitcoin as the primary indicator of the health and direction of the crypto space. Its performance can influence investment decisions across various digital assets . For those engaged in crypto trading , observing Bitcoin’s movements is paramount for strategic planning and identifying emerging opportunities. The current market momentum suggests a healthy appetite for risk assets, with investors seeking opportunities beyond traditional investments. This positive outlook is a welcome development for the entire crypto ecosystem, fostering innovation and adoption. Navigating Current Bitcoin Price Trends: What’s Next for Digital Assets?

While past performance does not guarantee future results, technical analysis often provides insights into potential movements. This new price point establishes a stronger foundation for future growth, signaling robust support. For those involved in digital assets , this surge highlights the dynamic nature of the market. Volatility is inherent, but so is the potential for substantial gains. Staying informed about market news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements within the blockchain space remains crucial for making informed decisions and effective crypto trading . Key Considerations for Investors: Market Monitoring: Continuously observe price action and trading volumes to gauge market sentiment and potential shifts. Risk Management: Understand the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversification can also play a role. Long-Term Vision: Many believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, viewing short-term fluctuations as part of its growth journey towards wider adoption. The current surge underscores Bitcoin’s resilience and its growing acceptance as a mainstream financial asset. This exciting development continues to shape the future of finance. In conclusion, the significant rise in BTC price above $119,000 marks an exhilarating period for the cryptocurrency market . This achievement is a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring appeal and the increasing confidence in digital assets globally.

50111270,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189732,1755230412,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50111270.jpeg,Urgent Call: U.S. Crypto Leaders Challenge Bank Data Fees Under Trump Administration,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-crypto-bank-fees/,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Call: U.S. Crypto Leaders Challenge Bank Data Fees Under Trump Administration The landscape of digital finance is constantly evolving, and a significant challenge has recently emerged concerning how consumers access their own financial information. Recently, prominent U.S. crypto and fintech executives have sounded the alarm, directly appealing to the Trump administration to intervene in a critical policy matter: the imposition of bank data fees . This move highlights a growing tension between traditional banking institutions and the innovative sectors pushing for greater financial fluidity. Why Are Bank Data Fees a Problem for Innovation? At the heart of the issue are the fees that traditional banks charge for allowing third-party applications to access customer financial data. While this might sound like a technicality, its implications are vast, particularly for consumers who wish to connect their bank accounts to various financial products and services offered by fintech and crypto platforms. The concern is that these fees act as a significant barrier, potentially stifling innovation and limiting consumer choice. Hindered Connectivity: Fees can make it expensive or even impossible for apps to integrate seamlessly with bank accounts. Reduced Consumer Choice: If linking accounts becomes too costly, consumers might be prevented from using the financial tools that best suit their needs. Innovation Stifled: New startups, especially in the crypto and fintech spaces, rely on accessible data to build competitive products. Fees can make their business models unviable. The Push for Free Customer Data Access The core argument from the crypto and fintech sectors is straightforward: consumers should have free and unfettered access to their own financial data. This concept, often referred to as ‘Open Banking,’ promotes a more interconnected financial ecosystem where individuals have greater control over their information and how it is used. It enables a richer array of services, from budgeting apps to investment platforms, to offer personalized and efficient solutions. Previously, the Biden administration had actively pursued policies aimed at making customer data access freely available. This initiative was part of a broader effort to foster competition and empower consumers within the financial sector. However, these efforts met strong resistance from the banking industry, which argued concerns over security, operational costs, and intellectual property. As a result, the proposed changes did not fully materialize, leaving the door open for continued debate and policy adjustments. What Does the Trump Administration’s Stance Mean? In a significant development, former President Trump has indicated that the current fee rules will remain in place until new guidelines are formally issued. This statement suggests a pause in the immediate push for free data access, creating uncertainty for fintech executives and U.S. crypto innovators who rely on this data. The delay could prolong the challenges faced by companies trying to build services that require direct integration with traditional banking systems. This situation underscores the ongoing tension between established financial institutions and the burgeoning digital economy. While banks emphasize the costs and risks associated with data sharing, fintech and crypto firms highlight the consumer benefits and the need for a level playing field to foster innovation. The decision by the Trump administration will be crucial in shaping the future of financial connectivity. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bank Data Fees The ongoing discussion around bank data fees is more than just a regulatory skirmish; it’s a battle for the future of financial services. Will consumers truly own their data, or will it remain a commodity controlled by large institutions? The outcome of this debate will directly impact the growth trajectory of the U.S. crypto industry and the broader fintech landscape. For consumers, the ability to seamlessly link accounts to innovative products could mean better financial management, more competitive rates, and access to cutting-edge tools. Key Takeaways: Advocacy: Crypto and fintech leaders are actively lobbying against bank data fees. Consumer Impact: Fees limit choices and access to innovative financial products. Policy Debate: The issue highlights a fundamental disagreement over data ownership and access. Future Implications: The decision on fees will shape the pace of financial innovation and consumer empowerment. This evolving scenario requires close attention from anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance and the digital economy. The ultimate resolution will define how easily consumers can leverage their own financial data to participate in the burgeoning world of decentralized finance and advanced fintech solutions. FAQs on Bank Data Fees and Customer Data Access Q1: What are bank data fees? Bank data fees are charges imposed by traditional banks on third-party financial applications (like budgeting apps or crypto exchanges) that wish to access a customer’s financial data with their consent. These fees are for the technical infrastructure and processes involved in securely sharing this information. Q2: Why are U.S. crypto and fintech executives concerned about these fees? U.S. crypto and fintech executives argue that these fees hinder innovation and limit consumer choice. They believe that charging for access to customer-owned data makes it more expensive to develop and offer competitive financial products, preventing seamless integration and adoption of new technologies. Q3: What does ‘customer data access’ mean in this context? Customer data access refers to the ability of individuals to grant permission to third-party applications to securely view and utilize their financial information held by banks. This enables services like personalized financial planning, automated investments, and seamless transfers between different financial platforms. Q4: How does the Trump administration’s stance affect the situation? The Trump administration has stated that current fee rules will remain in place until new guidelines are issued. This means the immediate push for free data access has paused, creating uncertainty for fintech and crypto firms hoping for a swift change in policy to reduce operational costs and expand services. Q5: What are the potential benefits of free customer data access for consumers? Free customer data access could lead to a more competitive financial market, offering consumers a wider array of innovative products and services. This includes better budgeting tools, easier loan applications, personalized financial advice, and seamless integration with crypto platforms, ultimately leading to greater financial empowerment. Q6: What is ‘Open Banking’ and how does it relate to this issue? ‘Open Banking’ is a concept where banks securely share customer data with third-party providers, with the customer’s consent. It’s directly related to this issue as it advocates for free and standardized access to customer data, aiming to foster competition and innovation in the financial services sector, which is precisely what fintech executives and U.S. crypto firms are pushing for.

When early participation is strong, it usually translates into built-in demand, as early buyers look ahead to gains while new entrants hurry to join before the price climbs further. Cold Wallet is reflecting that momentum. With over $6 million already secured in presale funding, Stage 17 is active at $0.00998 per CWT, and the signals point to a launch filled with significant attention. Looking ahead to its $0.3517 listing, the price difference leaves substantial room for growth, positioning Cold Wallet as one of the best picks for future adoption. Growing Presale Interest Adds Pressure for Launch The pace of participation in Cold Wallet’s presale shows increasing energy, as both retail buyers and private groups contribute to consistent daily activity. This kind of engagement is more than a passing number; it builds lasting demand as launch day approaches. The reasoning is clear: the more coins secured during presale, the fewer available when trading begins, leading to scarcity. This often sparks stronger buying interest, especially when the listing price is far above presale levels. At $0.00998 in Stage 17 versus the $0.3517 launch target, early holders see a sizable upside that appeals to both steady holders and short-term market players. Such a wide gap usually builds anticipation, encouraging those who missed early rounds to buy at listing, amplifying demand further. This cycle of scarcity and anticipation is one reason Cold Wallet is being named among the most promising projects for future gains. Utility and Rewards Driving User Confidence Support for Cold Wallet goes beyond presale performance. The project tackles one of the most pressing challenges in crypto: fees. Its system of rewarding users with CWT for gas payments, swaps, and on/off-ramp activity creates ongoing reasons for engagement even after launch. This framework promotes active circulation and long-term holding, with higher balances unlocking greater cashback levels, reaching up to 100% gas fee returns at the top tier. By pairing rewards with actual utility, Cold Wallet reduces reliance on speculation alone. This helps maintain stability after initial hype fades. A project tied to a practical product with steady users has the strength to hold value and maintain trading activity. This durability supports the view of Cold Wallet as one of the standout options for future adoption, since its design keeps relevance alive well past its debut. Presale Setup Encourages Early Participation The way Cold Wallet has organized its crypto presale adds to its steady momentum. Spanning 150 stages with gradual price increases, the setup motivates early action and builds urgency before each step upward. With Stage 17 active and over $6 million raised, the buying pace is expected to quicken as more participants take note of the narrowing window between the $0.00998 stage price and the $0.3517 listing. This layered presale also keeps the community engaged, as each milestone acts as a motivator for new buyers. When a presale reaches notable funding levels, interest from private groups often grows, adding more support. Combined with Cold Wallet’s referral program and rewards system, these mechanics strengthen its move from presale to exchange debut. For those looking ahead, this structure provides a strong case for Cold Wallet as one of the key projects to watch for future gains. Final Say Cold Wallet’s presale is progressing in a way that often precedes a successful exchange launch. With more than $6 million raised, Stage 17 priced at $0.00998, and a listing target of $0.3517, the potential upside is drawing attention from both individual and private market participants. Beyond funding, its model of cashback rewards, fee utility, and stage-based presale system signals continued activity after listing. While market results are never certain, the mix of scarcity, practical use, and engaged community positions Cold Wallet with a foundation that can drive both early and ongoing performance. For anyone tracking future growth opportunities, the current presale signals that Cold Wallet is one project worth watching closely.

Over the past year, the supply of USD Coin (USDC) in circulation expanded to $61.3 billion, marking a 90% increase. Revenue, including income from reserves, rose 53% year-over-year to reach $658 million. However, according to equity analysts at Mizuho Securities, investor sentiment toward the stock has cooled. The firm attributes this to a growing gap between Circle’s long-term projections for USDC growth and the actual market trajectory. Rising Costs and Competitive Pressures While USDC grew 6% quarter-to-date, Circle has previously set expectations for a 40% compound annual growth rate. This slower pace has raised concerns about whether the company can sustain its ambitious expansion targets. One area of concern highlighted by Mizuho is the rising cost of distributing USDC . The analysts noted that distribution expenses have climbed from 39% of the reserve pool in 2022 to 61% in 2024, with the second quarter figure reaching 64%. Higher costs can limit profit margins, especially if revenue growth slows. The analysts also pointed to increased competition following the introduction of the GENIUS Act, which could pave the way for more institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by market capitalization, is reportedly planning a return to US markets. The combination of regulatory shifts and heightened competition could put additional pressure on Circle’s market position. Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Outlook Circle’s earnings are also heavily influenced by US interest rates. With the US Labor Department reporting a 2.7% year-over-year increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July, slightly below market expectations, speculation has grown that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the near term. Mizuho noted that while lower inflation is positive for the broader economy , it could weigh on Circle’s earnings, which benefit from higher interest rates on its reserves. In their client note, Mizuho estimated Circle’s 2027 EBITDA below consensus levels, applying a market multiple of 23x, in line with peers such as Visa, Coinbase, and Robinhood, to arrive at a price target of $84 per share. Their bear case scenario, which assumes slower USDC growth at a 15% CAGR and lower interest rates, projects a potential decline to $40 per share. Circle’s performance over the next several quarters will likely depend on how effectively it can address rising costs, navigate a competitive stablecoin environment, and adapt to changes in interest rate policy. For now, the company remains one of the largest players in the stablecoin market , but the balance between growth, cost efficiency, and market share retention appears increasingly critical for its medium-term trajectory.

As of press time, BTC is trading at $118,336, representing a weekly loss of 1.9% and a 4.5% decline from its peak. The price shift comes amid notable on-chain developments that have caught the attention of market analysts. According to CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain, the Bitcoin Exchange Whale Ratio across all exchanges has risen above 0.50, a level historically associated with higher short-term volatility. This ratio measures the proportion of BTC inflows to exchanges originating from large holders, often signaling potential market-moving activity. Despite this, aggregated data across all exchanges shows negative net flows, meaning more BTC is leaving exchanges than entering, which typically aligns with accumulation phases. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Don’t Expect Volatility: Contrarian Signal Brewing? Bitcoin Binance Activity Diverges From Broader Market Trends While overall exchange flows suggest accumulation, Binance has seen a contrasting pattern. Data from CryptoOnchain shows Binance recorded its largest single-day positive net flow in the past 12 months, indicating a concentration of BTC inflows to the platform. Such divergences, when high whale ratios coincide with significant inflows to one exchange, have historically preceded both sharp sell-offs and leveraged short squeezes, depending on whether the inflows are directed toward spot selling or derivatives trading. This activity has been accompanied by a surge in Binance’s BTC spot trading volume, which reached $7 billion in a single day, according to a separate analysis by Amr Taha of CryptoQuant. The spike in volume may reflect a shift in trader positioning, potentially influenced by institutional trades or broader macroeconomic factors. Additionally, short-term holder (STH) inflows to Binance have crossed the 0.4 threshold on the Spent Output Age Bands metric, a level often associated with retail-driven sell activity. Historically, retail participants have tended to sell into strength during bullish market phases, providing liquidity for more sophisticated traders. Whale Behavior Points to Lower Immediate Selling Pressure In contrast to heightened retail activity, the inflows from large holders, categorized as whales (1,000–10,000 BTC) and humpbacks, remain relatively low. Current whale inflows stand at 1,170 BTC, significantly below the 14,610 BTC recorded on July 19, which coincided with a notable price drop. The absence of similar large-scale selling now suggests a reduction in immediate downside risk, though market conditions remain dependent on other factors such as derivatives positioning and macroeconomic developments. The interaction between whale behavior, retail participation, and exchange-specific flows highlights the current complexity of Bitcoin’s market structure. While the broader trend of net outflows from exchanges supports a longer-term bullish outlook, the elevated whale ratio and concentrated inflows to Binance increase the likelihood of short-term volatility. Analysts recommend close monitoring of Binance’s order book, open interest, and funding rates over the coming sessions to better understand potential price direction. With Bitcoin hovering just below the $120,000 mark, the next few trading days will be critical in determining whether the market stabilizes or sees further corrective moves.

This Presale Altcoin Could Deliver 200x Before DOGE Hits That Target,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/dogecoin-to-1-this-presale-altcoin-could-deliver-200x-before-doge-hits-that-target/,"Dogecoin’s $1 dream is alive—but not guaranteed—according to top analysts tracking market cycles, liquidity, and Ethereum’s breakout levels. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is eyeing a staggering 220x move before DOGE even gets close to that benchmark. The Roadblocks Holding Back DOGE’s $1 Ambition Crypto analyst VisionPulsed warns that Dogecoin’s push to the long-awaited $1 mark hinges on a perfect alignment of macro and market factors that hasn’t yet occurred. Key among them is Ethereum breaking decisively above its 2021 all-time high, a milestone that would confirm a fresh bull market. He also points to the Bitcoin halving cycle’s 486-day inflection window—landing around August 18, 2025—and the need for global M2 liquidity to remain supportive. DOGE’s price action shows choppy accumulation rather than a sustained uptrend, with topping-tail candles hinting at possible pullbacks. While short-term swings to $0.30 are possible, VisionPulsed stresses that without the multi-asset alignment he outlines, DOGE’s parabolic run will remain out of reach. The Case for DOGE Hitting $1 This Cycle Not all analysts are cautious. KrissPax argues that Dogecoin’s historical 4-year cycle pattern supports a rally toward $1 this fall—possibly even $2 if gains mirror its 2017 arc. Bullish technical setups, such as a confirmed crossover and flag breakouts, add weight to this view. DOGE is currently rebounding from sub-$0.20 levels, trading above $0.23 and aiming for $0.27–$0.30 in the near term. Analysts like Ali Martinez and Trader Tardigrade see these formations as precursors to larger surges. Kevin Capital adds that sentiment and momentum indicators remain underdeveloped, suggesting DOGE’s biggest moves are still ahead—especially if macro conditions, such as a potential Fed rate cut in September, inject more liquidity into the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Targets 220x Gains Before DOGE Hits $1 While DOGE’s path to $1 remains uncertain, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning for potentially explosive gains—an estimated 220x—before Dogecoin even touches that mark. Currently in its presale phase, the project is built on a security-first DeFi framework with strong market buzz. Analysts tracking emerging tokens believe MAGACOIN could deliver outsized percentage returns compared to DOGE’s more mature price structure, making it a high-conviction play for speculators chasing early-cycle upside. Bottom Line Dogecoin’s $1 target remains a possibility—but hinges on rare macro alignments and Ethereum’s breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, is gearing up for a much larger percentage move in a shorter timeframe, potentially leaving DOGE in the dust when it comes to ROI potential.

Hedera (HBAR) is trading steadily near $0.25, with technical patterns hinting at a possible wave 3 move toward $0.40. Filecoin (FIL) has been far more volatile, swinging 7% in just 24 hours as it moved between $2.50 and $2.68. But the strongest spotlight is on BlockDAG (BDAG) , which has already raised over $374 million and sold more than 25.1 billion coins. Now past the halfway point to its $600M goal, it sits at $0.0276 per coin, aiming for a $0.05 listing and a long-term forecast of $5. That growth potential translates into possible returns exceeding 18,000%, making it one of the most closely watched projects right now. Hedera (HBAR) Price Performance Holds Its Ground Hedera’s price action is drawing attention after a recent dip to around $0.25, which analysts see as a prime accumulation area. Fibonacci and Elliott Wave analysis point to a potential wave 3 rally in a 5-wave bullish setup, targeting between $0.31 and $0.397. Key demand sits between $0.258 and $0.288, suggesting strong buying interest. The price has also reclaimed the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $0.2736, signaling stability ahead of another possible push higher. If the current technical structure stays in place, Hedera could climb to $0.3512, with a chance to extend toward $0.40 in the coming weeks. RSI and stochastic indicators are leaning positive, supporting the case for a breakout that could draw even more attention to the asset’s short-term potential. Filecoin (FIL) Price Action Brings a 7% Range in 24 Hours Sharp swings have marked Filecoin’s market performance over the past day. FIL touched a high of $2.68 before sliding to $2.49 by midday on Aug. 11. This move came with heavy volume of 8.88 million at the 12:00 hour, reinforcing strong support at $2.49. Resistance remains at $2.68, where trades hit 3.80 million units. By the end of the session, the price recovered part of its drop, sitting near $2.56, about 2% down on the day. The rebound matched a 1.1% rise in the Coindesk 20 index. Volume spiked again during recovery, peaking at 78,053 units, hinting at renewed buying interest. This activity suggests Filecoin could soon make another attempt to challenge the upper end of its trading range. BlockDAG’s $374M Momentum Could Drive the $5 Projection BlockDAG is moving quickly toward its $600 million presale target, with more than $374 million already raised and over 25.1 billion coins sold. The current Batch 29 price is $0.0276, still under the $0.05 listing value, giving an increasingly narrow entry window. From Batch 1 to now, the coin’s price has risen 2,660%. Projections place it at $1 in the near term, offering a possible 3,522% ROI, while longer-term estimates suggest $5 or even higher. The scale of progress goes beyond sales. The network is set to launch with more than 2.5 million users on the X1 Miner app and over 19,250 miners sold, generating $7.8M in additional sales. It also boasts more than 200,000 holders and 4,500 developers preparing over 300 web3 projects to go live on its infrastructure. BlockDAG’s hybrid blockchain and DAG framework supports speeds of up to 15,000 transactions per second, using dual consensus to balance speed and security. A built-in dashboard allows real-time engagement, while confirmed listings on 20 exchanges will ensure immediate liquidity after launch. Each batch sold reduces the available supply at current prices, and as milestones are hit, entry points will keep shrinking. With this pace, the gap between today’s price and the $5 projection could close faster than expected, leaving latecomers watching from the sidelines. Final Takeaway This week’s market updates highlight three different stories. Hedera’s price is holding at key levels, showing technical signs that could lead to a bullish breakout. Filecoin’s price action continues to deliver fast moves, creating openings for active traders willing to ride short bursts of volatility. Then there’s BlockDAG, which is combining record presale numbers with a network that is already built to operate at scale. With $374 million secured, over 25.1 billion coins sold, and infrastructure ready to support large-scale adoption, it has the framework to meet, and possibly surpass, its $5 target. Together, these projects form a mix of steady growth, market action, and ambitious expansion that keeps them firmly among the top trending crypto names to watch right now.

The Peter Thiel-backed exchange is joining industry counterparts in a growing list of crypto corporations that are gaining access to traditional stock markets and indexes. Star Premiere The digital assets exchange Bullish rang the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) opening bell earlier this week, signaling a successful initial public offering (IPO) and its launch as a publicly traded company with the ticker BLSH. The stock’s opening price was $90, and it reached a high of $118 before adjusting to $68, which is also the price as of press time, according to Google Finance. Source: Google Finance The initial valuation aimed at an opening stock price of $28 to 31$, which represents a 190% increase from the highest target price, making their second attempt at going public one of the most successful IPO’s for the year. The company managed to raise $1.1 billion in the offering, compared to the initial target of $629.3 million by selling 20.3M shares. Bullish’s notable IPO adds it to a growing list of trading companies that have gone public, with a recent example being eToro. This exchange platform joined the stock exchange in May, reaching a valuation of approximately $4.2 billion. Only one other crypto exchange has gone public to date, and that’s Coinbase, which joined the NASDAQ with a hefty valuation of $85.8 billion in April 2021. The conditions for this public debut were, to say the least, accommodating, with crypto-friendly legislation from the White House, growing investor and institutional confidence, and a steady stream of capital flowing towards crypto assets and various financial instruments that have surfaced from them. Crypto Peers in The Public Space Apart from exchanges, other crypto institutions have also listed on public exchanges, highlighting the ever-increasing adoption levels of companies in the digital assets space. BitFuFu Inc., a Bitcoin mining company, completed a SPAC merger with Arisz Acquisition Corp. and joined the NASDAQ in March 2024, with the combination valued at $1.5 billion. The issuer of the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, Circle, raised $1.1 billion in its IPO, which valued the company at $6.9 billion when it listed on the NYSE.

This move has traders thinking of the coin’s historic rallies. BNB is now trading at $799.88, sitting well above the old resistance near $650. The breakout came from a strong upward channel that has been intact since 2018. In the last major rally between 2020 and 2021, BNB gained more than 1,360%. The current setup has a similar look. The breakout zone was around $490 to $500, and price action since then has been solid. Support is sitting in the $250 to $300 zone. A drop below this would hurt the bullish case, but so far the price is holding above the breakout. Traders expect consolidation at early targets before a possible move higher. The pattern is similar to past parabolic runs in BNB’s history. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws BNB-Level Hype MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing the kind of buzz that once belonged to BNB — with analysts eyeing a 450x upside in the same cycle. The token has been gaining attention during its presale as traders look for the next breakout story. Its community growth has been steady and early buyers are positioning before a potential exchange listing. Many compare the current sentiment around MAGA to the excitement that fueled early BNB rallies. With its market interest climbing, MAGACOIN FINANCE could surprise the market with massive gains if momentum continues. For BNB, the technical picture is clear. Price has broken out and is now in a zone where big moves can happen fast. Traders know the history and they are watching for repeat patterns. The fact that the breakout came after years of sideways movement makes the setup even more compelling. BNB’s rally potential toward $1,800 is realistic if the market holds its current strength. A push past that could open the door to the higher targets on the chart. Short-term pullbacks are expected, but they are part of a healthy trend. Conclusion BNB has the technical setup for a powerful run toward its $1,800 target, with history suggesting even higher levels could be reached. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building its own momentum, attracting early investors who believe it could be the next big winner. Whether it’s the established strength of BNB or the explosive potential of MAGA, traders have plenty to watch as this cycle unfolds.

Bessent posted on X that the government will use forfeited Bitcoin as the base for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Trump created in his March Executive Order. Treasury plans budget-neutral purchases to grow Bitcoin reserve U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the Treasury wants to add more Bitcoin to the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve without using new taxpayer money or compromising its financial responsibility. More acquisitions would increase government holdings and improve national influence in international cryptocurrency markets. The U.S. could stand out as a model for other countries exploring cryptocurrency adoption by holding and increasing Bitcoin reserves. Treasury officials could use previously forfeited assets, reallocate existing resources, or employ other creative financial mechanisms that do not burden taxpayers to acquire more Bitcoin without drawing new funds from Congress. This careful approach highlights how government agencies are learning to operate in a fast-moving and complex digital market by balancing between growing the reserve to meet strategic goals and protecting the public’s financial interests. Analysts believe budget-neutral pathways can strengthen the reserve over time and create a more stable foundation for future growth by allowing the government to respond to market fluctuations and seize opportunities when they arise. The announcement shows how quickly government policy on digital assets can change because it comes just a day after Bessent had said that the U.S. would not purchase Bitcoin. Given Bitcoin’s volatility and the high stakes involved in managing a national digital asset reserve, this shift reassures investors that any acquisitions will be conducted with careful planning and clear intent. Strategic reserve holds forfeited Bitcoin under Trump’s order The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was officially created through President Trump’s March Executive Order to establish a formal structure for managing digital assets within the U.S. Treasury by holding only Bitcoin forfeited to the federal government. The administration aimed to ensure that the funds were accounted for and separated from other digital or traditional financial assets by creating a clear and controlled mechanism for storing and potentially using government-held Bitcoin. Treasury officials previously estimated that the Strategic Reserve contained between $15 billion and $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, all of which came from seized funds . The reserve’s focus on Bitcoin shows the coin’s status as the most widely recognized digital asset and the administration’s goal of establishing a strong foundation for the country’s strategic digital holdings. The reserve remains primarily focused on Bitcoin, although the Trump administration considered an initiative to add other digital assets, such as Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano, as part of an expanded digital asset strategy. Though specific plans have not yet been disclosed, White House crypto advisor David Sacks said Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would have to look for ways to look for ways to add more Bitcoin to the reserve. This cautious approach ensures new acquisitions do not require additional taxpayer funding and are implemented in a controlled and transparent by prioritizing financial responsibility and careful planning. Bitcoin is trading around $119,000 from $124,000 after Bessent’s announcement, which shows that even though the announcement was from a policy perspective, investors are cautious and waiting to see how this will turn out.

The excitement surrounding a potential Altcoin Season is building rapidly, and a recent, highly anticipated report from leading crypto exchange Coinbase is fueling this optimism. It’s time to dive into their positive forecast and understand what this could mean for your portfolio. What’s Driving the Coinbase Altcoin Season Forecast? Coinbase recently released a significant report on its official website, aptly titled “Monthly Outlook: Altcoin Season Cometh.” This detailed analysis projects a very positive outlook for the third quarter of this year, with a strong expectation for a full-scale Altcoin Season to commence as early as September. This forecast is certainly grabbing the attention of investors worldwide. For those new to the concept, an Altcoin Season isn’t just a casual term. It defines a specific period where at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins, ranked by market capitalization, consistently outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day timeframe. This phenomenon signifies a broad shift in capital, as investors diversify beyond Bitcoin into a wider array of digital assets. Understanding the Bitcoin Dominance Shift: A Key Indicator A crucial metric supporting Coinbase’s optimistic view is the noticeable Bitcoin Dominance Shift . Bitcoin’s market dominance, which stood at a commanding 65% in May, has now seen a notable dip to approximately 59%. This decline is often interpreted as an early signal of capital rotation, suggesting that funds are moving out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. While this shift is promising, it’s important to note the current state of the Altcoin Season Index. According to CoinMarketCap data, the index currently registers at 40. This figure is still considerably below the historical threshold of 75 that traditionally signals a full-fledged altcoin season. However, the trajectory is positive, indicating that conditions are evolving favorably for the broader Altcoin Market Cap to rise. Macroeconomic Factors and Liquidity: Fueling the Crypto Market Outlook Coinbase’s report isn’t solely focused on on-chain metrics; it also emphasizes the significant role of macroeconomic factors. The exchange maintains an unchanged outlook for a substantial increase in global liquidity. This anticipated influx of capital is vital, as it provides the necessary impetus for growth across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. The report highlights several compelling points: The overall Altcoin Market Cap is climbing, indicating growing investor interest and confidence in these assets. Early positive signals from the Altcoin Season Index suggest a brewing momentum. Coinbase firmly believes that “conditions are setting up for a potential rotation into a more mature altcoin season as we head into September.” This statement reinforces their conviction in the impending market shift. This combination of declining Bitcoin dominance, a rising altcoin market cap, and an optimistic macroeconomic outlook paints a compelling picture. It suggests that the stage is indeed being set for altcoins to potentially experience significant growth, offering exciting prospects for traders and investors alike. Preparing for the Potential Altcoin Season: What Should You Consider? As we approach September, understanding how to navigate a potential Altcoin Season becomes crucial. While the opportunities can be substantial, it’s also important to remember the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Diversification, thorough research, and a clear understanding of your risk tolerance are paramount. Consider: Researching Promising Projects: Look beyond the top 10 and explore projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Monitoring Market Trends: Keep a close eye on the Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin dominance to confirm the ongoing shift. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect your capital. The anticipation around this period is palpable, driven by strong signals from reputable sources like Coinbase. Being prepared can help you potentially capitalize on the opportunities that may arise. In conclusion, Coinbase’s latest report provides a robust and optimistic forecast for an upcoming Altcoin Season . The confluence of a noticeable Bitcoin Dominance Shift , early positive movements in the Altcoin Season Index, and a favorable macroeconomic liquidity outlook collectively paint a promising picture. While no market movement is guaranteed, the signals suggest that altcoins could indeed be poised for a period of significant outperformance starting in September. For crypto enthusiasts, keeping a keen eye on these developments will be key to navigating the exciting months ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is an Altcoin Season? A1: An Altcoin Season is a period where at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins by market capitalization outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. It signifies a broad market shift where capital flows from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies. Q2: How does Bitcoin dominance relate to an Altcoin Season? A2: A decrease in Bitcoin dominance often precedes an Altcoin Season. When Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap falls, it suggests that investors are rotating their funds into altcoins, seeking higher potential gains. Q3: What is the Altcoin Season Index mentioned in the report? A3: The Altcoin Season Index is a metric, often tracked by sites like CoinMarketCap, that measures the percentage of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. A score of 75 or higher typically indicates a full-fledged altcoin season. Q4: Why is Coinbase predicting an Altcoin Season now? A4: Coinbase’s prediction is based on a combination of factors, including a recent dip in Bitcoin dominance, early positive signals from the Altcoin Season Index, and an optimistic macroeconomic outlook regarding increased market liquidity. Q5: What are the main risks of investing during an Altcoin Season? A5: While opportunities are abundant, altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. Risks include rapid price fluctuations, potential for project failures, and the need for thorough research to identify legitimate projects. Always manage your risk effectively.

This movement has raised suspicions of a potential security breach. BtcTurk Suspends Crypto Withdrawals, Deposits According to an X post by blockchain security entity Cyvers Alerts, outflows of over $48 million in cryptocurrencies were detected in “unusual activity” across multiple blockchain networks involving the Turkish exchange BtcTurk. Cyvers Alerts noted that their system flagged alerts from blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Arbitrum (ARB), BASE, Optimism (OP), Mantle (MANTLE), and Polygon (MATIC). Most of the transferred funds were deposited into two addresses. The firm added: The attacker has completed the transfers and begun swapping assets. We’ve contacted the team, who are taking immediate action. Withdrawals and deposits are currently suspended. In a separate X post , BtcTurk confirmed unusual activity in their hot wallets. The exchange stated that as a precaution, crypto withdrawals and deposits have been temporarily suspended. BtcTurk reassured users that the majority of their funds are securely stored in cold wallets. Despite the potential security breach, the exchange emphasized that users’ funds remain safe due to its “robust financial structure.” The platform added that crypto buying and selling, as well as Turkish Lira deposit and withdrawal transactions, will continue without interruption. It confirmed that all necessary security measures have been implemented to safeguard user assets. It is worth recalling that last year, BtcTurk experienced a cyber attack that led to unauthorized access to some of its hot wallets. At that time, the exchange partnered with Binance to recover approximately $5.3 million in digital assets. Are Crypto Security Mechanisms Still Vulnerable? ​​Over the past year, several high-profile crypto exchange hacks have raised concerns about security. In September 2024, crypto exchange BingX suffered a major breach, resulting in the loss of nearly $43 million in digital assets. Earlier this year, Bybit experienced one of the industry’s largest hacks, with $1.4 billion stolen. The scale of the breach caused Ethereum (ETH) to drop as much as 5% immediately afterward. Similarly, leading Indian exchange CoinDCX was targeted last month in a $44 million hack. However, CEO Sumit Gupta clarified that all user wallet funds were safe and unaffected. The rising number of crypto exchange hacks – despite enhanced security measures – remains a concern for investors. These incidents also underscore the importance of cold storage wallets for individuals holding significant crypto assets. At press time, BTC trades at $119,253, down 2.1% in the past 24 hours.",Crypto News|Altcoin|Arbitrum|bitcoin|btc|BTCTurk|BTCUSDT|crypto|Crypto Security|Cryptocurrency|ETH|Ethereum|exchange hack,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|ETH|ARB|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 05:00:14

Dogecoin Whales Have Accumulated During The Past Week In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about the latest trend in the holdings of the Dogecoin whales. The metric shared by the analyst is the “Supply Distribution” from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, which tells us about the total amount of DOGE supply that a particular wallet group is holding right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Price Flips 200-WMA: What Happens Next? Addresses or investors are put into these cohorts based on the number of tokens that they are carrying in their balance. All wallets with 5 coins, for example, are placed into the 1 to 10 coins range. In the context of the current topic, the whales are the investors of interest. These entities are typically defined as holding between 100 million and 1 billion DOGE. At the current exchange rate, the former converts to $22.4 million and the latter to $224 million. Clearly, the only holders who would qualify for the group would be the big-money traders. As such, the holdings of these investors can be worth keeping an eye on, as if nothing else, shifts in the cohort can provide information about the sentiment among the network’s influential beings. Now, here is a chart that shows the the trend in the Dogecoin Supply Distribution for the whales over the last month and a half: As displayed in the above graph, the 100 million to 1 billion Dogecoin range has seen its Supply Distribution go through a rise recently, indicating that members of the group have been participating in net accumulation. In total, the whales have added 2 billion DOGE (worth $448 million) to their holdings over the past week. This is a notable amount and suggests that the large investors are expecting the cryptocurrency to go up from here. It only remains to be seen, however, whether this accumulation would pay off for them. Alongside the buying, the cohort has also ramped up transaction activity, as Martinez has pointed out in another X post. The indicator shown in the chart is the “Whale Transaction Count,” which measures the total number of transfers occurring on the Dogecoin blockchain that involve a sum greater than $1 million.

Some are cementing their role in core infrastructure, while others are breaking out as presale plays with massive ROI potential. Together, they highlight where opportunity lies for those positioned ahead of the next cycle. From reward-driven platforms to oracle powerhouses, scalable smart contract ecosystems, and DeFi-first projects, the variety of options is wide. Here we’ll break down four of the top altcoins to buy now, each with distinct strengths backed by performance metrics, integrations, and momentum. 1. Cold Wallet – Utility Meets Massive Presale Gap Cold Wallet is setting itself apart in Stage 17 of its 150-stage presale, priced at $0.00998 with a fixed launch value of $0.3517. That’s a projected 37× difference, while those who entered at the Stage 1 level of $0.007 could see up to 50× gains. Some projections even suggest higher multipliers as adoption accelerates, making this one of the clearest examples among the top altcoins to buy now. What makes Cold Wallet unique is its functionality. Instead of simply storing digital assets, it rewards users with cashback in CWT for transactions, gas fees, and swap activity, without requiring staking or lockups. This design brings real-world usability right from the start. The app is already live on both Android and iOS, with security audits underway by Hacken and CertiK, making it rare for a presale project to already have a working, audited product. Momentum received another boost with the $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet, instantly adding two million active users. On top of this, referral programs deliver USDT payouts now and CWT rewards later, ensuring steady participation. With $5.9 million raised and over 703 million CWT already sold, Cold Wallet isn’t just another presale; it’s entering the market with adoption, visibility through CoinMarketCap listings, and a fixed pricing model designed for significant upside. For those searching for the next major play, Cold Wallet makes a strong case as one of the top altcoins to buy now. 2. Chainlink (LINK) – The Data Leader LINK is currently priced around $23.38, trading between $21.07 and $24.55 intraday. Over the last week, it has surged more than 42%, hitting its highest levels since February. A key driver has been its collaboration with Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), bringing real-time forex and precious metals data on-chain through Chainlink Data Streams. The network’s Total Value Secured (TVS) has climbed to around $84–95 billion, more than doubling in a year. With whale accumulation on the rise and supply on exchanges falling nearly 10%, analysts are targeting $29–30 as the next milestone. LINK’s central role in DeFi and tokenized assets keeps it firmly in the discussion as one of the top altcoins to buy now. 3. Cardano (ADA) – Building Steady Momentum Cardano trades near $0.8486, up about 9% in the past day and showing weekly gains of 17–21%. Its market cap sits around $30 billion, with daily trading volumes in the $2–2.6 billion range. The push is fueled by consistent community support and progress on technical features such as the Midnight sidechain, which enhances privacy. While short-term forecasts suggest a minor 3–4% pullback, long-term projections remain optimistic. Some analysts expect ADA to climb toward $1.24, while others project gains of more than 120% if its technical structure holds. This steady development pace, combined with its large active base, makes ADA one of the top altcoins to buy now for those seeking both growth and stability. 4. Ethena (ENA) – Growth with DeFi Reach ENA is holding around $0.79–$0.80 after a sharp 18.9% jump earlier this week that brought it to $0.7304. It’s up roughly 40% in the past seven days and an impressive 150% over the past month. With over $10 billion in Total Value Locked across 23 blockchains via LayerZero, ENA has shown rapid integration into the DeFi ecosystem. Charts remain bullish, with firm support between $0.73–$0.75 and resistance zones at $0.85 and $1.00. If momentum holds, breakouts toward $0.96, $1.18, or even $1.25 are possible. Coupled with a 42% surge in futures volume to $4.35 billion, ENA is gaining both traction and liquidity, earning its place as one of the top altcoins to buy now. Final Word Cold Wallet, LINK, ADA, and ENA each bring different strengths to the table: Cold Wallet offers a crypto presale with rare utility and a huge ROI gap, LINK continues to dominate data infrastructure, ADA builds steadily on technical upgrades and community growth, and ENA shows what rapid DeFi adoption can look like. For those focusing on performance, adoption, and strong development pipelines, these aren’t just speculative plays, they’re examples of the top altcoins to buy now, each with the potential to drive the next phase of market growth.

Institutional demand for Ethereum has shifted into high gear. The ETF flows aren’t just about holding ETH – they’re a signal that big players are betting on long-term value. For traders, this kind of momentum feels like the starting gun for the next crypto run. Breaking Ethereum’s all-time high is looking more like a question of when rather than if. The excitement isn’t staying within Ethereum. The surge in institutional ETH buying is spilling over into smaller projects as traders hunt for the best altcoin to buy now. That’s where new and exciting names like MAGACOIN FINANCE start to appear on watchlists. Why the Ethereum ETF Story Matters On August 12, Ethereum ETFs recorded a daily net inflow of $523.92 million, following an even bigger $1.02 billion the day before, according to SoSo Value data. On-chain activity shows that BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale are snapping up ETH. Source: SoSo Value Ethereum’s market strength often has a ripple effect. Traders look to diversify into coins that might offer bigger percentage gains. While ETH might grind toward its all-time high, the best low-cap crypto to buy can deliver explosive moves in shorter windows. This is why Ethereum news often sparks renewed interest in altcoins. With large-scale ETH accumulation taking place, investors are widening their search, scanning for small-cap crypto projects that can ride the wave. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Rising Contender in the Altcoin Hunt The Ethereum ETF hype has spilled into MAGACOIN FINANCE. Traders are talking about it as the possible best altcoin to buy now in the lower market cap range. The hook is simple — when institutions fuel ETH’s momentum, altcoins that can capture attention in the same bullish window often see massive upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE has started popping up in conversations among those looking for the best low-cap crypto to buy before it gets noticed by the broader market. Positioned as a new entrant with breakout potential, it’s riding the sentiment shift created by the Ethereum rally. Final Take: Ethereum’s Rally is Spilling Over The Ethereum ETF rush has changed the tone of the market. From billion-dollar inflows to major funds accumulating ETH, the signals point to a bullish phase. That momentum isn’t stopping at Ethereum; it’s sparking a search for the next rocket among smaller coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of those names that traders mention when talking about the best low-cap crypto to buy. It’s a rising contender that’s benefiting from the same optimism driving ETH higher. While no one can guarantee where the market heads next, the combination of ETF-driven excitement and altcoin speculation makes this a space worth watching.

After passing a third-party audit and landing on CoinMarketCap (CMC), RUVI spiked into top-trending territory and accelerated its presale pace. Phase 2 is already past 85% at $0.015, with a programmed 33% move to $0.020 as Phase 3 begins and a final presale price of $0.070. With $2.9M raised, 230M tokens sold, and a holder base above 2,800, analysts are now floating a path toward a $1 evaluation if adoption keeps compounding. Why RUVI’s momentum is building fast $2.9M raised in presale 230M tokens sold 2,800+ holders and growing CyberScope audit completed (independent third party) CoinMarketCap listing boosting discovery and watchlists WEEX partnership to improve visibility and simplify trading Live leaderboard giveaway adding extra incentives This mix of traction, trust, and access is turning attention into allocations, exactly what early-stage investors look for when momentum starts to catch. CMC listing turned visibility into buy pressure CMC is where discovery becomes action. RUVI’s listing coincided with Phase 2 nearing completion, giving investors a clear, time-bound price ladder: $0.015 now, $0.020 in Phase 3 (+33%), and $0.070 after the presale concludes. That transparency compresses decision-making. Rather than guess entries, buyers can front-run the next bracket, one reason daily allocations are rising and RUVI is trending. Real utility: the creator-first AI super app RUVI isn’t a narrative-only token. Its super app streamlines the entire content workflow so creators and teams can produce more with fewer tools: Research real-time trends to spot high-demand topics Generate platform-ready scripts tuned to brand voice and channel Create images and videos natively, no app-hopping Automate planning, iteration, scheduling, and publishing Who benefits? YouTubers, TikTokers, agencies, brands, and lean teams that need speed, consistency, and lower tool costs. By linking token demand to real product usage, RUVI aligns with sustained AI adoption rather than short-lived hype. Credibility and access: audit plus exchange alignment Early participants want safeguards and liquidity routes. RUVI completed a CyberScope audit, adding independent validation to its smart contracts. The partnership with WEEX, a major exchange, supports visibility and smoother trading for token holders as liquidity builds. Together, these signals reduce friction for both retail participants and larger allocators. Presale milestones and near-term catalysts Phase 2 surpassed 85% at $0.015 Automatic 33% step to $0.020 in Phase 3 Final presale price fixed at $0.070 Programmed price steps create defined spreads and urgency. With CMC-fueled awareness compounding, waiting often means paying the next bracket’s price. That structure is part of why analysts see a credible path to a $1 evaluation if user growth and listings keep expanding after launch. Extra incentive: leaderboard giveaway and VIP tiers RUVI’s live leaderboard giveaway rewards top contributors with additional tokens, an added push as Phase 2 nears completion. For larger allocations, VIP tiers model outcomes at a hypothetical $1 token valuation: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These examples show how presale bonuses can magnify upside if adoption and liquidity continue to scale after the presale ends. Bottom line RUVI is converting top-trending attention into tangible allocations, backed by an independent audit, a CMC listing, and exchange alignment with WEEX. With $2.9M raised, 230M tokens sold, 2,800+ holders, and a clear price ladder to $0.020 in Phase 3 and $0.070 at presale close, the catalysts are lined up. If you’re seeking a high-growth AI play with real utility and time-bound momentum, RUVI deserves a spot on your shortlist before the next programmed price step.

SOL price is now consolidating above $190 and might aim for more gains above the $200 zone. SOL price started a fresh upward move above the $185 and $192 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $190 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $202 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could extend gains if it clears the $198 resistance zone. Solana Price Aims For Fresh Increase Solana price started a decent increase after it found support near the $185 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL climbed above the $192 level to enter a short-term positive zone. The price even smashed the $200 resistance. The bulls were able to push the price above the $202 barrier. A high was formed at $210 and the price recently corrected gains below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $174 swing low to the $210 high. There was a break below a bullish trend line with support at $202 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the bulls were active near the $188 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $174 swing low to the $210 high. Solana is now trading above $190 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $198 level. The next major resistance is near the $200 level. The main resistance could be $202. A successful close above the $202 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $210. Any more gains might send the price toward the $220 level. Another Decline In SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $200 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $192 zone. The first major support is near the $188 level. A break below the $188 level might send the price toward the $180 support zone. If there is a close below the $180 support, the price could decline toward the $175 support in the near term.

This expiry event is slightly larger than last week’s , but it is still unlikely to be enough to influence spot markets, which have notched all-time highs in terms of market capitalization this week. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.90, meaning that there are almost as many long contracts expiring as shorts, and the bulls and bears are evenly matched. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has surged to almost $3.2 billion at this strike price on Deribit . There is also around $2.4 billion OI at $120,000 strike price as the bull speculators load up on contracts and dwindling OI for lower strike prices. Additionally, total Bitcoin futures OI currently stands at $83.3 billion, which is near record highs, according to CoinGlass. Greeks Live, a crypto derivatives provider, said this week that the group was predominantly bullish, “with strong momentum in both BTC and ETH, with traders actively selling puts and holding long positions that are deeply in profit.” “Key sentiment revolves around continued put selling strategies and excitement about ETH’s exceptional performance, though some concern exists about high volatility levels.” Greeks added that trading volume shows the market’s enthusiasm for trading as Deribit traded $10.9 billion in options on Thursday, breaking the $10 billion mark for the first time in a single day. As BTC hit a new all-time high and ETH neared its all-time high, the market experienced an unexpected correction, primarily triggered by an unexpectedly strong PPI reading.

This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $6.1 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization hit an all-time high of $4.25 trillion this week, but it is still smaller than America’s largest corporation, Nvidia, and just 18% of gold’s total market cap of nearly $23 trillion. However, markets had started to cool off by Friday, with total cap dropping 4% to $4.1 trillion at the time of writing. Bitcoin led the losses, falling 3.8% to below $118,000, but managed to regain a little composure during the Friday morning Asian session as it nudged back toward $119,000. Ethereum also cooled from recent four-year highs, sliding below $4,500 on Thursday before recovering to trade at $4,630 on Friday morning.

The financial institution uses the equity asymmetry framework to measure stocks based on the market environment and the latest economic data.

Goldman Sachs analysts said they mirrored the spike in drawdown to the previous spike seen during the S&P 500’s rally in January. The bank’s equity asymmetry framework showed a higher chance of a drawdown before President Trump announced his flurry of tariffs on April 2. At the time, the S&P 500 followed a historic sell-off as forecasted by the analysts. “The equity drawdown probability is elevated and has increased recently. Usually levels above 30% give a signal for downside risk to equities, and current levels are nearing those.” -David Kostin, Chief U.S. Equity Strategist in Goldman Sachs Research. The financial institution also attributed two main reasons as to why its model was indicating an elevated risk of a downturn. It noted that market volatility was low. The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) plummeted by more than 70% from its peak on Liberation Day. Goldman Sachs analysts also noted that the economy is slowing. They argued that the momentum of the economy needs to remain strong for stocks to thrive in a low-volatility environment. They also concluded that it seemed unlikely due to the heightened risks stemming from U.S. tariffs. The bank’s analysts also pointed to recent weakness in the job market as an indicator of a weaker economy. The U.S. has added fewer jobs than expected in recent months. Goldman Sachs analysts expect a spike in inflation in H2 Goldman Sachs expects inflation to rise in the second half of the year due to the continued uncertainty of Trump’s trade policies. David Mericle, the chief U.S. economist at the bank, mentioned on Wednesday that he expects inflation to surge above 3% as the effects of U.S. levies begin to materialize. The bank has been on high alert for signals of a coming correction as major U.S. indexes hover near all-time highs. The S&P’s 500 has surged 10% YTD and 29% since its post-Liberation Day low. The analysts believe that rising inflation could trigger more Fed easing. They argued that central bank easing could come with more equity volatility in the event of growth concerns, especially if it disappoints already dovish expectations. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan , Wednesday’s inflation data for July came in 0.2% higher for the month and 2.7% from a year earlier. The data caused a spike in market expectations for Fed easing in the second half of the year. The CEM Group’s FedWatch tool showed higher probabilities for interest rate cuts at the three upcoming Federal Reserve meetings for 2025. At the time, the tool showed a more than 98% chance of a 50-basis-point cut in the September meeting. Thursday’s producer prices showed the quickest rise in three years in July amid a surge in the costs of goods and services, which immediately wiped out expectations of a rate cut. The data pointed to a rise in inflationary pressure, which poses a dilemma for the U.S. central bank. CME’s FedWatch tool indicated a slight pullback in the chances of a 25-basis-point cut by the Fed, currently at 93.1%.

The move saw over $1 billion in market-wide liquidations and record intraday selling volume, testing critical institutional support near $3.05. Despite the drop, late-session buying hints at renewed accumulation from large holders as selling pressure eased. News Background Market-wide liquidations exceeded $1 billion, amplifying downside pressure across major cryptocurrencies. XRP’s selloff coincided with a midday capitulation event, with volume reaching 436.98 million units — one of the largest single-hour prints this quarter. Ripple’s CTO reiterated the XRP Ledger’s readiness for global financial infrastructure use, offering fundamental support amid technical weakness. Broader crypto market declines aligned with profit-taking in U.S. equities, shifting risk sentiment to the downside. Price Action Summary XRP dropped from $3.34 to $3.10 in the 24 hours from Aug. 14 03:00 to Aug. 15 02:00 (-7.19%). Session range spanned $3.34 to $3.05, a $0.29 move representing 8.69% volatility. The steepest decline occurred at 12:00, with price falling from $3.22 to $3.09 on heavy volume. Following the drop, XRP traded in a narrow $3.05–$3.13 band, signaling reduced sell-side momentum. Late-session trading saw price recover from $3.09 to $3.10, breaking back above immediate resistance. Technical Analysis Support confirmed between $3.05–$3.09 on multiple retests during high-volume selling. Resistance now sits at $3.13, with secondary resistance at $3.20. Declining volume after the midday spike suggests liquidation exhaustion. Final 60 minutes saw two notable volume surges — 4.53M and 3.76M — confirming institutional interest at support. Recovery above $3.10 in low-liquidity conditions may indicate early-stage re-accumulation. What Traders Are Watching Follow-through buying above $3.13 to confirm short-term reversal. Large-holder wallet activity for signs of renewed accumulation. Whether $3.05 holds during the next wave of market-wide volatility. Funding rate shifts in XRP derivatives markets that could signal leverage re-entry.

The global financial landscape, particularly the movements within the Asia FX markets, directly influences investor sentiment, capital flows, and ultimately, the risk appetite that often spills over into digital assets. Recently, a notable shift has been observed: Asian currencies are largely subdued, while the Japanese Yen has shown surprising strength. What’s driving these divergent paths, and how do evolving Fed Rate Bets play a pivotal role in this complex dance? Why is Asia FX Feeling the Chill? The general sentiment across Asian foreign exchange markets has been described as tepid, reflecting a cautious approach by investors. This subdued performance in Asia FX is influenced by a confluence of factors, primarily the strength of the US dollar and concerns about capital outflows from emerging markets. Many Asian economies are grappling with their own inflation pressures and the delicate balance of maintaining economic growth while managing currency stability. The term ‘tepid’ suggests a lack of strong directional momentum, neither robust appreciation nor sharp depreciation across the board for most regional currencies. This stands in contrast to periods of strong growth or significant capital inflows. Several factors contribute to this subdued state: US Dollar Strength: A robust US dollar, often fueled by higher interest rate differentials, makes other currencies relatively less attractive. Capital Outflow Concerns: As global interest rates rise, particularly in developed economies, investors may pull capital from riskier emerging markets in Asia, seeking higher yields or safer havens. Regional Economic Data: While some economies show resilience, others face headwinds from global trade slowdowns or domestic challenges, contributing to a mixed economic outlook across the continent. Monetary Policy Divergence: Asian central banks are navigating different stages of their monetary policy cycles compared to the Federal Reserve, creating varied impacts on their respective currencies. For instance, currencies like the Korean Won, Chinese Yuan, and Indian Rupee have largely traded within tight ranges or shown modest depreciation against the dollar, reflecting these underlying pressures. This environment necessitates careful observation for anyone tracking Global Markets , as subtle shifts can have significant implications. The Federal Reserve’s Shadow: How Do Shifting Fed Rate Bets Impact Currencies? A significant driver behind the current state of Asia FX and indeed, Global Markets , is the evolving expectation around the Federal Reserve’s interest rate policy. Recent strong US Economic Data , particularly on inflation and employment, has led to a reduction in market expectations for aggressive Fed rate cuts in the near future. This ‘higher-for-longer’ interest rate narrative for the US dollar has profound implications globally. When the Federal Reserve maintains higher interest rates, it makes dollar-denominated assets more appealing to international investors. This increases demand for the US dollar, causing it to strengthen against other currencies. For Asian economies, a stronger dollar can: Increase Import Costs: Making dollar-denominated imports, especially commodities like oil, more expensive for countries that rely on them. Heighten Debt Servicing Costs: For governments and corporations with dollar-denominated debt, a stronger dollar means higher local currency costs to service these debts. Trigger Capital Outflows: Investors might reallocate funds from Asian markets to the US to capture better risk-adjusted returns, putting downward pressure on Asian currencies. The reduction in Fed Rate Bets implies that the market is now pricing in fewer rate cuts, or even later rate cuts, than previously anticipated. This adjustment by traders and institutions sends ripples through bond yields, equity markets, and especially currency valuations worldwide, affecting everything from trade balances to investment flows. The Astonishing Ascent of the Japanese Yen: A Closer Look Amidst the general tepidness in Asia FX , the Japanese Yen has emerged as a standout performer, showcasing an astonishing rise. This notable strength is primarily attributed to Japan’s surprisingly robust Q2 GDP figures. While the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy for an extended period, the strong economic growth data has sparked speculation about a potential shift in their stance. Japan’s Q2 GDP exceeded market expectations, driven by strong domestic demand and a rebound in capital expenditure. This economic vitality suggests that the Japanese economy might be gaining momentum, potentially allowing the BoJ to consider normalizing its monetary policy sooner than previously thought. Even subtle hints or market speculation about a future interest rate hike from the BoJ can significantly boost the Yen, as it would narrow the yield differential with other major currencies, particularly the US dollar. Furthermore, the Japanese Yen often acts as a safe-haven currency during periods of global economic uncertainty or market volatility. When investors seek stability, they tend to flock to assets perceived as low-risk, and the Yen frequently benefits from this flight to safety. This dual dynamic—strong domestic Economic Data hinting at policy shifts and its traditional safe-haven appeal—has propelled the Yen’s recent appreciation, making it a compelling outlier in the current Global Markets landscape. Ripple Effects Across Global Markets: What’s the Broader Impact? The dynamics playing out in Asia FX and the contrasting performance of the Japanese Yen , all under the influence of shifting Fed Rate Bets , have far-reaching implications for Global Markets . These currency movements are not isolated; they create ripple effects across various asset classes, influencing investment decisions and economic stability worldwide. For equity markets, a stronger US dollar can pressure multinational companies with significant overseas earnings, as those earnings translate into fewer dollars. Conversely, export-oriented economies in Asia might face headwinds if their currencies strengthen too much, making their goods more expensive abroad. Bond markets react to interest rate differentials, with capital flowing towards higher-yielding government bonds, potentially impacting borrowing costs for nations. In the commodity markets, a stronger dollar typically makes dollar-denominated commodities like oil and gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially dampening demand. The interconnectedness of these financial systems means that a significant shift in one area, such as currency valuations, can trigger a chain reaction across others. Investors, including those in the crypto space, must monitor these macro trends closely, as shifts in traditional asset classes can influence risk appetite and capital allocation towards digital assets. The Crucial Role of Economic Data in Market Dynamics At the heart of market movements and central bank decisions lies Economic Data . The recent strength of the Japanese Yen , for instance, was directly linked to robust Q2 GDP figures. This highlights how critical data releases are in shaping market sentiment and influencing policy expectations. Central banks, including the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, adopt a ‘data-dependent’ approach, meaning their policy decisions are heavily influenced by incoming economic indicators. Key economic data points that traders and institutions scrutinize include: Inflation Reports: Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) provide insights into price pressures, directly impacting interest rate expectations. Employment Figures: Non-farm payrolls, unemployment rates, and wage growth indicate the health of the labor market and consumer spending capacity. Gross Domestic Product (GDP): A broad measure of economic activity, indicating the pace of economic growth or contraction. Retail Sales: A gauge of consumer spending, a significant component of many economies. Manufacturing and Services PMIs: Leading indicators of economic activity in key sectors. The market’s reaction to these data points can be swift and significant. A strong inflation report might lead to expectations of tighter monetary policy, strengthening the associated currency, while weak growth data could prompt expectations of easing. Understanding this relationship is fundamental for anyone looking to navigate the complexities of Global Markets and make informed investment decisions. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors in the Current Climate The current global economic landscape, marked by subdued Asia FX and a rising Japanese Yen amidst shifting Fed Rate Bets , presents both challenges and opportunities for investors across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Divergent monetary policies and uncertain economic outlooks can lead to heightened currency and market volatility, making it harder to predict movements. Policy Divergence Risk: The differing paths of central banks can create significant interest rate differentials, influencing capital flows and making some markets more susceptible to external shocks. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical tensions can amplify market uncertainty, leading to sudden shifts in investor sentiment and safe-haven flows. Opportunities: Strategic Positioning: For sophisticated investors, understanding these dynamics can open opportunities for strategic positioning in currencies, bonds, and equities. Diversification: The varying performance of currencies can underscore the importance of diversification across different geographical regions and asset classes to mitigate risk. Hedging Strategies: Businesses and investors with international exposures can explore hedging strategies to protect against adverse currency movements. For cryptocurrency investors, these macro trends are vital. A stronger US dollar, often a result of reduced Fed Rate Bets , can sometimes exert downward pressure on riskier assets like crypto. Conversely, a weakening dollar or a search for alternative stores of value in times of traditional market uncertainty could provide support. Monitoring the interplay between Economic Data , central bank actions, and currency markets is key to understanding broader market sentiment and its potential spillover into digital assets. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Tepid Waters To effectively navigate the current global financial landscape, marked by subdued Asia FX and the strong Japanese Yen , investors should consider several actionable insights: Monitor Central Bank Communications Closely: Pay keen attention to statements and speeches from the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan, and other major central banks. Their forward guidance on monetary policy is a critical determinant of currency movements. Track Key Economic Data Releases: Stay informed about upcoming Economic Data , particularly inflation, employment, and GDP reports from major economies. These releases often trigger significant market reactions. Understand Inter-Market Correlations: Recognize how currency movements correlate with other asset classes like equities, commodities, and bonds. A strong dollar, for example, can impact commodity prices and corporate earnings. Consider Diversification and Risk Management: In an environment of uncertainty, diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes and geographies can help mitigate risks. Employ robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-losses and managing position sizes. Assess Regional Nuances in Asia FX: While Asia FX may seem broadly tepid, understand that each currency has its unique drivers. Research specific economies and their local policy considerations. By staying informed and adopting a proactive approach, investors can better position themselves to respond to shifts in Global Markets and potentially capitalize on emerging opportunities, even amidst seemingly quiet periods for some currencies. In conclusion, the global currency landscape is a complex tapestry woven from diverse economic performances, central bank policies, and investor sentiment. While Asia FX broadly remains tepid, reflecting concerns over US dollar strength and reduced Fed Rate Bets , the Japanese Yen stands out with its astonishing rise, fueled by strong Q2 Economic Data . These dynamics underscore the interconnectedness of Global Markets and the crucial role that macroeconomic factors play in shaping investment opportunities and risks. For all investors, including those in the fast-paced crypto world, understanding these fundamental shifts is paramount for informed decision-making and navigating the evolving financial currents.

Banks argue that current regulation contains loopholes that could harm the financial system. The American Bankers Association (ABA) and 52 banking organizations expressed concerns about the law's interest payment, state regulations, and stablecoin issuance by non-financial companies in a letter sent to the Senate Banking Committee this week. Related News: Ripple Vice President Claims XRP Network is Fully Prepared for Future Technology The banks argued that while they supported the law prohibiting stablecoin issuers from paying interest to investors, the current text allows for this prohibition to be easily circumvented. The letter stated that exchanges, brokers, and affiliates could offer interest-like returns, transforming stablecoins from mere payment instruments into stores of value and credit mechanisms. “If deposits turn to stablecoins for interest, credit creation will decrease,” the letter stated, adding that the interest ban should also apply to digital asset exchanges, brokers, and other intermediaries. Banking institutions also noted that this regulatory gap could increase the risk of deposit outflows, especially during crisis periods, which would reduce the supply of credit, raise interest rates, and increase borrowing costs for businesses and households. *This is not investment advice.

While the tariffs aim to boost domestic manufacturing, critics warn they could raise equipment costs, weaken demand from US miners, and ultimately drive mining operations back overseas. American Bitcoin Expands with Bitmain Deal American Bitcoin, a Bitcoin mining company backed by members of US President Donald Trump’s family, exercised an option to acquire up to 17,280 application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) from Bitmain, which is one of the world’s leading crypto mining hardware manufacturers. Earlier this month, the company purchased 16,299 Antminer U3S21EXPH units, which deliver a combined computing power of 14.02 exahashes per second/ The deal was worth around $314 million, according to TheMinerMag . (Source: TheMinerMag ) The main goal of the agreement is to shield American Bitcoin from price hikes that could result from the Trump administration’s sweeping trade tariffs and import duties on China-made Bitmain equipment. In anticipation of these tariffs, Bitmain announced plans to open its first US-based ASIC production facility by the end of the year, as well as a new headquarters in either Florida or Texas. The trade restrictions are part of a push to reshore manufacturing, but they have introduced new strains across the Bitcoin mining supply chain. Miners and hardware producers are both being forced to adjust their strategies as they navigate the shifting economics brought on by the tariffs. Currently, over 99% of global Bitcoin mining hardware comes from three companies — Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan — with Bitmain holding a dominant 82% market share, according to the University of Cambridge . While the administration’s strategy is to bring production to US soil, it has attracted some mixed reactions. Mining hardware distribution by manufacturer (Source: University of Cambridge ) Critics argue that the tariffs could be inflationary and ultimately harm the domestic mining industry. Jaran Mellerud , CEO of Hashlabs, warned that higher equipment prices might crush demand from US miners, leaving manufacturers with excess inventory to offload abroad at lower prices. Such a shift could reverse the intended goal by pushing mining operations back overseas, and eroding the competitive position of US-based miners.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MINING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-15 05:30:00

The video was shared by crypto enthusiast Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), outlining a highly optimistic outlook for the digital asset following the final resolution of Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC and Ripple have withdrawn their respective appeals in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This closes a case that lasted for over five years. With this step, no further legal proceedings are pending between the regulator and the company, removing a significant overhang on the cryptocurrency. The analysts noted that during the height of the dispute, Ripple had signed over 1,700 non-disclosure agreements with companies and governments worldwide. Many of these entities may now be more willing to publicly announce partnerships or trials involving Ripple’s technology or the XRP Ledger (XRPL), potentially leading to a stream of new business updates.

Long term, it could reach $50 to $100 , depending on adoption and utility growth. They noted that XRP often follows broader crypto trends, with Bitcoin and Ethereum gains likely boosting investor interest in the asset. They cited a past 300% XRP rally in three weeks, suggesting similar surges remain possible, with legal clarity now providing a stronger foundation for decisive future price movements. Utility Over Speculation The discussion concluded with the assertion that XRP’s long-term potential rests on its functional advantages rather than speculative trading alone. The settlement now places the focus squarely on real-world adoption , institutional involvement, and Ripple’s ability to convert its extensive network of agreements into active, public partnerships. This shift will determine whether XRP can achieve the higher targets envisioned and potentially rival leading cryptocurrencies in terms of global utility.

In its August research outlook published Thursday, the exchange said the market has largely followed the path it predicted earlier this year, when it expected new highs in the second half of 2025. Stronger-than-anticipated macro conditions and clearer regulatory frameworks have helped fuel that momentum. Bitcoin’s market dominance has slipped from 65% in May to about 59% in August. Coinbase said the decline points to the early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. At the same time, altcoin market capitalization has jumped more than 50% since July to $1.4 trillion. Altcoin Season is coming As September approaches, the transition to a full-scale altcoin season is likely. Our positive 3Q25 outlook stems from macro trends such as potential Fed rate cuts and expected regulatory advancements. More key themes in this Monthly Outlook report ↓ — Coinbase Institutional (@CoinbaseInsto) August 14, 2025 ETH Market Cap Jumps 50% Since July on Treasury Buys The Altcoin Season Index, a metric that tracks whether alts are outperforming Bitcoin, remains in the low 40s, below the 75 threshold that signals a full rotation. Still, Coinbase noted that conditions are aligning for a broader rally as September approaches. Ethereum has been the main beneficiary of this shift. Its market cap has grown 50% since early July, powered by demand from digital asset treasuries and a growing narrative around stablecoins and real-world assets. Bitmine Immersion Technologies alone has acquired 1.2m ETH after raising $20b, with capacity to purchase $24.5b worth. The firm has overtaken Sharplink Gaming, the former leader among Ethereum-focused treasuries. Together, top institutional holders now control nearly 3 million ETH, about 2% of the supply. Source: Coinbase Tokens linked closely to Ethereum, including Arbitrum, Ethena, Lido DAO and Optimism, have all moved in step with ETH. Of these, only Lido has rallied sharply, gaining 58% this month. Coinbase said Lido’s rise reflected both its exposure to ETH and a US SEC staff statement earlier in August that liquid staking tokens are not securities under certain conditions. Alt Season Not Fully Here, But Conditions Are Building While institutional flows dominate the ETH story, Coinbase said retail capital is also waiting to move. More than $7.2 trillion currently sits in US money market funds, the largest stockpile on record. These balances represent what the firm called “missed opportunity costs” caused by high traditional valuations, trade uncertainties and lingering doubts about growth. It expects the upcoming Fed cuts to reduce the appeal of money market funds and redirect capital into crypto and other risk assets. The firm’s liquidity index, which tracks stablecoin issuance, trading volumes, orderbook depth and free float, has also begun to recover after six months of decline. Coinbase said this is an early sign that liquidity is returning to the crypto market. “Our 3Q25 outlook remains constructive, though our view on an altcoin season has evolved,” the report said. “The recent decrease in Bitcoin dominance suggests an early rotation of capital into altcoins rather than a full-scale altcoin season at this stage. With the Fed expected to ease in September and the SEC signaling flexibility around some token models, Coinbase said the conditions for a deeper altcoin season are beginning to fall into place.

Ether traders took the biggest hit, with $348.9 million liquidated, followed by Bitcoin at $177.1 million. Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin saw $64.2 million, $58.8 million, and $35.8 million in liquidations, respectively.

At an annualized pace, the country’s economy grew 1% in the quarter, exceeding expectations of a 0.4% rise. The yen also appreciated 0.1% to trade at 147.6 against the dollar. Considerably, the trade deficit also contracted in Q2 compared to the first quarter. In Q1, the country’s economy only surged 0.1%, translating to a modest 0.6% annualized gain. Japan’s analysts anticipate interest rate hikes this year For the June quarter, exports also contributed 0.3% to GDP growth even in the face of U.S. duties. Overall, export volumes rose 2% from the previous quarter as firms lowered prices to protect market share. Some exporters also accelerated shipments ahead of a potential tariff hike to 25%, though export values declined in May and June. Tourism also provided an additional lift to net exports, with spending by foreign travelers up 18% in Q2 and first-half arrivals setting a new record. Aside from exports, business investment also spiked 1.3% from the prior quarter, beating the forecast 0.7% gain, while private consumption edged up 0.2%. According to analysts, strong domestic demand supports the case for an additional Bank of Japan rate increase this year. Taro Kimura, an economist, even remarked, “Japan’s surprisingly strong second-quarter GDP bolsters the Bank of Japan’s case for a near-term rate hike, providing evidence that domestic demand is holding firm despite higher US tariffs.” Most analysts, however, expect policymakers to leave rates unchanged in September and raise them later in October. Roughly 42% of economists in Bloomberg’s poll anticipate an October increase. In July, Governor Kazuo Ueda asserted that the BOJ will raise borrowing costs if domestic demand stays resilient. On July 31, the BOJ raised its FY2025 growth estimate to 0.6%, yet warned that worldwide trade and policy changes might curb overseas growth and dent domestic business profits. Analysts warned that tariff drag may surface in Japan’s Q3 data Japan secured a trade agreement with the US on July 23, which President Donald Trump described as “perhaps the largest deal ever made.” The two nations agreed on a 15% blanket tariff on all exports to the U.S., including automobiles . According to Trump, Japan would commit $550 billion in U.S. investments, yielding “90% of the profits” to America. He further claimed Tokyo would allow wider trade in vehicles, rice, select agricultural products, and other goods. He also anticipates that their deal would create more jobs. Nonetheless, Japan would still have to deal with a higher tariff rate than before Trump’s regime. Market experts say the tariff effect may be more pronounced in Q3 as front-loaded shipments wind down. Inflation also remains a concern, with next week’s figures likely to show July price growth exceeding the BOJ’s goal. Even so, wage increases of more than 5% at Japan’s largest companies could help sustain consumer spending in the near term. According to Komiya, real wages would likely pick up in the fall, helping to bolster household finances in the future. Get seen where it counts.

Cardano (ADA) has been grinding its way back toward that $1 threshold after a strong weekly push, while XRP is flexing above $3, refusing to give up its spot. Traders are locking in positions and eyeing the next few months like it’s the calm before the storm. Both have fresh narratives driving momentum, but the real debate is this — which one’s going to take the crown when the 2025 run kicks into full gear? Before we get into the head-to-head breakdown, it’s worth noting that some sharp money isn’t just watching the majors. There’s a lot of buzz around MAGACOIN FINANCE — an early-access play that’s pulling in heavy interest as big-cap coins take a breather. Early buyers are treating it like a shot at catching the next breakout before it’s plastered across every exchange ticker. Cardano (ADA): Can the momentum hold? ADA’s rally isn’t just luck on the charts — there’s real groundwork being laid. The network just wrapped up its first on-chain governance vote, unlocking a massive $71 million in treasury funds for scaling upgrades. Hydra, a Layer-2 protocol designed to boost transaction speeds, and Ouroboros Leios, a next-gen consensus upgrade, are now locked in for development. These are the kind of changes that could finally put Cardano’s “slow but steady” reputation to bed and open the floodgates for DeFi growth. Then there’s the ETF angle. Grayscale just filed a Cardano trust, a key first step toward ETF status, after ADA got tagged as a “mature blockchain” under the Clarity Act. Betting markets are giving 2025 approval odds as high as 85%, though the SEC’s track record means nothing is a sure thing. Whale activity is also adding fuel. About 200 million ADA have been scooped up ahead of the Midnight Network’s NIGHT token airdrop, with half of the supply reserved for ADA holders. Open interest is climbing, but leverage isn’t running wild — a healthy sign. The short-term challenge? Clearing that stubborn $0.92 resistance. ADA Speculation: Bull case: Upgrades hit on schedule, ETF talk gets hotter, ADA blasts through $0.92 and pushes toward $1.10–$1.20. Base case: Sideways chop between $0.78–$0.98 as dev work ticks along. Bear case: ETF disappointment or post-airdrop dumping drags it back to the low $0.70s. An Opportunity to Get Into Something Before Everyone Else While ADA’s busy stacking technical wins, some traders are hedging with a completely different kind of play. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been turning heads thanks to its rapid-fire growth, a tight early supply, and a community that’s moving in fast. It’s the sort of setup that gets both retail and institutional eyes glued to the order book — and the word is, the ROI projections from seasoned analysts are eye-popping. The thinking is simple: lock in a spot before it lands on major exchanges and futures markets. And for those jumping in now, the EXTRA50X code unlocks a 50% bonus before the current window closes. XRP: The post-lawsuit runway For XRP, the biggest cloud hanging over it is gone. August’s joint dismissal with the SEC ended a five-year grind of uncertainty, officially declaring that retail XRP sales aren’t securities. Ripple settled for $50 million, got the ban on institutional sales lifted, and now has a clear path to expand — including ongoing CBDC trials with France and Georgia. Next up: the ETF push and Ripple’s banking ambitions. Heavyweights like Franklin Templeton and BlackRock have XRP ETF applications pending, and odds look good on paper. Ripple’s also going after a national banking license, which could tie its RLUSD stablecoin and XRP directly into the banking rails — though timelines here could make or break momentum. On-chain data’s giving mixed vibes. Roughly 130 million XRP hit exchanges in August — a possible profit-taking move — but whale wallets are at all-time highs, and open interest is hovering near $9.2 billion. That combo can make for some wild swings. XRP Speculation: Bull case: ETF approval plus bank integrations spark a run toward the mid-$4s. Base case: Solid progress without the big approvals keeps it chopping between $2.80–$3.60. Bear case: Delays or heavy selling pull it back toward the high $2s. Bottom line The biggest network development and light of an airdrop is pushing Cardano, and XRP at last can keep the courts out of its sideboards and waiting to make its institutional overtures count. They both have the firepower to surge, that is why so many smart traders are not taking sides, they are holding a bit of both. However, the actual buzz at the moment is over MAGACOIN FINANCE, an incredible golden opportunity whose early-stage allocations are being bought out in record time. There is the possibility of a massive winner with the EXTRA50X bonus yet to be decided upon, it is one of those investments with breakout potential that can make a fortune before the next market rotation even begins setting in motion.

US Government Doesn’t Plan To Buy More Bitcoin For Strategic Reserve In an interview with Fox Business, Bessant has touched on the topic of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and has confirmed that the government will not be buying more of the cryptocurrency for it. Instead, he said, the US will build it up using confiscated assets. At current prices, these assets are worth between $15 to $20 billion. The US Treasury Secretary has also revealed that the government is going to stop selling its BTC holdings. The market has reacted negatively to the news, with Bitcoin going to as low as $118,000. The asset was already chaotic during the past day, with its price first setting a new all-time high (ATH) above $124,000 and then facing a sharp retrace, so the announcement has only added to the chaos. This latest volatility in the cryptocurrency sector has meant that a significant amount of derivatives traders have found liquidation , according to data from CoinGlass . As displayed in the table, liquidations across the market have totaled to nearly $1 billion in the last 24 hours. As Bitcoin and other assets have declined in this window, it’s not surprising to see that longs took the brunt of the derivatives flush, with $747 million in positions being forcibly closed off. In terms of the individual tokens, Ethereum-related contracts led the liquidations at $312 million. Bitcoin came second with $214 million in contracts. ETH coming on top is likely down to the fact that the asset has been getting all the attention lately, with its price rallying close to its ATH. Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP (XRP) have also seen significant liquidations of $66 million and $56 million, respectively. While the US may not be planning to acquire Bitcoin itself, President Donald Trump has been moving to establish the country as the “crypto capital of the world.” The President’s Working Group earlier released a Digital Assets Report, giving recommendations related to cryptocurrency policy. Federal agencies have already begun working to realize Trump’s vision, like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with its Project Crypto and the CFTC with its Crypto Sprint . BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $118,200, down more than 2% over the past day.",Breaking News Ticker|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto liquidations|Cryptocurrency,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 06:00:16

As a result, experts believe that decentralized oracle network, Chainlink (LINK), is poised to reap substantial benefits from these progressive developments. Is Chainlink Crypto’s Overlooked Gem? Market expert Miles Deutscher recently highlighted that LINK may be the most promising large-cap investment opportunity this cycle, despite the possibility that many investors could overlook it. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shorts In Trouble? This Retest Could Ignite Multi-Level Rally In a social media post on X (formerly Twitter), the expert asserted that Chainlink is uniquely positioned to benefit from the “institutionalization of cryptocurrency” and the explosive growth of stablecoins, tokenization, and real-world assets (RWAs). Notably, the total value locked (TVL) in RWAs has surged thirteenfold in just two years, climbing from approximately $1 billion to over $13 billion as institutions increasingly recognize the limitations of the traditional SWIFT payment system. In response, major financial players like asset manager and crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer, BlackRock, are advocating for tokenization, while companies such as Stripe and Circle (CRCL) are now exploring the development of their own blockchain solutions. In this environment, Chainlink serves as a crucial “universal translator.” According to Deutscher, each tokenized stock, bond, or piece of real estate requires an oracle to accurately reflect its value on-chain, and Chainlink dominates this space, controlling 84% of the oracle market. The Feedback Loop Driving LINK’s Success The Chainlink network generates revenue through two primary channels: on-chain fees for services used across various blockchain networks, and partnerships with large corporations that pay for Chainlink’s solutions. This revenue model supports its operations and facilitates buybacks of LINK tokens, further enhancing the network’s sustainability. Related Reading: XRP Price At $36: 7-Year Bottom Breakout Could Trigger Repeat Of 2014-2017 Moreover, Chainlink’s protocol automatically converts all revenues—whether in Ethereum (ETH) or Circle’s USDC stablecoin—from corporate partnerships into LINK tokens on the open market, depositing them into a strategic treasury. This mechanism not only strengthens the network’s financial foundation but also creates a persistent supply sink as users stake LINK to secure the network, earning a sustainable yield of approximately 4.32%. Deutscher emphasizes that this dynamic creates a powerful feedback loop: increased adoption leads to higher revenues, which in turn results in more LINK purchased and locked, enhancing network security and utility. In his analysis, Deutscher also drew comparisons between LINK and XRP, arguing that LINK has gained more traction within institutional circles than XRP, making it a more logical investment given its current valuation. For context, the total value secured by Chainlink stands at an impressive $84.65 billion, dwarfing XRP’s decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked of approximately $85 million. Despite this disparity, XRP’s market cap is roughly twelve times larger than LINK’s, which Deutscher believes highlights LINK’s potential value at current levels. From a pricing perspective, Chainlink has recently broken above the $20 weekly resistance level, currently trading at $22.This is likened to Ethereum’s pivotal $4,000 level, indicating a potential upward trajectory for LINK in the coming months.

As a result, the meme coin is trading close to $0.244. This is the strongest level of the DOGE price in over a month. As a golden cross pattern forms and whales have bought over 1 billion DOGE in the last few sessions, market observers are readying for a powerful leg up. While DOGE’s climb continues, many long-term holders are already placing bets to hedge coverage. More and more seasoned investors are putting money into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a high-growth token which is gaining serious momentum in the run-up to the next wave. Dogecoin’s Technical Setup Signals More Upside Several bullish signs have fueled DOGE’s price action lately. A golden cross, where the 50-day MA has crossed above the 200-day MA, is historically a strong buy signal. In 2023 and 2024, similar crossovers cause gains of 25% and 130% respectively. Whales are taking note as more than $200 million of DOGE has been gathered this week. The most robust wallets currently control 47% of the supply; thus, it shows the confidence these wallets have on the token. Analysts are monitoring key breakout levels with a near-term price target of $0.28 and further upside to $0.42 and $0.48 if momentum picks up. The high trading volume strengthens the story of institutional interest and retail obsession. Why Whales Are Looking Beyond DOGE Some large DOGE holders are not diversifying because they’ve lost faith in Dogecoin. They are diversifying because they see significant upside potential in early-stage tokens that can perform great in the following breakout. This trend follows a script from previous cycles: when the focus switches, accumulate small caps with strong narratives. For this very reason, many DOGE veterans are embracing MAGACOIN FINANCE. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Early Entry with Momentum Seasoned DOGE holders are stacking MAGACOIN FINANCE now , banking on its explosive potential for the next leg up, as mounting whale activity from the Dogecoin community converges with a surging presale momentum and growing analyst buzz. With forecasts ranging from 39x to 74x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly becoming the high‑conviction, high‑upside play that smart altcoin investors are gravitating toward—especially as liquidity rotates into early-stage, scarcity-driven projects ahead of key exchange listings Final Thoughts: Positioning Before the Surge The technical indicators of Dogecoin are strong going into Q4, and whales are clearly optimistic. But in the world of oversized returns, small caps like MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer strategic positioning for the next burner. As market sentiment builds and meme coin momentum returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early entry window is attracting retail and institutional players. Past performance have taught us that big gains often come from big early bets. MAGACOIN FINANCE falls into this category of an early bet.

While established blue-chip tokens continue to inspire confidence, it’s the high-growth, disruptive projects that are drawing the most attention. Traders and analysts are scanning for the ultimate combination of rock-solid fundamentals, compelling narratives, and scalable tech, the recipe for exponential growth. Among the standouts, BlockDAG is setting records with presale momentum not seen in years, while well-known names like Filecoin, VeChain, and Stellar are proving their strength through adoption and technical setups. Each project offers its own unique value proposition, from decentralized storage to enterprise blockchain adoption, but all are positioned for possible breakout moves in 2025. Here’s why these names are dominating investor watchlists. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Momentum & Game-Changing Tech BlockDAG has become the talk of the crypto space, with its presale storming past $370 million and heading toward a huge $600M target. Sitting in Batch 29 at just $0.0276, it gives investors one of the last low-cost entries before later stages push valuations higher. Market watchers are already eyeing a potential run to $1 in its first bull market, a move that could hand early buyers triple-digit ROI. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design offers lightning-fast transactions while keeping decentralization intact. With full EVM compatibility, Ethereum-based dApps can move over seamlessly, giving the ecosystem instant expansion power. The adoption stats are already eye-catching: 2.5 million X1 app miners, over 200,000 holders, and 19,260 ASIC miners sold, all before the mainnet even launches. Backed by high-profile campaigns like the Inter Milan partnership, BlockDAG is building global brand recognition ahead of listing. For those chasing the best long-term crypto of 2025, the $0.0276 stage might be the last big entry point before the price takes off. 2. VeChain: Enterprise Partnerships Driving Bullish Setup VeChain’s enterprise blockchain model is giving it a strong case for the best long-term crypto title. VET has surged 12.1% in the past week, forming a bullish cup-and-handle pattern as it nears $0.043 resistance. Analysts are watching for a clean breakout toward $0.050 and possibly higher if momentum holds. With real-world supply chain tracking integrations and staking rewards fueling engagement, VeChain has fundamentals that match its bullish technical setup. If the breakout plays out, it could be one of the standout performers of 2025. 3. Filecoin: Decentralized Storage Ready for the Next Wave Filecoin is holding its ground as a best long-term crypto contender in the decentralized storage sector. Trading around $2.47 after a minor pullback, FIL has maintained strong support and is pushing toward the $2.68 resistance level. With AI and Web3 adoption ramping up, the market for decentralized storage is forecast to hit an enormous $17.5 billion by 2032. Charts are showing a bullish fractal setup, hinting at an upside breakout if overall sentiment turns positive. As the clear leader in decentralized storage, Filecoin is well-placed to capitalize on growing demand for secure, private, and scalable blockchain-based data solutions, a position that could pay off big in 2025. 4. Stellar: Institutional Integration Powering Gains Stellar has been rallying hard, climbing more than 10% this week and approaching $0.47 resistance. A huge boost came from its integration into the DTCC’s $2.5 quadrillion institutional blockchain framework, a move that solidifies its credibility with major players. With trading volumes and open interest both on the rise, technical projections see XLM pushing to $0.50 or beyond. If this trajectory continues, Stellar could cement itself among the best long-term crypto contenders of 2025, backed by both institutional adoption and retail enthusiasm. Evaluating the Best Long-Term Crypto in 2025 The search for the best long-term crypto of 2025 is revealing a mix of disruptive presale plays and proven industry leaders. BlockDAG’s record-breaking fundraising, cutting-edge architecture, and rapid adoption metrics make it a frontrunner. At the same time, Filecoin’s dominance in decentralized storage, VeChain’s enterprise-focused solutions, and Stellar’s institutional traction show that the growth story is not limited to one niche. As the next bull run draws closer, these projects offer opportunities ranging from early-stage high-reward entries like BlockDAG to established performers with expanding ecosystems. In this market, timing is everything, and getting positioned before the surge could mean life-changing returns. The race is on, and these assets are leading the charge.

The owner is known, the funds are intact, and yet no one can access the wallet. The address, attributed by Cointelegraph to Estonian banker Rain Lõhmus, holds approximately 250,000 ETH, now reported as worth more than $1 billion. Lõhmus, a founder of Estonia’s LHV Bank, purchased approximately 250,000 ETH for about $75,000 during Ethereum’s ICO . He later acknowledged ownership of the address in a national radio interview, calling it “no secret.” The allocation dates back to the 2014 offering and represents one of the largest individual presale holdings recorded on‑chain. BIG: Estonian banker Rain Lohmus, who bought $75,000 worth of $ETH during the 2015 ICO, has lost access to the wallet, now valued at over $1 billion. pic.twitter.com/fCBTk3s1OL — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) August 13, 2025 How the Wallet Became Inaccessible The reason for the paralysis is simple and final in cryptographic terms. The private key is missing. Lõhmus said he lost the password and has not mounted a significant recovery effort. Like many others in a similar situation, he invited assistance and once considered using artificial intelligence to reconstruct access, but no credible path has emerged. Ethereum’s design offers no administrator or reset function. Without the key, the funds cannot be spent. Similar Cases of Lost Fortunes Inaccessible coins due to lost keys are not isolated cases. Analysts tracking early addresses believe a meaningful share of ETH has been effectively removed from circulation due to lost credentials. Some investors have also lost their funds in unexpected ways. In one case, an investor who had acquired 6,000 BTC at $5 was arrested for unrelated events. While he was in prison, his landlord hired a cleaner for his apartment who accidentally threw away the keys to his wallet , leaving the fortune permanently out of reach. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Stefan Thomas, Ripple’s former Chief Technology Officer, also found himself in a similar situation after he lost the password to his encrypted USB drive containing 7,002 BTC. Surprisingly, Thomas has declined offers to help , as he has exhausted almost all his attempts at unlocking it. He’s not willing to take the risk and potentially lose access to his fortune forever. Risk Management Lessons The episode underlines operational risks that grow with asset size. Presale buyers who stored keys unsafely faced the real danger of irreversible loss. The Lõhmus case shows how easily investors can lose their funds without proper precautions. Cold storage remains one of the safest options for avoiding the centralization risks on exchanges. However, investors should maintain secure, redundant backups and documented recovery procedures to ensure long-term access to their assets.

Analysts say Ruvi AI (RUVI) could be the closest thing to that kind of momentum, with daily sales surging after its CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing and a product that actually solves real problems. Phase 2 of the presale has already passed 85% at $0.015. When it closes, the price steps up 33% to $0.020 for Phase 3, before a final presale price of $0.070. If you’re looking for asymmetric upside with near-term catalysts, RUVI deserves attention now. Why RUVI Is Getting AVAX-Level Comparisons $2.9M raised in presale 230M tokens sold 2,800+ holders and climbing CMC listing driving discovery and watchlists CyberScope audit completed (independent third party) WEEX partnership to boost visibility and simplify trading Live leaderboard giveaway adding extra incentives This mix of traction (sales and holders), trust (audit), and access (exchange alignment) is exactly what fueled early breakouts in previous cycles. CMC Listing Turned Visibility Into Allocations CMC is where interest turns into action. RUVI’s listing pushed it onto trending dashboards and thousands of watchlists right as Phase 2 crossed 85% completion. With a transparent pricing path, $0.015 now, $0.020 in Phase 3, and $0.070 at presale close, buyers can plan entries without guesswork. That clarity compresses decision time and often accelerates inflows ahead of each price step. Real Utility: A Creator-First AI Super App RUVI isn’t a narrative-only token. It’s building a super app that helps creators and teams produce more content with fewer tools, making it a practical AI play rather than pure speculation. Research real-time trends to uncover high-demand topics Generate platform-ready scripts tuned to brand voice and channel Create images and videos natively, no app-hopping Automate workflows to plan, iterate, schedule, and publish faster Who benefits? YouTubers, TikTokers, agencies, brands, and lean teams chasing speed, consistency, and lower tool costs. Tying token demand to real usage gives RUVI a stronger foundation than hype cycles. Credibility and Access: Audit + Exchange Alignment Institutional and retail buyers look for safeguards and liquidity routes. RUVI passed a CyberScope audit, adding third-party validation to its smart contracts. On the access front, a partnership with WEEX, a major exchange, supports visibility and simplifies trading for token holders as liquidity builds. These signals make larger allocations easier as phases progress. Programmed Catalysts Are Driving Urgency Phase 2 >85% at $0.015 Automatic 33% move to $0.020 in Phase 3 Final presale price set at $0.070 Programmed steps create defined spreads and clear windows to position before each reset. With CMC-fueled awareness compounding, waiting often means paying more on the next bracket. Extra Incentive: Leaderboard Giveaway and VIP Tiers RUVI’s live leaderboard giveaway rewards top contributors with additional tokens, an added push as the next price step approaches. For larger allocations, VIP tiers model potential outcomes at a hypothetical $1 valuation: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These modeled scenarios show how presale bonuses can magnify upside if adoption and liquidity keep building, hence the 13,200% ROI talk making the rounds among analysts. Bottom Line Momentum: CMC listing has pushed daily sales and discovery higher Trust: CyberScope audit and WEEX partnership de-risk early participation Traction: $2.9M raised, 230M tokens sold, 2,800+ holders Catalysts: 33% step to $0.020 in Phase 3; $0.070 final presale price Utility: A creator-focused AI super app tying token demand to real usage If you’re aiming for outsized returns with clear, near-term catalysts, RUVI’s setup looks primed. Phase 2 is nearly done at $0.015. Decide where you want to be before the scheduled price move pushes the next wave of buyers into higher brackets.

The breakout is being powered by a potent mix of macro hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts , surging risk appetite, and a regulatory jolt: a presidential executive order that opens the door for crypto inside 401(k) retirement plans. Bitcoin price by CoinMarketCap The snapshot: price, pace, momentum BTC tapped a record $124,002.49 on August 14, 2025, as traders leaned into the risk-on narrative and institutions added exposure. Ether (ETH) joined the move with fresh cycle highs , while analysts noted that sustained price action above $125,000 could pave the way toward $150,000. Macro tailwinds: Fed cuts vs. hot data Markets have been primed for a September Fed cut , a backdrop that typically benefits risk assets like Bitcoin. That easing drumbeat and bouts of dollar weakness helped turbocharge the rally. But the day’s hot U.S. producer-price print (PPI) reminded investors this path isn’t linear, yields and the dollar bounced intraday, tempering hopes for a jumbo cut. Net-net: the “Fed pivot” narrative remains a tailwind, but it’s not without crosswinds from sticky inflation. The regulatory game-changer: 401(k)s can hold crypto Last week’s executive order broadened access to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies 4 01(k) plans . Practically, that means U.S. retirement fiduciaries can evaluate and potentially add crypto offerings alongside private funds and other alts, subject to prudence and disclosure rules. The policy could unlock trillions in long-term retirement capital over time, even if the on-ramp is gradual. There’s real optimism here-more rails, more legitimacy, more patient capital, but also caution: alternative assets can bring higher fees, complexity, and volatility than traditional 401(k) lineups. Plan sponsors will need robust diligence, governance, and risk controls before flipping any switches. Institutions & market structure: ETFs, treasuries, and flows This cycle’s character is different from 2021. Spot Bitcoin ETFs , continued corporate treasury interest, and a friendlier U.S. policy backdrop have all deepened liquidity and tightened spreads. Financial media reported strong institutional participation and ETF focus alongside the record print, consistent with what traders have seen on the tape this summer. “Crypto in 401(k)? That’s institutional legitimacy.” The social mood matched the move: a chorus of posts framed the 401(k) order as a bridge between Main Street and digital assets-exactly the sort of infrastructure shift bulls have argued for years. What pros are saying: path to $150K? Several analysts flagged a simple roadmap: hold above the breakout zone ($120K–$125K), convert it into support, and momentum could carry toward $150K. That upside scenario rests on continued risk appetite, steady ETF inflows , and no nasty macro surprises. Risk check: what could derail the run Macro upside surprises in inflation that dim rate-cut hopes. Policy reversals or stricter fiduciary interpretations that slow 401(k) adoption. Liquidity air pockets if ETF flows stall or large holders de-risk into strength. Closing Thoughts This is the perfect hype mix: a headline-grabbing record above $124K , a credible pipeline for retirement-plan capital, and a macro backdrop that still tilts dovish despite hot data noise. If those pillars hold, the Bitcoin 124K Fed rate-cut 401(k) crypto story may only be warming up. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The Expansion Phase Has Begun,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-headed-to-7-the-expansion-phase-has-begun/,"TL;DR XRP dropped to $3.00 before rebounding as record selling volume tested major support levels. Over 320 million XRP bought by large wallets suggests renewed institutional accumulation pressure. XRP charts show breakout retest as analysts eye expansion phase with $7 target in sight. Price Drops Sharply After Market Liquidations XRP dropped more than 6% in the last 24 hours, falling to $3.00 before recovering slightly. The fall came during a broad selloff in the crypto market, triggered by over $1 billion in liquidations. This marked the asset’s lowest price in over a week. The 24-hour trading volume crossed $11.1 billion, with a sharp wave of selling pressure hitting during the early hours. During that time, XRP recorded 436.98 million units traded in a single hour — the highest hourly volume this quarter. Late in the session, buying picked up, helping stabilize the price around $3.12. Institutional Buying Signals Fresh Accumulation Crypto analyst Crypto King shared the view that XRP has moved out of its accumulation and manipulation stages. They believe the next phase, expansion, is now underway, with a price target of $7 in this cycle. Their analysis is based on chart structure and increased interest from large players. $XRP is heating up and institutions are stepping in. We are now entering the phase I have been waiting for: Manipulation done Accumulation done Expansion loading… The chart and fundamentals are lining up for something massive. My target this cycle is $7.00 If you ignore… pic.twitter.com/RcK5D3mcEJ — Crypto King (@CryptoKing4Ever) August 14, 2025 Supporting this, on-chain data from Ali Martinez shows large holders bought around 320 million XRP in the past three days. This total purchase is worth about $1 billion. This type of buying often reduces short-term selling pressure and can shape how smaller investors react. XRP’s price structure shows a shift after a clean breakout in mid-July. Since then, it has gained more than 66% before entering a sideways range. Crypto King’s chart outlines three phases: accumulation, manipulation, and expansion. Current price movement suggests XRP may be starting the third phase. A separate chart shared by CryptoBull shows XRP trading inside a symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour timeframe. The price has pulled back to retest the former resistance, now acting as support. This is often seen in healthy market trends where buyers step in after consolidation. Market Context and Technical Support The recent decline in crypto prices follows a broader drop in risk assets. U.S. equity markets also saw profit-taking, which may have added pressure across digital assets. Despite the pullback, Ripple’s CTO reaffirmed the XRP Ledger’s role in supporting financial systems. With the price sitting near a key support level, traders are watching for signs of strength as the expansion setup unfolds. The post XRP Headed to $7?

Delta Blockchain Fund founder and general partner Kavita Gupta commented on the risk-taking trend in the markets, new public offerings, and the future of stablecoin projects. Gupta stated that $500 million worth of new digital asset treasuries have recently entered the market and that funds totaling over $4 billion are being prepared to purchase ETH, adding, “For the first time in market history, we are experiencing a serious supply shortage in the amount of ETH that can be purchased.” Related News: Renowned Analyst Reveals Three Altcoins He Bought During the Downturn - Shares His Altcoin Season Prediction Gupta stated that this trend isn't limited to ETH, noting that companies are also adding Solana and other digital assets to their balance sheets, similar to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy. According to Gupta, the heavy buying of certain crypto assets by public companies and SPACs presents both opportunities and risks: “Demand is high, and billions of dollars are flowing into these assets. However, this could turn into a new pump-and-dump cycle on Wall Street.” Gupta predicts that, in addition to Circle, major companies like Robinhood, Facebook, and Instagram could launch their own stablecoin projects within the next year and a half. He noted that banks and fintech companies have also shown significant interest in developing their own stablecoin payment and settlement platforms, and that as many as 20 initial public offerings (IPOs) in this area are likely. *This is not investment advice.

Not a top-10 coin, traders say",https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/15/best-august-bet-for-10x-before-q1-2026-not-a-top-10-coin-traders-say/,"In the crypto market, the biggest gains often come from assets that have not yet climbed into the top rankings. Seasoned traders know that by the time a coin hits the top 10, most of its exponential growth has already happened. This August, the name circulating in private trading circles is not another Layer-1 giant or a heavily marketed meme token—it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a protocol still in presale but positioned to become a major player in DeFi before the end of its first year post-launch. Layer-2 scalability as a growth driver Where Layer-1 networks have struggled with congestion and high fees, Layer-2 protocols have been attracting users with faster transactions and lower costs. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be leveraging Layer-2 scalability to power its decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem, offering a smoother and cheaper experience for users who value both speed and capital efficiency. This is not just about technology—it’s about market behavior. Users and liquidity providers naturally gravitate toward platforms where transactions are near-instant, costs remain negligible, and scalability is baked into the architecture. That’s the environment where total value locked (TVL) can climb quickly, and where lending and borrowing activities can scale without bottlenecks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s approach will allow it to onboard users from day one at a pace that slower Layer-1 projects simply cannot match, giving it the foundation for rapid growth long before most competitors adjust. Stablecoin & lending synergy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not limiting itself to one revenue or adoption channel. The platform’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will allow lenders to deposit assets into liquidity pools, earning interest that adjusts dynamically based on utilization. Its Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will enable borrowers and lenders to negotiate rates directly. Adding another powerful hook, users will also be able to borrow a $1-pegged stablecoin against blue-chip cryptocurrencies or stablecoins they deposit. This creates an on-platform loop—users earn from lending, then tap into borrowing without leaving the ecosystem. Automated liquidation safeguards will keep collateral secure, ensuring that lending pools remain healthy even during market volatility. Together, these systems will create a self-sustaining cycle of liquidity, trading volume, and adoption. Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale at a price of $0.035. Already, 15% of tokens have been sold, raising $14.39 million from more than 15,250 holders. Security has been prioritized, with a CertiK audit confirming its smart contract integrity. Phase 7 will bring a price increase, which means investors entering now are locking in at the current valuation before the next upward step. The combination of a verified smart contract, a growing holder base, and significant capital already committed is creating urgency—especially among those looking for strong positions before major exchange listings. Beta launch + exchange listings impact The team behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has confirmed that the beta version of the platform will go live before the official launch. This early access will give users immediate hands-on experience with its lending tools, driving early TVL growth and proving functionality ahead of time. When this coincides with anticipated listings on major exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, and Coinbase, the effect on active wallet numbers will be substantial. The visibility from these listings will attract new participants globally, while the operational beta will convert curious traders into engaged users. Early liquidity inflow in that window is expected to be one of the key accelerators toward price appreciation. 10x potential for reasons At the current Phase 6 entry point of $0.035, the first post-presale milestone will be the $0.06 listing price. This represents an immediate 71% gain on launch day. With expanding user adoption, the token price is projected to move toward $0.35 within the first 12 months, translating to a 10x from current levels. From there, the same drivers—Layer-2 scalability, multi-model lending, stablecoin borrowing, major exchange access, and buyback-driven staking rewards—are expected to fuel the climb toward higher valuations before Q1 2026. As adoption metrics scale and revenue from lending and borrowing grows, more MUTM tokens will be repurchased from the open market and distributed to stakers, creating sustained demand pressure. This feedback loop will not just support price stability; it will actively contribute to long-term price appreciation. For traders seeking a position outside the over-crowded top 10 and aiming for aggressive growth within a defined time horizon, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. The combination of a low current entry price, strategic utility, early exchange exposure, and a revenue-backed buy-and-distribute model places it in a rare category—one that traders say could make it the best bet of August 2025.

50116869,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189758,1755240010,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50116869.jpeg,Solana Wallets Soar: Unprecedented Growth in Large SOL Holdings,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/solana-wallets-record-high/,"BitcoinWorld Solana Wallets Soar: Unprecedented Growth in Large SOL Holdings The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news concerning the Solana ecosystem. Recently, the number of Solana wallets holding over 10,000 SOL tokens, each valued at approximately $2 million, has surged to an unprecedented all-time high of 5,224. This remarkable increase in substantial SOL holdings signals growing confidence among high-net-worth investors and could reshape the dynamics of the broader Solana market . This phenomenon, often referred to as a rise in crypto whale activity , prompts us to explore what drives these movements and their potential implications. What’s Driving This Surge in Solana Wallets ? Several factors contribute to the escalating number of Solana wallets accumulating significant amounts of SOL. Solana’s robust blockchain infrastructure, known for its high transaction throughput and low fees, continues to attract developers and users alike. This fundamental strength makes it an appealing platform for long-term investment. Key drivers include: Ecosystem Growth: The continuous expansion of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFT projects on Solana creates utility and demand for SOL. Institutional Interest: Increasingly, institutional investors are recognizing Solana’s potential, allocating capital to its ecosystem. These large-scale investments naturally lead to an increase in large SOL holders . Technological Advancements: Ongoing network upgrades and improvements enhance Solana’s scalability and reliability, reinforcing investor confidence. These elements collectively paint a picture of a maturing and expanding ecosystem, drawing in substantial capital. Understanding Crypto Whale Activity and Its Influence on SOL Holdings When we talk about “crypto whales,” we refer to individuals or entities that hold vast amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, in this case, Solana. Their movements can significantly influence market sentiment and price action. The record high in Solana wallets with over 10,000 SOL suggests that these influential players are accumulating, rather than distributing, their assets. This accumulation of SOL holdings by whales often indicates a bullish long-term outlook. They typically have access to extensive research and capital, making their moves closely watched. While their large transactions can sometimes create short-term volatility, a sustained increase in whale holdings generally points to underlying strength and belief in the asset’s future. How Does This Impact the Overall Solana Market ? The growing presence of large SOL holders has several implications for the broader Solana market . On one hand, it can foster greater price stability as significant amounts of SOL are held by entities less likely to engage in rapid selling. This reduces circulating supply available for immediate trading, potentially supporting price floors. On the other hand, concentrated SOL holdings also mean that a few large players could, theoretically, exert considerable influence over market movements. However, Solana’s decentralized nature and growing user base help mitigate this risk. The overall trend suggests a strengthening foundation for Solana as a prominent blockchain platform. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Solana Ecosystem For both current and prospective investors, understanding this trend in Solana wallets is crucial. It highlights a period of significant accumulation by well-capitalized entities. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continuously monitor Solana’s development roadmap, ecosystem growth, and overall market sentiment. Diversify: While SOL holdings are increasing, always consider a diversified portfolio to mitigate risk. Understand Volatility: Even with increased whale accumulation, the crypto market remains volatile. Be prepared for price fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Large investors often take a long-term view. Consider if this strategy aligns with your own investment goals. The data on increasing Solana wallets holding substantial amounts of SOL provides a compelling narrative about the network’s perceived value and future potential. In conclusion, the record high in Solana wallets accumulating over 10,000 SOL is a powerful indicator of confidence from significant market participants. This surge in SOL holdings , driven by Solana’s robust technology and expanding ecosystem, signifies a maturing Solana market . While crypto whale activity always warrants attention, this trend largely reflects a positive outlook for the asset. As the number of large SOL holders grows, it underscores Solana’s position as a key player in the decentralized future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for Solana wallets to hit a “record high” in holdings? A1: It means that the number of individual Solana addresses (wallets) holding more than a specific amount of SOL (in this case, over 10,000 SOL) has reached its highest point ever recorded. This indicates increasing accumulation by significant investors. Q2: Who are “crypto whales” in the context of Solana? A2: Crypto whales are individuals or entities that hold a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, such as SOL. Their substantial holdings can influence market prices and sentiment due to their potential to make large transactions. Q3: How does increased SOL holdings by large investors impact Solana’s price? A3: Increased accumulation by large investors (whales) can be a bullish sign, suggesting confidence in the asset’s future. It can reduce the circulating supply, potentially supporting the price, though large sell-offs by whales could also cause volatility. Q4: Is this a bullish or bearish sign for the Solana market? A4: Generally, a record high in large SOL holdings is considered a bullish sign. It suggests that well-capitalized investors believe in Solana’s long-term potential and are accumulating assets, rather than selling them. Q5: What are the main reasons for the growth in large Solana wallets? A5: Key reasons include Solana’s growing ecosystem of dApps and DeFi projects, increasing institutional interest, and continuous technological advancements that improve the network’s scalability and reliability.

This highly anticipated development aims to significantly enhance the network’s transaction processing capabilities, promising a monumental boost in Solana speed upgrade . It’s a pivotal moment for blockchain performance , as the community gears up to decide on a proposal that could redefine the efficiency of this leading layer-1 protocol. This push for improved network transaction speed truly highlights the power of decentralized governance in shaping the future of blockchain technology. What is the Solana Alpenglow Upgrade and How Does it Work? The Alpenglow upgrade represents a significant leap forward for Solana’s core technology. At its heart, it proposes modifications to the existing Proof of History (PoH) and Tower BFT consensus mechanisms. These are the fundamental engines that drive Solana’s impressive transaction throughput. Proof of History (PoH): This is Solana’s innovative clock before consensus. It creates a historical record of events, proving that a transaction occurred at a specific time, which significantly reduces the time nodes spend agreeing on the order of transactions. Tower BFT: This is Solana’s version of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, a consensus algorithm that ensures network agreement even if some nodes are malicious. Alpenglow introduces two key components to these mechanisms: Votor and Rotor . These new elements are designed to work in tandem, streamlining the process by which transactions are validated and added to the blockchain. Essentially, they aim to make the existing highly efficient system even faster and more robust, directly impacting the overall Solana speed upgrade . Why is a Solana Speed Upgrade Crucial for Blockchain Performance? In the fast-paced world of decentralized applications (dApps) and Web3, speed is paramount. Users demand instant confirmations, and developers need a platform that can handle high transaction volumes without congestion or exorbitant fees. A significant boost in network transaction speed offers several compelling benefits: Enhanced User Experience: Faster transactions mean smoother interactions with dApps, from DeFi swaps to NFT mints, making the blockchain feel as responsive as traditional internet applications. Increased Scalability: The ability to process more transactions per second allows the network to support a larger user base and more complex applications, solidifying its blockchain performance . Developer Attraction: A high-performance network is highly attractive to developers building the next generation of decentralized solutions, fostering innovation and growth within the Solana ecosystem. The Solana Alpenglow initiative directly addresses these needs, aiming to push the boundaries of what’s possible on a decentralized network. The Power of Decentralized Governance in Action What makes the Alpenglow proposal particularly noteworthy is its journey through Solana’s decentralized governance process. Instead of a centralized entity dictating changes, the Solana community, comprising validators, token holders, and developers, takes the lead. This collective decision-making ensures that upgrades align with the community’s vision and needs. The current discussions, as reported by Cointelegraph on X, are a testament to this collaborative approach. Every voice matters, and the proposed changes are meticulously reviewed before reaching a final vote. This transparency and community involvement are fundamental pillars of the Solana ecosystem, ensuring that the network evolves in a truly decentralized manner. Anticipating the Impact on Network Transaction Speed With a governance vote on implementing Alpenglow expected in approximately 16 days, the anticipation within the community is palpable. If approved, the upgrade could usher in a new era of even greater efficiency for Solana. While the exact percentage increase in speed will only be known post-implementation, the intent is clear: to maintain Solana’s position as one of the fastest and most efficient blockchains available. However, like any major network upgrade, there are considerations. Rigorous testing will be crucial to ensure stability and seamless transition. The success of the Solana speed upgrade hinges on meticulous planning and execution by the core development teams and validators. The potential rewards, however, are immense, promising a more robust and responsive network for everyone. Summary: A Glimpse into Solana’s Accelerated Future The initiation of the Solana Alpenglow governance process marks an exciting chapter for the Solana network. This proposed upgrade, designed to enhance fundamental consensus mechanisms, aims to deliver an unparalleled boost in network transaction speed and overall blockchain performance . It underscores Solana’s commitment to continuous innovation and its dedication to empowering its community through robust decentralized governance . As the vote approaches, the crypto world watches keenly, anticipating the next evolution of one of the industry’s most dynamic blockchains.

A prominent New York Democrat has put forth a proposal aiming to introduce a new crypto tax New York , specifically targeting digital asset sales and transfers. This move signals a growing interest from lawmakers in regulating and taxing the burgeoning digital economy. What is This New York Crypto Tax Proposal? Assemblyman Phil Steck, a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly, is the driving force behind this legislative effort. He has officially proposed a bill, known as Assembly Bill 8966 , which seeks to impose an excise tax on the sale and transfer of various digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The core provision of this bill is a 0.2% excise tax. This tax would apply to both the sale and transfer of crypto assets. The objective appears to be generating revenue from the rapidly expanding digital asset market. This initiative highlights the ongoing debate around how traditional tax frameworks should adapt to the unique nature of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. How Could This Digital Asset Taxation Impact You? If Assembly Bill 8966 were to pass, it would introduce a new layer of financial consideration for anyone engaging in crypto transactions within New York. A 0.2% excise tax might seem small, but it could accumulate, especially for frequent traders or large-volume transactions. Consider these potential impacts: Increased Transaction Costs: Every sale or transfer of a digital asset would incur this additional fee. Reporting Complexity: New tax obligations often lead to more complex record-keeping and reporting requirements for individuals and businesses. Market Behavior: Such a tax could influence how often New York residents trade crypto or even encourage some to move their activities elsewhere. The concept of digital asset taxation is not new globally, but its implementation varies widely. New York’s approach could set a precedent for other states. What’s Next for This Crypto Sales Tax Bill? The journey for Assembly Bill 8966 from proposal to law involves several crucial steps. It is not a done deal yet, and the legislative process allows for public input and debate. Here’s the typical path a bill like this must follow: Committee Review: The bill must first clear an Assembly committee. This is where it will be debated, potentially amended, and voted upon by committee members. Full Assembly Vote: If it passes the committee, it then moves to a vote before the full New York State Assembly. A majority vote is required here. Governor’s Signature: Finally, for the bill to become law, it needs to secure the governor’s signature. The governor can sign it into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without a signature. This process means there are still opportunities for various stakeholders, including the crypto community, to voice their opinions on the proposed crypto sales tax . The outcome will be closely watched by the broader cryptocurrency industry. In summary, Assembly Bill 8966 represents a significant legislative effort to bring digital assets under the state’s tax umbrella. While the proposed 0.2% excise tax is relatively low, its implications for crypto users in New York are notable. The bill’s progression through the Assembly committee, a full Assembly vote, and ultimately the governor’s desk will determine its future and set a precedent for digital asset taxation within the state. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Assembly Bill 8966? Assembly Bill 8966 is a proposed New York State bill that aims to impose a 0.2% excise tax on the sale and transfer of digital assets and NFTs. Who proposed this New York crypto tax? The bill was proposed by Phil Steck, a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly. What is the proposed tax rate for crypto sales? The bill proposes a 0.2% excise tax on the sale and transfer of digital assets. Will this crypto sales tax affect all New York residents? If passed, the tax would apply to individuals and entities engaging in the sale and transfer of digital assets within New York State. What steps must Assembly Bill 8966 complete to become law? The bill must clear an Assembly committee, pass a vote in the full Assembly, and finally receive the governor’s signature to become law. How does this bill relate to digital asset taxation trends? This bill reflects a growing trend among governments worldwide to regulate and tax digital assets, integrating them into existing financial frameworks.

50117572,557269,1755241226,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50117572.jpeg,More Surprises In Store? Bitwise CIO Lists Four Catalysts The Crypto Market Is Overlooking,https://bitcoinist.com/bitwise-cio-catalysts-crypto-market-overlooking/,"As the market rally continues, Bitwise’s CIO has outlined some of the bullish catalysts that he believes the market is overlooking and could send the crypto market prices substantially higher in the coming months and years. Governments, Central Banks To Push Crypto Prices Higher In a Wednesday memo to clients, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan outlined some developments he believes the crypto market has not yet priced in despite the people’s bullish sentiment on the industry. Hougan highlighted that there’s “a lot to be excited about” now, including crypto regulation and legislation moving in a positive direction, stablecoins gaining momentum, corporate crypto purchases soaring, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experiencing remarkable adoption, and the “much-needed altcoin energy” being injected into the broader crypto market by Ethereum’s (ETH) rally. Nonetheless, he asserted that the “problem (…) is all these are well-known,” which could suggest that the market is “underestimating the scale of each of these developments.” To Bitwise CIO, there are “significant upside surprises in store for the market through the end of the year,” which could push prices substantially higher in the coming months and the start of 2026. Hougan listed governments potentially purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) as the first key catalyst not priced in. He explained that “The Three Horsemen of Bitcoin Demand” for this year were ETFs, corporations, and governments, but only the first two have delivered. Notably, ETFs have purchased 183,126 BTC, according to Bitwise’s CIO, while public corporations have acquired 354,744 BTC. Meanwhile, governments have failed to show up despite some “dribs and drabs” from some jurisdictions like Pakistan, Abu Dhabi, and even the US. He emphasized that the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), established by President Donald Trump in March, only holds assets seized through criminal forfeiture. In the memo, Hougan affirmed that, based on the conversations he is having at Bitwise, countries and central banks “are moving,” albeit slowly, clarifying that he doesn’t believe “there will be a rush of national announcements by year-end,” but suspects there will be enough to “establish this as a major potential catalyst for 2026. That realization alone could push prices substantially higher.” It’s worth noting that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed on Thursday morning that the government will not be purchasing additional Bitcoin for its SBR. Instead, the US will stop selling these assets and continue to build up the reserve’s stash through confiscated BTC What Else Has Not Been Priced In? Bitcoin trading near all-time highs while interest rates hover near historical highs is unusual, the Bitwise CIO said when discussing the second factor. Despite investors having priced in multiple rate cuts by year’s end, he asserted that the market is missing a much bigger story. Notably, the Trump administration “has a strong desire” for a weaker dollar and a more dovish Federal Reserve. The administration is “strongly signaling that it wants much lower rates and a much weaker dollar.” To him, Bitcoin could trade significantly higher with much lower rates and a much weaker dollar due to money printing. Hougan also underscored the diminishing volatility trend as a third potential catalyst, as both BTC’s volatility and the rate at which its volatility is changing have fallen dramatically since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. The growth of ETFs and corporate purchases injected new types of buyers into the crypto market, and advances on the regulatory and legislative side dramatically reduced risk in the market. I suspect this is the “new normal” for bitcoin. It is now roughly as volatile as high-volatility tech stocks, like Nvidia. Lastly, he suggested that a comeback of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) could be around the corner, bringing a wave of new capital. Hougan argued that ICOs have had a terrible reputation since 2018, which led most investors and observers to write them off “as damaged goods.” However, Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Chairman , Paul Atkins, recently “laid out a vision for a rebirth of ICOs” with his Project Crypto speech. “Unleashing a new ICO Market 2.0 could draw in significant new capital to the crypto market,” Hougan affirmed. “Markets don’t rise on good news. They rise on good news that is not priced in,” he affirmed, concluding that “the market in general underappreciates the scale of the bull market taking place in crypto. But I also think it’s overlooking some specific catalysts that will play out in the months and years to come.”",Crypto News|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin reserves|Bitcoin Volatility|Bitwise CIO|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Catalysts|crypto market 2025|Crypto Market breakout|Ethereum|ICOs|Matt Hougan|SBR|US Strageic Bitcoin Reserve,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 07:00:26

The token recorded a nearly 6% rise in the past week, briefly reaching $0.369 before easing to $0.3589 at the time of writing. While price action remains within a tight range, network fundamentals suggest continued high usage, particularly driven by stablecoin transfers. Related Reading: TRON Trading Volume Tops $1B: Could $1 Be the Next Milestone? TRON Stablecoin Demand and Market Liquidity Data from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant highlights that TRON has now processed more than 11.1 billion transactions in its lifetime, reflecting sustained growth since the start of the year. In 2024, the network closed with about 9.3 billion total transactions, meaning roughly 1.8 billion have been added so far in 2025. Current activity averages between 7–9 million transactions daily, with peaks near 10 million, well above the levels recorded in early 2024. Much of this activity is attributed to USDT/TRC-20 transfers, favored for their low fees and rapid confirmation times, positioning TRON as a widely used infrastructure for payments and fund transfers between wallets and exchanges. According to CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain, the growth in TRON’s transaction volume is more than just a technical statistic; it directly influences market liquidity. “The current momentum in transaction volumes enhances liquidity and facilitates the movement of funds into derivatives trading, supporting bullish scenarios when sentiment is positive,” the analyst noted. From early May to mid-August, the network processed approximately 860 million transactions, highlighting a consistent flow of capital across TRON’s ecosystem. This steady throughput has created conditions for efficient capital rotation between spot and derivatives markets, particularly on larger exchanges. The ability to handle high activity without significant fee increases also indicates broad and organic demand, rather than short-lived speculative surges. TRON’s role as a major settlement layer for stablecoin transfers means it continues to act as a backbone for exchange and cross-border activity in the crypto market. Technical Indicators and Potential Price Scenarios Complementing the on-chain data, CryptoQuant analyst BorisVest pointed to TRON’s recent price behavior relative to technical patterns. At its current price of around $0.36, TRX has moved above the upper Bollinger Band, suggesting a phase of stronger momentum. While this could indicate the potential for further gains if buying pressure persists, the analyst cautioned that overextension often raises the risk of near-term pullbacks. If market momentum stalls, a retracement could present entry opportunities for long-term positions. On the other hand, if transaction activity and USDT flows remain strong while market sentiment holds, TRX could sustain its current trend. Related Reading: TRON Sees Over 8 Million USDT Transactions in One Week, What’s Fueling This? Historical data from other large-cap tokens suggests that a combination of high network utility, stablecoin integration, and sustained liquidity often supports prolonged uptrends, though the balance between retail activity and large-holder behavior will remain a determining factor. As TRON continues to process millions of transactions daily and maintain deep integration with stablecoin flows, its role in crypto market infrastructure appears secure. However, price performance in the short term will likely depend on how this usage aligns with broader market sentiment and technical support levels.

The audited AI token is sprinting through its presale after a CoinMarketCap (CMC) partnership and listing put it on thousands of watchlists. Phase 2 has already surpassed 85% at $0.015, with a programmed 33% jump to $0.020 in Phase 3 and a final presale price set at $0.070. For investors hunting time-bound catalysts and real utility, RUVI is making the stronger case. Why capital is rotating to RUVI $2.9M raised, signaling strong early demand 230M tokens sold with a holder base above 2,800 CyberScope audit completed (independent third party) WEEX partnership to boost visibility and simplify trading CMC listing driving discovery and accelerating allocations Live leaderboard giveaway adding extra incentives These milestones, traction, trust, and access, often precede sharp re-ratings in emerging tokens. CMC listing that converts attention into allocations Visibility without structure rarely moves markets. RUVI’s CMC presence arrived as Phase 2 crossed 85% completion, compressing the decision window for buyers. The price path is transparent: $0.015 now, $0.020 in Phase 3 (+33%), then $0.070 after the presale concludes. That clarity reduces guesswork and encourages earlier entries, a key reason the presale pace has accelerated. Real utility: a creator-first AI super app RUVI’s appeal isn’t just narrative, it’s product-led. The Ruvi AI super app centralizes the full content workflow so creators and teams can ship more with fewer tools: Research live trends to spot topics with demand Generate platform-ready scripts tailored to voice and channel Create images and videos natively, no app-hopping Automate workflows to plan, iterate, schedule, and publish faster Who benefits? YouTubers, TikTokers, brands, agencies, and lean teams that care about speed, consistency, and lower tool costs. By tying token demand to day-to-day usage, RUVI aligns with durable AI adoption rather than short-lived hype. Credibility and access: audit plus exchange alignment Early participants want safeguards and liquidity routes. RUVI passed a CyberScope audit, adding independent validation to its smart contracts. On access, the WEEX partnership improves visibility and simplifies trading as liquidity develops. Together, these signals help de-risk early participation for both retail and larger allocators. Programmed catalysts create urgency Phase 2 >85% at $0.015 Automatic 33% move to $0.020 in Phase 3 Final presale price fixed at $0.070 These steps offer defined spreads for those who position early, and with CMC-driven discovery compounding, waiting often means paying the next bracket’s price. Extra incentives: leaderboard and VIP tiers RUVI’s live leaderboard giveaway rewards top contributors with additional tokens, timed to amplify momentum as Phase 2 nears completion. For larger allocations, VIP tiers model potential outcomes at a hypothetical $1 token valuation: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These examples show how presale bonuses can magnify upside if adoption and liquidity keep scaling. TRX stability vs. RUVI’s near-term upside Tron offers a mature network, but the sharper, time-bound setup appears to be RUVI’s. With Phase 2 already beyond 85% at $0.015, a scheduled jump to $0.020 for Phase 3, and a $0.070 final presale price, the path is clear. Add a completed CyberScope audit, a WEEX partnership, CMC-fueled visibility, and a creator-focused AI super app, and you have a newcomer that checks the boxes analysts look for when calling the next high-growth play. If you’re aiming to catch momentum before the bracket resets, RUVI deserves a hard look now.

The company holds a significant Bitcoin treasury and operates CoinDesk, adding value beyond its core exchange business. Despite strong fundamentals, the technical chart looks weak post-IPO, with potential for further downside unless volume increases and key resistance is broken. Given current price action and IPO history, I recommend holding BLSH for now and waiting for a potential retest of lower support levels. Introduction If you missed the Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) IPO earlier this year, don't worry, there's a new, shiny crypto-related stock in town: Bullish (BLSH). I love watching these stocks when they debut, which BLSH did on Wednesday the 13th (yesterday as of time of writing), because they tend to rocket up on their launch and then sell off later. It's a typical pattern we can watch over and over. Remember Coinbase's ( COIN ) IPO? That was mild, but followed the pattern many ""hot IPOs"" end up in. Data by YCharts And Circle earlier this year. Data by YCharts There are other examples, like the announcement of Upexi ( UPXI ) converting to a crypto treasury company, which caused the 600% jump before the sell-off. Data by YCharts The question isn't whether folks made money on these — some did and some didn't. It depends on where you bought in. No, the question is: should you buy in on Bullish now, considering it's in the middle of this movement? Bullish The Company Here is the Bullish timeline, from their founding in 2021 to the IPO: Bullish BLSH operates a crypto exchange as their primary business, but it has an edge, so to speak. It operates an automated market maker, or ""AMM,"" which is effectively an algorithm that works to collect bids and asks from across the exchange to provide ""deep liquidity,"" to use their marketing. They claim to have near-zero spreads even during times of volatility, which would make trading crypto on the platform very similar to trading stocks with most large brokers. Here's their direct marketing on the subject: Our proprietary Automated Market Maker (AMM) efficiently converts liquidity that is exclusively available on Bullish in the form of Automated Market Making Instructions into thousands of bids and offers. Once placed, these bids and offers create more predictable depth across varying market conditions. Bullish’s AMM evolves and improves upon the constant product market maker model (xy=k) often seen in DeFi. This makes Bullish more reliable and efficient than other exchanges—centralized or decentralized. Liquidity on Bullish is derived from customer assets in the form of AMM Instructions. This feature enables customers to seamlessly make markets on the Bullish Order Book by allocating their assets within specified trading parameters. Upon submitting an AMM Instruction, the Bullish AMM instantaneously generates thousands of individual bids and offers. As other market participants trade against these bids and offers, the customer who initiated the AMM Instruction can receive AMM payments through trading fees, spreads, and dynamic price adjustments when trades are matched against those specific bids and offers. The AMM works with tokens and derivatives, and can take custom instructions from institutional users on the Bullish platform. They claim to be able to take the limit order book, which looks like a jagged whipsaw, and create a smoother system without large spreads between bids and asks, which creates the staircase pattern in traditional books. While Bullish operates both books, the AMM book is their unique spin on it, and they claim it more reliable and efficient than other exchanges. Bullish Why does this matter? For most investors, it doesn't. For traders, and those traders interested in illiquid crypto token trading, this could make a huge difference and is actually a selling point. It's also a big selling point for many crypto hedge funds and large private traders (non-reporting smart money traders or ""whales"" in crypto-speak) which currently operate through other institutional exchanges that don't have the same systems, such as Coinbase, or through decentralized exchanges, which are far more prone to attracting bad actors. Both have their pros and cons, but Bullish is working on creating an exchange that combines the pros of institutional, centralized exchanges that are audited with the AMM of a decentralized exchange. Market share is the name of the game in the business of running an exchange, and so having an edge in bid/ask spreads, liquidity, and execution is critical. It's unclear yet, because Bullish is so new (founded in 2021), whether it is attractive enough to gather and hold onto assets. Gathering is one thing, keeping it is another. For now, the numbers in trading volume and liquidity look good and make them competitive with other exchanges in the marketplace. Bullish They own more than an exchange; they also operate CoinDesk, a crypto information service likely familiar to most investors in the cryptocurrency space. It's unclear to me how large the fees generated on the AUM are, but $41B is nothing to sneeze at, and index licensing fees can be expensive. Bullish They Have a Treasury The market loves crypto treasury companies, and it makes sense. This is the Strategy ( MSTR ) playbook: take out debt and convert operations cash into cryptocurrencies. Hold said cryptocurrencies. It's done really well for MSTR, to be fair. Data by YCharts Bullish doesn't seem to be using debt in the same way that MSTR is, but it is still hoarding a pile of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) for itself, with a market value around $2.8B assuming their pile is still around the 24,000 mark, but that was in Q1. Bullish That accounts for at least a third of BLSH's current market cap, not accounting for any premium given to the holdings, which is likely also present in propping up the nearly $10B BLSH now sits at after its IPO. Bullish Technical Analysis Let's take a look at BLSH's chart so far, now that it's been one full day from IPO, to the minute. Barchart Consolidation, the last low that set the new support floor, coincided with the lower Bollinger band (white) at the 70 level at the end of the day on IPO day. Now the 50 EMA (yellow) has set an upper ceiling, resistance at 82. Breaking down through the lower band with bearish momentum on both the MACD and PPO signal more weakness ahead. A base could form around the 70 mark again, unless we see volume increase significantly. This chart looks a little ugly right now, and I see us breaking down further unless BLSH can break above the 79 level on high volume. That would signal the potential to retest at the 82 level. That early volume may have been institutions like Ark Invest, who bought $2.5M shares , as well as frenzied traders trying to get in. The latter are the ones shaking out now, as the price falls on low volume. The frenzy is dying out, and more volume will be needed to push this stock any higher than it already is. If we see a break below 70, watch out for further pain. There's a reason it was priced at IPO at $32 and not the $118 peak it hit. The market may not be able to sustain that much hype. This is a stock that I am fundamentally bullish on, but the technicals are too ugly to walk in now. The chart, and the history of similar IPOs before this, say to wait it out and see for a retest of the 70 level in the coming days. Conclusion Ultimately, I have no doubt that traders both long and short have made money on Bullish so far. It is a business that, if their claims are true, may change the way institutional crypto traders operate, and could suck volume out of the decentralized exchanges — something Coinbase and other competitors have not been able to do. The edge Bullish's business has in its operations makes me bullish on it, but its price seems too high currently, still driven up by frenzied trading and infamous investors like Cathie Wood over at Ark Invest. We likely have more room to the downside in front of us, but I see another bottom forming soon before volume picks up. If volume doesn't pick up, it's likely that BLSH will have the strength to get back above $80 anytime soon. For that reason, it's a hold. I'll revisit this soon, in case that changes as the market plays out.

Key Takeaways: Crypto and fintech leaders urged President Trump to block bank fees for customer data access. The dispute centers on Biden’s 2024 open banking rule, which grants free third-party access to bank data. Banks accuse the crypto industry of seeking special treatment and government-backed price controls at their expense. In a letter sent Wednesday , executives accused major banks of attempting to “preserve their market position by imposing exorbitant new ‘account access’ fees” that would make it harder for consumers to connect their accounts to alternative financial products. Signatories included Gemini, Robinhood, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and the Blockchain Association. Crypto Leaders Tell Trump Bank Data Fees Could Cripple U.S. Digital Finance The group argued that these fees would damage the U.S. crypto, artificial intelligence, and digital payments industries, potentially shutting down services that depend on bank connectivity. “Severing this connection will drive innovation offshore and diminish U.S. influence,” the letter stated, linking the issue directly to Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. The dispute stems from an “open banking rule” finalized in October 2024 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under former President Joe Biden. The rule granted customers the right to share their bank data with third-party providers at no cost, a move widely celebrated by crypto companies but opposed by banking trade groups, which sued to block it. Trump initially supported efforts to scrap the rule, siding with banks, but reversed course in late July under lobbying pressure from the crypto industry. His administration has since told a federal judge it will keep the rule in place while working on a revised version. Crypto firms say free data access is essential for integrating bank accounts with their platforms, enabling seamless fiat-to-crypto transfers. Fintech and crypto execs are urging President Trump to stop banks like @JPMorgan from imposing predatory fees that will create new barriers and restrict your ability to control YOUR OWN banking data. It’s part of Big Banks’ plan to consolidate power, crush innovation, and limit… pic.twitter.com/LqGAMOJd1M — Will Hild (@WillHild) August 14, 2025 The letter to Trump argued that bank-imposed fees could “cripple innovative products” and jeopardize on-ramps to the digital asset ecosystem, undermining the president’s goal of making the US a safe harbor for crypto. Banking groups, led by the American Bankers Association, pushed back strongly on Wednesday. They accused the crypto industry of seeking “government price fixing” and demanding special treatment. “The double standard these companies want to perpetuate, where they may charge fees for service while banks are expected to provide the same service to these private companies for free, is absurd,” the ABA said in a statement. The ABA framed the letter’s signatories as “middlemen” trying to leverage Biden-era policies “for personal profit” while benefiting from banks’ significant investments in data security. Trump Administration Pushes Pro-Crypto Agenda The Trump administration advanced its pro-crypto agenda this week with a series of policy and regulatory moves. President Trump signed an executive order urging regulators to remove barriers that prevent 401(k) plans from including alternative assets such as cryptocurrencies. If implemented, the reforms could allow millions of Americans to allocate retirement funds to Bitcoin and other digital assets through regulated channels. Trump also nominated economist Stephen Miran , a digital asset advocate, to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, signaling continuity in his administration’s pro-crypto stance.

Without ruling out a possible fluctuation, analysts have been doubling down on DOGE and Unilabs Finance (UNIL) . While the Dogecoin price could go parabolic soon, UNIL is considered the best new crypto to invest in due to its blend of AI, DeFi and TradFi. Is the Ethereum Price Poised for a Pullback? The Ethereum price crossed $4,700 this week, but the Ethereum Foundation has been quietly selling off ETH. According to recent reports , $31.5 million in ETH was sold this week, coinciding with Monday’s record $1 billion in ETF inflows. Is a pullback on the horizon? Following the 30% Ethereum price rally on the weekly chart and a 60% gain over the past 30 days, a correction can’t be ruled out. Moreover, momentum has been declining, as shown by the unimpressive daily trading volume. Additionally, according to IntoTheBlock , there has been a decreasing netflow of $296 million over the past seven days, signaling increasing sales. While the Ethereum price is bound to break out above the 2021 high of $4,891, we might witness a pullback first before a bounce. Is the Dogecoin Price Ready for Its Big Leap? The Dogecoin price soared by 30% over the past month, hovering above $0.25 from a 30-day low of $0.18. Momentum has been rising, evident in the 50% increase in the daily trading volume to $4.28 billion. JMarks, unrelenting in their optimistic Dogecoin price prediction, eyes $1.20 this cycle . If this forecast plays out, the dog-inspired crypto will trade significantly above its 2021 ATH of $0.73, making it a top pick this year. Meanwhile, according to Messari , mindshare is high, suggesting growing investor interest. A retest of $0.28 is expected to push the Dogecoin price above $0.35, a move experts believe could play out in the coming days. Unilabs Finance (UNIL) — What Makes it the Next Big Thing? Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is unique in the sense that it combines three of the most bullish narratives: AI, DeFi and TradFi. At this crossroads, it has been hailed as a game-changer, with its unique offering revolving around a novel AI-backed DeFi asset manager. Moreover, as a presale token, it is significantly undervalued and heavily discounted, currently available at $0.0097 in its sixth ICO stage. With a 415% gain programmed at the listing price of $0.05, it is arguably the best new crypto to invest in—a better alternative than top altcoins with large market caps. Moreover, over $12.8 million has been raised by the team in funding, highlighting massive investor interest. Key features of this decentralized asset manager include a self-custodial asset vault and a cross-chain trading hub (users can trade across multiple blockchains). Hence, it edges out Uniswap, a leading DEX on Ethereum with a $7.5 billion market size and stands out more thanks to its yield-sharing strategy and periodic airdrops. Closing Thoughts While the Ethereum price faces a potential downtrend, the Dogecoin price is poised to explode amid rising momentum. At the same time, UNIL, a fast-growing AI token, is seen as the best new crypto to invest in due to its strong growth potential and connection to traditional finance (TradFi).

A seismic event just rattled the cryptocurrency world! Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, recently reported a massive DOGE transfer of 900,000,000 Dogecoin. This colossal sum, valued at approximately $208 million, moved from an unknown wallet directly to the Binance exchange. Such a significant Dogecoin transaction naturally sparks curiosity and speculation across the entire crypto market impact landscape. What does this enormous movement mean for Dogecoin and its investors? What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive DOGE Transfer Recently, the crypto community witnessed an eye-popping event. A staggering 900 million DOGE, Dogecoin’s native cryptocurrency, was sent from an unidentifiable wallet to Binance, one of the world’s largest digital asset exchanges. This kind of transaction is often associated with a “whale”—an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency. The Scale: 900,000,000 DOGE represents a significant portion of Dogecoin’s circulating supply, making this a noteworthy event. The Value: At the time of the transfer, this amount was worth around $208 million, highlighting the immense financial implications. The Destination: Moving funds to an exchange like Binance typically suggests an intent to sell, distribute, or utilize the assets for trading purposes. This Binance DOGE influx could influence market dynamics. Why Does a DOGE Whale Move Matter for Dogecoin Price? When a large holder, or a DOGE whale , moves such a substantial amount of tokens, it often sends ripples through the market. Why? Because these movements can signal potential future actions that might affect the Dogecoin price . While not always indicative of an immediate dump, preparing funds on an exchange gives the whale the option to sell quickly. Historically, large inflows to exchanges have sometimes preceded price volatility. However, it is crucial to remember that a transfer to an exchange does not automatically mean a sell-off will occur. The whale might be: Preparing to sell a portion of their holdings. Moving funds for staking or other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. Consolidating funds from multiple wallets. Participating in an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, though this is less common for direct exchange transfers. The sheer size of this DOGE transfer means it warrants close observation. Potential Crypto Market Impact and Binance’s Role The ripple effect of such a massive DOGE transfer extends beyond just Dogecoin. It can influence overall market sentiment and contribute to the broader crypto market impact . When a large amount of a popular meme coin like Dogecoin enters an exchange, it can create a perception of increased selling pressure, potentially leading to cautious behavior among other investors. Binance, as a central hub for cryptocurrency trading, plays a pivotal role in this scenario. The exchange handles enormous trading volumes daily, and the addition of 900 million DOGE to its reserves provides substantial liquidity for Binance DOGE trading pairs. This increased liquidity can be a double-edged sword: it facilitates larger trades without significant slippage, but it also means a large sell order could be executed more easily, potentially impacting the Dogecoin price more swiftly. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors In light of this significant DOGE whale activity, what should Dogecoin holders and prospective investors consider? Understanding market dynamics is key to making informed decisions. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources and whale tracking services like Whale Alert for real-time updates. Analyze Context: Don’t react solely to a single transaction. Look at broader market trends, Dogecoin’s fundamentals, and overall trading volume. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders to mitigate potential downside risks. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if your investment strategy is short-term trading based on volatility or long-term holding. Whale movements often have a more pronounced short-term effect. Diversify: Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies to reduce exposure to the volatility of a single asset. Every large Dogecoin transaction serves as a reminder that the crypto market is dynamic and can be influenced by significant holders. Conclusion: The Enduring Mystery of the DOGE Transfer The recent 900,000,000 DOGE transfer to Binance is undoubtedly a significant event in the Dogecoin ecosystem and the wider crypto market. While the exact intentions of the DOGE whale remain unknown, such movements highlight the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Whether this leads to a notable shift in Dogecoin price or simply adds to the liquidity on Binance, it serves as a powerful reminder for investors to remain vigilant and informed. The crypto market thrives on information, and understanding these large-scale movements helps us navigate its unpredictable waters. Keep an eye on the charts, and remember to always do your own research. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “crypto whale”? A: A crypto whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price with their transactions. Q2: Why is a 900,000,000 DOGE transfer significant? A: This DOGE transfer is significant because of its immense size ($208 million) and its potential to impact Dogecoin’s liquidity and price, especially when moved to a major exchange like Binance. Q3: Does this mean Dogecoin’s price will drop? A: Not necessarily. While a large inflow to an exchange can signal potential selling pressure, the whale might have other intentions, such as consolidating funds or participating in other activities. It does, however, increase the potential for volatility. Q4: How can I track large crypto transactions like this? A: Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting large cryptocurrency movements across various blockchains and exchanges. Many crypto news outlets also report on these significant transactions. Q5: What is Binance’s role in this DOGE transfer? A: Binance is the destination exchange, meaning the 900 million DOGE is now available on their platform. This provides significant liquidity for Binance DOGE trading pairs and makes the assets readily accessible for the whale to trade.

Experts have picked Cardano, Unilabs, and Tron as the best altcoins to buy now. Crypto Jaibrah predicts the Cardano price could soar to $2 by September and $4 by December. Tron is expected to surge to $0.45. Meanwhile, Unilabs (UNIL) is capturing attention with predictions that its value could pump by 5x. The presale gem has given early holders up to 100% ROI and has more up its sleeves. Cardano (ADA): Analysts Predict Major Breakout and Year-End Surge After a consistent spell of consolidation at $0.75 and $0.84, the Cardano price has surpassed the next psychological resistance of $0.95. CoinMarketCap shows the Cardano price has increased by 30.1% on the 7D chart. With sustained volume and higher buying pressure, the value of the DeFi crypto might cross $1.00 soon. The Cardano price is technically bullish. The RSI reads 62 which gives room for an uptrend. Supporting this bullish momentum is the ADI, which flashes a buy signal. Meanwhile, Crypto Jaibrah has shared a bullish outlook, forecasting that the Cardano price could hit $2 by September and reach a final target of $4.83 by December. This ambitious prediction suggests a strong rally ahead for ADA in the coming months. Supporting this view, Mr Brownstone says he fully anticipates a breakout in the Cardano price. He expects the DeFi coin to rise to $1.18 and $1.33. If these levels are cleared, Mr Brownstone forecasts the Cardano price might pump to $1.57. Tron (TRX) Price Holds Bullish Outlook as Key Resistance Level Nears ATOMB , a top crypto analyst, stated in a recent X post that the Tron price is still bullish. However, he argued that the $0.36 level will be the actual test of whether it can break out higher. He told his followers that if the Tron price stays above this level for an extended time, then it can surge up towards $0.42 and $0.45 levels, indicating strong potential for further increase. However, if Tron fails to hold $0.35, a pullback to $0.32 could happen. Another expert, Jack, posted a similar Tron price forecast. He noted that the value of the DeFi token could soar to $0.45. At the moment, CoinMarketCap data shows that the Tron price pumped by 7.5% on the 7D chart. The Tron price has crossed the $0.36 mark, a sign that buying pressure is rising. The Tron price requires a prolonged close above this level to start a rally. Unilabs (UNIL): The Best AI-Powered Hedge Fund Management Platform The DeFi market is gaining traction exponentially with the market size expected to rise to $231.19 billion in 2030.

In recent days, altcoins have surged following signs of possible U.S. rate cuts, with Ether breaking above $4,700. This wave of momentum draws attention to a bold, utility-focused contender that’s quietly gaining real traction. A wallet reveal in Q3 and a practical push for everyday crypto use hint at a very grounded challenger. It offers tangible tools and connects real people with cross-border solutions. It may well become one of the best crypto to buy now and a new altcoin to watch. Chainlink Rally: LINK Powers Higher on DeFi Use and Oracle Demand Chainlink just broke out to a seven-month high as new institutional partnerships and a token buyback fueled a 42% weekly rally. Analysts point to surging demand for Chainlink’s oracle services and growing institutional use cases. Recently, it was revealed that Chainlink whale transactions surged to the highest level in 3 months . Experts forecast LINK may hover between $23 and $30 through 2025, driven by its key role in DeFi and cross-chain systems. Some bullish models even project up to $38 in peak scenarios. Cardano’s Comeback: Bullish Charts Signal $1.50 Breakout Cardano is showing real strength. Trading around $0.90 after a 20% jump in a week, ADA looks poised for more, especially if it clears resistance at $0.94. Analysts highlight an inverse head-and-shoulders setup targeting $1.50 next. Crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, has said that Cardano price is currently mirroring the price structure of its last cycle, which is unfolding more slowly. It looks like ADA price is at the very start of an explosive move . Pepe Coin: Meme Icon Faces Mixed Forecasts Pepe Coin remains a community favorite, but forecasts vary. Some models say that after the sharp dump in late July, Pepe coin price broke out of the downtrend and is now making higher highs. If it gets a clean retest around the $0.0000100 zone (big support), bulls could push for the $0.0000130 level next and maybe $0.0000150 if current momentum holds . Optimistic analysts see room to pop as high as $0.00003044 in the near term. Yet, others warn of a 20–22% downturn from current levels, making PEPE a risky meme play. Remittix: Best Crypto to Buy Now and A Real-Use DeFi Power Remittix sits front and center among best cryptos to buy now, with real-use tools and a clear mission. Its Q3 wallet promises cross-chain support and simpler crypto transfers. Support starts with Ethereum and Solana. It stands apart from meme noise, offering concrete solutions for payments across borders. Compared with other tokens, its setup stands for true utility, strong tech and real community interest. Why Remittix Stands Out As The Best Crypto To Buy Now Security First: Audited by CertiK Built for borderless payments with global reach Momentum is building ahead of wallet launch Real-World Utility: Built for actual use — not just speculation Its Q3 wallet launch, recent beta reveal and a $250,000 giveaway are drawing real attention. It doesn’t stop there. Once Remittix reaches $20 million, the first CEX listing will be announced which shows its commitment towards securing higher liquidity and global reach. A Shift Toward Crypto with Practical Power As crypto markets evolve, it’s smarter to back tokens with real use, not just hype. Chainlink and Cardano offer strong fundamentals and chart patterns. Pepe holds meme culture appeal but carries volatility risks. A project like Remittix brings utility to users who want crypto that works in real life.

DeFi Education Fund Launches New Foundation According to the Wednesday press release , the DeFi Education Foundation will continue the digital asset-focused collective’s crypto advocacy work while giving donors the opportunity to benefit “from charitable giving incentives.” Today, we are thrilled to announce the launch of the DeFi Education Foundation — a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to furthering DEF’s mission of educating lawmakers about DeFi, protecting software developers, and advocating for sound DeFi policy. pic.twitter.com/Faw5myR7sw — DeFi Education Fund (@fund_defi) August 13, 2025 “We are thrilled to announce the launch of the DeFi Education Foundation (DEF) — a newly launched 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to furthering DEF’s mission of educating lawmakers about DeFi, protecting software developers, and promoting sound DeFi policy,” the press release states. “In-kind crypto donations to DeFi Education Foundation can be a more tax-efficient way to support DEF’s mission,” the organization added, stating that the move will be a “net-positive for many DEF donors.” “We remain unwaveringly focused on our advancing our mission on behalf of the DeFi industry, but with this new entity we have new benefits for our supporters,” the press release states. Navigating Crypto’s Regulatory Landscape News of the foundation’s launch comes the same week that its parent organization announced and a16z submitted proposals to the SEC to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to persuade the federal regulator to create a “safe harbor” for blockchain-powered apps amid regulatory uncertainty. The concern is that the SEC’s past approach could classify blockchain app developers as brokers, imposing burdensome registration and compliance requirements. “Requiring broker registration for neutral apps would force software developers to take on roles and responsibilities they never assumed—acting as gatekeepers, taking custody, and intermediating activity—all of which undermine the benefits of blockchain systems and create new risks for users,” a new blog post on the DeFi Education Fund’s website states. The launch of the foundation underscores the organization’s dual focus on advancing crypto advocacy and providing a tax-efficient way for supporters to back efforts addressing regulatory challenges like the SEC’s broker classification concerns.

Who would you choose to help you rebuild from the ashes? For Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, this isn’t just a thought experiment; it’s the dramatic framing for the company’s most exclusive internal club. In a revealing interview on the “Cheeky Pint” podcast published Wednesday, Tenev pulled back the curtain on a secretive group of 150 top-performing employees he has hand-picked to be the firm’s ideological and strategic core. This is not just a list of high-achievers; it’s a designated survival crew. The ‘apocalypse’ spiel The criteria for entry into this elite circle is simple: be one of the absolute best at the company. But the initiation is pure drama. “When I induct people into this community, I usually give a spiel,” Tenev explained. “If there was a disaster or some kind of apocalyptic scenario, and we had to rebuild Robinhood with 150 people, you would be in that group.” This “founder’s club,” as he calls it, is Tenev’s way of ensuring he maintains a direct line to the brightest minds across his organization, breaking free from the traditional constraints of the executive hierarchy. From budget tool to brain trust What began as a practical, compensation-focused tool to award budgets to the best performers has blossomed into something far more significant. Tenev, who co-founded the stock trading platform in 2013, said the group has since evolved into an “actual community” at the heart of the company, which went public in 2021 and is now valued at approximately $98.4 billion. This inner circle now serves as a high-level focus group and a vital feedback channel. “I go through the updated strategy or vision, we get those folks together, we get their feedback,” he said. “We do events. We have events in each city, and we get them together for dinners.” Merit over management Crucially, Tenev is adamant that the group is not just a reflection of the corporate ladder. With 2,300 full-time employees as of December 2024, he said he didn’t want the group to become 150 people “at the top of the org chart.” Instead, it includes individuals who demonstrate the most profound impact at every level of the company, ensuring that ground-level innovators have a seat at the table. This philosophy, he added, extends to the company’s broader culture, which “very much” concentrates promotions and rewards on the “best people in the company.” Robinhood declined to provide further comment to Business Insider on the initiative. Tenev isn’t the first Silicon Valley leader to create a clandestine club for top talent. In 2011, Fortune reported that Apple had a highly exclusive group called the “Top 100.” It was described as an invitation-only, off-site summit for the 100 most influential people at the company, where they would engage in three-day strategy sessions on top-secret projects. It served as a powerful reminder that within the world’s most innovative companies, there often exists an even more elite inner sanctum. Apple did not respond to a request for comment on whether the practice continues.

It’s very official now. Proud to be part of @coinbase https://t.co/CCUvGLbYLO — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) August 14, 2025 Crypto Derivatives Surging Deribit is the world’s leading crypto options exchange by volume and open interest, according to Coinbase. There is currently around $60 billion in open interest on the platform for all contracts, which saw over $1 trillion traded in the previous year. Open interest (OI) is the number or value of derivatives contracts that have yet to be settled or closed. Deribit also saw a record $185 billion in trading volume in July amid an institutional surge in crypto derivatives. Total Bitcoin futures OI is around $83 billion, according to CoinGlass, which lists the CME and Binance as market leaders. The $2.9 billion acquisition, which was announced in May , completes Coinbase’s derivatives product suite, which includes spot, futures, perpetuals, and options trading. Coinbase also stated that it expects Deribit to incur approximately $10 million in additional expenses for technology, development, and general administrative costs. The firm has acquired five companies so far this year, including Spindle, Roam, and Liquifi, as it aggressively expands its ambitions to become the “everything exchange.” In June, Deribit accepted BlackRock’s industry-leading USD Institutional Digital Fund (BUIDL) as collateral, giving investors a stable and yield-generating alternative. Coinbase Stock Up This Week Coinbase shares did not react to the announcement as the market had already priced it in. COIN ended the day flat, trading at around $325 after-hours, but has gained 4% over the past week as Bitcoin notched a new all-time high. The stock has performed well this year, gaining 31% since the beginning of 2025 and 65% since this time last year. COIN hit an all-time high of $420 on July 18, which was the same week that BTC first topped $120,000.

In a post accompanied by a multi-year XRP/BTC chart, he stated that the projection is based on Bitcoin reaching $270,000 and the XRP/BTC pair trading between 7,000 and 12,000 satoshis. According to him, this scenario is “probably in 2026,” suggesting that the timeline for such a move is not immediate but instead tied to broader market conditions over the next one to two years. Under these assumptions, an XRP/BTC ratio of 7,000 sats at a $270,000 Bitcoin price equates to roughly $19 per XRP, while 12,000 sats would correspond to around $32. This forms the basis for the price band outlined in his forecast. My macro target for $XRP this bull run is $19 – $32. This is based on 270K $BTC and 7K – 12K satoshi $XRPBTC . Probably in 2026. pic.twitter.com/1xVy9h4Zfc — Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) August 13, 2025 Probability for Near-Term Price Move In a reply to a question from X user Ripple Van Winkle, who asked whether $9 for XRP in September remains likely, Dr Cat clarified that his timeframe was September to December. He placed the probability of XRP reaching that level within the period at 40–50 percent. However, he added that if this target is not met, “the chance for a monster rally to 20–30 in 2026 increases A LOT.” His comments indicate that the $9 figure is an intermediate milestone rather than the ultimate target. Failure to achieve it in the stated timeframe does not invalidate the larger projection. Instead, in his view, it would significantly raise the likelihood of a sharp rally to the higher $20–$30 range during 2026, provided the underlying BTC and XRP/BTC assumptions hold. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart analysis and technical context The chart attached to the post is a two-month XRP/BTC chart from Binance, incorporating Ichimoku indicators, historical price action, and key horizontal resistance levels. The current XRP/BTC value is around 0.00002666 BTC, or approximately 2,666 sats. Red horizontal lines are drawn near 7,000 sats and 12,000 sats, marking the zones that form the basis of Dr Cat’s price targets. The chart also features an extended Ichimoku cloud projection, showing a shaded area into the late 2020s, with structure around the target zones aligning with his suggested 2026 timeframe. Volume data and a long-term moving average provide additional context for the market’s trend over the past decade. Dr Cat’s projection is derived from a straightforward calculation that links Bitcoin’s peak price and XRP’s relative strength against it. Despite the uncertainty about timing, Dr Cat maintains that the core thesis remains intact. The September–December window offers an intermediate opportunity for significant upside, but if missed, it could set the stage for a stronger move in 2026.

The comprehensive circular sets minimum requirements for wallet infrastructure, transaction verification, and access controls as the regulator prepares the industry for advanced custody technologies under its “ASPIRe” roadmap. The Hong Kong SFC issued new guidance for virtual asset trading platforms to strengthen custody standards, citing global security incidents and gaps found in a recent review. The circular outlines minimum requirements for wallet infrastructure, access controls, and management… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) August 15, 2025 Global Security Crisis Prompts Regulatory Intervention The SFC’s action comes amid a devastating wave of crypto security breaches, with hackers stealing funds in as little as four seconds, 75 times faster than average exchange alert systems can respond. Just yesterday, Aug 14, Turkish exchange BtcTurk became the latest victim with a suspected $48 million multi-chain attack targeting hot wallets across seven blockchain networks, marking the second major breach for the exchange within 14 months. Global crypto losses reached $2.47 billion across 344 incidents in the first half of 2025, with wallet-related breaches accounting for $1.7 billion across just 34 attacks. The Bybit exchange suffered the most significant single loss at $1.5 billion in February, while infrastructure attacks dominated 80% of stolen funds through compromised private keys and inadequate access controls. Regulatory Response Intensifies as Attack Sophistication Grows Dr Eric Yip, the SFC’s Executive Director of Intermediaries, emphasized that “client asset protection must always remain a top priority for all licensed VATPs” amid heightened global risks. The new standards address key vulnerabilities, including compromised third-party wallet solutions, insufficient transaction verification processes, and inadequate access controls over approval devices. According to a report Cryptonews covered yesterday, the SFC and Hong Kong Monetary Authority issued a joint warning about market volatility linked to stablecoin licensing speculation, cautioning investors against basing decisions on “misleading prospects of gains from short-term price volatility.” Global regulatory differences on stablecoin may influence issuer location decisions and adoption as Hong Kong implements its regime. #hongkong #hk #stablecoin https://t.co/bwww2I8wVA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 14, 2025 HKMA Chief Executive Eddie Yue confirmed that only a small number of stablecoin licenses will be granted initially despite engaging with dozens of interested parties. As of July 30, Hong Kong has licensed only 11 virtual asset platforms , with nine under review, implementing expedited licensing procedures since January 2025. The government accelerated tokenization efforts with approved products, including gold tokens and money market funds, while exploring real estate and private equity tokenization through Project Ensemble infrastructure. Over 40 companies have submitted stablecoin license inquiries , even before the August 1 regulation took effect. Major firms, including JD.com, Ant Group, Standard Chartered, and Circle, publicly stated application intentions, while law firms report managing consultations for additional candidates finalizing materials. Crypto Security Deteriorates as Recovery Efforts Lag Blockchain analytics firm Global Ledger revealed that hackers moved funds in 68% of cases before attacks became publicly known, with one-quarter fully laundering stolen assets before any alerts were issued. The fastest fund movement occurred just four seconds after exploitation, while the fastest complete laundering process took 2 minutes 57 seconds. North Korea-linked groups, including Lazarus, accounted for $1.6 billion or 70% of total stolen amounts in the first half of 2025. The sophisticated actors plan movements to coincide with normal transaction activity, typically striking around noon when organizations experience staff shifts and reduced vigilance. July crypto hack losses surge 27% to $142 million with CoinDCX's $44 million insider breach and GMX's $42 million exploit leading victims. #July #CryptoHack https://t.co/4UCMKaxUvI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 Infrastructure attacks targeting centralized exchanges contributed to 54% of total losses, with hackers exploiting high-value single points of failure. Personal wallets and token contracts followed at 11.7% and 17.2% respectively, while DeFi platforms, bridges, and gaming projects suffered additional losses. Recovery efforts returned only $187 million through law enforcement , white-hat arrangements, and exchange cooperation, representing just 4.2% of stolen funds. Legal frameworks have failed to evolve quickly enough to match the speed of digital asset activities, creating challenges for international cooperation and asset seizure. Notably, physical violence against crypto holders has also escalated with 32 “wrench attacks” reported globally in 2025, putting the year on pace to exceed 2021’s record. Nearly one-third occurred in France, where attackers increasingly target family members through kidnapping and mutilation attempts, demanding ransom payments.

Die Freude darüber währte allerdings nicht lange. Innerhalb weniger Stunden rutschte der Kurs um fast sechs Prozent ab und markierte damit den stärksten Tagesverlust seit mehreren Monaten. Für erfahrene Marktteilnehmer ist eine solche Korrektur in einem Bullenmarkt nicht ungewöhnlich. Nach längeren Aufwärtsphasen sind Gewinnmitnahmen und kurze Abkühlungen oft Teil des Musters. Dennoch fiel der Rückgang genau in eine Phase, in der viele mit einem stabilen Durchbruch über die Bestmarke gerechnet hatten. Bitcoin Chart zeigt das kurze Intermezzo, Quelle: www.coinmarketcap.com PPI-Daten als Auslöser Der zeitliche Ablauf zeigt eine deutliche Verbindung zu den neuen US-Daten zum Producer Price Index (PPI). Dieser Index misst, wie sich die Preise auf Produzentenebene entwickeln, und gilt als wichtiger Frühindikator für die Inflation. Die aktuellen Werte lagen über den Erwartungen. Das sorgte für Unruhe, weil es die Annahme schwächt, dass die US-Notenbank im September die Zinsen senken wird. Für risikoreiche Assets wie Bitcoin kann das Gegenwind bedeuten. Während die US-Börsen die anfänglichen Verluste rasch wieder aufholten, blieben Bitcoin und Gold tiefer im Minus. Die parallelen Bewegungen bei beiden Anlageklassen deuten darauf hin, dass Anleger zunächst in sichere Liquidität umschichteten. Fast gleichzeitig kam eine weitere Nachricht aus Washington: Das US-Finanzministerium stellte klar, dass aktuell keine Pläne bestehen, Bitcoin als Teil der Staatsreserven zu erwerben. Zwar war dies für den Markt keine große Überraschung, dennoch trug die Meldung dazu bei, die Unsicherheit zu verstärken. In einem Umfeld, in dem Kurse auf Rekordniveau stehen, reichen schon kleine Impulse, um stärkere Bewegungen auszulösen. BIG BREAKING RUMOURS OF JEROME POWELL WILL RESIGN IN AUGUST pic.twitter.com/ZBajbcPrdb — BITCOINLFG® (@bitcoinlfgo) August 15, 2025 Marktstruktur bleibt positiv Trotz des Rücksetzers ist die langfristige Struktur weiterhin klar aufwärtsgerichtet. Mehrere Analysen sehen in diesem Zyklus Kursziele zwischen 150.000 und 200.000 US-Dollar als realistisch an, sofern sich die makroökonomischen Rahmenbedingungen nicht deutlich verschlechtern. Kurzfristig prägen jedoch Liquidationen und schnelle Richtungswechsel das Bild. Am Tag des Rückgangs wurden Long-Positionen im Wert von rund 800 Millionen US-Dollar aufgelöst, davon etwa 160 Millionen allein in Bitcoin. Solche Kettenreaktionen verstärken Abwärtsbewegungen und halten die Volatilität hoch. Im Blick vieler Anleger steht jetzt nicht nur die Frage, wann Bitcoin den Weg nach oben wieder aufnimmt, sondern auch, welche Altcoins in der Zwischenzeit überdurchschnittlich profitieren könnten. Selbst wenn Bitcoin im aktuellen Zyklus tatsächlich auf 200.000 US-Dollar steigen sollte, würde das vom aktuellen Niveau aus „nur“ etwa 60 bis 70 Prozent Rendite bedeuten. Projekte, die noch am Anfang stehen, können in derselben Marktphase jedoch um ein Vielfaches zulegen. Einer dieser Kandidaten ist Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) . Die Layer-2-Lösung verbindet die Sicherheit und Dezentralität von Bitcoin mit der Geschwindigkeit der Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), die als schnellste Ausführungsumgebung im Krypto-Sektor gilt. Vorverkauf des Hyper Memecoins steht schon fast 10 Millionen, Quelle: https://bitcoinhyper.com/de Technische Grundlage und Token-Nutzen Über eine spezielle Brücke werden Bitcoin ins Hyper-Netzwerk transferiert und dort als Wrapped BTC (WBTC) genutzt. Diese können in DeFi-Projekten, im Gaming, für NFTs oder Zahlungen eingesetzt werden – alles mit der Performance einer Hochgeschwindigkeits-Blockchain. Wer zurück ins Hauptnetz möchte, verbrennt seine WBTC und erhält die ursprünglichen BTC zurück. Der HYPER-Token wird für Transaktionsgebühren benötigt, ermöglicht den Zugang zu bestimmten Anwendungen und soll nach Start der DAO auch für Abstimmungen genutzt werden. Steigt die Nutzung des Netzwerks, steigt auch die Nachfrage nach dem Token. Derzeit kostet ein HYPER-Token noch 0,012725 US-Dollar. Diese Preisstufe gilt jedoch nur für die nächsten 28 Stunden, danach erfolgt automatisch eine Erhöhung. Im bisherigen Presale hat das Projekt bereits über 9 Millionen US-Dollar eingesammelt – ein Zeichen für reges Interesse, gerade bei einem risikoreichen Memecoin. Gerade in einer Marktphase, in der Altcoins wie Ethereum, Solana oder Ripple zweistellige Zuwächse verzeichnen, könnte Bitcoin Hyper von einer beginnenden Kapitalrotation profitieren. Für Anleger, die neben Bitcoin auf ein risikorieche aber prozentual deutlich höhere Renditechancen setzen wollen, könnte das Projekt daher eine spannende Ergänzung im Portfolio sein.

50118791,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=408717,1755243333,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/50118791.jpeg,"Crypto Price Analysis August-15: ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL, and HYPE",https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-price-analysis-august-15-eth-xrp-ada-sol-and-hype/,"This Friday, we examine Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Hyperliquid in greater detail. Ethereum (ETH) For the first time in four years, Ethereum is about to test the all-time high at $4,868. The price is less than 4% from that level at the time of this post. Due to this stellar performance, ETH is also up by 19% this week. The asset is about to enter one of the most exciting periods when price discovery starts. Once ETH manages to turn $4,900 – $5,000 into a key support, the race is on for a new ATH. Volatility will explode as bulls and bears battle for dominance. Looking ahead, Ethereum looks very strong here and appears determined to break the current ATH. Once that is cleared, the price has the way opened towards $6,000 and $7,000 as first targets. Longer term, ETH could approach $9,000 or even $10,000 if the rally is sustained. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP remained under the $3.2 resistance this week and booked a 6% loss. This is not very reassuring, considering most altcoins made good progress this week and are in green. Unfortunately for XRP, the momentum is not there because it already had a strong rally in July. Therefore, buyers appear exhausted, or they have moved to the Ethereum ecosystem, where the price action is more attractive. Looking ahead, as long as the asset can stay above the $3 support, it has a good shot at rallying later once money rotates back from other altcoins like Ethereum or Cardano. With this in mind, the current trend is flat, and the price may consolidate further around $3. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) Cardano had a fantastic week after it managed to break the $0.90 resistance and touched $1 briefly before the price pulled back. This allowed it to book a 20% gain this week! Excitement is returning to ADA, and the price action shows it. The next objective for bulls is to reclaim $1 and hold that level as support. If they are successful, then this cryptocurrency has a great shot at much higher levels in the second part of 2025. The most important target beyond $1 is $1.3 right now. Looking ahead, ADA is found in a strong rally that can catapult the price above $1 and even pass the $1.3 high from December 2024 if buyers remain aggressive. That would open the way towards $1.5 afterwards. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Good news for Solana holders as the price is attempting to reclaim the $200 level. This week, buyers tried twice to hold the price above $200, but were rejected so far. Nevertheless, each attempt puts Solana closer to turning this level into support. In terms of price action, SOL also had a great week, closing it with a 13% gain. The chart remains bullish with clear higher highs and lows. If nothing changes in the current momentum, a price above $200 is only a matter of time. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency has good support at $186 if sellers return. The current resistance is found at $200 and $227, which will need to be broken if the bulls want to sustain the current uptrend. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) Hype managed an impressive recovery in the past week, closing it with a 20% price increase. This allowed it to return close to the all-time high at $50. At the time of this post, the price is at $48.5. With another push, buyers could break above $50 for the first time ever. After a sustained correction in late July, this reversal was sharp and quick, showing that buyers were only waiting for a good opportunity to return. Bulls appear determined to send HYPE much higher in the coming months. Looking ahead, if HYPE manages to turn $50 into a key support, then it will enter price discovery like Ethereum above $5,000. After that, key targets will be found at $54, $60, and $66. Hopefully, sellers stay put at $50 and don’t return there to stop the ongoing rally.

50118934,https://finbold.com/?p=251107,1755243640,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"Crypto market cap hits new all-time high, but instability looms",https://finbold.com/crypto-market-cap-hits-new-all-time-high-but-instability-looms/,"The crypto market roared to new heights this week, with the total market capitalization of digital assets hitting a new all-time high on Monday of almost $4.15 trillion, according to Coinmarketcap. That number beats the previous all-time high set in July, and although the market cap has since fallen back slightly to $3.96 trillion as of the time of writing, overall sentiment remains strong, with the market bracing itself for fresh gains in the coming days. Large-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are leading the charge with some of the most significant price increases. Bitcoin came within a hair of its all-time high of $123,091 on Monday, hitting $122,321 before tapering off. But the biggest gainer has been Ethereum , which crossed the $4,000 threshold at the weekend and surged to a high of $4,351.7, edging closer to its all-time high of $4,891.7 attained back in November 2021. Its value has soared more than 45% in the last month, with gains of just over 18% in the last seven days. Ethereum leads the charge Ethereum’s surge is thought to be driven by increased institutional interest in the asset, which powers much of the crypto DeFi ecosystem. In recent weeks, publicly-traded companies like SharpLink have added massive amounts of ETH to their corporate treasuries, seeing the asset as an alternative long-term store of value to BTC that boasts superior yield-generating capabilities. Data from strategicethreserve.xyz shows that 64 corporations now hold around 3.49 million ETH (valued at $15.05 billion), representing 2.89% of its total circulating supply. Still, even with Ethereum’s unprecedented momentum, Bitcoin continues to gain traction in terms of institutional inflows. Strategy, the world’s largest corporate BTC holder, acquired 21,021 BTC in July, worth around $2.46 billion, while large entities as a whole added 26,700 BTC to their balance sheets. All told, public and privately-owned companies now hold around 1.35 million BTC, or approximately 6% of the total supply, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. Ethereum’s momentum is so strong that a number of analysts are forecasting yet more gains to come this week. Crypto entrepreneur and investor Ted Pillows posted on X that the ETH breakout is underway, exactly as he predicted it would play out, and said it won’t be long until we see a new all-time high for the world’s second-most valuable cryptocurrency: I told you that the $ETH breakout is coming. And it happened exactly as predicted. Ethereum has smashed through its resistance and is now heading higher. It feels like a new ATH is just a matter of days now. pic.twitter.com/XCxetoP0Ku — Ted (@TedPillows) August 9, 2025 Incentives drive market activity However, while bullish sentiment in the crypto markets appears to be overwhelming, other analysts argue that there’s a lack of stability behind the current surge. Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of the crypto market maker and investor DWF Labs , pointed out that market activity does not necessarily equate to market stability, and noted that we’re not seeing a return of long-term capital. “What we are seeing is fast capital rotation across reward programs, yield-based tokens and speculative assets, without much structural commitment,” Grachev said. “Bitcoin’s market share has dropped from 65% in June to around 61% now, which reflects a shift away from fundamentals.” Grachev went on to explain that much of the current market activity is being driven by incentives, with participants looking to farm points, positioning themselves for airdrops, or otherwise chasing token launches. While these kinds of behaviors generate short-term flow, they do not contribute to more durable liquidity, he said. Of bigger concern, according to Grachev, is that many of these incentives appear to be drying up, which threatens to undermine the current surge of market activity “Borrowing rates across many decentralized platforms have also dropped, and in several high-profile stablecoin pools, yields have declined from over 60% earlier this year to under 5%,” Grachev noted. “This is not just a sign of increased competition. It shows that the incentives driving participation are weakening, even as volumes appear strong. Pro-crypto policies boost sentiment Despite the lack of fundamentals underpinning the market’s growth, crypto prices have been propped up to a degree by some encouraging signs on the regulatory front. For instance, U.S. President Donald Trump issued two crypto-friendly executive orders last week, following on from last month’s signing into law of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act. The first of those orders, issued August 7, instructed federal regulators to reassess their current guidance on whether or not to approve alternative assets such as crypto in employer-sponsored retirement plans. The order was seen as a massive potential windfall for crypto, with the total value of assets in 401(k)s estimated at some $8.7 trillion at the end of the first quarter. Just hours after opening up 401(k)s to digital assets, Trump issued a second order asking financial institutions to end the practice of “debanking” customers based on their business activities, polities and religious beliefs. This was apparently an effort to address complaints in the crypto industry that banks are effectively engaged in some kind of conspiracy, shutting down individuals’ and businesses’ accounts due to their crypto dealings. “Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was real,” said Paul Grewal, chief legal officer Coinbase, in a post on X , referring to the name of the alleged conspiracy. “And now we see real action taken to fix it.” Liquidity volumes misleading The ongoing pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration will likely continue to boost bullish sentiments in the digital asset markets, but Grachev nonetheless warned institutional investors to act cautiously, noting that the headline volumes are misleading. “Real liquidity is defined by the ability to enter and exit positions reliably, especially in stressed conditions,” he asserted. Grachev said he’s watching three metrics very closely – stablecoin redemption patterns, changes in funding rates across crypto exchanges, and the pace of on-chain borrowing, as he believes that weaknesses in these are usually some of the earliest signs of structural pressure. “In the past three weeks, we’ve seen tail liquidity on certain altcoin pairs fall by over 40% during daily volatility spikes,” he explained. “That means even modest sell pressure can move prices sharply. However, Grachev stressed that his comments do not represent an operational forecast. “It’s an operational view based on what we see across books and venues each day,” he said. “In this environment, understanding how liquidity behaves matters more than following where the price moves.” Featured image via Shutterstock.

Key Takeaways: Czech police arrested convicted drug trafficker Tomas Jirikovsky over a $45M Bitcoin donation. The donation, accepted without verification by former Justice Minister Pavel Blazek, sparked a political scandal. Justice Minister Eva Decroix plans to release a detailed case timeline. The National Centre for Combating Organised Crime confirmed it carried out raids on Thursday, seizing assets as part of an investigation now centered on suspected money laundering and drug trafficking. The case, overseen by the High Public Prosecutor’s Office in Olomouc, was recently separated from a broader probe disclosed in May. Czech Bitcoin Donor Jirikovsky Detained in Breclav Jirikovsky, identified by local media as the donor of 468 bitcoin to the justice ministry, was detained at a property in Breclav, Echo24 reported . The cryptocurrency was transferred earlier this year and accepted by then-Justice Minister Pavel Blazek without verifying its origins. Blazek resigned in May after revelations that the funds came from Jirikovsky, a convicted darknet operator previously imprisoned for drug trafficking. A July audit ordered by Blazek’s successor, Eva Decroix, concluded the ministry should never have accepted the donation due to the high risk it represented proceeds of crime. The scandal has shaken the Czech political landscape. In June, Prime Minister Petr Fiala’s center-right coalition narrowly survived a no-confidence vote triggered by the controversy, with 98 lawmakers voting to keep the government against 94 calling for its removal.

Prosecutors said Thursday’s raids were aimed at “clarifying the case” and securing persons and property, declining to provide more details to protect the investigation’s integrity. Decroix, who took over as justice minister in May, has pledged to publish an expanded case timeline this week containing more than 8,000 entries, as public scrutiny intensifies ahead of October’s parliamentary elections. Crypto Hacks, Scams Cost Investors $2.2B in H1 2025: CertiK Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion. Without these, losses align more closely with previous years at around $690 million. Ethereum remained the primary target, suffering over $1.6 billion in losses across 175 events. The report also pointed to rising sophistication of phishing schemes and ongoing risks from social engineering, urging crypto users to verify links, avoid suspicious sites, and use hardware wallets.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $25.28 Market cap $10.67B Trading volume $1.41B Circulating supply 422.27M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $25.62 24-hour low $23.24 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 5.37% 50-day SMA $21.87 200-day SMA $22.82 Sentiment Bullish Green days 17/30 (57%) Fear and Greed Index 75 (Greed) Avalanche price analysis As of August 15, AVAX’s price rose by 1.78% in 24 hours, slightly outpacing Bitcoin and aligning with the broader altcoin momentum. Its trading volume also rose (66.65%), showing greater conviction in the market trend. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Last month, AVAX attempted a recovery, which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $27.38. It faced strong resistance at its 30-day macro supply zone ($27.00-$27.38), a level that triggered 3 rejections since March 2025. AVAX attempted again this month and managed to reach $25, outpacing the wider crypto market. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is rising. The histograms (0.12) show positive momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s run with strong support at $22.33.

Technical analysis suggests that Avalanche is bullish. It should move upwards over the short term. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX up? AVAX is up after correcting from the month’s low. AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment and technical overextension. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors.

Analysts see 65x for new ETH token,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/15/bnb-hits-new-ath-is-eth-next-analysts-see-65x-for-new-eth-token/,"BNB Price just shattered its previous record, rallying near $865 and institutional interest is surging. Ethereum is picking up pace too, eclipsing $4,000. However, a bold new token tied to real-world payments and launching its listing could offer returns far beyond the usual altcoin routine. Ethereum may rally but Remittix (RTX) looks primed to steal headlines. BNB price reaches new heights, fueled by institutional demand BNB Price soared to a fresh all-time high of $865, up about 12% this week, with bulls eyeing the $1,000 mark supported by heavy institutional inflows and a healthy on-chain burn rate. The BNB Chain is processing over 12.4 million daily transactions and manages an $11.2 billion stablecoin market post-upgrade, reinforcing its utility beyond speculation. Ethereum gains momentum, could it be a slow climb or structural breakout? Ethereum has reclaimed the $4,000 level as ETFs and institutions pour in, posting over $2.27 billion in weekly ETF inflows, the strongest performance since their launch. Whale and institutional accumulation continue, with companies like BitMine Immersion acquiring hundreds of thousands of ETH. Technicals and capital interest are pointing to a rally beyond $5,000 if obstacles fall. Remittix (RTX) stakes its claim with real-world utility and listing milestones Remittix now trades around $0.0944, enjoying a 20–25% run-up in recent sessions as cash pours out of old altcoins into projects with infrastructure. The project has raised over $19 million, is just shy of its $20 million listing trigger and will reveal its first CEX partner once the milestone is hit, earning credibility ahead of execution. Its Q3 wallet beta and $250,000 giveaway add momentum while delivering payments utility and trust. Here’s why Remittix is gaining ground: Instant crypto-to-bank transfers across 30+ countries Built trust with a CertiK contract audit Addresses a $19 trillion real-world payments gap First CEX name reveal tied to hitting $20M funds Q3 2025 wallet beta slated to accelerate adoption Real utility is winning investor conviction BNB Price is capturing headlines and Ethereum is drawing institutional investors with ETF flows and structural strength. Yet Remittix stands apart. It isn’t riding trends, it’s shaping them with real product, clear milestones and a lean toward global adoption. While BNB and ETH climb on narrative and momentum, Remittix is building the rails that could deliver outsized gains once the listing news drops. Its fusion of infrastructure, beta deployment and a high-value giveaway is putting it at the center of the next wave in crypto.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-15 08:00:00

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is ready to reclaim crucial resistance levels and hit new highs in the coming months. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes ‘Final Boss’ Level, But Analyst Says Weekly Close Is Key For Price Discovery Run Cardano Holds Crucial Support Despite Pullback On Thursday, Cardano experienced an 11% drop after surpassing the $1.00 barrier for the first time since March. ADA’s retracement was fueled by the crypto market’s pullback, which saw massive liquidations throughout the day. According to CoinGlass data, the crypto market saw over $1.05 billion in liquidations over the last 24 hours, driven by higher-than-expected macroeconomic signals. Notably, the PPI number revealed an annual headline inflation of 3.3%, way higher than the 2.5% forecast. Additionally, the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the US government will not be purchasing additional Bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR), established by President Trump in March 2025. Instead, the US will stop selling its BTC holdings and continue to build up the reserve’s stash through confiscated assets. As a result, Bitcoin, which hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 on Wednesday night, retraced to the $117,000-$118,000 support zone, while the rest of the market turned red. Nonetheless, Cardano has gone against the current, becoming the only cryptocurrency in the top 50 list to remain in green despite the broader market pullback, with a 3.5% increase in the daily timeframe. In the last 24 hours, ADA has broken out of its local range, hitting a five-month high of $1.02 on Thursday morning. Amid the market drop, ADA held above its breakout level, hovering between the $0.89-$0.91 range over the past few hours, and it’s attempting to break out of its current levels. ADA To Repeat Last Cycle’s Playbook? Analyst Ali Martinez noted that ADA has been trading within a descending channel since the Q4 2024 rally, which saw the cryptocurrency hit its multi-year high of $1.32 in December. During this period, Cardano has attempted to break out of the descending resistance twice, finally passing this barrier after surging above the $0.84 mark. To the analyst, a confirmed breakout from this level targets a 70% run to $1.50. Previously, Martinez suggested that ADA is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, but it’s more gradual. Other analysts have also noted that the altcoin appears to be repeating its 2020-2021 playbook. Crypto Yhodda highlighted that after hitting its 2018 high, Cardano saw an ABC corrective wave before consolidating within an ascending broadening wedge formation for two years. The cryptocurrency consolidated near the range-high after rejection from the pattern’s resistance in 2020, and before breaking out to its 2021 ATH of $3.09. This cycle, the altcoin has repeated the same movements, accumulating within the same pattern since 2022. Since being rejected from the ascending resistance in late 2024, ADA has been trading between the mid and high zones of this pattern. Related Reading: SUI Set Up For Another Leg?

50119947,557321,1755244855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50119947.jpeg,Citigroup Executive Confirms Plans To Offer Stablecoin And Crypto ETF Custody,https://bitcoinist.com/citigroup-confirms-plans-to-offer-stablecoin/,"Amid pro-crypto policies emerging from the US Congress toward crypto assets, American multinational investment bank, Citigroup, is contemplating the introduction of stablecoin custody services and crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Citigroup’s Goal For Crypto Biswarup Chatterjee, Citigroup’s global head of partnerships and innovation for its services division, indicated that the bank is primarily focused on providing custody services for the high-quality assets that support stablecoins. In a recent interview with Reuters, he emphasized the importance of this initiative within Citi’s broader services business, which encompasses treasury management, cash management, and payment solutions for large corporations. Although Citigroup had previously mentioned its interest in potentially launching its own stablecoin, the bank has not elaborated on its comprehensive plans for digital assets until now. In addition to stablecoin custody, Citigroup is also exploring services for managing digital assets that underlie crypto-related investment products. According to Reuters, the rise of ETFs that track Bitcoin’s (BTC) spot price has created an increasing need for custody services. The largest of these ETFs, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), boasts a market capitalization of around $90 billion, necessitating secure management of an equivalent amount of digital currency to support these financial products. Currently, Coinbase dominates the custody business for crypto exchange-traded funds, serving as custodian for over 80% of their issuers. Citigroup aims to carve out its own niche in this sector, with plans to leverage stablecoins to enhance the speed of payments, which in traditional banking can often take several days or more. Considering The Creation Of Its Own Stablecoin Per the report, Citi’s current offerings include “tokenized” US dollar payments that utilize a blockchain network to facilitate transactions around the clock between accounts in major financial hubs like New York, London, and Hong Kong. The bank is working on developing services that would allow clients to transfer stablecoins between accounts or convert them into dollars for instant payments. Chatterjee noted that discussions with clients are ongoing to explore various use cases for these services. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency has shifted under the Trump administration, which took a more lenient approach to the expansion of traditional financial institutions into the crypto space. However, Reuters highlights that Citigroup and its peers will still need to navigate existing regulations, including those related to anti-money laundering (AML) and currency controls, particularly for international transactions. Chatterjee emphasized the importance of ensuring that crypto assets used in custody services are sourced from legitimate origins, as well as the necessity of bolstering cybersecurity and operational protocols to protect against theft. The potential issuance of a stablecoin by Citigroup is also being considered, signaling the bank’s commitment to adapting to the cryptocurrency industry.

50120152,https://invezz.com/?p=2839994,1755244869,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,How SOL underperformance has led holders to a viral altcoin dubbed ‘the next XRP’,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/15/how-sol-underperformance-has-led-holders-to-a-viral-altcoin-dubbed-the-next-xrp/,"Solana price has slipped into second-tier performance among big altcoins. A slide of nearly 3% today, even as Bitcoin makes new highs, is raising eyebrows. Yet investors are buzzing about a fast-rising altcoin being tagged “The Next XRP.” Remittix enters that conversation with its payment focus, live utility, and a reveal-ready CEX listing once it kicks off $20 Million. Chains like Solana might offer scale, but market appetite is shifting toward real-world solutions and that shift frames the Remittix narrative. Solana’s blues despite broader market rally Solana price currently sits near $195, but is holding behind bigger gains in other chains. That level brings a faint pulse to traders, but underperformance is subtle in the trendlines compared to peers rallying faster. Weakness is showing on several charts, with analysts cautioning that SOL may continue trailing Ethereum, BNB and XRP throughout 2025. Even so, Solana isn’t being dismissed wholesale; its low fees and rich ecosystem still hold value. But for holders, this slow grind undercuts meme-worthy hype and offers little persuasive momentum, prompting many to eye alternatives labelled “the next big breakout.” Why one altcoin is gaining hype as ‘XRP 2.0’ That altcoin is Remittix (RTX). Solana still benefits from its decentralization and a growing developer ecosystem, but a recent soft patch has left openings that rivals could exploit. Remittix builds on crypto’s utility-first promises, offering practical payment tools right now. Interest in RTX has gone viral; many compare its mission to how XRP aimed to bridge banks and crypto, but Remittix is already executing that vision. Whales and retail investors are tuning in. Its live utility roadmap, market momentum and growing chatter make it more than hype; it’s becoming a working alternate narrative to Solana’s story. What Remittix (RTX) brings that Solana doesn’t Remittix now trades at about $0.0944, rallying over 20% recently as investors shift toward utility and payment rails. The project has raised over $19.6 million and sold 600 million tokens, with anticipation building for its $20 million CEX listing reveal. Here’s why it’s getting tagged “the next XRP”: Solving a real-world $19 trillion payments problem Wallet beta set for Q3 2025 with multi-chain support Audited by CertiK for built-in transparency Cross-border crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries Over $19.6 Million raised already, setting up CEX-listing reveal when $20 Million is hit Why some think Remittix could outshine Solana SOL continues to wobble and that leaves space for challengers. While Solana gives developers a robust playground, its lack of upside in recent weeks has investors hunting for faster-moving utility options. Remittix is the living contrast of active payment features, a coming wallet rollout and the looming $250,000 giveaway anchoring the hype. Solana may carry long-term credibility, but its recent performance keeps it from catching headlines. Meanwhile, Remittix is being whispered about as “XRP 2.0,” getting investor attention for pragmatic execution not theory. If its wallet launch stays on track for Q3 and the CEX listing reveals drops on cue, Remittix may grow into a narrative of utility triumphing over technical specs. That might just shift priorities across portfolios away from Solana price swings and toward functional crypto infrastructure.

According to Bleeping Computer , blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, TRON, Tether, and Binance joined the T3 Financial Crime Unit (T3 FCU) initiative launched in September 2024. Dubbed the T3+ Global Collaborator Program, the operation has seized more than $250 million in criminal assets worldwide since launch. “Since its inception in September 2024, T3 FCU has worked closely with law enforcement agencies worldwide to identify and disrupt criminal networks,” TRM Labs said in an announcement this week. “Freezing over $250 million in illicit assets in less than a year is a powerful testament to what’s possible when the industry comes together with a shared goal,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. The T3 initiative has helped global law enforcement agencies to crackdown on money laundering, investment fraud and other financial crimes. Over $300 million in cybercrime crypto seized in anti-fraud effort – @billtoulas https://t.co/gjiMMMq6aQ https://t.co/gjiMMMq6aQ — BleepingComputer (@BleepinComputer) August 14, 2025 US, Canada Helped Chainalysis Track Scam Proceeds The second initiative included agencies from the US and Canada, collaborating on several operations to freeze $74 million in crypto. Per a Chainalysis report published on Thursday , Project Atlas, led by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), and Operation Avalanche, spearheaded by the BC Securities Commission, have seized crypto assets of tens of millions in illicit funds. For instance, Project Atlas focused on identifying and disrupting investment scams. The operation involved cooperation from various law enforcement and private-sector stakeholders. “Project Atlas identified more than 2,000 crypto wallet addresses linked to fraud victims across 14 countries, including Canada, the US, Australia, Germany, and the UK,” the report read. Interestingly, the project prevented more than $70 million in cryptocurrency from being stolen. Besides, Operation Avalanche, supported by Chainalysis, identified over $4.3 million in losses tied to Ethereum-based fraud schemes. The operation involved a range of Canadian regulatory partners, including the Ontario Provincial Police, Vancouver Police, and Delta Police Department. Fraud Schemes Still Global Issue Despite Crypto Seized So Far “Fraudulent investment schemes remain a global issue, especially with crypto, where regulation is still catching up in many jurisdictions,” Natalie Newson, CertiK’s Senior Blockchain Investigator told Cryptonews. According to Newson, Ponzi schemes are unfortunately still common in crypto due to its decentralized nature. High and fast return promises still lure investors, exploiting gaps in regulatory enforcement. “maintaining a healthy skepticism toward investments that lack transparency or are not registered with appropriate regulatory bodies is essential in safeguarding assets,” she added.

50119889,557459,1755245270,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50119889.jpeg,4 Best Crypto Presales ChatGPT Predicts Will Explode in 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/4-best-crypto-presales-chatgpt-predicts-will-explode-in-2025/,"Hunting for the next big breakout winner in crypto? Your best shot might be with tokens still in presale. Why? Because presale cryptos typically come at rock-bottom prices, offer massive upside potential, often give early access to exclusive utilities (like staking rewards), and let you get in before the hype – and the big money – drives prices sky-high. To help you spot the best crypto presales to invest in right now, we turned to ChatGPT-5. Arguably the most powerful AI chatbot in the world, ChatGPT has the ability to process massive amounts of market data, analyze sentiment across social media, and identify emerging trends before they hit the mainstream. Keep reading to discover ChatGPT’s top suggestions, along with their key details, current prices, capital raised so far, and growth potential. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – New Bitcoin Layer 2 for High Speeds, Low Fees & Web3 Support Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to crank up Bitcoin’s real-world utility by delivering Solana-like speed, affordability, and programmability to the network. Its approach? A cutting-edge Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that integrates the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling developers to deploy smart contracts and build decentralized applications on Bitcoin, just as they would on Solana. Next comes a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge, which gives you direct access to Hyper’s SVM-powered Web3 ecosystem by seamlessly converting Layer 1 $BTC into Layer 2 $BTC. Essentially, you deposit native $BTC into a designated Bitcoin address monitored by the canonical bridge, which then ‘wraps’ those coins into Layer 2-compatible $BTC tokens. What can you do with these ‘wrapped’ tokens? Dive into a full range of Web3 activities. DeFi trading, DAO participation and governance, lending, staking, token swaps, NFTs, blockchain gaming, and more. With over $9.6M in early investor funding, Bitcoin Hyper is easily one of the hottest crypto presales going around. And you can join the gravy train by buying $HYPER at just $0.012725 per token. The best part? According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token can explode by 2,400% in the months ahead, potentially hitting $0.32 by year-end. Visit Bitcoin Hyper’s website for more information. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Community-Backed Meme Coin with Degen, 1000x Mindset Maxi Doge ($MAXI) skips the bells and whistles of more ‘sophisticated’ crypto projects. In fact, it proudly owns its lack of utility and seriousness. But make no mistake, it has a mission. A furious one: to overtake Dogecoin’s dominance and claim the title of the best meme coin in the world. Why the grudge against $DOGE, you ask? Because Maxi is Dogecoin’s distant cousin, the one left to wallow in loneliness at family gatherings while Doge soaked up all the limelight. That’s why Maxi refused to follow other animal tokens with their wholesome, cutesy vibe. Instead, he hit the gym, lifted heavy, drowned in protein shakes and caffeine, and transformed into the fiercest version of a Shiba Inu the crypto market has ever seen. With 40% of its total token supply reserved for marketing, $MAXI’s developers clearly know the mantra: virality. Think PR, paid ads, and influencer collaborations. Despite being fresh out of the oven, $MAXI’s presale has already pulled in over $971K, backed by a loyal community of crypto degens who live by Maxi’s all-in philosophy: ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump.’ Buying $MAXI won’t just give you potentially explosive returns; it’ll also unlock holder-only weekly trading leaderboards and ‘Max Ripped, Max Gains’ challenges. Learn all about $MAXI by visiting its website. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram Trading Bot Sniping Liquidity in New Meme Coins Snorter Token ($SNORT) a top new utility-driven altcoin aiming to ride the surging meme coin wave – a segment that’s grown by over 88% in the past year. At its core is Snorter Bot, an upcoming Telegram-based trading bot designed to give retail traders equal footing with crypto whales, who’ve traditionally dominated the meme coin space by leveraging advanced tools to scoop up liquidity before others. Snorter, however, features automatic order execution, so you can set buy/sell orders in advance, sit back, and watch the bot undercut institutional players. Even better, Snorter is incredibly easy to use. Placing orders, for instance, is as simple as sending a command in Telegram chat, which is really no different from sending a regular message. Moreover, you can also manage your entire Snorter portfolio and even copy trades from seasoned pros, all through Telegram’s familiar text-based interface. Security-wise, too, Snorter’s an ace. It comes with safeguards against both big and small on-chain threats, including rug pulls, honeypots, scams, front-running, and even Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks. Why buy $SNORT ? Because it unlocks a bunch of exclusive perks: Potential 820% ROI in just the next few months, with $SNORT predicted to hit $0.94 this year No daily sniping limits Advanced analytical tools Staking rewards, currently yielding an impressive 141% APY Industry-lowest trading fees of just 0.85% – compared to the 1.5% charged to non-holders Snorter Token is currently in presale, where it has already gathered a chunky $3.1M. And 1 $SNORT is priced at just $0.1013. Check out Snorter Token’s official website to know more. 4. Remittix ($RTX) – Leading the PayFi Revolution with Crypto-to-Fiat Payments Remittix ($RTX) is perfectly positioned to capture a substantial share of the global cross-border payments market, which is projected to exceed $250 trillion by 2027 . This innovative altcoin bridges crypto and fiat like never before, allowing users to send fiat payments to bank accounts all over the world using crypto. At the time of writing, Remittix supports over 30 fiat currencies and 50+ cryptocurrency pairs. In addition to groundbreaking usability – where recipients receive a bank transfer without ever knowing it started as a crypto payment – you’ll also benefit from zero FX fees and lightning-fast transactions. The Remittix presale has been a massive hit, to say the least. It has so far sold an eye-popping 600M tokens, raising over $19.6M in the process. Want in? 1 $RTX is currently available at just $0.0969. Bottom Line Using AI to spot the next crypto to explode proved to be a smart move, as ChatGPT delivered a well-rounded mix, comprising both utility-backed altcoins like $HYPER and $SNORT , and degen-powered picks like $MAXI . That said, kindly tread with caution; the crypto market is highly volatile and unpredictable. None of the above is financial advice, either, and you must always do your own research before investing.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 08:07:50

Estimates for Uniswap’s average price in 2028 range from $38.11 to $43.56. UNI’s average price in 2031 will be $68.06, with a maximum price of $70.78. Uniswap, a DeFi protocol founded in 2018 by former mechanical engineer Hayden Adams. The Uniswap exchange is a 100% on-chain automated market maker (AMM) protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. The AMM allows DeFi users to swap ether (ETH) for any ERC-20 token without intermediaries, solving many liquidity problems most exchanges face. Uniswap’s unique features and utility make its token, UNI, attractive to traders and investors. Will UNI reach $100? How high can UNI go in five years? Let’s take a look at Uniswap’s technical analysis and price prediction to provide answers to these queries.

Cryptocurrency gains 0.21% of its value. UNI coin faces resistance around $11.71. On August 15, 2025, Uniswap price analysis revealed an upward trend for the day. The altcoin’s price increased to $11.08 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the cryptocurrency gained up to 0.21% of its value. Bulls have taken the lead again following a strong correction observed yesterday, as support appeared around $10.87 after UNI shed more than 5% of its value. Uniswap price analysis on the daily time frame The one-day price chart of Uniswap coin confirmed a bullish trend in the market. The UNI/USD value has surged to an intra day high of $11.08.

Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $12.12. Whereby, its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $8.60. UNI/USD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending in the neutral region. The indicator’s value has been recorded at index 57.73 today, as it inches closer to the overbought area. The increasing trend is represented by an upward curve on the RSI graph. Further stability in the market can be expected if the buying momentum continues. Uniswap price analysis on 4-hour chart The four-hour price analysis of Uniswap coin shows returning selling pressure. The coin is struggling to maintain its price at $11.08 for the past few hours. Moreover, the comparatively high volatility signifies relatively higher chances of an upcoming reversal. The Bollinger bands have diverged, leading to an increase in volatility. This increase in volatility signals a higher market unpredictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger band has shifted to $12.36, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $10.61, securing the support. UNI/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is trending within the neutral region. The indicator’s value has flattened at 46 in the past few hours.

Uniswap price analysis gives a bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market trends, as the coin’s price is increasing after a continued bullish impulse observed over the current trading session. If buyers hold the ongoing momentum, UNI’s price might increase to the $12 range. Is Uniswap a good investment? Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) with massive potential. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap uses an automated market-matching (AMM) system. Uniswap has shown good performance over time and is expected to reach the $34.48 level by 2027 and above $70.78 by 2031. Why is UNI up? The broader crypto market is experiencing a bullish phase today. Most of the top cryptocurrencies are gaining value, and so is UNI. As buyers gained ground around $10.87, positive sentiment returned to the market. How much will Uniswap be worth in 2025? The maximum UNI can reach in 2025 is $16.33, while the average price is expected to be around $13.61. Will UNI reach $20? Uniswap is trading just above the $9 range, down from $18.59, which it achieved in December last year. The current resistance levels are $9.3 and $10.7; a break above them can lead to $11. If UNI gets more support, $20 can be achieved by the year 2026. Will UNI reach $50? In May 2021, UNI touched $44.9, its all-time high and not much below $50. This possibility can arise again if the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish on political and economic factors. Can Uniswap reach $100 dollars? According to the Uniswap price prediction, UNI is not expected to reach near $100 by the last quarter of 2031. Though this is a five-year time frame, it’s worth waiting, as the coin’s value will increase but may not reach $100. Does UNI have a good long-term Future? UNI is the token of the famous Uniswap decentralized exchange. It has a wide user base and good liquidity, so the coin has good prospects. Market analysts expect UNI’s price to reach $70.78 by the end of 2031, substantially higher than its current price.

This transaction was recorded as a true on-chain token destruction. OKX Permanently Burns 279 Million OKB Tokens Following this large-scale burn, OKB's total supply was capped at 21 million tokens. This is considered a key step in OKX's long-term supply management strategy. Token burns generally aim to positively impact market value by reducing the total supply. OKB is the native ecosystem token of the OKX exchange, offering reduced trading fees, access to exclusive investment opportunities, and various platform benefits. The supply reduction could increase the relative share of existing token holders and potentially put upward pressure on the price. While OKX has previously conducted regular buyback and burn programs, today's trading volume is striking in terms of scale. This development has resonated strongly within the crypto community, with investors closely monitoring the market's reaction. Experts note that the limited supply model could support OKB's value in the long run, but market conditions and overall crypto trends will directly impact this process. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, the US Dollar has experienced a noticeable pullback, a move closely watched by investors worldwide. This dip, occurring just ahead of a high-profile geopolitical summit, raises pertinent questions about market stability and future economic trajectories. For those deeply invested in digital assets, understanding these macro-level shifts is not just an academic exercise; it’s crucial for navigating portfolio risks and identifying emerging opportunities. Why the US Dollar is Under Pressure? The US Dollar , often considered the world’s primary reserve currency, typically acts as a safe haven during times of global uncertainty. However, leading up to significant geopolitical events, its behavior can become unpredictable. The recent decline in the dollar’s value can be attributed to several factors, often intertwined with market anticipation and risk sentiment. Investors tend to price in potential outcomes of such summits, ranging from diplomatic breakthroughs to increased tensions, which directly influence their confidence in holding dollar-denominated assets. Key factors contributing to the dollar’s recent movements often include: Anticipation of Policy Shifts: Summits between major global leaders can hint at future policy directions concerning trade, sanctions, or international relations, directly affecting economic outlooks. Investor Risk Appetite: A perception of reduced geopolitical risk might encourage investors to move away from safe-haven assets like the dollar into higher-yielding, riskier assets. Conversely, increased uncertainty can lead to dollar strength. Economic Fundamentals: While the summit is a catalyst, underlying economic data, such as inflation rates, employment figures, and interest rate expectations, always play a role in the dollar’s long-term trajectory. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact on Currency Markets Geopolitical events are powerful drivers of currency movements. High-stakes meetings, like the Trump-Putin summit, create an environment of heightened speculation in the Forex market . The outcome, or even the rhetoric leading up to it, can trigger significant shifts in investor sentiment. For instance, if the summit is expected to ease trade tensions or foster greater international cooperation, it might lead to a ‘risk-on’ environment, potentially weakening the dollar as capital flows into other currencies or emerging markets. Consider these points regarding geopolitical influence: Uncertainty Premium: Before a major event, markets often price in an ‘uncertainty premium,’ which can manifest as either increased volatility or a temporary flight to safety. Policy Divergence: Joint statements or perceived agreements/disagreements can signal future policy divergences between nations, impacting currency valuations. Market Reaction to News: Traders and algorithmic systems react almost instantaneously to headlines, causing rapid price fluctuations. The direct impact on currency markets means that traders must remain agile, constantly re-evaluating their positions based on evolving political narratives. Navigating the Forex Market : Strategies for Volatility For participants in the Forex market , periods of heightened geopolitical activity present both challenges and opportunities. The increased currency volatility demands a more cautious yet adaptive approach. Understanding how different currencies react to specific types of news is crucial. For example, the Japanese Yen and Swiss Franc are often considered safe-haven currencies alongside the US Dollar, attracting capital during times of global stress. Effective strategies during such periods include: Risk Management: Employing strict stop-loss orders and managing position sizes to mitigate potential losses from sudden market swings. Diversification: Spreading investments across different currency pairs or asset classes to reduce exposure to a single event. Fundamental Analysis: Deep diving into the economic and political fundamentals of the countries involved can provide a clearer picture of long-term trends, beyond short-term noise. Technical Analysis: Using charts and indicators to identify potential support and resistance levels, which can be particularly useful during volatile periods. Decoding Currency Volatility : Risks and Opportunities Currency volatility is a double-edged sword. While it creates significant risks for those unprepared, it also generates substantial opportunities for skilled traders. Understanding the underlying drivers of this volatility is key. It’s not just about the immediate news; it’s also about how that news is interpreted by a multitude of market participants, leading to herd mentality or swift reversals. Here’s how volatility impacts different market participants: For Traders: High volatility means larger potential price swings, offering more chances for profit on short-term trades, but also increasing the risk of rapid losses. For Businesses: Companies involved in international trade face increased currency risk, impacting their revenues and costs. Hedging strategies become vital. For Investors: Long-term investors in foreign assets might see their returns eroded or boosted by currency fluctuations, necessitating careful consideration of currency exposure. The key is to differentiate between noise and genuine shifts in market sentiment or economic fundamentals. Panic selling or buying based on unconfirmed rumors can be detrimental. Ripple Effects: How This Impacts Global Financial Markets The impact of a weakening US Dollar or increased currency volatility extends far beyond the Forex market. It creates ripple effects across all Global financial markets , including equities, commodities, and significantly, cryptocurrencies. A weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated commodities like oil and gold cheaper for holders of other currencies, potentially driving up their prices. For equities, companies with significant international revenues might see their earnings boosted when the dollar is weaker. Crucially, for the cryptocurrency space: Alternative Store of Value: When traditional fiat currencies like the dollar show signs of weakness or instability, some investors might seek alternative stores of value, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This can potentially drive demand for digital assets. Liquidity Shifts: Changes in global liquidity conditions, often influenced by dollar strength, can impact the capital available for riskier assets like crypto. A strong dollar can sometimes pull liquidity out of crypto, while a weaker dollar might free up capital. Investor Sentiment Spillover: The overall sentiment in traditional financial markets often spills over into crypto. If geopolitical events create a ‘risk-off’ environment, it can affect crypto as well, though sometimes crypto acts as a non-correlated asset. Monitoring the dollar’s health and geopolitical developments is therefore not just for forex traders; it’s a vital component of a comprehensive investment strategy for anyone involved in the broader financial landscape, especially in the interconnected world of digital assets. Conclusion: Staying Vigilant in a Dynamic Landscape The recent pullback in the US Dollar ahead of a critical geopolitical summit underscores the intricate dance between politics, economics, and currency valuations. Such events are potent reminders of the inherent currency volatility in the Forex market and their far-reaching geopolitical impact across Global financial markets . For investors, particularly those navigating the exciting yet unpredictable cryptocurrency space, staying informed about these macro trends is not merely beneficial; it’s essential for making informed decisions and protecting portfolios. The financial landscape is constantly evolving, driven by a complex interplay of forces. While predicting the exact outcomes of geopolitical events is impossible, understanding their potential influence on major currencies like the US Dollar allows for better preparation and more resilient investment strategies. Adaptability, informed analysis, and robust risk management remain the pillars of success in these dynamic times.

After a quiet period in late July, ADA USD began printing higher highs in early August, briefly surpassing $1 today before a minor retracement. Traders remain optimistic that Cardano price could climb further, potentially challenging Dogecoin and USDC in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, savvy investors are stacking Remittix (RTX) , attracted by its real-world utility and remarkable upside potential. Cardano price charts signal strength as Cardano foundation drives real-world adoption Technical indicators for Cardano price suggest bullish momentum. The daily chart shows a golden cross forming, a classic signal where the 50-period moving average crosses above the 200-period moving average. Historically, similar patterns have preceded significant rallies and analysts now project that Cardano price could hit $3 in just 27 days if current momentum continues. Volume trends reinforce this optimism, as ADA USD trades at a five-month high with buyers actively pushing the market. Should bulls maintain control, the next resistance points include $1.2 and $1.35, offering opportunities for traders to capitalize on momentum. The current environment highlights why Cardano price remains a favorite among crypto investors. Beyond technicals, Cardano has strong fundamentals supporting its growth. The Cardano Foundation is partnering with Input Output Global (IOG), Emurgo and Intersect to drive global adoption. Initiatives include enterprise masterclasses, case studies in supply chain, AI and finance and resources for universities teaching the Aiken programming language. These developments strengthen Cardano price prospects by showcasing tangible utility. Institutional and retail interest is growing, suggesting that ADA USD may continue to attract capital from investors seeking both long-term value and exposure to one of the most promising blockchain ecosystems.

The exchange’s open interest (OI) plunged by 5% within hours, which means that many traders rapidly exited positions or closed leverage in reaction to the sudden price drop. Local Bottom Such a behavior reflects a swift change in sentiment, from aggressive bullishness near recent highs to a more defensive, risk-off stance. At the same time, cumulative net taker volume dropped sharply by $1.89 billion, a move that is often tied to aggressive selling or the unwinding of late long positions. Historically, such steep declines have frequently aligned with local price bottoms on shorter timeframes, which suggests that selling pressure may be approaching exhaustion. However, in this instance, the sharp reversal points to capitulation by traders who had entered long positions just before the recent peak. According to CryptoQuant, traders who entered late long positions and are now underwater are exiting rapidly. This wave of closures is driving down both open interest and net taker volume. Liquidation metrics add further context. The Net Liquidations 8-hour change, for example, surged to $130 million – primarily from forced closures of overleveraged longs – indicating a classic long squeeze. As prices fell, these liquidations triggered a cascade of sell orders and amplified downward momentum. Complementing this view is the compression in Binance’s funding rate to 0.006%, which reflects a waning demand to hold long positions and diminished bullish conviction among derivatives traders. A sharp open interest decline, collapsing net taker volume, heavy long liquidations, and falling funding rates collectively point to a textbook long squeeze, quickly flushing bullish traders from positions as cascading liquidations accelerate the market’s downward momentum. Beyond the derivatives market, structural signals are also turning cautious. Structure Turns Bearish Swissblock noted that Bitcoin failed to sustain its upward momentum after briefly reaching a new all-time high of $124.5K. While overall momentum indicators remain positive, the crash has transformed the market structure from bullish to bearish. This shift indicates that, despite underlying strength, sellers are exerting pressure and creating a less favorable environment for extended rallies. Without a clear “alignment” between momentum and market structure, any rebound attempts could lack the necessary follow-through to hold gains, which makes them vulnerable to quick reversals. In short, the market’s underlying strength is being offset by structural weakness. This raises the risk that near-term upward moves may prove temporary.

50121779,557591,1755248297,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50121779.jpeg,ChatGPT-5 chọn 3 alt coin để mua và nắm giữ lâu dài,https://bitcoinist.com/chatgpt-5-top-3-cryptocurrencies-to-buy-and-hold/,"Khi được hỏi về ba loại tiền điện tử mà mình sẽ nắm giữ vô thời hạn, mô hình ngôn ngữ thế hệ mới của OpenAI – ChatGPT-5 – đã lựa chọn sự kết hợp giữa các đồng tiền dẫn đầu và tài sản hạ tầng quan trọng: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) và Chainlink (LINK). Việc đưa Chainlink vào danh sách đánh dấu sự thay đổi so với danh sách trước đây, khi AI từng chọn Remittix (RTX) – một token thanh toán xuyên biên giới mới nổi, được đánh giá cao nhờ phí giao dịch thấp và cơ chế giảm phát. Mặc dù RTX vẫn là một ứng viên tiềm năng trong phân khúc ngách, ChatGPT-5 cuối cùng đã thay thế nó bằng LINK, với lý do đồng coin này đóng vai trò then chốt trong khả năng tương tác giữa các blockchain và tích hợp dữ liệu từ thế giới thực. ChatGPT chọn Bitcoin làm “nền tảng cốt lõi” Bitcoin hiện đang được giao dịch ở mức 119.091 USD, tăng 99,85% trong vòng một năm qua, và được mô tả là “nền tảng cốt lõi” của bất kỳ danh mục đầu tư dài hạn nào. Với nhu cầu từ các tổ chức đối với quỹ ETF Bitcoin giao ngay đạt mức kỷ lục và sự kiện halving năm 2024 làm hạn chế nguồn cung, AI cho rằng việc phát hành cố định cùng niềm tin toàn cầu dành cho BTC là những yếu tố củng cố vị thế thống trị của nó. ChatGPT chọn Ethereum làm “tài sản sinh lợi” Ethereum, hiện có giá 4.404,88 USD (+64,31% từ đầu năm đến nay), được mô tả là “tài sản sinh lợi” trong nhóm, mang lại lợi nhuận thông qua staking và đóng vai trò nền tảng cho tài chính phi tập trung (DeFi), thị trường NFT và các giải pháp mở rộng Layer-2. ChatGPT chọn Bitcoin Hyper là “cược hạ tầng” Bitcoin Hyper, hiện ở giai đoạn presale với mức tăng trưởng ấn tượng kể từ khi ra mắt, được ChatGPT-5 xem là “cược hạ tầng” trong số các alt coin nhờ khả năng mang lại tốc độ giao dịch nhanh, phí thấp và hỗ trợ khả năng tương tác chuỗi chéo thông qua kiến trúc Layer-2. Giải pháp này giúp Bitcoin không chỉ là nơi lưu trữ giá trị mà còn trở thành nền tảng cho DeFi, NFT, trò chơi blockchain và các ứng dụng Web3 khác.

Similar scams drained $880,000 from another victim, alongside multiple smaller thefts. On top of this, malicious signature requests stole more than $600,000, including $165,000 in a single attack. The FBI also warned of fraudulent “crypto recovery law firms” targeting scam victims for additional theft, amid rising crypto-related crime that saw $2.5 billion lost in the first half of 2025. Crypto Users Hit by Address Poisoning Spree Crypto scammers stole more than $1.6 million from unsuspecting users through address poisoning attacks in just the past week. This means that these attacks surpassed the total losses that were recorded in the entire month of March. One of the most serious incidents occurred on Friday, when a victim mistakenly sent 140 Ethereum (ETH), valued at roughly $636,500, to a fraudulent address. According to scam prevention platform ScamSniffer, the victim copied the wrong address from their transaction history after it was “poisoned” with a lookalike entry. The history, ScamSniffer explained , was already filled with malicious addresses, making it only a matter of time before the trap succeeded. The theft was not an isolated case. On Sunday, another victim lost $880,000 worth of cryptocurrency to the same type of scam. Additional reports from cybersecurity alerts revealed smaller losses, including $80,000 from one user and $62,000 from another. Combined data from multiple security firms confirmed that over $1.6 million was drained from victims’ wallets through address poisoning since Sunday, which is more than the $1.2 million that was lost to these attacks in March . Address poisoning works by sending small transactions from addresses that closely resemble those of legitimate contacts or previous transactions. This fake entry then appears in the victim’s transaction history, and if the victim copies the address for a future transfer without double-checking, the funds are sent directly to the scammer. Web3 Antivirus described it as a form of “transaction history poisoning,” which exploits user habits and reliance on partial address verification. On top of address poisoning scams, scammers also took more than $600,000 from victims this week through malicious signature requests , like “approve,” “increaseAllowance,” and “permit” signatures. One such attack on Tuesday resulted in the loss of $165,000 worth of BLOCK and DOLO tokens after the victim unknowingly granted the scammer access to their funds. Security experts urged crypto users to adopt best practices like maintaining an address book or whitelist and verifying the full wallet address before initiating any transaction. Scam Law Firms Target Crypto Victims The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also recently issued a new warning to victims of crypto scams, and pointed out that fraudulent law firms are promising to recover stolen funds. In a public service announcement that was made on Wednesday, the agency said these fictitious firms are specifically targeting people who already lost some or all of their crypto holdings, putting them at risk of even more losses and potential compromise of personal data. Warning from the FBI According to the FBI, the scam typically involves unsolicited contact from so-called “crypto recovery law firms” or legal entities requesting payment in cryptocurrency or prepaid gift cards. The bureau explained that legitimate law firms do not operate this way and urged people to be wary of any such outreach, especially if they have not reported the initial scam to law enforcement or civil protection agencies. This latest notice builds on similar warnings the FBI issued in August of 2023 and June of 2024. The warning was also made against the backdrop of rising crypto-related crime. Blockchain security firm CertiK reported that approximately $2.5 billion was lost to hacks, exploits, and scams in the first half of 2025 alone. While some victims manage to recover funds through exchanges or other means, many are left to navigate the aftermath without formal assistance, making them vulnerable to secondary scams. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that any digital assets seized by authorities will be added to the national cryptocurrency stockpile—sometimes referred to as a Bitcoin reserve—after compensating affected victims. In April, the FBI’s Dallas division seized $2.4 million worth of Bitcoin linked to an alleged member of a hacking group, later seeking a legal claim on the assets in July. The risks to crypto holders extend beyond online scams as some criminals are resorting to physical threats. SatoshiLabs founder Alena Vranova estimated that at least one Bitcoin holder somewhere in the world is targeted each week in incidents involving kidnapping or ransom demands.",News|Security,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BTC|ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-15 09:00:00

His remarks came amid the recent growth in altcoins this year. Duong mentioned in Coinbase’s monthly report on Thursday that September might see a push towards a full-scale altcoin season. According to Coinbase, an altcoin season is clear when three quarters of the top 50 altcoins surpass Bitcoin over 90 days. Duong believes Fed policies might drive retail participation into altcoins Altcoin Season is coming As September approaches, the transition to a full-scale altcoin season is likely. Our positive 3Q25 outlook stems from macro trends such as potential Fed rate cuts and expected regulatory advancements. More key themes in this Monthly Outlook report ↓ — Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) August 14, 2025 The exchange’s head of research believes that money market funds currently hold a significant amount of retail capital. Duong noted that a record $7.2 trillion is currently sitting in U.S. money market funds. He argued that the decline of cash balances by $150 billion in April ignited stronger crypto and risk asset performance in subsequent months. Cash balances rebounded by over $200 billion in June, which he believes was at odds with the crypto appreciation witnessed over the same period. Duong also argued that retail participation was imminent due to the probability of potential Federal Reserve easing in the coming months. His remarks came after July’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed moderate inflation at 2.7% YoY. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Tuesday’s inflation data increased the chances of the central bank cutting rates in September on futures markets to around 98%. At the time of publication, CME’s FedWatch tool showed a 93% reduction in the September rate after Thursday’s producer prices showed the quickest rise in three years. According to Duong, interest rate cuts have the potential to draw fresh capital into the market and could ignite an altcoin rally. Source: Coinbase . Altcoin open interest dominance ratio. He also argued that BTC dominance could influence the beginning of an altcoin rally. The BTC dominance gauge has plummeted 10% from over 65% in May to around 59% by August. At the time of publication, BTC dominance is currently at 59.36%, its lowest level since January. Duong believes that Bitcoin’s current market dominance signals the early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. On Thursday, crypto day trader Ito Shimotsuma also noted that Bitcoin dominance had just formed its first monthly bearish cross since January 2021. He stated that in the past, altcoins rallied for only four months when such a scenario occurred. According to him, a similar scenario is likely to occur that will lead to an altcoin rally till December. ETH institutional interest growth fuels altcoin season Duong believes the altcoin season is imminent due to the surge in altcoin season indexes in recent months. The altcoin market cap has risen above 50% since early July, but is yet to reach the 75% threshold, which historically determines altcoin seasons . At the time of publication, CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 45, up from below 25 in July. CryptoRank’s index is at 50, while Blockchain Center’s remained neutral at 53. “With the altcoin market cap climbing and the Altcoin Season Index showing early positive signals, we believe conditions are setting up for a potential rotation into a more mature altcoin season as we head into September.” – David Duong , Head of Research at Coinbase Joanna Liang, founding partner of Singapore-based venture capital firm Jsquare, said three key conditions need to align for an altcoin season to take place. She explained that a drop in a favorable overall market condition, a drop in BTC dominance, and a strong new narrative are enough conditions to signal an altcoin rally. Past altcoin cycles were driven by different catalysts such as ICOs in 2017-2018, Layer-1s in 2018-2019, and DeFi/NFTs in 2021-2022. Liang believes that the altcoin market is yet to rally, as it awaits market signals that can inject fresh capital and fuel an altseason. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

However, with a turn toward altcoins, Ethereum has quickly become the center of attention, especially after ETH crossed the $4,000 level. Now, as interest balloons, expectations for how high the Ethereum price could go have expanded, with many expecting 5-figures soon. Why Ethereum Price Is Headed For $15,00 In an X (formerly Twitter) post, popular crypto analyst Rekt Fencer predicted that the Ethereum price was “programmed” to reach the $15,000 mark. As for why he believes that the altcoin would climb this high, he highlights five major developments that will be the defining trigger for the Ethereum price to reach $15,000. Related Reading: Ethereum CME Gap Threatens Recovery, Why A Crash To $4,080 Is Possible The first thing on the list is the fact that ETH buying has been ramping up among institutions lately. For example, Ethereum treasury companies have sprung up in the last year, with the likes of Bitmine and SharpLink leading the charge. With ETH quickly becoming the cryptocurrency of choice for these large investors, over $10 billion worth of ETH has been bought by these companies in less than three years. Next on the list is the fact that US President Donald Trump is a major Ethereum holder. The president, who is hailed as the first pro-crypto president of the United States, currently holds over $500 million worth of ETH. This means that the majority of the president’s crypto wealth is actually in Ethereum. Another major factor driving up the value of the Ethereum price is the heightened interest in Spot Ethereum ETFs. As buying of Spot Ethereum ETFs has ramped up, so have their total holdings. According to data from the CoinMarketCap website, Spot ETH ETF issuers now control a whopping $19 billion in AUM, which translates to 3.76% of the total Ethereum market cap. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Could Crash To $110,000 Amid Signs Of Exhaustion Fourth on the list is the proliferation of pro-crypto laws such as the GENIUS Act that was passed this month. This has made it easier for institutional investors to move into Ethereum and driven up buying during this time. Then the fifth point is the fact that staking for Spot Ethereum ETFs is coming. While this is yet to be approved, there have been multiple filings by Spot Ethereum ETFs to allow ETH staking for the funds. This means that if this is approved, then these funds would end up locking a large number of their ETH holdings in order to enjoy yield from staking.

So far, XRP looks to be under a lot of selling pressure, but this could just be the preparation for the next takeoff. As crypto analyst MadWhale explains, it is times like these that the major moves tend to happen . Market Makers Prepping XRP For A Big Move? The sentiment around XRP has begun to shift toward the negative as the altcoin has not kept up with the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum through the recent market surge. This underperformance has kept the cryptocurrency from its all-time high campaign as the price has continued to trend sideways. Undeterred by this price action, crypto analyst MadWhale has mapped out what could possibly be happening to the XRP price and how market makers could be using this as an opportunity to shake out investors. In the post, the analyst explains that no market is ever just straight up or down, and it is the swings that market makers use against traders. MadWhale explains that market makers hold the price in a narrow range or display dull sideways price movements, with breakouts in no particular direction taking place. During this time, they cause investors to lose interest and hope in the digital asset, as they make them pull out of the market. As this happens, while investors think that the cryptocurrency has lost its momentum and will continue to crash, the market makers are using it to prime the next move. The target is often again high-leveraged traders to make them lose their positions as they flush them out. The Move Happens When Hope Fades While shaking out the weak hands on assets like XRP , market makers are also snapping up liquidity, which is what helps to make the next move easier. The analyst calls it “the fuel for major market moves” as it makes it cheaper for the market makers to carry out their moves. Once XRP investors are worn out and the weak hands have been taken out, this is when the main move begins . “The market never moves in a straight painless path. Every swing trap or sideways grind has a purpose. If you understand these moves as part of the market maker’s plan to gather liquidity you can position yourself where others give up and join the move when it truly starts. Patience and pattern recognition are your sharpest weapons,” MadWhale concluded.",XRP|crypto|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|Ripple price|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|XRP|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 09:00:18

These programmed supply cuts have a history of triggering major price waves, not just for Bitcoin but also for the altcoins riding its momentum. With the next halving set for April 2028, investors are already building watchlists for the best altcoin to buy in 2025 and the top altcoins 2025 that could lead the charge. Among the rising names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves as a bold new contender with serious upside potential. The Countdown to Bitcoin’s Next Supply Shock The fourth Bitcoin halving took place on April 20, 2024, slashing mining rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per block. This hard-coded event reduced new supply by 50% and reinforced Bitcoin’s scarcity model. The next one — projected for April 4, 2028 at block 1,050,000 — will cut the reward again to just 1.5625 BTC. With around 140,129 blocks left (about 965 days), the market has entered a long build-up phase. Past cycles show that altcoins often outperform in percentage gains when the post-halving bull run kicks in. That’s why traders are already hunting for the best crypto to invest in 2025 — aiming to position before the real momentum begins. From DeFi leaders to AI-driven blockchain plays, the top altcoins 2025 list is filling with projects that could rival Bitcoin’s performance. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Poised for a 35x Breakout As the halving clock ticks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to leave even the biggest names in the dust. Analysts tracking its progress are pointing to a projected 35x climb — a number that puts it in rare territory for potential returns. Unlike older projects weighed down by slow innovation, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built for speed, adaptability, and market engagement. This makes it more than just another speculative token. It’s positioning itself to join the top altcoins 2025 conversation, giving investors an alternative to the large-cap giants. For those building positions now, MAGACOIN might be the best altcoin to buy in 2025 for outsized gains when the halving sparks a new market cycle. Why This Halving Could Change the Game for Altcoins Every halving triggers a fresh wave of attention to crypto markets. Bitcoin may lead the headlines, but the fastest moves often happen in smaller, high-growth coins. That’s where opportunities lie for investors looking beyond the big names. The 2028 halving will likely tighten supply while demand rises, creating ideal conditions for altcoins with strong narratives and active communities. MAGACOIN FINANCE checks those boxes, making it a standout candidate alongside other promising projects for the best crypto to invest in 2025.

However, the real bombshell was Treasury Secretary Bessent’s comment that the US would not be buying Bitcoin for its Strategic Reserve, a comment that he may now have walked back on. Awful US PPI data Some pretty awful Producer Prices data was released on Thursday which put the skids under the Bitcoin price. It showed that the Producer Price Index had risen 3.3% on an annual basis last month compared with a forecast figure of a 2.5% gain. This could even have implications for the expected rate cut in September. Bessent not buying - then buying again However, what really sent the Bitcoin price into collapse mode was U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent’s statement during an interview on Fox News that the US government would not be buying Bitcoin to add to its Strategic Reserve. Notwithstanding, only a few hours later in a post on X , the Treasury Secretary appeared to contradict his earlier statement by affirming the following: Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the “Bitcoin superpower of the world.” Whether Bessent miscommunicated in his Fox News interview, or whether he meant what he said, it would seem that the second statement has put Bitcoin purchases back on the agenda. Dip results in closing CME gap and retesting bull flag Source: TradingView If it wasn’t for the trigger of the two valid shocks to the market, one might have thought that the recent sharp dip in price was highly manipulated. Not long after making a new all-time high, the $BTC price fell precipitously all the way down to close the CME gap and retest the top of the bull flag. If you also throw into the mix the fact that short-term momentum indicators were able to reset, the collapse may have had a silver lining. Right now the $BTC price is up against the $119,000 horizontal resistance level. It would be expected that there may be a pause here, but given the bounce from the Stochastic RSI indicators, the pause might only be temporary. Bulls need to get $BTC price back on track Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the trend breaks in the price action and also in the RSI. For both it can be observed that it wouldn’t take too much for the price to get back above those uptrends. Concentrating on the RSI, it will be important for the indicator line to rise above the descending trendline (black line) in order to get back on track. $119,000 is the important level to hold over the weekend Source: TradingView The weekly time frame view for $BTC reveals a candle that is far from good looking. The bulls will be hoping that the candle becomes green and fills up over Friday and the weekend. Even if this doesn’t really happen, the main thing is to stay above what is starting to become a strong level of support at $119,000. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI illustrates how important it is for the indicator line to finally break through the descending trendline. When it does, this is likely the signal that $BTC is heading into its next leg higher. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Dogecoin (DOGE) support analysis shows stability at $0.21, signaling a potential 30% surge if the buying pressure continues. Yet, Cold Wallet(CWT) is rewriting the rulebook altogether. With a cashback-first model, $6 million raised, and Stage 17 priced at $0.00998 against a $0.3517 listing, it offers a 3,423% ROI potential. Compared to ADA’s steady climb and DOGE’s meme-fueled volatility, Cold Wallet’s market-ready adoption edge could make it the most lucrative move in 2025. Cardano Eyes $1 Breakout as Whales Scoop Up 200M ADA Cardano (ADA) is holding strong near $0.81, and recent whale activity has grabbed attention; 200 million ADA tokens shifted into large wallets in just 48 hours. Analysts are watching the $0.84–$0.88 zone closely: a decisive move above this resistance could pave the way toward the psychological $1 milestone. On-chain indicators show moderate bubble risk, suggesting market strength without overheating and that the rally could be sustainable. The long-term ascending trendline remains intact, adding technical support to the bullish thesis. With whales accumulating, the scattered chart strength, and a reasonable momentum, a move beyond $1 could trigger renewed buying and broader momentum. For long-term investors, Cardano’s setup now offers a potentially favorable entry ahead of a breakout. Dogecoin Eyes 30% Surge As Whale Buying Signals Strength Dogecoin (DOGE) has found its footing around the $0.21 support level; a zone that previously sparked strong rallies. Analysts suggest that as long as DOGE holds above this level, it could launch a 30% upside move toward approximately $0.26. This outlook follows a recent rebound from a pullback near $0.20, with buyers stepping in at key price points. Notably, large holders accumulated over $200 million worth of DOGE in a single day, signaling renewed confidence and fueling bullish sentiment. Technical indicators are lining up in DOGE’s favor. Patterns such as a rounded bottom and a potential MACD golden cross suggest broader momentum may follow. For speculative traders and meme-coin enthusiasts alike, this setup combines clear entry levels with evidence of strong buying demand. Cold Wallet’s $6M Presale Turns Fee Refunds Into Growth Power Cold Wallet is removing two of the biggest barriers to Web3 adoption: high participation costs and slow onboarding. Instead of letting gas, swap, and transfer fees drain user value, Cold Wallet refunds them directly, making every action inside the ecosystem a value-positive event. This cashback-first model builds loyalty from the first transaction, creating a reason for users to stay active long-term. The integration of Plus Wallet supercharges this launch. Over 2 million pre-existing accounts are already connected, meaning Cold Wallet begins at scale on day one. This is not a theoretical roadmap; with $6 million raised and more than 716 million tokens sold, it is already a fully funded build in motion. Stage 17 of crypto presale pricing is set at $0.00998, compared to a fixed $0.3517 listing goal, offering an eye-catching 3,423% potential ROI. Early buyers in Stage 1 entered at $0.007 and are already seeing measurable gains. With each stage sold, that profit gap closes, adding urgency for new participants. For those looking for a market-ready crypto project with adoption, liquidity, and incentives already in place, Cold Wallet delivers an ecosystem designed for rapid scale, and the window to enter at its current price is closing fast. Why Cold Wallet Holds the Real Edge Cardano (ADA) bullish outlook points toward a breakout, and Dogecoin (DOGE) support analysis teases a short-term rally, but neither offers the built-in adoption advantage Cold Wallet commands. By refunding fees and onboarding over 2 million Plus Wallet users instantly, Cold Wallet enters the market with scale, liquidity, and retention hardwired from day one. Stage 1 buyers at $0.007 are already ahead, and each presale stage narrows the profit gap toward the $0.3517 listing. In a year where the strongest plays will be those that merge utility with immediate traction, Cold Wallet is not just riding the market; it is positioned to reshape it entirely.

Trong chương trình, ông chia sẻ quan điểm về hướng đi tiếp theo của ngành, bao gồm sự bùng nổ gần đây của các meme coin tiềm năng, được thúc đẩy bởi các nền tảng như Pump.fun – nơi bất kỳ ai cũng có thể dễ dàng tạo ra một loại tiền điện tử mới. Phần lớn các coin này gần như vô giá trị cả về ứng dụng thực tế lẫn khả năng đầu cơ. Tuy nhiên, nhiều đồng vẫn có vốn hóa trên 1 triệu USD, và một số như Dogecoin thậm chí đạt hàng chục tỷ USD. Điều đáng chú ý hơn, theo Carlson-Wee, là tất cả memecoin khi được nhìn tổng thể đang dần để lại dấu ấn trong văn hóa đại chúng. “Mỗi khi có một sự kiện tin tức mới hoặc một meme lan truyền trên mạng xã hội, gần như ngay lập tức sẽ xuất hiện một đồng coin gắn liền với nó,” ông nói, lấy ví dụ có người biết tin Đức Giáo hoàng Francis qua một memecoin. Carlson-Wee dự đoán rằng trong tương lai, memecoin có thể trở thành một dạng nội dung, và dựa trên hoạt động giao dịch của nhà đầu tư, chúng sẽ trở thành một phần của dòng thông tin tự nhiên trên mạng xã hội. Với nhiều người trong và ngoài thế giới crypto, đây có thể là một lựa chọn hấp dẫn so với hệ thống hiện tại, nơi nội dung bị chi phối bởi thuật toán của các tập đoàn công nghệ lớn. “Những memecoin mới này hoạt động như một hệ thống khám phá thông tin cho thị trường thông tin ở ranh giới mới nhất,” Carlson-Wee nói. “Trên mạng xã hội, bạn có thể tưởng tượng rằng mỗi bài đăng đều là một đồng coin. Tôi nghĩ đây chính là hướng mà chúng ta đang tiến tới.” Ngoài ra, nhà sáng lập Polychain cũng đề cập đến những xu hướng mới khác có khả năng trở thành một phần quan trọng của ngành crypto. Ở giao điểm giữa crypto và AI, Carlson-Wee nhận định blockchain là nền tảng tự nhiên để triển khai các “agent” – phần mềm tự động – bởi hệ thống truyền thống khó thực hiện các giao dịch tự trị, trong khi blockchain có thể dùng hợp đồng thông minh để làm điều này. “Các agent có thể ký kết hợp đồng bằng phần mềm hoặc toán học như hợp đồng thông minh trên blockchain, sở hữu tài sản trong ví crypto và giao dịch với con người hoặc các agent khác thông qua ví crypto,” ông giải thích. Trước đây, trong một cuộc thảo luận khác về danh sách những đồng coin nên nắm giữ lâu dài, Carlson-Wee từng chọn Bitcoin Hyper – một dự án Layer-2 cho Bitcoin – như một ví dụ điển hình thay thế cho các dự án chưa đạt được sự chấp nhận rộng rãi. Sự lựa chọn này cho thấy sự chuyển hướng sang những tài sản đã và đang cung cấp chức năng cốt lõi cho hệ sinh thái blockchain, thay vì những dự án vẫn chỉ dừng ở tiềm năng. Bitcoin Hyper – Từ công nghệ Layer-2 đến tương lai của meme coin tiềm năng Bitcoin Hyper không chỉ mang đến giải pháp Layer-2 tiên tiến cho mạng lưới Bitcoin, giúp giao dịch nhanh hơn và phí thấp hơn, mà còn mở ra tiềm năng kết hợp với xu hướng meme coin tiềm năng . Với khả năng hỗ trợ DeFi, NFT, trò chơi blockchain và ứng dụng Web3, Bitcoin Hyper đang định vị mình như một dự án vừa có nền tảng công nghệ vững chắc vừa có sức hút cộng đồng mạnh mẽ. Sự kết hợp giữa hạ tầng blockchain hiện đại và sức lan tỏa của meme coin có thể đưa Bitcoin Hyper trở thành một trong những đồng coin nổi bật nhất trong kỷ nguyên crypto mới.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 09:10:18

In a public notice issued Wednesday, the FBI said fictitious law firms are approaching individuals who have already lost money to crypto fraud, promising to retrieve stolen funds but ultimately aiming to steal more. These schemes often demand upfront payments in cryptocurrency or gift cards and attempt to collect sensitive personal information. The warning builds on similar advisories released by the FBI in August 2023 and June 2024, and specifically urges caution toward unsolicited outreach from supposed legal representatives. “Be cautious of law firms contacting you unexpectedly, especially if you have not reported the crime to law enforcement or civil agencies,” the bureau emphasized. FBI Issues Renewed Public Warning The scale of crypto-related losses remains severe. Blockchain security firm CertiK reported that $2.5 billion was lost to hacks, exploits, and scams in the first half of 2025 alone. While some victims recover funds through exchanges or official channels, many are left vulnerable to secondary frauds when seeking help. The FBI plays a central role in investigating and prosecuting crypto-related crimes, including asset seizures. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently confirmed that confiscated digital assets—after compensating victims—could be directed into the country’s national crypto reserves. In April, the Dallas FBI seized $2.4 million worth of Bitcoin linked to a suspected hacker, and in July, federal prosecutors filed suit to formally claim the funds. Such cases underscore the growing importance of crypto assets in law enforcement operations and broader government asset management. Seized Crypto May Bolster U.S. Holdings However, the digital asset world’s risks extend beyond financial fraud. Authorities have documented an alarming trend of criminals resorting to physical threats. Kidnappings aimed at forcing crypto holders to transfer assets or pay ransom have been reported worldwide. SatoshiLabs founder Alena Vranova has estimated that at least one Bitcoin investor somewhere in the world is targeted in this way each week. The FBI’s latest advisory serves as both a warning and a call for vigilance. Victims of crypto scams are urged to report incidents directly to official agencies rather than relying on unsolicited offers of help. With cybercrime techniques evolving and the stakes for digital wealth rising, the bureau’s message is clear: the path to recovering lost crypto does not run through cold calls and shady promises.

Analyst Dan Gambardello warns of ongoing market manipulation wiping out leveraged longs. ADA’s risk score signals a “pre-bull market” zone, echoing late 2020 conditions. Cardano (ADA) is hovering near a decisive resistance level, with analysts warning that the next move could determine whether the asset holds a sustained bull run or retreats for further consolidation. In a recent YouTube update, analyst Dan Gambardello noted that ADA’s brief spike above $1, which lasted only minutes, brought the cryptocurrency right into a multi-year trendline resistance.

The two leaders are set to meet face-to-face in Alaska, aiming to talk about what it might take to end the war in Ukraine, which has dragged on since Russia’s invasion in early 2022. While broader European equities pushed higher on the day, defense stocks in the region took a hit. Investors dumped names tied to the war economy, with fears that even the suggestion of peace could cool spending. The Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense Index had tanked for three straight sessions once the Trump-Putin meeting was announced. But by Thursday, it started to climb again, rising 1.3%, though still far below earlier highs. It’s been up 52% year-to-date, boosted by the massive military budgets across NATO countries trying to counter Russian aggression. Despite this pullback, analysts aren’t expecting much to change. Even if nothing concrete happens in Alaska, governments aren’t about to cancel contracts or stop ramping up production. Bitcoin stays strong as Japan beats forecasts and China slows While the traditional markets bobbed and dipped, Bitcoin was finding it hard to stand its ground too. The world’s largest crypto traded firmly above $120,000, after briefly touching a new all-time high of $123,637 less than 48 hours ago. Meanwhile in Asia, stocks were split. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed at a record after the country’s second-quarter GDP grew 0.3%, beating expectations. The rise came despite pressure from U.S. tariffs, and showed the economy still has some fuel left. That small gain was enough to drive the index to a fresh high. China, however, brought more reasons for caution. The country’s growth stalled in July. Retail sales were up 3.7% compared to last year, but that was far from the 4.6% forecasted by analysts polled by Reuters. It also marked a slowdown from June’s 4.8% gain. On top of that, industrial output rose 5.7%, which was its lowest reading since November last year and under the 5.9% many expected. Beijing is still tightening its grip on industries with excess supply, but domestic demand hasn’t bounced back. That weak momentum hit Hong Kong futures too. The Hang Seng Index futures slipped to 25,316, pointing to a soft open after Thursday’s 25,519.32 close. Wall Street edges higher as oil and metals make cautious moves U.S. markets were mostly quiet, but not idle. S&P 500 set a tiny new closing record Thursday night. Dow Jones and Nasdaq Composite dipped slightly, but traders didn’t seem rattled. Futures told the real story. By early Friday, Dow futures had climbed 244 points (0.76%), S&P 500 futures added 0.24%, and Nasdaq 100 futures crept up 0.07%. Some big names made noise. UnitedHealth surged more than 10% after both Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management revealed they had taken stakes in the company. Intel also rose over 4%, off a Bloomberg report that the Trump administration is exploring a plan to take a piece of the chipmaker. Oil prices held steady, showing signs of strength but not breaking out. Brent crude was up 16 cents to $67.00 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate inched up 14 cents to $64.10. Over in metals, it was a different story. Gold prices were heading for a rough week, down 1.8% so far. Hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data crushed hopes that the Federal Reserve might slash rates by 50 basis points at its next meeting in September. Spot gold ticked up just 0.1% to $3,339 per ounce by early Friday. December futures stayed flat at $3,384. Other metals followed gold’s lead; down, but not crashing. Spot silver slipped 0.2% to $37.91 per ounce. Platinum dropped 0.2%, landing at $1,354.94, and palladium gave up 0.3% to end at $1,142.51.

This substantial Aave transaction , first brought to light by Whale Alert , has certainly captured the attention of market observers and sparked widespread curiosity about its purpose and implications. What Exactly Happened? Unpacking This Aave Transaction Whale Alert , a prominent blockchain tracker, recently flagged an extraordinary USDT transfer . Their report indicated that 200,000,000 USDT, Tether’s stablecoin, departed from Aave, a leading DeFi protocol, destined for an undisclosed address. This single Aave transaction , valued at approximately $200 million, represents a significant movement of capital within the crypto ecosystem. Such a large movement from a well-known DeFi platform like Aave immediately raises questions. Was it a strategic move by a major player, or something else entirely? Understanding the context of these transfers is crucial for market participants. Why Do Large USDT Transfers Matter? A substantial large crypto transfer like this often signals notable activity behind the scenes. These movements can indicate several scenarios: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: A large buyer and seller might bypass public exchanges to execute a private trade, preventing price slippage. Institutional Rebalancing: Large institutions or funds often move assets to rebalance portfolios or shift between different investment strategies. Security Enhancement: Funds might be moved from a hot wallet (connected to the internet) to a cold storage solution (offline) for enhanced security. Exchange Deposits/Withdrawals: A large amount of USDT could be moved to or from an exchange, potentially in preparation for large trades or withdrawals. Every significant USDT transfer is closely monitored because it can offer glimpses into the strategies of major market participants. Who Are These Influential Crypto Whales? A crypto whale is an individual or entity holding a vast amount of cryptocurrency. They possess enough assets to potentially influence market prices with their trades or movements. These large holders are closely watched because their actions can provide insights into broader market sentiment or upcoming trends. When a crypto whale executes a move as significant as this recent Aave transaction, it naturally sparks intense speculation. While their identities remain hidden behind blockchain addresses, their financial maneuvers are transparent for all to see. What Are the Potential Impacts of This Large Crypto Transfer? While the exact implications of this particular large crypto transfer remain speculative due to the unknown recipient, such massive movements can have various effects. For the Aave protocol itself, a withdrawal of this size might temporarily impact its liquidity pools, though Aave is designed to handle large volumes. For the broader crypto market, a significant USDT transfer can trigger discussions about market stability or potential shifts in investment strategies among major players. However, it is important to remember that a single transfer, even a massive one, does not always dictate immediate market direction or signal impending price volatility. Understanding the Whale Alert and Blockchain Transparency The ability of Whale Alert to track and report such transactions highlights the inherent transparency of blockchain technology. While the identity of the wallet owner remains anonymous, the transaction itself—its origin, destination, and amount—is publicly verifiable on the blockchain. This transparency is a core principle of decentralized finance. It allows services like Whale Alert to provide valuable insights into market flows, even if the ultimate intentions behind each Aave transaction or large crypto transfer remain a mystery to external observers. Conclusion: The recent USDT transfer of $200 million from Aave to an unknown wallet, promptly highlighted by Whale Alert , truly underscores the dynamic and often mysterious nature of the crypto market. While the precise purpose of this large crypto transfer remains undisclosed, it serves as a powerful reminder of the significant influence that crypto whale movements can wield. Monitoring these substantial Aave transaction s helps us better understand the intricate pulse of the market and the constant flow of capital within the decentralized finance space. The crypto world is always moving, and keeping informed about these major shifts is key. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Aave? Aave is a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies. It operates on various blockchains and is known for its innovative features like flash loans. Q2: What does “unknown wallet” mean in a crypto transaction? An “unknown wallet” refers to a blockchain address whose owner’s real-world identity has not been publicly disclosed or linked. While the transaction itself is transparent on the blockchain, the individual or entity behind the address remains anonymous. Q3: Why is a $200 million USDT transfer considered significant? A transfer of $200 million is significant because it represents an enormous amount of capital. Such large movements typically involve institutional players or major investors (crypto whales) and can potentially signal strategic shifts, large trades, or changes in asset allocation. Q4: How do large crypto transfers like this affect the market? While a single large crypto transfer doesn’t guarantee a market impact, it can influence sentiment. Observers often speculate on the reasons behind such moves, which can lead to increased discussion, analysis, and sometimes, short-term market reactions, especially if the funds are moved to or from an exchange. Q5: What is Whale Alert? Whale Alert is a popular service that tracks and reports large cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. It provides real-time alerts on significant movements, helping market participants stay informed about major capital flows.

On the 4-hour chart, price remains within a broad ascending channel that has guided its uptrend since early August. The 50-SMA at $118,753 is acting as dynamic support, repeatedly halting intraday pullbacks, while the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level at $117,335 has so far held as a structural floor. The RSI has bounced from the mid-40s, signaling that selling pressure is easing, while the MACD histogram is flattening out, hinting that bearish momentum is losing steam. If Bitcoin manages to maintain this footing above $117,300, bulls could attempt another push toward the $123,236 resistance zone, with $126,242 as the next technical target. Macro Events Keep Traders on Edge The macro backdrop is playing a critical role in shaping near-term sentiment. CME FedWatch Tool data shows traders are now pricing a 92.6% probability of the Federal Reserve cutting rates to 4.00–4.25% at its September 17 meeting, down from the current 4.25–4.50% range. This expectation shift came after U.S. PPI data surprised to the upside at +0.9% versus the 0.2% forecast, while weekly jobless claims held steady at 224K. Source: CME FedWatch Tool Now onto Friday’s US retail sales and consumer sentiment numbers, which will tell us if the Fed will stick to the rate cut script. A soft print will boost risk appetite and give Bitcoin the push it needs to clear the overhead resistance. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Price Prediction: Technical Route to $130K From a structural perspective, the price action is bullish. The channel is still intact, and higher lows are reinforcing the trend. A break above $126K will trigger buying and accelerate the move to $130K, which is a supply zone and psychological round number resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview If this break happens, the channel’s upper boundary will project to $150K in the coming quarters. On the flip side, a close below $117,300 will expose the $113,650 invalidation level, where the 100-SMA is. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Trade Setup For traders, the accumulation zone between $117,300-$118,000 is a good risk-reward setup. Longs can target $123,200 first and then $126,200 with stops just below $113,650 to protect against a deeper correction. With the technicals stable, the Fed leaning dovish, and macro catalysts coming up, Bitcoin’s next big move may happen sooner than we think. If the bulls can hold the current support and regain momentum, a move to $130K and higher is back on the table.

While it remains uncertain which direction the market will move, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has arrived today, as it does every Friday. According to data for the third week of August, $4.7 billion worth of Bitcoin and $1.3 billion worth of Ethereum options will expire on August 15 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.90, the maximum loss point is $117,000 and the notional value is $4.7 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 1.02, a maximum loss point of $4,000, and a notional value of $1.3 billion. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin's price following the $4.7 billion options expiration on August 15th. While the maximum pain point is at $117,000 for BTC and $4,000 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. The put/call ratio for Bitcoin of 0.90 also indicates that there are slightly more call options (bets on a price increase) than put options (bets on a price decrease). This suggests that option traders are taking a bullish position despite the price trading above its maximum pain level. The same isn't true for Ethereum. ETH's put/call ratio of 1.02 indicates that put options (bets on a price decline) are slightly more active than call options (bets on a price increase). A ratio closer to 1 suggests investors are in a slightly bearish but balanced market. Analysts at Greeks.live stated that the unexpected correction in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets was due to the PPI data. However, despite this sharp correction, analysts noted that there were no major changes in the options market. Analysts reported a trading volume of $10.9 billion on Deribit, marking the first time trading volume has surpassed the $10 billion mark in a single day. Despite the decline, analysts noted that this record indicates an upward trend, saying, “high trading enthusiasm suggests the market is not worried about its future and the bull market is likely to continue.” *This is not investment advice.

Nguyên nhân đứng sau đà tăng gần đây của Ethereum: Hai chất xúc tác chính Đầu tiên, vào ngày 7 tháng 8, Tổng thống Trump đã ký một sắc lệnh cho phép các quỹ hưu trí 401(k) được bao gồm tiền điện tử và các loại tài sản thay thế khác. Động thái này được xem là một bước tiến lớn hướng tới việc chấp nhận crypto rộng rãi, vì nó mang lại cho các nhà đầu tư phổ thông cơ hội tiếp cận một trong những loại tài sản tăng trưởng nhanh nhất với lợi thế về thuế. Ira Auerbach, cựu giám đốc mảng tài sản số tại Nasdaq, nhận định rằng nếu được triển khai hiệu quả, điều này có thể tạo ra cầu nối thực sự giữa tiết kiệm hưu trí truyền thống và công nghệ blockchain. Tiếp theo, công ty nắm giữ $ETH niêm yết công khai – Fundamental Global – đã nộp hồ sơ đăng ký phát hành chứng khoán trị giá 5 tỷ USD lên SEC, cho thấy niềm tin mạnh mẽ từ các tổ chức vào tài sản này. Nói đơn giản, đây là một sự chấp thuận từ cơ quan quản lý cho phép công ty có thể nhanh chóng bán chứng khoán theo thời gian mà không cần xin phê duyệt riêng cho từng đợt phát hành. Công ty đặt mục tiêu sử dụng số vốn huy động để mua một lượng Ethereum lớn, vượt xa quy mô nắm giữ hiện tại của các đơn vị niêm yết công khai như SharpLink Gaming và Ether Machine. Đợt tăng của $ETH có thể kích hoạt làn sóng altcoin mới Michaël van de Poppe, đồng sáng lập MN Trading Capital, gần đây đã bày tỏ quan điểm lạc quan về altcoin, cho biết ông vẫn “all-in” vào phân khúc này. Sự lạc quan này xuất phát từ kỳ vọng về một mùa altcoin sắp tới có thể mang lại mức tăng từ 200% đến 500%, được thúc đẩy bởi cú bứt phá gần đây của Ethereum và sự quan tâm gia tăng từ các tổ chức. Tổng kết lại, với việc Ethereum đang mở ra một kỷ nguyên mới cho altcoin, những token tiện ích thực sự đóng góp vào sự phát triển của crypto có thể sẽ là những người chiến thắng lớn nhất. Và với hơn 14,5 triệu USD huy động từ các nhà đầu tư sớm, cùng sự chú ý của các “cá voi” và làn sóng truyền thông, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) đang nổi lên như ứng viên hàng đầu. Best Wallet Token là gì? $BEST là đồng tiền điện tử gốc của Best Wallet – một ví crypto phi tập trung được thiết kế để mang đến cho những người mới lần đầu sở hữu ví một cánh cửa lý tưởng bước vào thế giới bảo mật tiền điện tử, trong bối cảnh ngành này đang tăng trưởng với tốc độ CAGR 31,9%. Best Wallet đặt yếu tố bảo mật lên hàng đầu, đảm bảo mọi khía cạnh đều được kiểm soát chặt chẽ. Trước hết, đây là ví tự quản (self-custodial), nghĩa là bạn nắm toàn quyền kiểm soát khóa riêng tư – và từ đó là toàn bộ quyền sở hữu tài sản của mình, không phụ thuộc vào bên thứ ba. Ngoài ra, ví được trang bị bộ tính năng bảo mật toàn diện nhằm bảo vệ tài sản và dữ liệu của bạn ở mọi bước. Điều này bao gồm cơ chế chống hack, lừa đảo, và các trang phishing, công nghệ mã hóa tiên tiến, cùng các tùy chọn xác thực đa lớp nâng cao như đăng nhập sinh trắc học. Đơn giản & thân thiện với người mới Từ việc thiết lập ví đầu tiên cho đến hoán đổi token trên nhiều blockchain, Best Wallet được xây dựng hướng tới sự đơn giản và dễ sử dụng. Người dùng còn có thể tạo nhiều ví Ethereum để quản lý danh mục đầu tư theo cách riêng – chẳng hạn, một ví cho lưu trữ dài hạn, một ví cho giao dịch DeFi, một ví cho NFT và một ví dành cho staking. Điểm nổi bật nhất của Best Wallet là Presale Aggregator, cho phép mua các meme coin tốt nhất đang mở bán presale trực tiếp ngay trong ứng dụng. Vì vậy, không giống như các ví crypto miễn phí khác, bạn không cần truy cập trang presale bên ngoài, kết nối ví rồi quay lại ứng dụng để xác nhận giao dịch. Với Best Wallet, toàn bộ quy trình diễn ra liền mạch, nhanh chóng và an toàn, nhờ đội ngũ nội bộ kiểm duyệt từng token trước khi niêm yết để bảo vệ người dùng khỏi các vụ lừa đảo hoặc rug pull. Mua $BEST ngay khi đang trong giai đoạn Presale để tối đa hóa lợi nhuận Best Wallet Token hiện chưa được niêm yết trên các sàn giao dịch, nghĩa là giá vẫn đang ở mức thấp nhất. Với hơn 14,5 triệu USD huy động từ các nhà đầu tư sớm, mỗi token hiện có giá chỉ 0,025455 USD. Theo dự đoán giá $BEST, token này có thể tăng tới 2.300% vào năm 2026, đạt mức khoảng 0,62 USD. Triển vọng tích cực này phần lớn đến từ kế hoạch tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ của Best Wallet, với mục tiêu chiếm hơn 40% thị phần ví crypto phi tập trung vào năm 2027. Thêm vào đó, mua $BEST còn mang lại nhiều quyền lợi độc quyền trong nền tảng, bao gồm: Giảm phí giao dịch và phí gas Quyền bỏ phiếu cho các quyết định quan trọng của nền tảng Quyền truy cập sớm vào các meme coin mới trong giai đoạn presale Phần thưởng staking, hiện có lợi suất 92% APY Tổng kết Đợt bứt phá mới đây của Ethereum vượt mốc 4.000 USD đang được xem là tín hiệu rõ ràng cho thấy thị trường altcoin có thể sắp bước vào giai đoạn bùng nổ. Với cách tiếp cận dựa trên tiện ích và sự quan tâm lớn từ cộng đồng trong giai đoạn presale, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) đang ở vị thế hoàn hảo để tận dụng làn sóng này và mang lại tiềm năng lợi nhuận lớn. Tuy nhiên, cần lưu ý rằng thị trường crypto có độ biến động rất cao và việc đầu tư luôn tiềm ẩn rủi ro.

The SEC will now decide by October 16, 2025, whether to approve or reject the filings. In the report, the SEC explained that it needs more time to go through the proposals and the issues they raised . This is after previous extensions and formal proceedings that were started in May. SEC delays Bitwise and 21Shares decisions to October The SEC postponed its ruling on Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals from Bitwise and 21Shares, setting a new deadline of October 16, 2025. The agency invoked its full 60-day extension authority, following an earlier delay in March and the initiation of formal proceedings in May. In its latest notice, the SEC said it needs more time to review the applications and the issues they raise, citing the need to thoroughly assess broader market implications, regulatory compliance, and investor protection measures before taking any final action. The standard public comment period and review process began after Bitwise and 21Shares first submitted their applications on January 28, 2025, and the filings were published in the Federal Register on February 18, 2025. To meet the agency’s expectations for transparency, market integrity, and protection against potential manipulation, both firms updated their filings to align more closely with SEC requirements. These updates show that both Bitwise and 21Shares want to provide a strong framework for a Solana-based ETF that could operate safely in the U.S. market while responding to regulatory concerns. The ongoing debate about whether Solana should be classified as a security or a commodity continues to influence the SEC’s cautious approach. Analysts also point out the potential concentration of control among a small number of network participants and the maturity of the Solana network as other determining factors. Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, said the agency must ensure that these products do not create undue risk for investors or the broader market, even with growing interest in altcoin ETFs. He explained that the SEC’s careful review reflects the need to balance market innovation with proper safeguards because regulatory clarity and a mature ecosystem are critical for investor confidence. Investors react as other Solana ETF filings remain pending As the SEC carefully evaluates each proposal’s regulatory, technical, and market-related aspects, the applications of Grayscale , Fidelity, ProShares, and Canary Funds for Solana ETFs face similar delays. The repeated delays show that the SEC weighs factors such as market integrity, investor protection, and the proper classification of Solana as a security or commodity before approval. Meanwhile, the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, said it has no interest in the Solana market because it’s satisfied with its existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Analysts say BlackRock’s choice could influence how other large managers approach the Solana ETF market in the future. It may also reflect the firm’s assessment of Solana’s relative risk compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Reactions to the SEC’s announcement show how sensitive cryptocurrency markets are to regulatory developments and public statements by key agencies, as Solana’s price dropped following the delay. The October 16 outcome could set a precedent for future approvals of similar products since investors and traders may adjust their positions in Solana and other related assets as they anticipate the SEC’s decision. Some analysts say that a standard spot Solana ETF will exist this year if the proposals meet the agency’s market surveillance, liquidity, and investor protection requirements. On the other hand, others say that the more the SEC focuses on safety and oversight, the more scrutiny proposals will undergo before being approved. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The massive purchase occurred as Bitcoin retreated from its new all-time high of $124,457 to current levels around $119,000. The acquisition also coincided with BlackRock’s aggressive accumulation strategy, with the asset manager purchasing $523 million in Bitcoin and $519 million in Ethereum during Thursday’s market dump. US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $230 million in net inflows on August 14, led by BlackRock’s IBIT with $524 million, while Ethereum ETFs saw $640 million in inflows driven by ETHA’s $520 million contribution.

Adding more bullish optimism, David Bailey’s Bitcoin firm Nakamoto has completed its merger with healthcare company KindlyMD to create a publicly traded vehicle targeting $ 1 million in Bitcoin accumulation. The merged entity plans to deploy $540 million from recent financing into building substantial Bitcoin treasury holdings. Market Massacre Tests Institutional Resolve The July Producer Price Index exceeded expectations at 3.3% annually versus the forecasted 2.5%, triggering the largest crypto liquidation event in months. Bybit suffered the heaviest casualties with $447 million in destroyed leveraged positions, representing 42% of total liquidations across exchanges. Ethereum bore the brunt of asset-specific damage, falling 3.78% with $229 million in long positions and $80.22 million in short positions obliterated. Bitcoin declined 2.98%, erasing $253 million in leveraged positions in minutes, while altcoins suffered deeper corrections with SOL down 5.12%, XRP dropping 6.63%, and DOGE plummeting 8.90%. Popular trader AguilaTrades lost 18,323 ETH worth $83.56 million, leaving only $330,000 in their account after the liquidation cascade.

Source: BitcoinHyper on X The recent spike above $124,000, followed by a retracement into the $118,500-$123,000 range, suggests a deviation rather than a genuine breakout. Bitcoin futures premium remains neutral below 10%, indicating traders were unfazed by the price drop from all-time highs. The resilience in derivatives markets indicates little fear of retesting $110,000 support despite repeated failures above $120,000. The anonymous whale’s $792 million acquisition provides fundamental support but has not overcome existing resistance dynamics. Technical analysis suggests other institutional players may be using strength to rebalance positions, requiring additional accumulation before decisive breakouts. Bitcoin appears positioned for continued range-bound trading between $116,000-$123,000 while rebuilding its technical foundation. The whale investment should provide a floor for corrections rather than an immediate breakout catalyst, with patience required before sustained advances beyond current resistance levels.

Recent reports confirm that ETH ETF holdings , combined with Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) entities, have collectively surpassed an astonishing 10 million Ethereum (ETH). This monumental accumulation highlights a growing trend of institutional confidence and widespread adoption of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Understanding ETH ETF Holdings and the Strategic ETH Reserve This remarkable accumulation, announced by the Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) on X, signals a powerful shift in how major players view and invest in the crypto space. When we talk about ETH ETF holdings , we refer to the Ethereum held by Exchange Traded Funds. These funds allow traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They streamline investment, offering regulated and accessible pathways. The Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) comprises various entities, including large institutions, corporate treasuries, and even decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). These entities strategically hold Ethereum for long-term value or specific ecosystem purposes. Their combined holdings with Ethereum ETFs demonstrate a robust belief in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its future potential. This isn’t just about price speculation; it’s about recognizing Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 infrastructure. Accessibility: Ethereum ETFs make investment easier for traditional financial institutions. Validation: Large-scale holdings by SER entities and ETFs validate Ethereum as a serious asset class. Liquidity: Increased institutional participation can enhance market liquidity and stability. The Profound Impact of Institutional Ethereum Accumulation The accumulation of over 10 million ETH by these entities has profound implications for the broader crypto market. Firstly, it represents a substantial amount of Ethereum being held off exchanges, which can potentially reduce selling pressure and contribute to price stability. Secondly, it showcases the increasing appetite for Institutional Ethereum , moving it from a niche asset to a recognized component of diversified portfolios. This trend also suggests a maturing market. As more regulated products like Ethereum ETFs emerge and as major entities commit significant capital, the perception of crypto assets shifts. Investors often look to institutional involvement as a sign of legitimacy and long-term viability. This growing institutional footprint can attract even more capital, creating a positive feedback loop for Ethereum’s ecosystem. What are the benefits for the average investor? Increased Stability: Institutional buying, including through ETH ETF holdings , can help reduce volatility. Broader Acceptance: More institutional adoption paves the way for wider public acceptance. Ecosystem Growth: Capital inflow supports development within the Ethereum network, leading to better dApps and services. Analyzing Future Crypto Investment Trends and Ethereum’s Role While the surge in ETH ETF holdings and SER accumulation is overwhelmingly positive, it also brings considerations. The concentration of a significant portion of Ethereum in fewer hands, albeit large and diverse entities, could raise questions about centralization in the long term. However, Ethereum’s decentralized network architecture aims to mitigate such concerns, focusing on broad participation at the protocol level. Looking ahead, these crypto investment trends suggest a continued professionalization of the digital asset space. We can anticipate more financial products catering to institutional demand, further integrating cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial system. For individuals, understanding these macro shifts is crucial. It helps in assessing market sentiment and potential long-term trajectories for assets like Ethereum. The growth of the Strategic ETH Reserve alongside ETFs highlights a collective belief in Ethereum’s enduring value. Actionable Insight: Stay informed about regulatory developments and the performance of institutional crypto products. These indicators often provide valuable insights into the market’s direction and future ETH ETF holdings . The impressive milestone of over 10 million ETH held by SER entities and Ethereum ETFs underscores a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency. It signifies robust institutional confidence, a maturing market, and a clear path toward greater integration of digital assets into global finance. This growing embrace of Ethereum by major players solidifies its position as a foundational technology for the future of finance and the internet. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are SER entities in the context of Ethereum holdings? A1: SER (Strategic ETH Reserve) entities refer to a diverse group of large holders, including institutional investors, corporate treasuries, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), who strategically accumulate and hold Ethereum for long-term value and ecosystem participation. Q2: How do Ethereum ETFs work? A2: Ethereum ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency themselves. They trade on traditional stock exchanges, offering a regulated and accessible way to invest in ETH. Q3: Why is 10 million ETH a significant milestone? A3: Surpassing 10 million ETH in combined holdings by SER entities and ETFs is significant because it demonstrates a substantial and growing institutional commitment to Ethereum, signaling strong confidence in its long-term potential and utility. This scale of accumulation can impact market stability and legitimacy. Q4: How does institutional accumulation affect Ethereum’s price? A4: Institutional accumulation can positively affect Ethereum’s price by reducing the circulating supply available on exchanges, increasing demand, and signaling market maturity. This can lead to greater price stability and potential long-term appreciation, though market dynamics are complex. Q5: What are the potential challenges of increased institutional ETH holdings? A5: While largely positive, potential challenges could include concerns about centralization if too much supply becomes concentrated, though Ethereum’s decentralized nature at the protocol level aims to mitigate this. Regulatory scrutiny may also increase with greater institutional involvement. Did you find this article insightful?

The report from DWF Ventures, the investment arm of DWF Labs, charts Hyperliquid’s evolution from an Arbitrum-based PerpDEX to its current Layer 1 platform following migration to HyperEVM and the HYPE token airdrop. Community-first strategy DWF Ventures attributes Hyperliquid’s success to its absence of early-stage VC funding, instead focusing on refining UX and organically growing its community. This approach was rewarded through the allocation of 31% of HYPE’s total supply to early users via airdrop. Since moving to HyperEVM, the platform has achieved record performance. In July, Hyperliquid recorded $320 billion in perps volume and $87 million in revenue, accounting for 35% of all blockchain revenue that month, the largest share by any single chain. The platform’s market share versus major CEXs like Bybit and OKX has reached all-time highs, with its aggregate market share climbing to the current 6.1% peak. The analysis highlights HYPE’s tokenomics, where 97% of trading fees fund token buybacks. To date, close to $1.3 billion of HYPE has been market bought by the Hyperliquid Assistance Fund. The report also examines governance proposals, including permissionless perps market creation without centralized approval. “Hyperliquid’s growth has been driven by factors including a successful airdrop, a strong and organic community, and of course, its effective product,” the report concludes. “As the platform’s market share continues to trend upwards, it is poised to capture further growth, translating to increased buybacks and buy pressure over time.” Featured image via Shutterstock.

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $100K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After a sharp 4% drop yesterday, Bitcoin ($BTC) is back in the green. And while today’s gain is under 1%, it’s a meaningful move given that this price bounce is happening at a critical support level. On the daily chart, $BTC is now resting almost perfectly on the 50% Fibonacci retracement level – yesterday’s candle didn’t even close below it. This is a strong bullish signal because the 50% Fib is often seen as a ‘make-or-break’ zone in trending markets, where buyers step in aggressively to defend the uptrend. Even better? On the 4-hour chart, the bounce aligns with both the 100 EMA and an upward-sloping trendline (orange), creating a powerful confluence of support. Confluence like this increases the probability of a sustained move higher, as multiple technical factors attract buying pressure. As for the upside, if the Fibonacci pattern plays out, Bitcoin could climb to at least the high of the Fib range – $124,501 – putting a new all-time high potentially within arm’s reach. Coinbase Completes Deribit Purchase, Adding $60B Futures Platform While $HYPER Builds for Bitcoin’s Future August 15, 2025 • 10:10 UTC Coinbase completed its purchase of Deribit in one of the biggest acquisitions of 2025 – and Coinbase’s sixth expansion of the year. The move gives Coinbase a platform that did its biggest-ever month in July, over $185B in trading volume. It also signals how quickly the crypto economy is moving towards consolidation and building the next generation of crypto products. That’s something on clear display with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), the fastest Bitcoin Layer 2. Using a modular architecture that combines Bitcoin’s Layer 1 and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), $HYPER could vastly expand Bitcoin’s utility. Visit the project homepage to learn more. US Inflation Rises, Creating Short-Term Headwinds, But Bulls Remain Focused on Future with Bitcoin Hyper August 15, 2025 • 10:10 UTC Bad news, at least for the short-term, as the most recent data showed US inflation heating up; it rose 0.9% in July. The risk for crypto – including the blue-chips like Ethereum and Bitcoin – is indirect, at least for now. If inflation rises too quickly, the Fed may be unwilling to cut rates in its September meeting. Still, the long-term outlook remains bullish, with rising global liquidity from both China and the US. Savvy investors are keeping a clear eye on the future, with projects like Bitcoin Hyper’s innovative modular Bitcoin Layer 2 demonstrating just how much creativity still lies in the sector.

Today’s Dogecoin Technical Analysis Dogecoin ($DOGE) remains in a precarious spot, with two major resistances looming just above current price levels. The first is the blue rectangle zone, a key level that triggered a sharp 45% sell-off back in June. The second is the upper blue trendline of a descending triangle pattern, which has repeatedly capped upside attempts – the most recent being in July. On the brighter side, $DOGE has just rebounded from the 200 EMA on the 4-hour chart and is now holding strong above the 50 EMA – both bullish technical signals. Adding to the confluence, this bounce is also originating from the latest 4-hour support zone (green box), further reinforcing the case for a potential upward move. All in all, while there are definitely reasons to be cautious, the potential for an upward push is undeniable, too, possibly giving $DOGE the momentum needed to challenge and break through these resistances with greater force. $DOGE Whales Just Bought 2B Tokens, Could $MAXI be Next on The Radar? August 15, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Dogecoin whales just went full send, scooping up 2B DOGE (roughly $448M) this past week.

U.S. banking giant Wells Fargo has dramatically increased its Wells Fargo IBIT holdings in the second quarter of this year. This move signals a growing trend of institutional engagement with digital assets, specifically through Bitcoin ETF investment . Previously holding $26 million, Wells Fargo’s stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has now surged to over $160 million, as reported by Crypto Briefing and confirmed by a recent SEC filing. This substantial jump highlights the increasing confidence traditional financial institutions place in the crypto market. What Does Wells Fargo’s IBIT Investment Signify? This significant increase in IBIT investment by Wells Fargo is more than just a number; it represents a powerful endorsement. It demonstrates that major players in traditional finance are not just observing the cryptocurrency space but actively participating in it. This action could encourage other large institutions to explore similar avenues for institutional crypto adoption , further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable asset class. The decision to boost Wells Fargo Bitcoin ETF exposure reflects several key factors: Growing Client Demand: Institutions like Wells Fargo often respond to evolving client interest in new investment opportunities. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has provided a clearer regulatory framework, reducing perceived risks. Diversification Strategy: Bitcoin offers a unique uncorrelated asset class, potentially enhancing portfolio diversification for large investors. This strategic move by Wells Fargo underscores a broader shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. How Are Bitcoin ETFs Driving Institutional Crypto Adoption? Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock’s IBIT, provide a regulated and accessible gateway for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This simplifies compliance and operational complexities. The ease of access offered by these products is a major catalyst for increased Bitcoin ETF investment across the financial sector. For instance, an institution can invest in IBIT through their existing brokerage accounts, treating it much like any other exchange-traded fund. This familiarity lowers the barrier to entry for cautious investors who might otherwise shy away from direct crypto purchases. The transparency and liquidity of ETFs also appeal to large-scale investors. What Are the Broader Implications of Increased IBIT Holdings? The expanded Wells Fargo IBIT holdings have far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This significant institutional capital inflow can: Boost Market Confidence: Large investments from established entities can instill greater confidence among retail and institutional investors alike. Enhance Liquidity: Increased trading volume in Bitcoin ETFs contributes to overall market liquidity. Pave the Way for More Adoption: As more financial giants follow suit, it could accelerate the mainstream integration of cryptocurrencies into global finance. This trend suggests a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly viewed as legitimate components of diversified investment portfolios. It also highlights the strategic importance of regulated products like IBIT in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. Looking Ahead: The Future of Institutional Bitcoin ETF Investment The remarkable growth in Wells Fargo IBIT holdings is likely just the beginning. As the crypto market continues to evolve and mature, we can anticipate even more significant participation from institutional investors. The success of products like IBIT is proving that there is substantial demand for regulated, accessible crypto investment vehicles. This shift represents a pivotal moment for digital assets. It signals a future where cryptocurrencies are not just niche investments but integral components of global financial strategies. The ongoing commitment from major players like Wells Fargo is a testament to Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition and its potential to reshape the financial landscape. In conclusion, Wells Fargo’s substantial increase in IBIT investment is a clear indicator of growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space. This move, driven by factors like client demand and regulatory clarity, underscores the transformative role of Bitcoin ETFs in bridging traditional finance with the crypto economy. As more institutions embrace this path, the future of digital asset adoption looks increasingly promising, paving the way for a more integrated financial world.

A2: Wells Fargo’s substantial increase in IBIT holdings from $26 million to over $160 million signifies growing confidence from major traditional financial institutions in Bitcoin as an asset class.

XRP Is Not A Scam, Expert Admits In the edited segment, Yusko jokes about “the XRP army,” then acknowledges, “I might’ve said that XRP is a scam… and I actually kind of stand by it,” before adding that price increases say more about order flow than about underlying functionality: “And the fact that an asset increases in price doesn’t mean that the functionality got better. It just means that, you know, there’s more buyers than sellers. So the price rises,” he said. He also riffed on Washington “king-making” ledgers for specific functions and poked at rumors after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was photographed with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. DAI framed the repost bluntly: “XRP Is a Dinosaur Coin According to @scottmelker. XRP is a scam according to @MarkYusko… When Bitcoin becomes an Altcoin they know the party is over.” Scott “The Wolf of All Streets” Melker pushed back almost immediately—at once distancing himself from Yusko’s characterization and from the entire topic. “I don’t think XRP is a scam,” he wrote . “I don’t really think about XRP. However, many who do think about XRP get deeply troubled when they think that someone might think something bad about XRP. Seems like their problem, not mine.” In a follow-up, he clarified that what he found “amazing” was Yusko’s willingness to say exactly what he thinks, not the idea that XRP is fraudulent. That posture—simultaneously rejecting the “scam” label while calling XRP and Ethereum “dinosaur” coins—tracked with Melker’s public commentary and helped sustain the flare-up across Crypto-Twitter overnight.Supporters of XRP seized on the moment to argue that blanket aspersions are out of step with the project’s legal and market standing after the five-year SEC fight wound down this month. The most detailed rebuttal came from “Cryptoinsightuk,” who argued that the “scam” discourse is selectively applied and misreads both market structure and the recent history of enforcement. His core position: “The crazy part about this is XRP is no more of a ‘scam’ than BTC, which is no more of a “scam” than the dollar and the whole financial system. It blows my mind to watch the constant bombardment of hatred towards XRP specifically and then for those throwing out wild accusations” He also pushed back on Yusko’s “king-maker” framing by noting that, for years, US authorities effectively did the opposite by singling out Ripple and its token for aggressive action. In his telling, that history undermines the idea that XRP has benefited from preferential treatment, even implicitly. Lawyer Bill Morgan (@Belisarius2020) just commented: “A truly ridiculous take. Much anti-XRP FUD comes from the same sources. It has nothing to do with valid criticism of XRP or preference for other coins. It is deliberate FUD.” On August 8, 2025, the US Securities and Exchange Commission formally ended its lawsuit against Ripple Labs; District Judge Analisa Torres’ penalties remained in place—most notably a $125 million civil fine and an injunction restricting certain institutional-sale conduct—while both sides dropped their appeals. The court’s 2023 summary-judgment split still defines the legal perimeter: institutional sales of XRP were unregistered securities offerings; programmatic sales on exchanges were not. That distinction is central to why the “scam” charge grates in 2025. The legal record does not pronounce the token itself fraudulent; it delineates when and how Ripple’s sales practices fell under securities law. As for Yusko, his critique in the resurfaced clip is less about illegality and more about utility, politics and narrative gravity—an argument that an asset’s price ascent can be disconnected from improvements in its “functionality.” At press time, XRP traded at $",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 10:00:14

Senator Cynthia Lummis swiftly framed the endpoint. “America needs the BITCOIN Act,” she wrote, calling the legislation the operative blueprint for expanding a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve without tapping taxpayers. In a Fox Business hit that ricocheted across X, Bessent said the government is “not going to be buying” additional bitcoin and added, “We’re going to stop selling that,” referencing a reserve he valued between $15 billion and $20 billion. Markets faded into the statement; by mid-day, bitcoin was off roughly 3.7%. The point that stuck—“we’re not going to be buying”—was clipped and shared widely, but it was only half the story. Related Reading: Q4 Will Decide If The 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle Is Dead: Analyst Hours later, Bessent posted a clarifying note. “Bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government will be the foundation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Trump established in his March Executive Order,” he wrote. “In addition, Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President’s promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world.’” The course correction aligned his comments with the administration’s March directive and the policy discussion that has matured since. Bitcoin Act Is Still The Way Forward Lummis, chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, seized the moment to underline the fiscal constraint. “Secretary Scott Bessent is right: a budget-neutral path to building SBR is the way. We cannot save our country from $37T debt by purchasing more bitcoin, but we can revalue gold reserves to today’s prices & transfer the increase in value to build SBR. America needs the BITCOIN Act.” In a separate reply to Bessent, she added: “I have a ₿ill for that.” Her posts also flagged ongoing work “with Scott Bessent & Howard Lutnick to identify budget-neutral ways to continue growing our bitcoin reserve & outpacing adversaries in the race.” The legal and administrative scaffolding for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve was set five months ago. On March 6, President Trump signed an executive order creating the SBR and a separate US Digital Asset Stockpile, directing agencies to capitalize the reserve with Bitcoin “finally forfeited” to the government and to develop budget-neutral strategies for further acquisition. Related Reading: Binance Bitcoin Reserves Surge To 579,000 BTC – Signal Of Profit-Taking Or Bullish Liquidity? Lummis’s “BITCOIN Act” would take that framework from executive policy to statute and goes considerably further. The latest text lays out a five-year purchase program authorizing up to 200,000 BTC per year—1,000,000 BTC in total—paired with a 20-year minimum holding period and a quarterly, public cryptographic proof-of-reserves regime. Where Bessent’s remarks intersect—and diverge—with that legislative ambition is gold. In March, he downplayed a formal revaluation of US gold as a credible budget lever, even as the broader policy conversation around the asset side of the federal balance sheet intensified. On Thursday, Bessent told Fox Business that a gold revaluation is “unlikely.” Lummis, by contrast, is explicitly proposing to mark gold to market in order to seed the SBR without new borrowing—an idea that has migrated from think-piece fodder to bill text but still faces macro, legal, and central-bank-independence scrutiny. The bottom line is that Thursday did not mark a policy reversal so much as a restatement of sequencing. The executive branch will build the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve first with finally forfeited coins and, per Bessent’s clarification, is actively evaluating budget-neutral ways to expand it.

Experts Weigh In Their Stance,https://timestabloid.com/could-this-token-reach-4-before-doge-tests-2-experts-weigh/,"The crypto community is buzzing with speculation about whether Dogecoin (DOGE) can break the $2 mark, but seasoned analysts are pointing toward another contender with more functional firepower— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While DOGE thrives on community hype and meme momentum, MUTM is emerging as a true DeFi workhorse, offering features that blend real-world lending utility with the kind of strategic upside that investors rarely see in presale markets. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed as a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that enables users to earn interest and access capital through a dual lending system. This unique approach lets participants choose between peer-to-contract (P2C) lending—earning yield from blue-chip crypto loans—or peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, where risk-takers can strike private deals, even leveraging trending memecoins. This flexibility is more than just a novelty; it creates a diverse and adaptable lending ecosystem, something memecoins like DOGE will never be able to replicate. The upcoming Layer-2 integration will be a defining moment for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). By significantly increasing transaction throughput while slashing fees, the platform will make lending and borrowing efficient enough to support large-scale adoption. In practical terms, this means faster loan settlements, lower costs for both lenders and borrowers, and a frictionless gateway for users entering the ecosystem. Pair this with the upcoming beta launch, and users will have a hands-on opportunity to explore live lending, staking, and the protocol’s upcoming stablecoin—laying the groundwork for a powerful network effect before the token even lists on major exchanges. Presale Momentum and Strategic Advantage Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at $0.035. To date, $14.39 million has been raised, with 17% of the allocation sold and over 15,250 holders already on board. The window for buyers to enter at this rate is closing quickly, as Phase 7 will trigger a 15% price increase. The sense of urgency is compounded by the fact that the project’s credibility has already been validated through a rigorous CertiK audit, achieving an impressive Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet score of 78. The roadmap points toward aggressive milestones, including listings on leading exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, KuCoin, and MEXC—moves that will instantly increase visibility and liquidity. A major catalyst will be the launch of the platform’s stablecoin, ensuring reliable lending liquidity and anchoring the protocol’s economic structure. Another revenue driver is the mtToken staking mechanism, which will distribute dividends to participants via a buyback system. As lending and borrowing activity grows, so will the volume of buybacks, creating a continuous cycle of demand for MUTM. To understand the power of early positioning, consider this: an investor who joined in Phase 2 with $40,000 at a token price of $0.015 would have secured 2,666,666 MUTM tokens. At today’s Phase 6 price of $0.035, that investment is valued at $93,333—already a 133% gain on paper before the token even lists. When Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches its projected $4 target, that same holding will be worth $10,666,664. This kind of growth potential is not built on hype alone but on a model with proven economic mechanics, deep liquidity planning, and high-speed Layer-2 infrastructure. The Case for $4 Before DOGE Hits $2 While DOGE remains a cultural phenomenon, its growth prospects are heavily tied to sentiment and viral attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), by contrast, is building a real economy within DeFi—an environment where tokens earn yield, users borrow without selling their assets, and market participants can operate in a high-speed, low-cost Layer-2 ecosystem. The addition of a stablecoin will provide stability and predictable liquidity for borrowers, while mtToken staking will reward long-term users with tangible value. The $4 target for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is supported by clear, measurable drivers: an imminent beta launch that will test real features, listings on top exchanges to attract global exposure, and a structural buy-and-distribute model that fuels ongoing demand. With Phase 6 only 17% sold, investors still have a rare opportunity to secure MUTM at $0.035 before the next price increase locks in. The window is closing fast, and history often rewards those who act early—just as it did in crypto’s most legendary success stories.

50124084,https://cryptonews.com/?p=409286,1755252060,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50124084.jpeg,New York Assembly Bill Seeks 0.2% Excise Tax on Crypto and NFT Transactions,https://cryptonews.com/news/new-york-assembly-bill-seeks-0-2-excise-tax-on-crypto-and-nft-transactions/,"New York Assembly Member Phil Steck has introduced legislation imposing a 0.2% excise tax on all digital asset transactions, including crypto and NFT sales or transfers. According to the bill filing , the proceeds will be earmarked for expanding substance abuse prevention programs in upstate schools. Source: NYAssembly State Revenue Generation Targets Growing Digital Asset Sector Assembly Bill A08966, introduced August 13 and referred to the Ways and Means Committee, would take effect September 1, 2025, marking another state-level attempt to generate revenue from the growing crypto sector. The bill defines digital assets broadly as any asset “ issued, transferred, or both, using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, ” encompassing digital currencies, coins, and non-fungible tokens. The legislation places responsibility for tax payment on “ the person or persons making or effectuating the sale or transfer, ” potentially creating compliance challenges for exchanges, traders, and DeFi protocols operating in New York. The proposed tax comes as global jurisdictions pursue diverse approaches to crypto taxation, ranging from total bans in China to innovation-friendly frameworks in Switzerland and Singapore. The Trump administration reversed Biden-era crypto enforcement policies in 2025, repealing DeFi broker rules and positioning the US as more crypto-friendly, while the EU implemented comprehensive MiCA regulations requiring strict licensing for crypto asset service providers. Global Tax Race Intensifies as Revenue Potential Becomes Clear Thailand, for instance, has implemented a five-year personal income tax exemption on crypto capital gains through licensed platforms, effective January 2025 through December 2029. The Thai government anticipates over 1 billion baht in additional tax revenue through indirect economic activity despite the exemption. While Thailand wants to exempt taxation, taxing countries are progressing gradually. Most recently, Indonesia’s crypto tax revenue jumped 181% to $38 million in 2024, driven by transaction volumes reaching $39.67 billion as the country’s crypto user base exceeded 20 million people. Indonesia’s crypto tax revenue jumped 181% in 2024 to ~$38M, but collections have fallen in 2025 due to market volatility. #cryptotax #Indonesia https://t.co/s20V54zazb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 However, 2025 collections dropped to $6.97 million through July due to market volatility, highlighting the challenge of relying on crypto taxes for stable revenue. The Indonesian government raised taxes on foreign exchanges from 0.2% to 1% while keeping domestic platform increases modest at 0.21%, attempting to shift activity toward regulated local platforms. Mining operations face doubled VAT from 1.1% to 2.2%, with special income tax rates ending in 2026. Similarly, Japan’s crypto investors face income tax rates up to 55% on profits, prompting the Japan Blockchain Association to survey 1,500 adults about potential reforms. The survey found 84% of current crypto holders would buy more if the government implemented a flat 20% capital gains tax, while 12% of non-holders said they would start investing under reformed tax rules. Regional Approaches Vary From Prohibition to Innovation Incentives Earlier this year, Ukraine also proposed an 18% personal income tax plus 5% military levy on virtual asset gains, with preferential rates of 5-9% for specific categories. The wartime military levy helps fund defense efforts while the country develops comprehensive crypto taxation frameworks following international examples. While countries are working towards their taxation framework, China maintains a total ban on all cryptocurrency activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, as of June 2025, extending earlier prohibitions to support the state-backed digital yuan. In fact, China goes as far as enforcing through active asset seizures and criminal penalties for violations, which remains the major country in the region with low crypto appetite. Singapore, however, offers rigorous licensing through the Monetary Authority with finalized stablecoin regulatory frameworks, attracting blockchain innovation while implementing strict compliance requirements. Similarly, Hong Kong has positioned itself as an Asian crypto center with licensing for exchanges, custody services, and comprehensive stablecoin oversight. Hong Kong SFC tightens crypto custody rules after global security incidents result in $3B losses as hackers move funds 75 times faster than exchange alerts. #HongKong #Crypto https://t.co/zffDuuT6aI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 15, 2025 Contrary to the Asian mixed stance, the European Union’s MiCA regulation has unified regulation that requires comprehensive licensing for crypto asset service providers with strict anti-money laundering and consumer protection rules. The framework harmonizes regulation across member states while maintaining innovation-focused oversight approaches. The New York proposal joins other state-level initiatives as federal crypto policy evolves under the Trump administration’s pro-innovation stance. The success of the 0.2% excise tax will likely influence other US states considering similar revenue-generating measures targeting the expanding crypto market.

50124469,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=189798,1755252610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/50124469.jpeg,USDT Minted: A Billion-Dollar Boost Ignites Crypto Market Excitement,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usdt-minted-crypto-boost/,"BitcoinWorld USDT Minted: A Billion-Dollar Boost Ignites Crypto Market Excitement A significant event recently unfolded in the cryptocurrency world, grabbing the attention of traders and investors alike. Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain transaction tracker, reported that a staggering 1,000 million (that’s 1 billion) USDT minted at the Tether Treasury. This massive USDT issuance immediately sparked discussions about its potential impact on the broader crypto market and the dynamics of the global stablecoin supply . What Does 1 Billion USDT Minted Mean for You? When we talk about USDT minted , we are referring to the creation of new Tether (USDT) tokens. USDT is a stablecoin, designed to maintain a value pegged to the US dollar. Tether, the company behind USDT, issues new tokens in response to demand from exchanges and large institutional buyers. Each newly minted USDT token is theoretically backed by an equivalent amount of reserves, such as cash or cash equivalents. The minting process usually indicates that more people or entities want to acquire USDT, often to facilitate trading in other cryptocurrencies. This particular minting occurred at the Tether Treasury , which acts as the central hub for the creation and destruction of USDT tokens. Essentially, more USDT in circulation can mean increased liquidity flowing into the digital asset space. Why Does Tether Increase Stablecoin Supply ? Tether’s primary mechanism for issuing new USDT is demand-driven. When large players like cryptocurrency exchanges or institutional investors need more USDT to facilitate trading or to onboard new capital into the crypto ecosystem, they typically send USD to Tether. In return, Tether issues new USDT tokens. Consider these key reasons for increased USDT issuance : Market Demand: A rising demand for stablecoins often signals an influx of new capital into the crypto space, as investors use USDT to enter or exit positions. Liquidity Provision: More USDT means more liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell other cryptocurrencies without significant price slippage. Arbitrage Opportunities: Traders use USDT to quickly move funds between exchanges, taking advantage of price differences for various assets. This recent 1 billion USDT minted event strongly suggests a notable increase in market demand. How Might This Affect the Crypto Market ? The minting of a significant amount of USDT can have several implications for the crypto market . Historically, large USDT issuances have often preceded or coincided with periods of increased cryptocurrency prices, particularly for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here’s how this could play out: Increased Buying Pressure: Freshly minted USDT often finds its way onto exchanges, where it can be used to purchase other cryptocurrencies, potentially driving up prices. Enhanced Liquidity: A larger stablecoin supply improves overall market liquidity, which can lead to tighter spreads and more efficient trading. Market Confidence: Some interpret large issuances as a sign of growing institutional interest or capital inflow, boosting overall market sentiment. However, it is crucial to remember that correlation does not always imply causation. Other factors always influence market movements. Understanding the Role of the Tether Treasury The Tether Treasury functions as the central vault for USDT. When new tokens are minted, they are initially held in this treasury address before being distributed to exchanges or other entities. Conversely, when USDT is redeemed for USD, the tokens are burned (destroyed) from the treasury. Transparency surrounding Tether’s reserves and the operations of its treasury has been a long-standing topic of discussion within the crypto community. Tether regularly publishes attestations regarding its reserves, aiming to provide assurance that each USDT is indeed backed. Navigating the Implications of USDT Issuance For those involved in the crypto space, monitoring significant USDT issuance events is a valuable practice. While not a direct buy signal, it provides insight into the underlying demand for stablecoins and potential capital flows. Key takeaways for readers: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on Whale Alert and similar trackers for large stablecoin movements. Assess Market Context: Evaluate USDT minting alongside other market indicators, such as trading volumes and overall sentiment. Understand Risk: While USDT aims for stability, all crypto assets carry inherent risks. The recent 1 billion USDT minted at the Tether Treasury is a notable development. It signifies strong demand for the world’s largest stablecoin, potentially injecting significant liquidity into the crypto market . As the stablecoin supply expands, market participants will be watching closely to see how this fresh capital influences asset prices and trading activity. This event underscores the dynamic and interconnected nature of the digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDT minting? USDT minting is the process by which new Tether (USDT) tokens are created and put into circulation by Tether Limited, the issuer of the stablecoin. This typically occurs in response to increased demand from large buyers or exchanges. Q2: Why did Tether mint 1 billion USDT? Tether generally mints new USDT to meet growing demand for the stablecoin. This demand often comes from individuals or institutions looking to onboard capital into the crypto market or increase liquidity for trading other digital assets. Q3: What is the Tether Treasury? The Tether Treasury is a specific blockchain address controlled by Tether Limited. It acts as the central repository where newly minted USDT tokens are initially held before being distributed, and where redeemed USDT tokens are sent to be burned. Q4: How does this USDT issuance affect the crypto market ? A large USDT issuance can inject significant liquidity into the crypto market. This can potentially lead to increased buying pressure for other cryptocurrencies, higher trading volumes, and overall enhanced market efficiency. However, market reactions are complex and influenced by many factors. Q5: Is a large USDT minted event always bullish for crypto? While large USDT mints often precede periods of upward price movement, it is not a guaranteed bullish signal. The actual impact depends on how the minted USDT is utilized in the market, as well as broader economic and sentiment factors. It primarily indicates increased demand for stablecoins.

Big investors also purchased billions of DOGE tokens, while analysts believe the meme coin has yet to stun the community with an impressive price increase. BNB surged to a new ATH, whereas its market cap surpassed that of Nike. Accumulating XRP en Masse Large Ripple investors have been very active lately, increasing their exposure to XRP. Yesterday (August 14), the X user Ali Martinez revealed they have purchased 320 million tokens in the span of 72 hours. Prior to that, they scooped up 900 million XRP in just two days. The USD equivalent of the combined accumulated stash stands at over $3.8 billion (calculated at current rates) and could be interpreted as a bullish signal. After all, purchases of that type reduce the amount of XRP tokens on the open market, which, paired with non-declining demand, should push the price up. The buys also play a psychological role by encouraging smaller players to hop on the bandwagon , too . Meanwhile, XRP has experienced significant turbulence over the past week. Its price was gradually heading north, reaching a peak of almost $3.35 on August 14, but crashed to nearly $3 several hours ago amid an overall correction of the crypto market. The bulls managed to recover some lost ground, and currently, Ripple’s cross-border token trades at around $3.12 (per CoinGecko’s data). DOGE Whales on the Move, too Whales spent a little less than $500 million to amass two billion DOGE last week. Thus, they increased their total possessions to 27.6 billion coins, or roughly 18.3% of the meme coin’s circulating supply. The effort caught the attention of the crypto community, with some speculating that the whales might have inside information about a significant upcoming event. “2B DOGE in 7 days? Either they know something we don’t … or we’re about to find out the hard way,” one X user said. Similar to XRP, the largest meme coin experienced substantial volatility in the last seven days but remains in green territory within that timeframe. Its current valuation is around $0.23, with many analysts envisioning further gains in the short term. KALEO is among the biggest optimists, predicting a price explosion to the unprecedented (and somewhat ridiculous) level of almost $7. BNB Made History The native cryptocurrency of Binance hit a new all-time high price of $866 on August 14. Its market capitalization briefly surged past $120 billion, making the asset bigger than Nike, Nintendo, and other well-known brands. Binance Coin (BNB) slightly retraced in the following hours and currently trades at around $850, but it remains the subject of bullish forecasts. X user Crypto Raven expects the price to soar beyond $1,000 in Q4 this year. Ali Martinez also outlined an optimistic view, saying: I’m bullish on $BNB . Public companies, a sovereign fund, and even treasury arms are holding it, some positions worth hundreds of millions. It’s also one of the top-performing altcoins this year, now in price discovery after breaking new all-time highs.

Binance has officially announced the upcoming listing of the USELESS/USDT perpetual contract on its platform. This highly anticipated addition is set to go live on August 15, 2024, at 12:15 UTC, offering traders an impressive maximum leverage of 50x. This move underscores Binance’s continuous effort to expand its trading offerings and provide more diverse opportunities for its global user base. What Exactly is a Binance Perpetual Contract? Many traders wonder about the specifics of these advanced trading instruments. A perpetual contract is a type of futures contract without an expiry date. Unlike traditional futures, you can hold a perpetual contract indefinitely, as long as you maintain sufficient margin. This flexibility makes them incredibly popular in the fast-paced crypto market. The core appeal of a Binance perpetual contract lies in its ability to allow traders to speculate on the future price movements of an asset without actually owning it. Furthermore, the inclusion of leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. For the USELESS/USDT pair, traders can access up to 50x leverage, meaning a small initial capital can control a much larger position. Unlocking Opportunities with Crypto Leverage Trading The listing of USELESS/USDT with 50x leverage opens new avenues for seasoned traders. Crypto leverage trading allows you to amplify your exposure to market movements. For instance, with 50x leverage, a 1% price increase in USELESS could theoretically result in a 50% profit on your initial capital. However, it is crucial to remember that leverage also magnifies losses to the same degree. Binance’s decision to offer such high leverage for a new pair like USELESS/USDT indicates confidence in its risk management systems and a catering to demand from aggressive traders. It provides a potent tool for those looking to capitalize on even minor price fluctuations, but it requires a disciplined approach and a thorough understanding of market dynamics. Why the USELESS/USDT Listing Matters to Traders Every new crypto listing on a major exchange like Binance generates significant interest, and the USELESS/USDT pair is no exception. New listings often come with increased volatility and trading volume in their initial phases, creating exciting opportunities for short-term traders. For long-term strategists, it introduces another asset to monitor for potential future growth or hedging strategies. This particular listing adds a unique asset to Binance’s extensive derivatives portfolio. Traders looking to diversify their perpetual contract exposure beyond mainstream cryptocurrencies might find the USELESS/USDT pair an interesting option. Its availability on Binance’s robust platform ensures liquidity and a secure trading environment. Navigating Binance Futures: What You Need to Know Engaging with the Binance futures platform, especially with a new and potentially volatile asset like USELESS/USDT, demands careful consideration. Here are some actionable insights: Understand the Asset: Before trading, research what USELESS is, its project, and its market capitalization. Knowledge is power. Risk Management is Key: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, especially with high leverage. Start Small: Begin with a smaller position size to get a feel for the market dynamics of the new pair. Monitor Funding Rates: Perpetual contracts have funding rates that can impact your profitability, especially during periods of high open interest. Binance provides various tools and resources to help traders manage their positions effectively. Utilize these features to protect your capital. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Binance Traders The upcoming Binance perpetual contract listing of USELESS/USDT on August 15 marks another exciting development for the crypto trading community. It expands the range of available assets for high-leverage trading, offering both immense potential for profit and significant risks. As always, traders should approach these opportunities with a well-defined strategy, robust risk management, and a commitment to continuous learning. Binance continues to solidify its position as a leader in the derivatives market, providing cutting-edge tools for its users. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a perpetual contract?

AI Models Predict 2025 Peak Price,https://cryptopotato.com/has-xrps-bull-run-just-begun-or-is-the-top-already-in-ai-models-predict-2025-peak-price/,"TL;DR Ripple’s cross-border token is among the cryptocurrencies that managed to break their previous all-time highs this year and chart a fresh peak. However, it has lost steam in the following month, unlike many of its competitors, and the question now arises whether the 2025 top has already been reached or does XRP have the legs for one more run. Bull Vs. Bear Cases In terms of methodology, the AI solution said it prompted four large language models with identical inputs to reach its conclusion. It reviewed the most recent price actions, historical cycle behavior, common technical markets, such as the Fibonacci extensions, as well as support and resistance lines, and potential catalysts ( ETF applications , legal clarity , payments adoption, and overall global situation). Admitting that making bold predictions is highly speculative, especially in the cryptocurrency industry, ChatGPT outlined two main scenarios – bullish and bearish. Should the first materialize, XRP’s price would break out of its current sideways structure between $3.00 and $3.50 and head toward a new peak of up to $7 by the end of the year. In case more catalysts cluster, ChatGPT noted that the third-largest cryptocurrency can rocket to lower double-digit territory as well. Some of those potential propellers include: Catalyst Fatigue : If ETF momentum stalls or legal headlines disappoint, enthusiasm can unwind quickly. Macro Shock : A risk-off turn—driven by rates, liquidity, or geopolitics—would hit high-beta assets hardest. Although there was a bearish scenario as well, it still sounds quite promising for XRP bulls. ChatGPT said there is a possibility that the July 2025 all-time high of $3.65 could be as high as Ripple’s token can go this year. Failed Reclaim : Multiple failed attempts to clear the $3.4–$3.6 band, especially on declining volume, strengthen the case for a deeper retrace into the mid-$2s or lower. Still, it noted that this is the least likely scenario to transpire as long as the overall market conditions remain similar or even more favorable. AI Conclusion OpenAI’s solution, which recently revealed its fifth version, noted that models do not promise a moonshot, but they also don’t believe the top is in for 2025. After mentioning the necessary disclaimer that this conclusion is not direct financial advice, ChatGPT said: “The consensus says XRP’s 2025 peak most likely lands in the $5–$7 band if price reclaims and holds above prior highs on rising volume and at least one major catalyst materializes. Without that, the market may have already printed its local top. Bottom line: watch the $3.4–$3.6 corridor, volume expansion, and headline catalysts—because the next decisive move will likely be fast.” The post Has XRP’s Bull Run Just Begun or Is the Top Already In?

The announcement follows the sanctioning of one of the founders of the coin trading platform, allegedly used by Russian actors to move money, bypass sanctions and commit crime. Washington targets Russian crypto exchange Garantex The United States is increasing pressure on the people who launched and ran Russian digital asset exchange Garantex, shut down in a U.S.-led law enforcement effort earlier this year. The Departments of State and the Treasury have now put bounties on the exchange’s executives, according to an announcement issued on Thursday, after the U.S. placed its co-founder, Sergey Mendeleev, under sanctions. The State Department’s Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program (TOCRP), which backs efforts to disrupt global crime, is now offering $6 million for information leading to the arrests and convictions of Garantex leaders. The total includes up to $5 million for the capture of its sales manager, Aleksandr Mira Serda, a Russian national also known as “Aleksandr Ntifo-Siaw,” and up to $1 million for other key leaders of the exchange, the government institutions detailed, stating: “Today, the Departments of State and the Treasury are targeting Garantex, a Russian-operated cryptocurrency exchange allegedly used by a wide variety of cybercriminals and cybercrime organizations for money laundering, and its network.” The authorities reminded that, according to the U.S. Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Garantex received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds. The money was used to facilitate various crimes, including hacking, ransomware, terrorism, and drug trafficking, often resulting in “substantial harm for U.S. victims.” The press release highlighted: “Between April 2019 and March 2025, Garantex processed at least $96 billion in cryptocurrency transactions.” U.S. tightens noose on operators of Russian crypto exchange Garantex was co-founded by Aleksandr Mira Serda, Sergey Mendeleev, and Stanislav Drugalev in 2019 and was active until the Secret Service and the FBI, together with Europol, seized its website in March 2025, froze $26 million worth of Tether (USDT) in wallets linked to the platform and charged its administrators with money laundering. The bounties were announced after the Treasury Department’s U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added Mendeleev to its sanctions list. The Russian entrepreneur described his sanctioning as “absolutely logical” from the point of view of “Americans who, of course, don’t understand the realities of our crypto market.” Speaking to leading Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media, Mendeleev insisted he hasn’t had anything to do with Garantex for the past five years, calling it “no more than a line in my biography.” He was also quoted as stating: “I understand when the Wall Street Journal prints some fiction about my participation in financing Hamas, whom I call terrorists in every interview, or talks about how I help bomb Ukraine, which is especially amusing for those who know me. But OFAC seems to be a serious organization, it’s the Trump administration.” OFAC targeted a number of Russian entities and other individuals accused of helping with sanctions evasion. Among them are A7, the company that launched the Ruble-pegged stablecoin A7A5 , Exved, a cross-border payment service, and Indefi Smartbank, which provided technical support to Exved. Grinex, which is believed to have succeeded the now-defunct Garantex, was also sanctioned, as well as Old Vector, the firm that issues A7A5. Both are registered in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan . Mendeleev made it clear he is not managing Grinex and said he heard some of the other names for the first time, adding that Indefi and Exved “have nothing but websites.” He also remarked he had prepared for all this in advance, claiming the sanctions would have no effect on his activities.

While older and more conventional names like Ethereum (ETH) are set to move in accordance with general market sentiment, newer DeFi player Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting disproportionate attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently trading at $0.035 in presale phase 6. The early investors in the project will have at least 400% profit when MUTM can be bought and sold in the open market. Mutuum Finance has already amassed over $14.4 million in sales and has over 15220 token buyers. With volatility set to explode ahead of the Fed call, both established and newer blockchain projects can expect to see dramatic flips in investor interest. Ethereum Rallies Toward $5,000 as Fed Rate Cut Hopes Rise Ethereum (ETH) is hovering near $4,620, underpinned by strong institutional demand, ETF inflows, and renewed optimism following U.S. inflation data that bolsters expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. Improved CPI figures and rising chances of monetary easing have triggered bullish momentum across crypto markets, with Ethereum inching towards its all-time high. The $4,800-$5,000 area is now being tracked by analysts as the next key resistance for ETH. New protocols such as Mutuum Finance are also rising to prominence among investors in this macro-driven market. Mutuum Finance Enters Presale Stage 6 Mutuum Finance is performing amazingly in presale. The project is currently at $0.035 as stage 6 gains traction. Mutuum Finance is changing the game in the way DeFi operates by building a system with real-world real-use cases. The presale has garnered more than 15220 token holders with more than $14.4 million worth of funds already invested. $100K Value of Tokens to Be Won Mutuum Finance also launched a giveaway of $100,000. There will be 10 winners who will receive a reward of $10,000 in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is one of the evidences of how hard the project works to have a long-term and a loyal fanbase. Another move towards transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has initiated an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project team will be rewarding the participants with up to $50,000 USDT for finding bugs in the project. The aim of the bounty program is to get a good coverage of all vulnerability classes. The program is split into the four vulnerability classes according to their severity, i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance is a P2P and P2C lending protocol. It is a DeFi experience end-to-end to exactly meet the need of the consumers and comparatively safer, transparent, and diversified compared to conventional centralized finance products. High-Performance Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance is among the top-rated DeFi protocols in which assets are in total control of the users. It is a two-model lending protocol that is making lending and borrowing highly flexible and efficient such as Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract is a smart automatic contract where there is no human involvement at any stage. Peer-to-Peer model lacks an intermediary and hence lenders are directly linked to borrowers. Ethereum can reach new heights if the Fed proceeds with Sept rate cuts, but Mutuum Finance is providing investors with an uncommon chance at merely $0.035 in front of its Stage 7 jump to $0.04. With $14.4M raised as of now, 15,220+ holders, and 95.0 CertiK trust score, force is building rapidly. Be a part of it now before price rises and the market rushes in.

Recent reports have shed light on a truly unsettling trend: an ETH price surge has inadvertently added a staggering $83 million to the illicit coffers of various hackers. This isn’t just about initial thefts; it’s about criminals leveraging market dynamics to amplify their ill-gotten wealth, transforming their stolen assets into even greater fortunes. This alarming development was brought to light by detailed on-chain analysis . How Did Ethereum Hackers Boost Their Profits? On-chain analyst EmberCN recently shared critical insights on X, revealing how three distinct Ethereum hackers managed to accumulate significant additional profits. These weren’t mere passive gains; they stemmed from strategic maneuvers after their initial cybercrimes. The attackers held onto their stolen Ethereum, then capitalized on the rising market value, effectively turning their thefts into a highly profitable investment. Radiant Capital Hacker: This individual saw their illicit holdings swell by an astonishing $48.3 million. Their ability to hold and trade ETH at opportune moments demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of market timing. Infini Hacker: Another perpetrator, responsible for the Infini breach, added $25.15 million to their loot. This substantial sum highlights the ongoing vulnerability within the DeFi space. Unidentified Hacker: An unknown attacker also managed to secure an additional $9.76 million. The fact that an unidentified entity can still profit underlines the challenges in tracking and recovering stolen digital assets. EmberCN aptly described this phenomenon as a “hacker’s bull market,” where attackers profit not just from the initial theft but also from the subsequent rally in asset prices. This situation presents a dual challenge for the crypto community, as it makes recovering funds even more difficult and incentivizes further malicious activity from these Ethereum hackers . Understanding the Crucial Role of On-Chain Analysis in Tracking Hacker Gains The discovery of these amplified hacker gains wouldn’t be possible without the diligent work of on-chain analysts like EmberCN. On-chain analysis involves scrutinizing public blockchain data to identify patterns, track transactions, and uncover illicit activities. This transparency, inherent to blockchain technology, is a double-edged sword. While it allows for the tracking of funds, it also means that the movement and accumulation of stolen assets are visible for all to see. Such analysis is vital for: Tracing Stolen Funds: Helping law enforcement and security firms follow the money trail. Identifying Vulnerabilities: Pinpointing weaknesses in protocols that hackers exploit. Informing the Community: Alerting users to potential risks and the tactics employed by malicious actors. These insights are crucial steps towards enhancing overall crypto security . Without them, the true extent of these financial exploits might remain hidden, making it harder to develop robust defenses against Ethereum hackers . What Are the Broader Implications of These Hacker Gains? The fact that an ETH price surge can significantly increase hacker gains raises serious questions about the resilience and security of the broader crypto ecosystem. When criminals not only steal but also profit from market movements, it can erode trust among legitimate investors and users. It paints a picture where illicit activities are rewarded, which is detrimental to the long-term health and adoption of decentralized finance. The challenges presented by these sophisticated attacks are multifaceted: Investor Confidence: Repeated incidents of large-scale thefts and subsequent profit amplification can deter new investors and make existing ones wary. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments and regulators may push for stricter oversight if they perceive the crypto space as a haven for criminal activity. Security Imperatives: Projects must redouble their efforts in auditing, bug bounties, and implementing multi-layered security protocols to prevent such incidents. It’s clear that while the market rallies bring excitement for investors, they also present opportunities for those with ill intent. The ongoing cat-and-mouse game between Ethereum hackers and security professionals is more intense than ever. Protecting Your Assets in a Volatile Market In light of these developments, what can you do to protect your digital assets? Vigilance and proactive measures are key. Always prioritize the security of your funds, especially when market conditions are volatile. Use Reputable Platforms: Stick to well-audited and established exchanges and DeFi protocols. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts. Be Wary of Phishing: Always double-check URLs and email senders before clicking links or providing information. Cold Storage for Large Holdings: For significant amounts of crypto, consider hardware wallets or other offline storage solutions. Stay Informed: Follow reputable on-chain analysis experts and security researchers to understand emerging threats and best practices in crypto security . The crypto market’s dynamic nature means both opportunities and risks. Understanding how incidents like the recent ETH price surge impacting hacker gains occur is the first step towards building a safer ecosystem for everyone. In conclusion, the revelation that an ETH price surge has swelled hacker gains by over $83 million serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset space. While the market celebrates new highs, the vigilance of on-chain analysis is crucial in exposing the darker side of crypto profitability. It underscores the urgent need for enhanced crypto security measures and continued community awareness to combat the sophisticated tactics of Ethereum hackers . Staying informed and prioritizing security are paramount for navigating this evolving landscape safely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How did hackers gain additional profits from the ETH price surge? Hackers amplified their initial illicit gains by holding onto the stolen Ethereum (ETH) and then strategically trading it as the ETH price surged. This allowed them to profit from both the initial theft and the subsequent market rally. Q2: Who are the specific hackers mentioned in the report by EmberCN? On-chain analyst EmberCN identified three groups of hackers: the Radiant Capital hacker, the Infini hacker, and an additional unidentified hacker. Each of these entities saw significant boosts to their stolen funds due to the ETH price surge. Q3: What is on-chain analysis and why is it important in tracking hacker activities? On-chain analysis is the process of examining public blockchain data to trace transactions, identify patterns, and uncover illicit activities. It is crucial for tracking hacker activities because it provides transparency, helping security experts and law enforcement follow the flow of stolen funds and understand attacker tactics. Q4: How can individuals protect their crypto assets from similar threats? Individuals can enhance their crypto security by using reputable platforms, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), being vigilant against phishing attempts, considering cold storage for large holdings, and staying informed about the latest security practices and threats through reliable sources. Q5: What are the broader implications of hackers profiting from market rallies? When hackers profit from market rallies, it can erode investor confidence, increase regulatory scrutiny on the crypto space, and highlight the urgent need for projects to implement more robust security protocols. It underscores the ongoing challenge of combating sophisticated cybercrime in the digital asset ecosystem.

However, beneath the bullish momentum, several on-chain signals are raising concerns about the sustainability of the rally. SKALE’s partnership with ‘It Remains’ SKALE’s rally began to accelerate after the integration with “It Remains,” a dystopian transmedia franchise, into the SKALE Network. The integration promises to merge immersive storytelling with blockchain features such as gas-free transactions, interactive AR/VR experiences, and NFT-powered governance. SKALE’s gasless, Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chains are being positioned as the backbone for the project, offering fast, cost-free interactions that aim to drive mass adoption. Following the announcement, SKALE’s daily trading volume spiked nearly 2,700% to $279 million before surging again to $905 million on major exchanges like Binance and Bithumb. The price jumped as high as $0.054 during the month, a dramatic recovery from June’s all-time low of $0.01596. The network has also reported over 3 million unique active wallets and more than 681 million transactions to date. Massive trading volumes stir questions While heavy trading activity often reflects strong demand, SKALE’s Chief Technology Officer, Stan Kladko, has cautioned that some of the surge may be driven by automated trading bots. If true, this could mean that parts of the rally are artificially inflated, increasing the risk of volatility if bot activity declines. Stan Kladko 🇺🇦 🇺🇸 🇵🇹 ☮️ @Stan_Kladko · Follow Lots of people today bought SKL to immediately sell it to other people These other people bought it to sell to yet other people.Or bots I hope people and bots had fun in the process :)) #crypto #ethereum @FAIR_Blockchain #skale 2:49 AM · Aug 14, 2025 21 Reply Copy link Read 8 replies High volume spikes without a proportional increase in organic demand can create unstable market conditions. In such cases, prices may retreat quickly once speculative interest fades. This concern comes as the broader crypto market remains sensitive to shifts in sentiment, particularly among altcoins. On-chain signals hint at profit-taking Alongside the surge in volume, on-chain data shows a sharp increase in dormant coin activity. The number of long-idle SKL tokens suddenly moving rose by 420% in just one session, from 33.36 million to 173.62 million SKL. Historically, such spikes have preceded price pullbacks as early holders move to secure profits. At the same time, whales have reduced their holdings by roughly 130 million SKL, while exchange reserves have climbed by 2.44% in 24 hours. An increase in coins held on exchanges often signals that holders are preparing to sell, which can add selling pressure to the market. Price momentum faces its biggest test Despite its impressive performance, SKALE’s rally is now encountering resistance. The token has pulled back from recent highs and is trading near $0.044, with a market cap of $256 million. While it remains up over 127% in the past two weeks, the mix of high bot-driven trading, rising exchange balances, and whale sell-offs could cap further upside in the short term. For now, the SKALE story is one of both opportunity and caution. While its integration with It Remains has spotlighted its capabilities and attracted fresh attention, the underlying trading patterns suggest that without sustained organic demand, the rally could struggle to maintain its current pace. Traders should watch closely to see whether SKALE can turn short-term hype into lasting growth or whether the recent surge will fade as quickly as it began.

This remarkable influx of digital assets highlights a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape. This massive expansion is primarily driven by the leading players, Tether and Circle, showcasing robust Tether USDT growth and substantial Circle USDC minting . What’s Behind This Explosive Stablecoin Issuance? Recent data from Lookonchain on X reveals that Tether alone minted another 1 billion USDT, contributing significantly to this monumental figure. When combined with Circle’s activities, the total stablecoin issuance over the past month truly stands out. Increased Demand: A primary driver for this surge is the escalating demand for stablecoins within the crypto ecosystem. Traders and investors use stablecoins like USDT and USDC to navigate volatile markets, offering a safe haven during price fluctuations. Market Liquidity: Higher stablecoin volumes typically indicate increased liquidity in the broader cryptocurrency market. This makes it easier for participants to enter and exit positions, facilitating smoother trading. Gateway to DeFi: Stablecoins serve as crucial on-ramps and off-ramps for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. As DeFi adoption grows, so does the need for these stable digital assets. Understanding Tether USDT Growth and Circle USDC Minting Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are the two largest crypto stablecoins by market capitalization. They maintain a peg to the US dollar, meaning one unit of USDT or USDC is intended to always be worth one US dollar. This stability makes them indispensable tools in the fast-paced crypto world. The consistent Tether USDT growth signifies its continued dominance as the most widely used stablecoin for trading pairs across various exchanges. Similarly, the significant Circle USDC minting demonstrates its increasing adoption, particularly within institutional circles and regulated environments. Are Crypto Stablecoins Fueling Digital Dollar Expansion? Absolutely. The massive increase in stablecoin issuance directly contributes to the broader trend of digital dollar expansion . These tokens function as digital representations of fiat currency, enabling fast, borderless, and low-cost transactions on blockchain networks. This growth indicates a strong market appetite for digital assets that combine the benefits of blockchain technology with the stability of traditional currencies. It’s a clear signal that the digital economy is maturing, with stablecoins playing a pivotal role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto space. Navigating the Future of Stablecoins: Challenges and Opportunities While the recent surge in stablecoin issuance is a positive indicator of market health and utility, it also brings attention to important considerations. Regulators worldwide are closely examining stablecoins, focusing on aspects like reserves, transparency, and consumer protection. Regulatory Scrutiny: Enhanced regulatory frameworks are emerging to govern stablecoins, aiming to ensure their stability and prevent systemic risks. Transparency: Leading issuers are under increasing pressure to provide clear, verifiable audits of their reserves, building greater trust among users. Innovation: Despite challenges, the demand for efficient digital payment rails continues to drive innovation in the stablecoin sector, exploring new use cases beyond just trading. The ongoing growth in crypto stablecoins underscores their foundational importance to the digital asset ecosystem. They provide the stability and liquidity necessary for complex financial operations on the blockchain, paving the way for further mainstream adoption of digital currencies. The recent $9.5 billion surge in stablecoin issuance, led by robust Tether USDT growth and substantial Circle USDC minting , is more than just a number; it’s a testament to the increasing utility and integration of digital assets into the global financial landscape. This remarkable expansion of digital dollar expansion signifies a maturing market and highlights the crucial role stablecoins play in facilitating seamless transactions and fostering liquidity within the crypto economy. As these digital currencies continue to evolve, they will undoubtedly remain a cornerstone of future financial innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is stablecoin issuance?

BPI India outlines policy and corporate integration plans BPI India stated in a tweet that now is the time for “financial freedom,” highlighting the importance of controlling the country’s economic future without overreliance on foreign systems. Its founding team has prepared a roadmap that ties Bitcoin adoption to five core priorities: expanding renewable energy use in mining, providing governments with clear data for policy design, promoting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset for corporations, improving financial literacy, and enabling faster, cheaper transactions for businesses and individuals. The organisation has released its first white paper, focusing on state-level opportunities for Bitcoin mining in India. It is also preparing a “CFO Playbook” to guide companies on integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries.

The idea is to convert unused solar, wind, and hydroelectric capacity into digital assets, turning excess generation into a source of economic value. This approach, already being tested in several developing economies, could help India monetise its renewable infrastructure and attract foreign investment in green energy projects. Mithilesh Kumar Jha, one of the founders, has said that integrating Bitcoin into India’s financial and energy systems could help shield the country from global political volatility while lowering payment costs. By aligning energy strategy with digital asset infrastructure, India could build resilience into its economic framework. Bitcoin market conditions align with launch timing The timing of BPI India’s launch comes as global cryptocurrency adoption is accelerating. Bitcoin’s price has been buoyed in recent weeks by growing liquidity in the market, with expectations of US interest rate cuts in September and October boosting demand for risk-based assets such as cryptocurrencies. For Indian investors, this momentum coincides with an environment that is becoming increasingly receptive to digital assets. Despite the short-term dip, the broader market environment has created favourable conditions for the institute’s push to position India as a leader in the global Bitcoin economy.

Coinbase Answers, Reveals Date Prediction!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-altcoin-season-coming-coinbase-answers-reveals-date-prediction/,"The altcoin season, which never seemed to arrive, has become a never-ending story. While there's no consensus on the altcoin season in the market, some analysts argue that it's already begun, while others argue that it hasn't even begun yet. At this point, the latest updated analysis came from Coinbase, the largest exchange in the United States. Altcoin Season is in September! Accordingly, Coinbase stated that it expects a full-blown altcoin season starting in September. Coinbase has published a report titled “Monthly Outlook: Altcoin Season is Coming” on its official website and outlined its expectations for the altcoin season. According to this report, Coinbase analysts led by Coinbase Institutional global research head David Duong offered a positive outlook for Q3 2025, stating that a full-blown altcoin season is expected starting in September. Analysts also said that a full altcoin season is approaching as institutional investors' interest in Ethereum grows. Coinbase stated that it defines an altcoin season as a period in which at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins by market capitalization have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. At this point, analysts stated that Bitcoin dominance, which is seen as the biggest harbinger of the arrival of the altcoin season, has decreased from 65% in May to 59% currently, which is an early sign that capital is turning to altcoins. According to CoinMarketCap data, the altcoin market capitalization has increased by over 50% since the beginning of July. Despite this increase, the Altcoin Season Index currently stands at 40 points, well below the historical threshold of 75 points for an altcoin season. “With altcoin market capitalization rising and the Altcoin Season Index showing early positive signals, we believe conditions are in place for a potential rotation into a more mature altcoin season as we enter September,” the exchange said, citing the data. Duong also stated that the Fed's easing is also positive for altcoins. He noted that there is a significant amount of retail capital sitting on the sidelines, adding that a Fed rate cut in September could bring more retail investors into the market. *This is not investment advice.

In an X post on Thursday, Bessent stressed the Treasury’s commitment to the President’s vision of making the United States the “Bitcoin superpower of the world,” adding that forfeited Bitcoin from government criminal cases would form the reserve’s foundation. His statement sought to calm market jitters after a televised interview appeared to signal a halt to Bitcoin purchases. Earlier that day, Bessent had told FOX Business, “We’re not going to be buying that,” when discussing the reserve, a comment that sent Bitcoin tumbling from $121,073 to $118,886 within 40 minutes—wiping nearly $55 billion from its market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. By the time of his clarification, Bitcoin had steadied near $118,500. Concerns Over Slow Implementation Despite Bessent’s reassurance, some industry voices remain skeptical. Critics point to the Treasury’s slow pace in executing the reserve strategy, warning that other nations could accumulate significant holdings first. Eli Nagar, CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Braiins, remarked on X, “At some point, exploration without execution starts to look like avoidance.” The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile were both created through a March 6 executive order by President Donald Trump. The initiative permits Bitcoin purchases using “budget-neutral” methods—strategies that do not place additional costs on US taxpayers. Ideas floated include reevaluating gold certificates and using tariff revenues. However, congressional approval is required for such acquisitions, a hurdle that may be slowing progress. Senator Cynthia Lummis has urged lawmakers to revisit the BITCOIN Act she introduced earlier this year to address the issue . No Plans to Sell Existing Holdings: Bessent While the Treasury’s buying plans remain under review, Bessent confirmed there will be no sales of the government’s current Bitcoin stash. “We’re going to stop selling,” he told FOX Business, estimating the reserve’s value at between $15 billion and $20 billion. Data from BitBo’s Bitcoin Treasuries dashboard shows the US holds approximately 198,012 BTC, worth about $23.5 billion. Supporters of the reserve believe that holding and gradually increasing these assets could strengthen America’s position in the global digital economy—provided the Treasury can move from planning to action.

Recently, a significant shift in Binance BTC inflows has caught the attention of analysts, potentially signaling upcoming changes in market dynamics. Let’s delve into what this means for investors and traders, leveraging recent on-chain data analysis . What Do Surging Binance BTC Inflows Indicate? On-chain data recently highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain reveals a sharp increase in Binance Exchange’s seven-day average Bitcoin (BTC) inflows. This means more Bitcoin is actively moving onto the platform. Such movements are crucial for market observers to track. Historically, surges in exchange inflows have often been associated with several potential activities: Selling Preparation: Traders move BTC to exchanges to liquidate their holdings. Margin Collateralization: Funds are deposited to be used as collateral for leveraged trading positions. Institutional Portfolio Rebalancing: Large entities adjust their holdings, which can involve moving assets onto exchanges. These actions can collectively contribute to an increase in the available supply of Bitcoin on the exchange, potentially impacting its price. Decoding the Bitcoin Selling Pressure Signal When Bitcoin flows onto exchanges, it increases the immediate supply. If buying demand does not match this increased supply, it typically leads to Bitcoin selling pressure in the short term. This imbalance can cause prices to decline. The situation is further confirmed by a simultaneous rise in ‘positive netflow’ on Binance. Positive netflow signifies that the total BTC exchange balance on Binance is climbing. This growing liquidity on the exchange suggests a greater potential for assets to be sold, contributing to short-term crypto market volatility and possible downside. Understanding this dynamic is vital for anticipating market movements. While inflows don’t guarantee a price drop, they certainly increase the likelihood if demand isn’t strong enough to absorb the incoming supply. Navigating Potential Market Downside: Your Action Plan Given the recent surge in Binance BTC inflows , what steps can market participants consider? It is always wise to approach such signals with a strategic mindset. Here are a few considerations: Monitor Demand: Keep a close eye on buying volume and order book depth. Strong buying demand can absorb increased supply. Risk Management: For traders, this might be a time to review stop-loss orders or consider reducing exposure if the market shows signs of weakness. Long-Term Perspective: For long-term investors, short-term fluctuations driven by inflows might present opportunities for accumulation if prices dip. Remember, on-chain data provides insights, but it is just one piece of the puzzle. Combining it with other technical and fundamental analysis is key to making informed decisions in the volatile crypto space. Summary: Stay Vigilant with On-Chain Data The recent surge in Binance BTC inflows , coupled with positive netflow, is a notable development in the Bitcoin market. This on-chain data analysis from CryptoQuant indicates an increase in Bitcoin liquidity on the exchange, raising the potential for short-term Bitcoin selling pressure and increased crypto market volatility . While not a definitive forecast, it serves as an important signal for market participants to exercise caution and adjust their strategies accordingly. Staying informed about these underlying flows can empower you to navigate the market more effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are Binance BTC inflows? A1: Binance BTC inflows refer to the amount of Bitcoin (BTC) that is transferred from external wallets or other exchanges into the Binance exchange’s wallets. An increase indicates more BTC is being made available on the platform. Q2: Why do increased inflows often suggest selling pressure? A2: When more Bitcoin moves onto an exchange, it typically means holders are preparing to sell, use it as collateral for trades, or rebalance portfolios. If buying demand doesn’t keep up with this increased supply, it can lead to downward price pressure. Q3: What is ‘positive netflow’ and how does it relate? A3: Positive netflow means that the total amount of a cryptocurrency on an exchange is increasing (inflows exceed outflows). In this context, it confirms that Binance’s overall BTC balance is growing, adding to the potential for sales. Q4: How reliable is on-chain data analysis for predicting market movements? A4: On-chain data provides valuable transparency into network activity and can offer strong insights into potential market trends. However, it’s not a sole predictor; it should be combined with other forms of analysis (technical, fundamental) for a comprehensive view. Q5: Does this mean a guaranteed market crash for Bitcoin? A5: No, increased inflows signal potential selling pressure, not a guaranteed crash. The actual market impact depends on various factors, including overall market sentiment, news events, and whether buying demand steps in to absorb the supply. Q6: Where can I find more insights like this? A6: Platforms like CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and other reputable on-chain analytics providers offer detailed data and analysis for market participants.

50128395,557434,1755259229,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50128395.jpeg,U-Turn In Cardano Governance: Foundation Backs Crucial Funding,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-governance-foundation-crucial-funding/,"The Cardano Foundation has reversed its position on a contentious treasury withdrawal, switching its DRep vote to “YES” for funding a free Native Asset Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Cardano developers. In a post on X on August 15, the Foundation wrote: “After careful consideration, the Cardano Foundation DRep has changed its vote to YES on the Treasury Withdrawal to fund a free Native Asset Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Cardano developers,” adding that its initial “No” had been rooted in “financial and funding concerns,” which were addressed by new information from the applicant team.” Cardano Foundation Gives Green Light To Key Funding The full rationale, posted to IPFS, makes the pivot explicit and anchors it in concrete numbers and implementation detail. The governance action—“Withdraw ₳605,000 for A free Native Asset CDN for Cardano Developers”—would underwrite 18 months of no-cost access to NFTCDN’s infrastructure for every Cardano builder. According to the Foundation’s document , the service “solves a complex and expensive problem for builders” and is already used by projects including the Eternl and Vespr wallets. The rationale says the team supplied a clarified budget “for salaries and infrastructure costs based on current usage patterns,” which directly addressed the Foundation’s earlier reservations. Crucially, the Foundation frames the 18-month subsidy as a data-gathering runway to decide among three long-term paths once usage and cost curves are known: open-sourcing the stack, decentralizing the service, or transferring ownership to a non-profit. It also notes that while it initially viewed Project Catalyst as a more appropriate venue, the applicant demonstrated “no appropriate funding category exists in Catalyst for this type of infrastructure,” warranting a Treasury Withdrawal instead. “We now consider this proposal to be a suitably justified, strategic investment in public infrastructure,” the document concludes. The vote change lands within Cardano’s broader 2025 governance cycle, which includes a suite of 39 Treasury Withdrawal proposals derived from the Intersect-administered ecosystem budget process (approximately ₳275 million). The Foundation has emphasized transparent DRep decision-making and published running summaries of its votes and governance workstreams. For developers and integrators, the immediate headline is operational rather than political: if enacted, the measure would eliminate near-term CDN costs for native asset rendering and metadata delivery across wallets, explorers, and dApps—costs that smaller or non-profit teams have struggled to absorb. The applicant’s public forum posts describe the service as an infrastructure-as-a-service layer that has already handled hundreds of millions of API calls, and outline the intent to use the funded window to quantify demand and right-size infrastructure for the long-term model the community ultimately prefers. Governance traceability is straightforward. The Foundation’s DRep identifier can be checked on public explorers for a record of the vote and attached metadata; the governance action itself is listed among current Treasury Withdrawal items on explorer dashboards. The Foundation also maintains a governance portal that consolidates its voting approach, meeting notes, and identifiers for both its DRep and Constitutional Committee roles.

The 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle Is Dead In his Update #66 newsletter published on August 15, 2025, Edwards writes that since the April 2024 halving, Bitcoin’s annual supply growth has fallen to roughly 0.8%, “less than half of Gold’s 1.5–3%,” adding that this shift “made Bitcoin the hardest asset known to man, with look-ahead certainty.” With miners’ new-issuance supply now a rounding error compared with aggregate demand, the dramatic, miner-driven busts of prior cycles look increasingly like artifacts of an earlier era. “In short – the primary driving force behind Bitcoin cycle 80-90% drawdowns historically is dead.” Edwards does not deny that cycles exist. He reframes their causes. Reflexive investor behavior, macro liquidity, on-chain valuation extremes, and derivatives-market “euphoria” can still combine to produce sizable drawdowns. But if the halving calendar no longer dictates those inflection points, investors must recalibrate the signals they monitor and the timelines on which they expect risk to crystalize. Related Reading: Q4 Will Decide If The 4-Year Bitcoin Cycle Is Dead: Analyst On reflexivity, he cautions that belief in the four-year script can itself become a price driver. If “enough Bitcoiners believe in the 4 year cycle… they will structure their investing activities around it,” he notes, invoking George Soros’s notion that market narratives feed back into fundamentals. That self-fulfilling element can still trigger “sizeable drawdowns,” even if miners are no longer the marginal price-setters. Macro liquidity, in Edwards’s framework, remains decisive. He tracks a “Net Liquidity” gauge—the year-over-year growth in global broad money minus the cost of debt (proxied by US 10-year Treasury yields)—to distinguish genuinely expansive regimes from nominal money growth that is offset by higher rates. Historically, “All of Bitcoin’s historic bear markets have occurred while this metric was declining… with the depths… while this metric was less than zero,” he writes, whereas “All of Bitcoin’s major bull runs have occurred in positive Net Liquidity environments.” As of mid-August, he characterizes conditions as constructive: “We are currently in a positive liquidity environment and the Fed is now forecast to cut rates 3 times in the remainder of 2025.” On-Chain Data Is Still Supportive If liquidity sets the tide, euphoria marks the froth. Edwards points to established on-chain gauges—MVRV, NVT, Energy Value—that have historically flashed red at cycle peaks. Those indicators, he says, are not yet there: “In 2025 we still see no signs of onchain Euphoria. Bitcoin today is appreciating in a steady, relatively sustainable way versus historic cycles.” A chart of MVRV Z-Score “shows we are nowhere near the price euphoria of historic Bitcoin tops.” By contrast, his derivatives composite—the “Heater,” which aggregates positioning and leverage across perps, futures, and options—has been hot enough to warrant short-term caution. “The heat is on… Of all the metrics we will look at here, this one is telling us that the market locally has overheated near all time highs this week.” In his telling, elevated Heater readings can cap near-term upside unless they persist for months alongside rising open interest—conditions more consistent with a major top. One metric, however, eclipses the rest in 2025–26: institutional absorption of new supply. “Today, 150+ public companies and ETFs are buying over 500% of Bitcoin’s daily supply creation from mining,” Edwards writes. “When demand outruns supply like this, Bitcoin has historically surged over the coming months. Every time this has happened in Bitcoin’s history (5 occurrences), price has shot up by 135% on average.” He emphasizes that the current, extended period of high multiples on this measure is “good news for Bitcoin,” while conceding the obvious caveat: no one can know how long such conditions will last. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Price Flips 200-WMA: What Happens Next? Because institutional demand can flip to supply, Edwards details a “treasury company early warning system.” He highlights four watch-items that his team tracks “24/7 for cycle risk management and positioning purposes”: a Treasury Buy-Sell Ratio that, if falling, “suggests growing selling by the 150+ companies”; a Treasury CVD whose flattening or lurch into a “red zone” is “risk off”; the percentage of Coinbase volume that is net buying; and a Treasury Company Seller Count that, on spikes, has historically preceded pressure. Layered on top is balance-sheet fragility. The more treasuries lever up to accumulate Bitcoin, the more a drawdown can cascade through forced deleveraging. “Total Debt relative to Enterprise value are key to track,” he says, adding that Capriole will publish a fresh tranche of treasury-risk metrics “next week.” Quantum Computers Vs. Bitcoin Edwards then makes an argument many Bitcoin investors will find uncomfortable: quantum computing is both an attractive return opportunity and Bitcoin’s most concrete long-term tail risk. Capriole, he says, expects “the asset class will outperform Bitcoin by circa 50% p.a. over the next 5–10 years,” citing today’s small market capitalizations against a “$2T+” addressable market. At the same time, “in the long-term (without change) QC is existential to Bitcoin,” with a worst-case window of “3–6 years” to break the cryptography that secures wallets and transactions. He notes that China “is spending 5X more on QC than the US” and recently “presented a QC machine a million times more powerful than Google’s,” arguing that the pace of breakthroughs, “with… innovations occurring every quarter,” suggests “this technology will mature sooner than many think. Just like ChatGPT.” The operational challenge, even if the risk is not imminent, is the migration path. Edwards sketches back-of-the-envelope constraints: roughly 25 million Bitcoin addresses hold more than $100; on “a good day,” the network handles about 10 transactions per second. If everyone tried to rotate to quantum-resistant keys at once—and many would prudently send test transactions—it would take “3–6 months” just to push the transactions through, before even counting the time to achieve consensus on, and deploy, a preferred upgrade. “Optimistically we are looking at a 12 month lead time to move the Bitcoin network to a Quantum proof system,” he writes. He flags work by Jameson Lopp as a starting point and urges the community to “encourage action on the QC Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPS).” Capriole itself holds quantum-computing exposure both for return potential and as “a portfolio hedge should a worst case scenario eventuate.” His conclusion is clear without being complacent. “The Bitcoin miner driven cycle is largely dead.” If institutional demand holds, “there is a strong chance of a right translated cycle,” with “a significant period of price expansion still ahead of us.” But vigilance is essential. The two variables to prioritize this halving epoch, in his view, are “Net Liquidity and Institutional Buying,” while the “biggest risk to this cycle” is paradoxically the cohort that has powered it: the Bitcoin treasury companies whose balance-sheet choices can compound both upside and downside. Quantum computing, he stresses, “isn’t a risk to Bitcoin this Halving cycle,” but absent action “it certainly will be in the next one.” The prescription is not to fear cycles, but to retire the outdated ones and prepare—technically and operationally—for the cycles that remain. At press time, BTC traded at $119,121.

50128520,557859,1755259450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50128520.jpeg,US Treasury Bessent Backtracks BTC Reserve Statement – Next Crypto to Explode,https://bitcoinist.com/us-explores-bitcoin-buying-next-crypto-to-explode/,"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent caused market jitters yesterday. And all it took was for him to imply that the government is ruling $BTC purchases for the strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Within just 40 minutes, his comment erased an eye-watering $55B from $BTC’s market cap. Still, he quickly debunked such a claim, which eased some of the market’s panic. With renewed confidence in the Web3 arena, now could be a great time to invest in the next crypto to explode . Bessent Caused $BTC’s $124K ATH to Nosedive $BTC dropped to ~$117K after hitting a new ATH of $124+ yesterday. It’s now showing signs of recovery at $119K. This tremendous slump came on the heels of Bessent indicating to Fox Business that the government wouldn’t be acquiring additional $BTC . ‘We’ve also started to get into the 21st century, a Bitcoin reserve. We’re not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up,’ commented Bessent. Though on a positive note, he did say that the Treasury won’t be selling its $BTC stash. According to him, it’s currently worth ‘somewhere between $15B and $20B.’ After $BTC took a tumble, Bessent didn’t hang around to set the record straight. He quickly took to X, saying the ‘Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve.’ As market confidence returns, now might be an opportune time to cast your attention on high-potential tokens with ambitious use cases. We have high hopes for Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Chintai ($CHEX) , and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . 1. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Presale Nears $1M Over Eyeing Futures Trading Platform Integration Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a new contender in the bustling dog-themed token arena, currently valued at a sizable $48B . Despite being a Shiba Inu coin on steroids (literally), $MAXI aims to offer more than just hype; it has plans for gamified tournaments and integrations with futures trading platforms in the future. That said, you only need to check out its presale website to see that meme culture runs deep in its DNA. It has bold slogans like ‘Feel the Maxi Pump’ and ‘Forget Your Limits’ splashed across the page. Supporting the project’s growth are its fair and sustainable tokenomics. Maxi Doge allocates a hefty 40% of its total token supply to marketing. This way, it can boost its visibility continuously to help bring up its token’s price. Meanwhile, an additional 15% is earmarked for the dev team, so gear up for ongoing developments and innovation. You can also rest assured that the dev team has prioritized security right from the start. Coinsult and SolidProof have audited its smart contract, and no issues were found. $MAXI is available on presale for just $0.000252. Showing its weight, it’s close to hitting its $1M milestone, with $980K raised thus far. 2. Chintai ($CHEX) – Supercharges Real World Asset Platform, Rockets 103% in 7 Days $CHEX is the linchpin of Chintai, a regulated digital asset platform that tokenizes real-world assets (RWAs). The platform makes it easy to create, trade, and manage tokenized assets, including issuance and secondary trading, all in a fully compliant setup. It’s powered by Chintai Nexus, its own tech built on the EOS blockchain with the Antelope protocol. Doing so means it can enable fast, scalable, and low-cost transactions. Its native token, $CHEX, powers the entire ecosystem. It covers network resource fees, plus staking, governance, and liquidity incentives. With RWAs on-chain hitting $26B and asset holders up 11% – exceeding 350K in the past month – $CHEX is well-positioned to capture a slice of this growing market. In fact, it already is. $CHEX is up 35% since last month and an impressive 103% in the previous week alone. Considering the RWA market is projected to reach $16T by 2030 , $CHEX positions itself for major growth. Now could be a prime time to buy $CHEX before its price possibly rockets. It’s available on some of the best crypto exchanges for just $0.1785. 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Set to Transform Bitcoin Into a Fast & Low Cost DeFi Powerhouse Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming Layer 2 network designed to uplift Bitcoin by making it faster, cheaper, and DeFi-ready. Once launched this quarter, the Layer 2’s capabilities have what it takes to push Bitcoin to become a much more powerful, versatile blockchain. At the moment, the Bitcoin network can only facilitate 7 transactions per second (tps) . In comparison, Ethereum can handle 15-30 tps, and Solana over 1K tps. To make Bitcoin speedier, Bitcoin Hyper pledges to batch transactions off-chain before settling them on Bitcoin’s base layer. Doing so would also help the network cut congestion and lower fees. Additionally, it’ll leverage the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to unlock smart contract functionality for Bitcoin. This alone would help DeFi protocols, dApps, and even the best meme coins to thrive on the network. In turn, it might help increase Bitcoin’s Total Value Locked, currently ranked third among all blockchains at $7.662B. At the moment, most of this value comes from custodial holdings, Lightning payment channels, sidechains, and wrapped $BTC. Ethereum, however, has the highest TVL at a hefty $94.74B, most of which is locked in smart contracts and dApps. With Bitcoin Hyper, Bitcoin could unlock massive liquidity and boost its position as a true DeFi powerhouse, just like Ethereum. A Canonical Bridge will also handle secure assets between the SVM and Bitcoin, while it plans for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to keep transactions trustless and scalable. To get the most out of the ecosystem, however, you’ll want to scoop up some $HYPER . Then, you can enjoy cheaper gas fees, governance rights, and staking rewards at an eye-popping 113%. $HYPER has already attracted over $9.6M on presale, despite one coin costing just $0.012725. Once the Layer 2 launches, it’s anticipated to reach $0.32 , so now signals a great time to join for potential 2,414%+ gains. Verdict – US Treasury Confirming BTC Buys Sparks Crypto Optimism Bessent’s comment on Bitcoin reserve purchases shook the market, but his swift backtrack reignited confidence. The rapid decline in $BTC’s price underscores just how sensitive the crypto market is. Yet, it also shows how quickly sentiment can switch when uncertainty is resolved. With confirmation that the US government will explore ways to grow its Bitcoin reserve, $BTC is stabilizing. And as always, when $BTC shows promise, so too do smaller low-cap coins – it’s the market leader, after all. Whether you’re interested in meme coin hype, RWAs, or Bitcoin scaling solutions, $MAXI , $CHEX, and $HYPER have what it takes to flourish on renewed market confidence. This isn’t investment advice.

In the referenced statement, Leibbrandt noted that a significant part of Ripple’s value proposition is tied to the cryptocurrency XRP. He explained that while banks can see potential in the technology, they have been hesitant to convert funds into cryptocurrencies due to market volatility. He said this cautious stance is common among risk-averse institutions, which prefer stability in currency values when dealing with cross-border transactions. Legal and Regulatory Barriers The shared material further outlined another major reason for SWIFT’s reluctance to adopt cryptocurrency-based solutions: the uncertain legal status of XRP and other digital assets in the past years. Leibbrandt pointed to the unclear regulatory environment as a critical factor limiting adoption. For banks and large financial institutions , operating within a stable and transparent legal framework is essential. Until such clarity is achieved, these entities are unlikely to move forward with integrating cryptocurrencies into their operations.

On August 7, Ripple Labs Inc. and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jointly filed a dismissal of their respective appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This Joint Stipulation of Dismissal formally concludes both the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal, bringing an end to a closely followed legal battle that had been a source of uncertainty in the industry.

While market volatility remains an important consideration, the removal of legal uncertainty and the prospect of a finalized U.S. regulatory framework address two of the key obstacles identified by financial institutions. According to SMQKE, these developments may pave the way for renewed discussions and evaluations around how XRP could fit into established cross-border payment networks such as SWIFT .

On August 14, Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs achieved an astounding combined ETF trading volume of $11.5 billion. This remarkable figure, as noted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas on X, mirrors the daily trading volume seen in shares of tech giant Apple, signaling a powerful surge in the nascent crypto ETF market . What Propelled This Massive Crypto ETF Market Surge? This unprecedented surge in crypto ETF market activity did not happen by chance. Several key factors converged to create such a robust trading environment. Increased institutional interest plays a crucial role, as more traditional financial players seek exposure to digital assets through regulated investment vehicles. Moreover, growing clarity around regulatory frameworks has bolstered investor confidence. As more countries and financial bodies provide clearer guidelines for digital assets, the perceived risk associated with these investments decreases. This encourages a broader range of investors to participate. Here are some contributing factors: Rising Investor Confidence: Greater understanding and acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets. Macroeconomic Factors: Investors seeking alternative assets amidst global economic uncertainties. Product Accessibility: ETFs provide an easier, more familiar way for traditional investors to access crypto without direct ownership. How Does Bitcoin ETF Performance Compare? A significant portion of the $11.5 billion ETF trading volume came from Bitcoin ETF products. Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, often leads the way in market movements. Its established presence and growing adoption by institutional investors make it a cornerstone of the crypto ETF landscape. The performance of Bitcoin ETFs often serves as a barometer for the broader digital asset market. When a Bitcoin ETF sees substantial inflows and trading activity, it typically indicates strong bullish sentiment across the crypto sector. This also suggests increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a valuable asset class. This volume demonstrates that investors are actively using these regulated products to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price action, highlighting a maturing market structure. The Growing Influence of Ethereum ETF Products While Bitcoin often takes the spotlight, Ethereum ETF products also contributed significantly to the record-breaking volume. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem supporting decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts, offers a different value proposition to investors. Its upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent updates) has also enhanced its appeal, making it more energy-efficient and scalable. The strong performance of Ethereum ETF offerings suggests that investors are not just interested in Bitcoin. They are diversifying their crypto exposure, recognizing the innovation and potential within the Ethereum network. This diversified interest is a healthy sign for the overall crypto market’s growth and stability. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are paving the way for broader adoption of digital assets within traditional finance. Navigating the Future: What’s Next for Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs? The $11.5 billion trading day is more than just a headline; it is a clear indicator of the burgeoning interest in Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs . This level of activity suggests a deepening integration of digital assets into mainstream financial portfolios. As these products gain more traction, we can anticipate several developments. Future trends might include: Increased Product Offerings: More diverse crypto ETFs focusing on other altcoins or specific sectors within crypto. Enhanced Liquidity: Higher trading volumes generally lead to greater liquidity, making it easier for large investors to enter and exit positions. Broader Regulatory Acceptance: More countries may follow suit in approving and regulating similar products, expanding the global reach of crypto ETFs. This growing interest highlights the ongoing maturation of the crypto asset class. The impressive ETF trading volume underscores a fundamental shift in how investors view and access digital currencies. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto Investments The remarkable $11.5 billion daily trading volume for Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on August 14 marks a pivotal moment.

Why Investors Are Looking for Alternatives to XRP XRP has received important traction for cross-border payments, but the current market conditions have made low gas fee crypto and crypto solving real-world problems very attractive. The search for the best crypto presale 2025 has pushed investors towards projects adopting real utility, scalability and early-stage growth potential. Though XRP’s market position is still going strong, it is no longer alone as a crypto with actual utility in the remittance industry. The next high-growth crypto can be expected from platforms that provide shorter adoption cycles, broader fiat coverage and better incentives for early supporters. Remittix: A Cross-Border DeFi Solution with Real Utility Remittix is a cross-chain DeFi project enabling instant crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries, 40+ cryptocurrencies and 30+ fiat currencies. Its mobile-first wallet beta launching in Q3 2025 will provide real-time FX conversion and near-zero gas fees, delivering a frictionless payment experience for both crypto natives and new entrants. The Remittix (RTX) token is currently trading at $0.0944, having raised over $19.6 million and sold 600 million+ tokens in its crypto presale. Once the presale reaches $20 million, the project will release its first Centralized Exchange (CEX) listing, which will provide access to greater liquidity and global exposure. What’s Powering Remittix’s Growing Momentum: Global Reach: Send crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries Real Utility: FX conversion with transparent rates Strong Security: Audited by CertiK Presale Momentum: $19.6 million + raised with 40% bonus live The ongoing $250,000 Remittix giveaway and 20% referral rewards offer further incentive to early adopters. With its mix of crypto staking functionality, real-world payment use case and CEX listing speculation, RTX is attracting both retail investors and institutional interest. Presale’s rapid growth is being driven by demand for crypto with passive income potential and future crypto projects that address core market needs. The upcoming CEX listing should drive significant visibility, similar to how early-stage Ripple was driven by exchange availability. With the leading DeFi projects 2025 prospects in view, the beta wallet release of Remittix will be a key adoption test.

""ETH is the Heart of the Network!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/vitalik-buterin-makes-important-statements-about-ethereum-eth-is-the-heart-of-the-network/,"Ethereum (ETH) has been quietly rising, coming very close to surpassing its 2021 ATH. However, following the US PPI data, which exceeded expectations, the crypto market experienced a sharp correction. ETH was also affected by this correction, falling from $4,700 to $4,480. ETH subsequently recovered, reaching levels around $4,600. While expectations continue for Ethereum to surpass its previous ATH in the short term, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin made important statements. Speaking to Bankless, Buterin spoke about ETH's fundamental role in the ecosystem, saying that ETH is the unifying core of the Ethereum network. Buterin stated that ETH is the key to the greatest consensus at the economic level within the Ethereum ecosystem and serves to unite the entire Ethereum community. Buterin argued that for these critical reasons, it is vital for ETH to maintain its position in the ecosystem. While there are various debates about the source of ETH's value, Ethereum remains central to the financial system. Transaction fees, network effects, and other factors all provide support for ETH, and efforts should be made to strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem and ETH from these perspectives in the future. As you may recall, Vitalik Buterin recently commented on the growing trend of ETH-focused treasury companies. While supporting this trend, Buterin warned that excessive leverage risks triggering a gradual price collapse. Buterin said that holding ETH in companies' treasuries is valuable and helps more investors access it. However, he warned that this trend could pose risks to the Ethereum ecosystem if it turns into an “overly leveraged game.” Related News: Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Offers Support and Warning for ETH!

The collaboration marks the sixth deal for Coinbase this year and combines $700 million in cash with 11 million Class A shares of the exchange platform. The collaboration combines Deribit’s derivative infrastructure with Coinbase’s growing suite of digital assets. The acquisition is an attempt by the Coinbase exchange to enter the crypto derivatives conversation. Coinbase moves for market share with Deribit’s acquisition Deribit was founded in 2016 by brothers John and Marius Jansen with a strong base of institutional and advanced traders. In 2024, its trading volume reached $1.185 trillion, nearly twice that of the previous year’s $608 billion. July posted $185 billion in monthly trading volume and approximately $59 to $60 billion in open interest.

The partnership will allow the U.S exchange platform to expand its derivatives offerings to include options. The company revealed that the integration will enable it to deliver products within a single platform, increasing liquidity and global reach. It will also offer various trading tools that meet diverse risk and jurisdictional requirements. Greg Tusar, Vice President of Institutional Products at Coinbase, acknowledged Deribit’s fast, capital-efficient, and battle-tested platform, saying it perfectly complements their growing futures and perpetuals business. He added that they are positioned to lead the next wave of innovation as demand for crypto options grows. Deribit’s July performance showed vigorous institutional activity and increased demand for derivative products. Industry data shows that crypto options are becoming more popular, drawing retail and institutional investors looking for advanced hedging and leverage strategies. Coinbase is betting on the deal to immediately grow to the adjusted EBITDA, as Deribit generated over $30 million in transaction revenue in July alone. The U.S. crypto exchange will consolidate Deribit’s results from August 14 to September 30 for Q3 revenue results. It also anticipates approximately $10 million in additional technology, development, and administrative expenses for Q3, excluding deal-related amortization. Coinbase stock remains 31% up since January The acquisition is expected to help Coinbase compete with other exchanges that offer different services, such as Kraken, Binance, and Robinhood . Binance continues to lead with a broad suite of services and token launches, while Robinhood recently expanded into tokenized stock trading for European customers. Coinbase exchange stock dipped by 2.5% following the announcement, but remains up 31% since January and 65% year over year. It has also purchased Spindle, a blockchain-based advertising platform, the Roam browser development team, and Liquifi, a token management firm. Briam Armstrong, CEO, has insisted that the deal is central to building a one-stop shop for all digital asset transactions. Emile Choi, COO, highlighted the importance of integrating Deribit’s technology and talent to accelerate product development and global market penetration. The exchange said the acquisition’s success depends on smooth integration, working with regulators, and ongoing demand for derivatives. The company also warned about possible risks, such as disruptions during integration, competition from global exchanges, and market volatility. Coinbase described the collaboration as a step towards creating faster, more efficient, and more accessible crypto derivatives markets. Tusar noted that they are building the future of crypto derivatives markets. The crypto exchange platform now controls approximately over $1 trillion in annual options trading, which Deribit held last year, and a dominant share of the options market.

Despite focusing on alts lately, he remains a strong BTC advocate, projecting it could reach $250K in the short term and $1 million by 2028. The Latest Purchase Arthur Hayes, the co-founder and former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, continues to increase his crypto holdings. According to Lookonchain, today (August 15), he purchased more Hyperliquid (HYPE), Lido DAO (LDO), and Ethena (ENA) tokens. The platform revealed that in the past five days alone he accumulated a total of 1,750 ETH (valued at over $8 million at current rates), 58,631 HYPE ($2.8 million), 3.1 million ENA ($2.3 million), 1.29 million LDO ($1.8 million), 184,610 PENDLE ($1 million), and 420,000 ETHFI ($504,000). His portfolio consists of cryptocurrencies that have experienced a substantial price uptick lately. ETH is up almost 50% on a monthly scale, HYPE is inching towards a new all-time high of $50, while ENA has exploded by triple digits in the past 30 days. It is worth noting that Hayes sold some of his altcoin holdings at the beginning of the month. Back then, he disposed of millions of dollars’ worth of ETH, ENA, and PEPE. Just a few days later, though, he repurchased the previously offloaded amount of ETH and even jokingly swore that he would never take a profit again . Hayes’s Take on BTC While the CIO of Maelstrom has recently increased his exposure to certain altcoins, rather than Bitcoin (BTC), he remains a firm supporter of the leading digital asset. In March, he suggested that Donald Trump’s debt policies would force the Federal Reserve to print more money at some point, which could make BTC an even more attractive investment. A month later, he said , “ It’s time to go long everything,” urging investors to focus on the primary cryptocurrency and once again predicting an upcoming money-printing wave from the Fed. Additionally, Hayes outlined a highly bullish forecast, envisioning BTC to reach a whopping $1 million per coin by 2028. Earlier this month, he argued that the American economy is on the brink of collapse and the only thing to save it is a financial injection of $9 trillion. According to him, such a move would push the price of BTC to $250,000.

This dynamic decentralized exchange (DEX) has carved a significant niche for itself, demonstrating remarkable growth and market influence without relying on traditional venture capital (VC) funding. DWF Ventures, the venture arm of DWF Labs, recently highlighted Hyperliquid’s unique journey, emphasizing its rapid ascent in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. What Fuels Hyperliquid’s Success in DeFi? Hyperliquid’s journey began as an Arbitrum-based perpetual exchange (PerpDEX). Its strategic decision to forgo early venture capital funding set it apart. This approach allowed the platform to prioritize community engagement and robust product development from the outset, rather than being beholden to investor demands. This focus has been a cornerstone of its impressive trajectory. Community-First Approach: By avoiding early VC, Hyperliquid fostered a strong, organic community. Product Excellence: Resources were channeled directly into building a superior perpetual exchange . Independent Growth: This path enabled Hyperliquid to evolve on its own terms, leading to unique strategic decisions. This independent spirit is a testament to the power of focusing on fundamentals in the competitive world of decentralized finance. HyperEVM and HYPE: A Leap in Crypto Innovation A pivotal moment for Hyperliquid was its migration from Arbitrum to its own Layer-1 network, HyperEVM. This move was a bold step, designed to enhance performance and scalability. Alongside this transition, Hyperliquid introduced the HYPE token, distributed through an airdrop. This airdrop generously allocated 31% of the total supply to early users, further cementing community loyalty and participation. The shift to HyperEVM and the introduction of HYPE signify a commitment to long-term infrastructure and a truly decentralized ecosystem. This focus on proprietary technology is a key driver of its continued crypto innovation . Unpacking Hyperliquid’s Impressive Blockchain Revenue and Market Share Hyperliquid’s strategic choices have translated into astonishing financial metrics. The platform has achieved significant milestones, underscoring its impact on the perpetual exchange market. These figures highlight not just growth, but also sustainable economic models within decentralized finance . Massive Trading Volume: Hyperliquid recorded an astounding $320 billion in perpetual trading volume. Substantial Revenue: In July alone, the platform generated $87 million in revenue. Dominant Market Share: It captured 35% of blockchain revenue among its peers. Centralized Exchange Competition: Hyperliquid also secured 6.1% of the centralized exchange market share, a remarkable feat for a decentralized platform. These figures illustrate Hyperliquid’s powerful position and its ability to compete effectively with both decentralized and centralized entities.

50130795,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78529,1755263140,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Pundit Predicts XRP Price When the First Wave of XRP ETFs Kicks In,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-predicts-xrp-price-when-the-first-wave-of-xrp-etfs-kicks-in/,"Crypto analyst Kenny Nguyen has outlined a bold projection for XRP’s price in light of the anticipated launch of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. In a post shared today, Nguyen stated that XRP “SHOULD BE AROUND $22 – $50” when the initial wave of these ETF products begins trading. With XRP currently valued at around $3.10, Nguyen’s forecast would represent a substantial price increase of 607% to over 1,500% from current levels. At those price points, XRP’s market capitalization would range from roughly $1.3 trillion to $3 trillion, significantly higher than its present $186 billion valuation. XRP SHOULD BE AROUND $22 – $50 WHEN THE FIRST WAVE OF SPOT XRP ETFS KICKED IN. — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) August 15, 2025 Potential Impact of Spot XRP ETFs on Market Valuation The optimism behind Nguyen’s projection stems from the belief that spot ETFs can serve as a gateway for both institutional and retail investors seeking regulated exposure to XRP without the complexities of direct custody. The introduction of spot XRP ETFs would mirror developments seen in other major digital assets and could mark one of the most pivotal moments in XRP’s market history. Unlike assets such as Ethereum, which provide staking rewards that may discourage ETF adoption, XRP does not have a staking feature. This absence of an opportunity cost could make ETF investment in XRP more appealing for certain investors. Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, which is one of the applicants for an XRP ETF, recently argued that this structural difference, combined with XRP’s entrenched position in the cross-border payments sector and its extensive global community, supports the case for strong inflows once the funds go live. Market Scenarios Based on Projected Inflows Different market models have been used to estimate where XRP’s price could land following ETF approval. McClurg suggested in a recent discussion that the asset could see $5 billion in investments in its first month. Analyst Dom’s multiplier model, which applies a 272x factor to market cap growth from inflows, places XRP’s valuation at $1.546 trillion in this scenario. This is equivalent to about $26 per token , within Nguyen’s projected range. Other projections draw parallels with Bitcoin’s ETF debut. If XRP ETFs capture 35% of the inflows that Bitcoin ETFs have recorded since launch, which is approximately $16.3 billion, and a conservative multiplier of 100 is applied, XRP’s market capitalization could reach around $1.76 trillion, corresponding to a price of roughly $30. Smaller inflow estimates still yield notable gains, with $11.7 billion potentially lifting XRP to $22.20 and $5.85 billion supporting a price of about $12.23. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Comparisons to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF Performance Some analysts view Bitcoin’s market reaction to ETF approval as a possible benchmark. Bitcoin experienced a temporary dip on launch day but later climbed to record highs above $100,000 within the year as ETF holdings expanded rapidly. In contrast, Ethereum’s spot ETFs have not yet pushed the asset to new highs, with momentum only building recently due to increased treasury activity. Observers note that XRP’s trajectory may differ entirely, depending on investor sentiment and capital allocation once ETFs launch. Rising Probability of U.S. Approval Confidence in the eventual approval of spot XRP ETFs continues to increase. Bloomberg ETF analysts recently estimated a 95% chance of approval, while prediction platform Polymarket reflects probabilities between 80% and 88% for 2025. Multiple major investment firms, including 21Shares, Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and WisdomTree, are currently awaiting a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which faces a deadline in October to rule on the pending applications. If approval is granted, Nguyen’s forecast of a $20 to $50 XRP price range will be tested in real market conditions, with investor inflows likely determining whether the asset approaches the upper end of that spectrum.

The token reached $0.000026 and quickly encountered resistance at that level, with 4.02 trillion tokens changing hands during a midday rejection that set a clear technical ceiling for the short term, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. From there, BONK slipped 6% to find a floor near $0.000023, where 1.07 trillion tokens traded as buyers absorbed the sell pressure. This zone has now emerged as a key support level, tested multiple times without breaking. BONK subsequently staged a modest recovery, gaining roughly 1% from $0.000024 to $0.00002425. The rebound was fueled by sharp volume spikes at 10:48 UTC and 10:49 UTC, 21.99 billion and 31.43 billion tokens, respectively, suggesting accumulation from larger players just above prior resistance. Traders now face a defined battle line: resistance remains fixed at $0.000026, with support anchored at $0.000023. A sustained push above $0.000025 could signal the beginning of a more pronounced upward move, while a break of the lower bound risks retesting early-August lows, according to the model. BONK’s continued high liquidity, even amid recent volatility, underscores its position as one of the more active tokens in the meme coin sector. Institutional participation has kept price action tightly bound, but it has also increased the potential for sudden breakouts should order books thin at key levels. Technical Analysis Trading range: $0.000023–$0.000026 over the 23-hour period. Resistance locked at $0.000026 after 4.02T token sell wall. Support confirmed at $0.000023 with 1.07T tokens traded. Price closed at $0.00002448, down 0.92% over the period. Late-session bounce from $0.000024 to $0.00002425 (+1%). Volume spikes at 10:48 UTC (21.99B) and 10:49 UTC (31.43B) suggest accumulation. Consolidation zone emerging between $0.000024 and $0.000025.

This future is closer than you think, thanks to stablecoins . A groundbreaking report from Keyrock and Bitso projects that these digital assets could power a significant portion of global payments by 2030, transforming how we conduct international business and personal transactions. What’s Driving the Stablecoin Surge in Global Payments? The joint report suggests that stablecoins might account for an astonishing 12% of global cross-border payments, equivalent to about $1 trillion, within the next six years. This marks a substantial leap from under 3% in 2024. But what exactly fuels this optimistic projection? Efficiency: Stablecoins offer faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional banking systems, especially for international transfers. Accessibility: They provide financial services to unbanked or underbanked populations worldwide. Innovation: Ongoing technological advancements are making stablecoin transactions more seamless and secure. This rapid growth hinges on crucial improvements in market infrastructure, including enhanced liquidity and greater interoperability between different blockchain networks. Clearly, the path to widespread global payments adoption is becoming clearer. The Pivotal Role of Crypto Regulation and Innovation Analysts emphasize that significant growth in the stablecoin sector largely depends on a clearer regulatory landscape. Fortunately, progress is already visible. Jurisdictions like the U.S. and Europe are actively working to establish comprehensive crypto regulation frameworks, which will provide much-needed clarity and confidence for institutions and users alike. Moreover, innovation within the industry is accelerating. Major players are not just participating; they are actively shaping the future. Companies like Tether and Circle, along with various fintechs and established banks, are expanding their presence. Some are even launching their own proprietary blockchains to capture more transaction value and offer tailored solutions. For instance, Circle recently introduced its Arc blockchain, while Tether operates Plasma and Stable, showcasing a commitment to advancing the underlying technology. Unlocking the Potential of Cross-Border Payments The promise of cross-border payments powered by stablecoins is immense. Think about businesses making international supplier payments without delays or high fees, or individuals sending remittances to family members overseas in minutes rather than days. This efficiency can unlock significant economic opportunities globally. Reduced Costs: Lower transaction fees benefit both senders and receivers. Faster Settlements: Near-instant transactions improve cash flow for businesses. Increased Transparency: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a clear audit trail. However, challenges remain. Ensuring robust security, managing potential systemic risks, and achieving widespread user adoption are key hurdles. Addressing these concerns will be vital for stablecoins to fully realize their potential in the international payment landscape. Major Players and Future Digital Currency Adoption The active involvement of industry giants underscores the growing belief in the future of digital currency adoption . Firms like Tether and Circle are leading the charge, but traditional financial institutions are also exploring how to integrate stablecoins into their offerings. This convergence of traditional finance and decentralized technology is creating a powerful ecosystem. As regulatory clarity improves and technological innovations continue, we can expect stablecoins to become an increasingly integral part of the global financial system. Their ability to bridge the gap between traditional fiat currencies and the speed of blockchain technology makes them uniquely positioned to revolutionize how money moves around the world. The journey to 12% of global payments by 2030 is ambitious but achievable. With continued innovation, a supportive regulatory environment, and growing confidence from users and institutions, stablecoins are poised to redefine international finance, making transactions faster, cheaper, and more accessible for everyone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or to a commodity like gold, to minimize price volatility. Q2: How do stablecoins improve global payments? Stablecoins offer faster transaction speeds, lower fees, and greater accessibility for international transfers compared to traditional banking methods, especially for cross-border payments. Q3: What role does regulation play in stablecoin growth? Clear and consistent crypto regulation provides legal certainty, enhances consumer protection, and builds trust, which is essential for institutional adoption and broader market growth. Q4: Which companies are major players in the stablecoin space? Key players include Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC), along with various fintech companies and traditional banks exploring or launching their own stablecoin-related services and blockchains. Q5: What are the main challenges for stablecoin adoption? Challenges include ensuring robust security, managing liquidity, achieving interoperability between different blockchain networks, and addressing potential systemic risks.

The company now holds 82,186 ETH and has entered into partnerships to earn income from it. ATNF stock price is up 312% over the last year, mostly due to the news of the pivot and new ETH holdings. I rate ATNF as a Hold for now as the new strategy goes into effect and the current rally subsides. ETHZILLA (180 Life Sciences) Overview 180 Life Sciences ( ATNF ), now known as ETHZILLA, has changed its overall strategy and business operations. The bioscience drug research and drug discovery company is entering the crypto ecosystem with an entirely new strategy. The company has support from big crypto players for its new operations. The company recently acquired a large amount of Ethereum. It is important to consider the company’s valuation with these new assets. To date, the company has not received any meaningful revenues because its work has been clinical research and drug trials. The crypto treasury has just been established, so the company will continue to receive zero revenues. The difference is that the company will produce investment income from its ETH holdings. I will describe below the company’s new business strategy and attempt to make a new valuation of the stock price with the new assets being considered. The risks are higher, but the company also has a more profitable model before it. For now, I will say the stock price is overvalued based on current assets. I rate the stock as a Hold and recommend investors watch developments from the company. I covered ETHZILLA f/k/a180 Life Science in April 2021 on Seeking Alpha. My previous rating and analysis no longer apply to the company. Even though ETHZILLA still has biotech assets, it does not in its recent Q10 give any updates about what it is doing with the remaining assets. It does say that it is still looking for way to profit from the assets or sell them. As of the last quarterly earnings, the company still reported research costs on its income statement and operating costs. Online Blockchain Casino The company states in its Q10 filing that it has acquired certain assets from Elray . The company acquired licensed patents and a gaming technology platform from Elray in 2024. The assets amount to the key components of creating an online blockchain casino. Elray received stock shares and warrants for the transaction and will help ETHZILLA build and launch the casino. There have been no updates from ETHZILLA about the implementation of these assets or building a casino. It is assumed the system will play some role in the company’s new strategy as being an ETH treasury. Pivot to Ethereum Treasury Strategy The new ETH treasury strategy comes with a new name for the company, ETHZILLA. The company will use its new capital to build an Ethereum treasury vehicle. The strategy is similar to BitMine ( BMNR ) and Strategy ( MSTR ), where the company holds a large amount of different crypto currency and raises proceeds to buy more. They raise proceeds through different debt instruments and loans. ETHZILLA is taking its own approach and has the backing of Peter Thiel, who invested in the company and other crypto treasury strategies . As of August 12, the Ethzilla holds 82,186 Ether ( ETH ) and Ether equivalents, which is worth around $349 million. With the recent Ether rally, the holdings are now worth $373.72 million. In addition to these holdings, the company has $238 million in cash and equivalents. The company has put Electric Capital in charge of its holdings to generate yield. ETHZILLA expects the ETH strategy to generate higher yields than traditionally staking ETH. Rather, the management of assets will gain through a combination of staking, lending, loaning, and private agreements. The company’s ETH treasury will have a group of advisors beyond Electric Capital. The company will partner with Etherealize and its strategic partners. Etherealize and its group of DeFi partners will act as a council for Ethzilla and advise on how to generate proceeds through the Ethereum ecosystem. ATNF Stock - New Valuation The new ETH assets are not reflected in the company’s last earnings release because they were bought afterward. We can imagine the changes to the balance sheet after the assets have been added. Here is a chart of the company’s historical earnings and valuation before the new assets. Amounts in US$ Millions Q2-2025 Q1-2025 Q4-2024 Q3-2023 Q2-2024 Revenues - - - - - Total Operating Expenses 1.7 2.4 1.4 1.0 1.8 Operating Income (1.7) (2.4) (1.4) (1.0) (1.8) Net Income (1.7) (2.4) (4.3) (0.8) 0.0 Cash & ST Investments 2.2 3.7 4.6 0.2 1.1 Total Current Assets 3.1 4.0 5.1 1.2 2.3 Total Assets 10.7 11.7 12.8 10.5 3.9 Accounts Payable 3.3 3.0 2.6 2.7 2.9 Total Current Liabilities 5.3 3.9 3.5 6.4 4.0 Total Liabilities 5.3 3.9 3.5 637 4.3 Book Value / Share $0.89 NAV per Share $0.03 Current Price / Share $7.61 Market Cap 1,650 Total EV 1,650 Data from Seeking Alpha. As of the last Q10, the company reported total debt of $762 thousand. The debt is mostly associated with the purchase of assets and patents from Elray. Current assets outweigh liabilities, but cash is low. At the current rate, cash burn through operations is an issue. The current stock price is way above the company’s book value per share and NAV value per share. The stock price has gained 312% over the last year. Most of the gains occurred this month over news of the pivot and from private placement. The high market cap reflects the high stock price. We now reimagine the balance sheet to include the company’s current ETH holdings and new cash on hand. Its ETH is now worth $373.72 million and the company has $238 million in cash and equivalents. Assets would now be $667.42 million and NAV per share would be $4.29 per share, assuming no further liabilities. The current stock price of $7.61 per share is far above $4.29 per share. The stock price is overvalued at the moment, thus the Hold rating. Comparison to Peers The new ETH treasury strategy for the company has few details on how it will proceed. Strategy ( MSTR ) has been very successful with its bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury strategy. Other companies like Gamestop ( GME ) and Trump Media and Technology Group ( DJT ) are trying similar strategies. There are not many publicly traded companies which have done it. Bitmine ( BMNR ) holds over $2.9 billion ETH and plans to have a treasury. Crypto has seen huge gains over the last year. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is up 102% over the last year and ethereum is up 73% over the last year. Blockchains offer new ecosystems for using these coins as investment tools and debt instruments, like staking. Online gaming and other online ecosystems use blockchains and tokens to run. This environment of using the token allows for the price of it to rise. If you are new to this technology, consider that bitcoin and ethereum can be used to buy things and those purchases are done on the blockchains associated with the currency. The blockchains support different environments which use the tokens, including investment platforms, mining platforms, gaming platforms, NFT platforms, and gambling platforms. The blockchain and its currency have an ecosystem which allows for many different transactions. Risk and Investment Strategy ETHZILLA is at moderate to high risk of poor financial performance. The risk will be less when the company can show either revenues or investment income on a consistent basis. The company’s strategy is innovative and profitable. The technology is new and upcoming. We have to see if ETH treasuries produce the same gains at BTC treasuries. A Hold rating for the company comes at a moderate to high risk. The stock price has recently rallied and is now cooling down or decreasing. There is no revenue for the company and no promise of revenue anytime soon. The company has a higher valuation now and that would be one reason for the stock price to rally. It will be important to read over the company’s next earnings report and especially its balance sheet. Conclusion 180 Life Sciences is now ETHZILLA. The business strategy has changed to an ETH treasury strategy. The company has partnerships with which it will try to gain income from using its new ETH holdings. ETHZILLA also acquired an online gambling platform, but it is unclear what they are doing with it. The company still has its biotech patents and research, but there are no updates. The new business strategy is interesting. As we watch the company implement it, I rate the company as a Hold.",ATNF,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-15 13:15:46

New cryptocurrency mining trends in 2025: GBR Miner leads the cloud mining profit revolution,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-breaks-new-highs-new-cryptocurrency-mining-trends/,"Unlike many mining platforms that rely on traditional electricity, GBRMiner’s mining facilities are powered entirely by renewable energy, including solar, wind, and hydropower. This not only reduces the platform’s carbon footprint but also significantly reduces energy costs, allowing more profits to be passed on to users. GBRMiner offers an attractive welcome bonus for new users. Register and receive $500 in mining credits, allowing you to start mining without any upfront investment. As the cryptocurrency market continues to heat up in 2025, with Ethereum prices breaking through the $4,700 mark and showing strong upward momentum, cloud mining platforms are becoming a new favorite for investors seeking stable returns. Taking into account current Ethereum market trends, this article provides investors with a comprehensive guide to maximizing crypto profits in 2025. The Ethereum Market Boom and the Rise of Cloud Mining In August 2025, the price of Ethereum (ETH) broke through the $4,700 mark and is currently hovering around $4,500. Market analysts generally believe this marks the beginning of Ethereum’s independent market trend. The ETH/BTC exchange rate has rebounded from its historical low of $0.0372 to above $0.33, demonstrating significant strength relative to Bitcoin. Veteran traders such as Miki point out that Ethereum has ended its three-year relative decline and is likely to enter an independent, unilateral rally in 2025. Institutional funds are pouring into the Ethereum market on a large scale. Data shows that Ethereum spot ETFs have reached $25.712 billion in net assets, holding approximately 6 million ETH, representing 4.96% of the current circulating supply. Compared to the 6.48% share held by Bitcoin ETFs, this represents significant room for growth. Three main reasons institutional investors favor Ethereum include its more cost-effective price compared to Bitcoin, its ability to be staked and earn interest as an “interest-bearing asset,” and its stable and secure operation. Against this market backdrop, cloud mining platforms are attracting increasing investor attention due to their low barriers to entry, stable returns, and the lack of hardware management. GBR Miner, an industry-leading platform, has launched innovative mining solutions to help users seize the opportunities of the cryptocurrency market in 2025. GBRMiner: The Next-Generation Cloud Mining Profit Engine GBRMiner, an emerging cloud mining platform, is rapidly gaining market recognition for its innovative technical architecture and user-friendly design.

Unlike traditional single-coin mining, GBRMiner’s dynamic algorithm intelligently allocates computing power between ETH, ZAM, and other high-potential tokens, maximizing user returns. GBRMiner commitment to environmental protection is particularly noteworthy. GBR Miner: The Industry-Leading Cloud Mining Solution As a mature platform in the cloud mining sector, GBR Miner maintains its leading position in 2025. Renowned for its stability, transparency, and high returns, it is particularly well-suited for investors seeking long-term, stable returns.

GBR Miner is also committed to sustainable mining. All mining operations utilize green energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower, ensuring profitability while maintaining environmental responsibility. This philosophy is attracting a growing number of environmentally conscious investors. Cloud Mining Investment Strategy and Risk Management in 2025 With Ethereum showing strong momentum in 2025, how can investors maximize returns through cloud mining platforms? The following strategic recommendations are offered by professional analysts: Diversification is key. Don’t invest all your funds in mining contracts on a single platform or cryptocurrency. Ideally, diversify your investments across high-quality platforms like GBR Miner and choose a portfolio of contracts with different maturities. Market timing is equally important. When Ethereum prices break through key resistance levels (such as the current $4,000-4,100 range), you can appropriately increase your allocation to ETH-related mining. 10% Veteran trader Sanmu noted that once ETH breaks through $4,100, it’s likely to continue testing its all-time high of $4,800. 10 This would significantly increase the profit potential of ETH mining. For long-term investors, consider reinvesting or staking Ethereum mining proceeds. After Ethereum transitioned to the PoS consensus mechanism, the annualized return on staking has remained between 4% and 6%, complementing mining returns. This dual-income “mining + staking” strategy is becoming increasingly popular in 2025. Industry Outlook and Technological Innovation Looking ahead to the second half of 2025 and beyond, the cloud mining industry will face a series of opportunities and challenges. With continued inflows of funds into Ethereum ETFs and increased institutional participation, the stability of ETH mining returns is expected to further enhance. At the same time, the supply tightening effect of Bitcoin after halving has also begun to appear, which may drive the entire cryptocurrency market upward. Join GBR Miner and earn ETH instantly!

But let’s begin with the largest digital asset. Just last week, its price struggled to maintain above $117,000 and even dipped below that level on a couple of occasions. However, it had a solid weekend in which it added a few grand and jumped toward $119,000. The beginning of the current business week was a lot more promising. On Monday alone, the cryptocurrency spiked above $122,000 to mark a multi-week peak before the bears returned and pushed it south by over three grand. However, the culmination was yet to occur as the bulls initiated a spectacular leg up on Wednesday and Thursday morning, driving bitcoin above its July 2025 all-time high of $123,200 to a new one. This time, the asset peaked at $124,500. Following this explosive price jump, though, came the almost inevitable correction. BTC quickly dropped back down to $122,000 and $121,000, but that was just the start. The hot PPI data for July came out, with numbers surging to a three-year high, which had an immediate impact on bitcoin’s price. Within minutes, the asset dumped to under $118,000, taking the rest of the market with it, which resulted in nearly $1 billion worth of liquidations. Although it has recovered some ground since then, BTC is still below $119,000. More volatility is expected later today as Donald Trump is set to meet with Vladimir Putin to discuss a possible peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Ethereum also had a big week, surging to its highest level since 2021 of over $4,700. However, it couldn’t push further to break its all-time high of almost $4,900, unlike BNB, which set a new record at $865 . Other notable weekly gainers include SOL, HYPE, LINK, and ADA.

The company has secured an additional 110,000 Solana (SOL) tokens, valued at an impressive $22 million. This strategic expansion further solidifies their position in the rapidly evolving world of crypto investment , bringing their total digital asset holdings to approximately 1,420,173 SOL and SOL equivalents. This bold step highlights the increasing integration of sophisticated blockchain technology within traditional financial strategies. What Propels DeFi Development’s Solana (SOL) Strategy? DeFi Development Corp.’s latest acquisition of 110,000 SOL tokens is more than just a purchase; it is a clear indicator of their long-term vision. This addition brings their total Solana portfolio to an estimated value of $273 million. Such substantial holdings reflect a strong belief in the future potential of the Solana ecosystem and its underlying blockchain technology. The company’s commitment to Solana is not new. Earlier in July, DeFi Development successfully completed a $122.5 million convertible bond issuance. The primary purpose of this significant funding was to fuel further SOL purchases, demonstrating a calculated and aggressive approach to expanding their digital asset holdings. Strategic Accumulation: The consistent acquisition of Solana (SOL) tokens positions DeFi Development Corp. as a major player in the Solana ecosystem. Long-Term Vision: These moves suggest a belief in the sustained growth and utility of the Solana blockchain. Funding Innovation: The bond issuance provides ample capital for continued crypto investment and expansion. Understanding Solana (SOL) and its Role in Blockchain Technology Solana (SOL) stands out in the cryptocurrency landscape due to its high throughput and low transaction costs, powered by innovative blockchain technology. It is a favorite among developers for building decentralized applications (dApps) and various DeFi protocols. Currently, CoinMarketCap reports SOL trading at $193.67, experiencing a minor dip of 0.24% over the past 24 hours. Despite minor fluctuations, its robust infrastructure continues to attract significant interest from institutional investors like DeFi Development Corp. Investing in Solana provides DeFi Development with exposure to a dynamic and rapidly expanding segment of the blockchain space. This strategic decision aligns with the company’s focus on AI-powered platforms, as Solana’s efficiency can support complex computational needs often associated with AI applications in finance. How Are Digital Asset Holdings Shaping the Future of Crypto Investment? The trend of companies accumulating significant digital asset holdings , particularly in established cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), signifies a maturation of the crypto market. It moves beyond speculative trading to strategic corporate treasury management and long-term investment. This shift is crucial for the mainstream adoption of blockchain technology. For businesses like DeFi Development , holding substantial amounts of a foundational cryptocurrency like SOL offers several advantages: Diversification: Adds a new class of assets to traditional portfolios. Growth Potential: Positions the company to benefit from the growth of the blockchain and DeFi sectors. Operational Utility: Potentially leverages the underlying blockchain for its own AI-powered platform operations. This approach to crypto investment is becoming a blueprint for other forward-thinking entities looking to integrate digital assets into their core strategies. It reflects a growing confidence in the stability and utility of these innovative technologies. What’s Next for DeFi Development and Solana (SOL)? DeFi Development Corp.’s continued expansion of its Solana (SOL) holdings signals a clear trajectory. The company is not merely observing the market; it is actively participating and shaping it through significant capital deployment. This commitment reinforces the growing narrative of institutional confidence in the broader digital asset space. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, we can expect more entities to follow similar strategic paths, driving further innovation and adoption. The current market dynamics for SOL, while showing minor daily fluctuations, remain strong within a broader upward trend, supporting the long-term investment thesis. DeFi Development ‘s moves serve as a compelling example of how AI-powered platforms are leveraging digital assets for strategic growth and enhanced financial positioning.

This evolution shows how blockchain has matured – from a raw, experimental playground to a regulated, efficiency-driven financial layer. And while each phase has brought its share of winners and losers, investors continue searching for the “next big thing” that could deliver massive returns, much like how MAGACOIN FINANCE is now drawing attention as a new contender in the current bull market. The ICO Era ICOs took over headlines between 2017 and 2018. Under the influence of Ethereum smart contracts, projects avoided the established channels to find funding and sold their tokens directly to investors worldwide. The articulation was straightforward, pitch a token which holds value in the next revolutionary dApp before launching. Billions came in, even on projects little more than a whitepaper. The hype and FOMO caused valuations to go to the stratosphere and back in reality, valuations dropped rapidly. Regulatory clampdowns came and only a small percentage of ICO projects remained intact. Nevertheless, ICOs demonstrated the success of on-chain fundraising, which led to other subsequent models such as the IEO and IDO. A Strategic Investment in Today’s Market Although in improving hype cycles, in the past, retail speculation has fueled a hype cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting it in a more sustainable model. Being supported by constant progress and a growing ecosystem, it is gaining the deserved reputation of a security-certified, audited, long-term project. Participants notably already witnessed significant momentum early on, and as spots in the allocations are becoming less available, the interest is growing before broader access to the exchanges can be reached. The chance resembles the initial days of other breakout tokens – when a little investment can multiply a number of times, lеading to incredible gains. NFTs Era By 2021, the spotlight shifted from utility tokens to ownership. NFTs, backed by blockchain certificates, let people own unique pieces of digital art, collectibles, and in-game assets. Beeple’s $69 million sale and celebrity endorsements pushed NFTs into pop culture overnight. The speculative rush sent prices of top collections soaring before the bubble popped. Most collections lost nearly all their value, but the technology itself endured. Today, NFTs are finding real-world use cases in ticketing, authentication, and gaming, proving the underlying innovation had substance beyond the hype. RWAs Era Now, attention has turned to Real-World Asset tokenization. This is not about creating speculative crypto-native products – it’s about bringing tangible assets like real estate, bonds, and private credit onto the blockchain. Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton are leading the market, seeking efficiency, liquidity, and transparency. The interest among institutions is evident, since these tokens are pegged in real assets, and hence the volatility is reduced, which fits into the compliance requirements. There are still hurdles to overcome, primarily around legal structures and cross-border rules and regulations but as regulatory sandboxes are implemented in countries, the road to large-scale adoption is becoming clear. Conclusion From ICOs to NFTs and now RWAs, each crypto hype cycle has built on the lessons of the last. The industry is moving from speculative mania toward a more grounded, utility-focused future. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits into this evolution by offering a secure, growth-oriented ecosystem that combines innovation with credibility – making it a project to watch as the market’s next chapter unfolds.

Moreover, the token now trades a whisker below July’s all-time high, which keeps traders focused on a decisive break over the $50 mark. The question is not whether momentum exists, but whether it can carry price through resistance and hold. Record activity lifts sentiment On August 15, Hyperliquid posted a new platform record with $29 billion in 24-hour trading volume and $7.7 million in fees. Hyperliquid @HyperliquidX · Follow Hyperliquid reached new all-time highs with $29B in 24h volume and $7.7M in 24h fees. 8:25 AM · Aug 15, 2025 1.5K Reply Copy link Read 197 replies Moreover, HYPE hovered around $48.57 as of press time, which put it roughly 1.1% below the $49.75 peak set on July 14. Because price sits so close to that milestone, sentiment has turned more assertive, and dip buyers remain active within the day’s $44.40–$49.35 range. Whales step in At the same time, on-chain flows show fresh capital rather than recycled liquidity. Notably, a newly created wallet withdrew $23.51 million in USDC from centralised exchanges and bought 466,000 HYPE worth $21.45 million, while also accumulating $2.16 million in UFART. 余烬 @EmberCN · Follow 一个新创建地址在过去 6 小时里购买了 46.6 万枚 $HYPE ($2145 万)。这个地址在凌晨创建后从 Binance 跟 Crypto. com 提取了 2351 万 USDC 然后存进 Hyperliquid，购买了 46.6 万枚 $HYPE ($2145 万，价格 $45.69) 和 216 万枚 $UFART ($214 万，价格 $1.02)。地址： hypurrscan.io/address/0xa523… 6:03 AM · Aug 15, 2025 9 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies Additionally, Arthur Hayes has purchased a substantial amount of HYPE tokens.

Liquidity and institutional tailwinds Beyond price, underlying liquidity continues to improve. Hyperliquid’s TVL has climbed from about $460 million in mid-July to roughly $610 million, while July USD inflows jumped from $21.35 million in June to $349.27 million. Moreover, Circle’s plan to bring native USDC and CCTP V2 to Hyperliquid, along with Anchorage Digital Bank’s custody support for HYPE, strengthens on- and off-ramps for both retail and institutions. Momentum tilt on the chart From a technical point of view, the recent breakout from a downward channel, after weeks of compression, and a fresh ascending trendline argue for continuation if buyers defend higher lows. Furthermore, major moving averages from the 50-day SMA down to the 20-day EMA point to a buy bias, while the RSI sits near 63, which leaves room before overbought territory. Hyperliquid price chart | Source: TradingView Additionally, the MACD remains positive, and the stochastic indicator near 87.81 signals firm buying interest, even as the Bollinger Bands tighten and the price rides the upper band. Hyperliquid price forecast: the path to $50 Given the confluence of record platform activity, whale accumulation, and bullish technicals, the base case favours an attempt at $50 and a test of $52. A daily close above $49.75 with expanding volume and persistent fee strength would likely validate a move toward $55 in the short run. However, if price stalls beneath $48 and breadth fades, the market could consolidate between $44 and $49 while rebuilding energy.

Historical signals, like Bitcoin dominance’s first monthly bearish cross since January of 2021, add weight to the bullish case. Ethereum is leading the charge, with US spot ETH ETFs pulling in over $3 billion in the first half of August, including a record $1 billion in a single day. ETH prices surged nearly 20% this week, topping $4,765, as institutional inflows hit record highs. Altseason Buzz Builds Coinbase suggested that current market conditions could be setting the stage for a full-scale altcoin season as early as September, with certain key indicators already pointing toward a potential shift in momentum away from Bitcoin. In its latest monthly outlook, David Duong, Coinbase Institutional’s global head of research, said that the firm defines an altcoin season as a period in which at least 75% of the top 50 altcoins by market capitalization outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. While this threshold has not been reached just yet, several factors suggest the market is moving in that direction. Coinbase monthly outlook One of the main drivers is the large amount of retail capital that is currently parked in money market funds. Duong argued that the Federal Reserve’s expected September interest rate cut— odds of which have climbed to 92% after the latest Consumer Price Index data showing inflation steady at 2.7%—could unlock more retail participation in crypto markets. A lower interest rate environment typically boosts high-risk assets like altcoins by drawing in fresh liquidity. Bitcoin’s market dominance also fell from over 65% in May to around 59%, its lowest since January. Duong said this decline signals the early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. Other traders like Ito Shimotsuma noticed that Bitcoin dominance just formed its first monthly bearish cross since January of 2021. Back then, altcoins rallied for four months after the signal, and a similar move could trigger gains through December 2025. (Source: Coinbase) Additionally, altcoin market capitalization surged by over 50% since early July, and while altcoin season indexes from CoinMarketCap, Blockchain Center, and CryptoRank are still below the 75 threshold, they have been steadily rising. Institutional interest in Ethereum is playing a major role in driving momentum, supported by stablecoin adoption and digital asset treasuries. However, Joanna Liang of venture capital firm Jsquare explained that the market still awaits a strong new narrative to fully ignite altseason, similar to how ICOs, Layer-1 blockchains, and DeFi/NFT booms fueled past cycles. With the supportive macroeconomic backdrop, falling Bitcoin dominance, and a compelling narrative converge, analysts believe a mature altcoin season could emerge over the next few months. Ethereum ETFs Head for Record-Breaking Month On altcoin that is picking up steam is Ethereum. In fact, spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States attracted over $3 billion in net inflows in just the first two weeks of August, setting the stage for their second-strongest monthly performance since launch. Data shows that spot Ethereum ETFs are on track to record their strongest week ever, with inflows exceeding $2.9 billion. The momentum has been particularly strong this week, averaging over $700 million in daily inflows since Monday. Monday alone saw a record-setting $1 billion in inflows, which was the highest single-day figure for the asset class. ETH ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) The surge in ETF demand took place alongside a robust rally in ETH’s price this month. On Thursday, ETH climbed to a yearly high of $4,765.83 before experiencing a sharp drop below $4,500, only to recover and trade above $4,600 at press time. This means that ETH was able to climb by nearly 20% throughout the past week. The wave of capital also pushed total net assets across all spot Ethereum ETFs to a record $29.22 billion. ETH price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Since their launch, spot Ethereum ETFs accumulated $12.73 billion in cumulative net inflows and are on pace for a five-month inflow streak heading into September. Thursday’s trading day alone brought in $639.61 million, led by BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) with $519.68 million, followed by the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust with over $60 million and Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund with nearly $57 million. This week’s strong performance follows Wednesday’s $729 million in net inflows, which was the second-highest daily inflow for spot Ethereum ETFs after Monday’s record. With Ethereum’s price surging and institutional demand climbing, market strategy firm Fundstrat is turning increasingly bullish. Chief information officer Thomas Lee described ETH as the “biggest macro trade” of the next decade, while head of digital asset research Sean Farrell projected the asset could reach between $12,000 and $15,000 by the end of 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ALTCOIN|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-15 13:30:00

This particular transaction involved a staggering 455,298 LINK tokens, valued at approximately $10.2 million, moved within a short four-hour window. This LINK whale transaction , as reported by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, immediately sparked discussions about its potential implications for the broader crypto market. Understanding such large movements is crucial for anyone tracking digital asset trends, as they often signal shifts in investor sentiment or strategic positioning. What Does a Large Chainlink (LINK) Withdrawal Signify? When a newly created wallet undertakes a substantial Chainlink (LINK) withdrawal , it’s more than just a simple transfer of funds. This action often indicates what is known as “whale activity” in the crypto space, specifically a LINK whale transaction in this context. Whales are individuals or entities holding large amounts of a particular cryptocurrency, and their movements can significantly influence market dynamics. For instance, moving tokens off an exchange generally suggests an intent to hold them for the long term, rather than sell them immediately. Conversely, depositing large amounts onto an exchange might precede a sell-off. Accumulation: The wallet owner might be accumulating LINK for a long-term investment strategy, believing in Chainlink’s future growth and its role in decentralized oracle networks. Security: Moving funds from a centralized exchange to a private wallet enhances security, as the user gains full control over their private keys, mitigating exchange-related risks. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large withdrawals can sometimes precede an OTC transaction, where a buyer and seller agree on a price directly, bypassing public exchanges to avoid significant price slippage. Analyzing Binance LINK Movements: Is There a Pattern? The recent Binance LINK movements highlight the constant flow of assets on and off major exchanges. Binance, being one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, frequently sees significant transactions. However, a single large withdrawal by a newly formed wallet often stands out. It prompts analysts to investigate the wallet’s history, if any, and its subsequent actions. While the immediate reason for this specific large crypto withdrawals remains speculative without further data, observing such patterns helps in understanding potential market shifts. Investors often monitor exchange balances and large transfers as indicators of supply and demand. A decrease in exchange supply due to significant withdrawals can, in theory, reduce selling pressure and potentially lead to price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases. However, it’s vital to remember that one transaction alone does not dictate the entire market trend. The overall crypto market impact depends on various factors, including broader market sentiment, news, and macroeconomic conditions. The Potential Impact of Large Crypto Withdrawals on LINK Price The immediate effect of a large crypto withdrawals on an asset’s price can be subtle or pronounced, depending on market conditions. For Chainlink (LINK), a $10.2 million withdrawal represents a notable sum, yet it’s a fraction of its total market capitalization. Nevertheless, such moves can influence short-term sentiment. If other whales follow suit, or if the market perceives this as a bullish signal for LINK, it could contribute to positive price momentum. Consider these aspects regarding the LINK price impact : Reduced Selling Pressure: Tokens moved off exchanges are typically not intended for immediate sale, thus reducing the available supply on trading platforms. Investor Confidence: Large holders accumulating an asset can signal confidence, potentially encouraging other investors. Liquidity Changes: While the overall market liquidity might not drastically change, the liquidity on Binance specifically for LINK might see a minor adjustment. However, the market is complex. Other factors, such as overall crypto market trends, regulatory news, or Chainlink-specific developments, could easily outweigh the impact of a single withdrawal. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact: What Should Investors Consider? For investors, understanding these large transactions is part of staying informed about the crypto market impact . While a significant Chainlink (LINK) withdrawal might seem like a direct signal, it’s crucial to approach such events with a balanced perspective. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider these actionable insights: Due Diligence: Always conduct your own research. Don’t rely solely on whale movements as a definitive buy or sell signal. Long-Term Vision: Focus on Chainlink’s fundamentals, its technology, adoption, and development roadmap rather than short-term price fluctuations driven by large transactions. Risk Management: Diversify your portfolio and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Volatility is inherent in the crypto space. Stay Informed: Follow reputable analytics firms and news sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and Binance LINK movements . This substantial Chainlink (LINK) withdrawal from Binance by a new wallet serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto markets. While the immediate reasons remain speculative, such large movements underscore the ongoing activity by significant holders. They highlight the importance of monitoring on-chain data for insights into potential market trends and investor behavior. Ultimately, a well-informed and strategic approach remains paramount for navigating the complexities of the digital asset landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Chainlink (LINK) withdrawal? A Chainlink (LINK) withdrawal refers to the act of moving LINK tokens from a cryptocurrency exchange, like Binance, to a private wallet or another address. This action typically means the owner intends to hold the tokens rather than sell them immediately on the exchange. 2. Why do whales withdraw large amounts of crypto from exchanges? Whales, or large holders, withdraw significant amounts of crypto for various reasons, including long-term accumulation, enhanced security by self-custody, or preparing for an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction that bypasses public exchanges. 3. How does a large withdrawal affect LINK’s price? A large withdrawal can potentially reduce the available supply of LINK on exchanges, which might decrease selling pressure. If demand remains constant or increases, this could contribute to positive price momentum, though it’s rarely the sole factor. 4. Is this Chainlink (LINK) withdrawal a bullish or bearish signal? Generally, large withdrawals are considered a bullish signal as they suggest an intent to hold rather than sell. However, the crypto market is complex, and one transaction does not definitively indicate a trend. It’s crucial to consider broader market conditions and other factors. 5. How can I track large crypto transactions like this?

50132084,557551,1755265293,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50132084.jpeg,Altcoin season by mohla začať už v septembri. Pripravte sa na ňu s týmito coinmi,https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-season-uz-v-septembri/,"Podľa najnovšieho mesačného výhľadu od Coinbase Institutional, altcoin season môže prísť už niekoľko týždňov . Prognóza je taka, že k zmene trhového lídra z Bitcoinu na alternatívne kryptomeny by mohlo dôjsť už v septembri. Pojem altcoin sezóna označuje obdobie na trhu, keď kryptomeny iné než Bitcoin, často na čele s Ethereum, Solana a ďalšími veľkými tokenmi, dosahujú počas dlhšieho časového úseku výrazne vyššie percentuálne zisky než $BTC. Dôvody, prečo altcoin season môže začať už v septembri Správa zo 14. augusta , ktorej autorom je David Duong , vedúci výskumu v Coinbase, uvádza tri hlavné faktory, prečo altcoin season môže začať už v septembri: klesajúcu dominanciu Bitcoinu, zvyšujúcu sa likviditu a rastúcu ochotu investorov presúvať kapitál do aktív s vyššou volatilitou. Duong tento vývoj opisuje ako cyklický presun kapitálu smerom k rizikovejším aktívam, ku ktorému dochádza, keď na trhu rastie dôvera. Dominancia B itcoinu – teda jeho podiel na celkovej trhovej hodnote kryptomien, začal oslabovať. Coinbase upozorňuje, že keď tento ukazovateľ klesá, kapitál sa presúva najskôr do veľkých altcoinov a následne do stredných a menších projektov. Tento rotačný efekt by sa podľa nich mohol naplno prejaviť už v septembri. Likvidita altcoinov – Coinbase poukazuje na užšie rozdiely medzi nákupnou a predajnou cenou a na hlbšie order booky na hlavných burzách, čo uľahčuje obchodníkom vstup a výstup z pozícií bez výraznej straty na cene. Vyššia likvidita zároveň priťahuje aj väčších hráčov, ktorí by sa inak menej obchodovaným tokenom vyhýbali. Trhový sentiment – Duong tvrdí, že pri stabilizácii makroekonomických podmienok sú investori ochotnejší hľadať vyššie výnosy v rizikovejších kryptoaktívach. Takéto prostredie môže podporiť trvalý prílev kapitálu do altcoinov, najmä ak sa cena bitcoinu bude konsolidovať namiesto prudkého rastu na nové maximá. Zdroj: Coinbase Monthly Outlook Ak sa prognózy Coinbase naplnia a altcoin season skutočne odštartuje už v septembri, môžeme očakávať, že na trh sa dostanú do popredia nielen tradiční lídri ako Ethereum či Solana, ale aj nové a kreatívne projekty, ktoré dokážu zaujať odlišným prístupom. V čase rastúcej ochoty investorov hľadať vyššie výnosy práve medzi altcoinmi , majú šancu zažiariť aj menej známe, no výrazne odlíšiteľné tokeny.

This ambitious vision, articulated by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins, signals a significant shift in the nation’s approach to digital assets. Atkins recently told Fox Business that the SEC will deploy every available resource to establish the U.S. as the premier Bitcoin hub and leader in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. What is ‘Project Crypto’ All About? On July 31, the SEC officially launched “Project Crypto,” a strategic initiative designed to propel the U.S. to the forefront of the digital asset revolution. This project directly supports U.S. President Donald Trump’s vision of making the nation the global center for cryptocurrency innovation . The core idea behind Project Crypto is to foster an environment where digital assets can thrive responsibly, attracting investment and talent from across the globe. Resource Allocation: The SEC Chair emphasized deploying all available agency resources to achieve this goal. Strategic Alignment: Project Crypto aligns with the broader national objective of economic and technological leadership. Innovation Focus: The initiative prioritizes creating a fertile ground for new technologies and business models in the crypto space. Moreover, this move suggests a proactive stance from the SEC, aiming to shape the future of digital finance rather than merely reacting to it. It’s about building a robust framework that supports growth while safeguarding market integrity. Why Aim to Be the Premier U.S. Crypto Capital? Establishing the U.S. as the leading U.S. crypto capital offers numerous benefits, not just for the digital asset industry but for the entire economy. A strong domestic crypto sector can lead to significant economic growth, creating new jobs, attracting foreign investment, and fostering technological advancements. Think about the potential for groundbreaking startups, increased financial inclusion, and enhanced global competitiveness. The vision extends beyond mere economic gains. It also encompasses solidifying the U.S. position as a global financial powerhouse in the digital age. By becoming a definitive Bitcoin hub , the nation can influence global standards and ensure that future financial systems are built on principles that reflect American values of transparency and innovation. Navigating Challenges for U.S. Cryptocurrency Innovation While the ambition to become the global U.S. crypto capital is inspiring, the path forward is not without its challenges. The primary hurdle involves striking the right balance between fostering cryptocurrency innovation and implementing effective regulatory oversight. The SEC, led by the SEC Chair , must navigate complex issues such as consumer protection, market manipulation prevention, and anti-money laundering efforts. Furthermore, competition from other nations eager to attract crypto businesses remains fierce. Jurisdictions in Europe and Asia are also actively developing their own crypto-friendly frameworks. Therefore, the U.S. must ensure its regulatory environment is clear, predictable, and encourages rather than stifles growth. Implications for the Global Bitcoin Hub The success of “Project Crypto” could profoundly impact the global digital asset market, especially for Bitcoin. As the U.S. solidifies its position as a trusted Bitcoin hub , it could lead to increased institutional adoption and greater liquidity for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. This could, in turn, enhance market stability and reduce volatility, making digital assets more appealing to a broader range of investors. Ultimately, a clear and supportive regulatory framework from the SEC Chair could unlock massive potential for the entire ecosystem. It could encourage more companies to build, invest, and operate within the U.S., accelerating the mainstream adoption of digital currencies and blockchain technology. The U.S. SEC’s “Project Crypto” represents a bold and strategic move to cement the nation’s role as the global U.S. crypto capital . With a clear focus on fostering cryptocurrency innovation and establishing a robust Bitcoin hub , the initiative aims to leverage the full resources of the SEC. While challenges exist, the potential benefits for economic growth, technological leadership, and global financial influence are substantial. This proactive approach by SEC Chair Paul Atkins could truly redefine the future of digital assets worldwide, making the U.S. a beacon for the burgeoning crypto economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the main goal of “Project Crypto”? The main goal of “Project Crypto” is to establish the U.S. as the world’s leading U.S. crypto capital and premier hub for cryptocurrency innovation , fulfilling President Donald Trump’s vision. Who is leading this initiative at the SEC? U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins is leading this initiative, aiming to deploy all available resources to achieve the stated goals. How might this impact the Bitcoin market? By establishing the U.S. as a robust Bitcoin hub , “Project Crypto” could lead to increased institutional adoption, greater liquidity, and enhanced market stability for Bitcoin. What are the primary challenges for the U.S. in becoming the global crypto capital? Key challenges include balancing innovation with regulatory oversight, ensuring consumer protection, preventing market manipulation, and competing with other nations for crypto business attraction. Will “Project Crypto” affect all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? While Bitcoin is mentioned as a key focus, the initiative aims to foster broader cryptocurrency innovation , implying benefits and regulatory frameworks for the entire digital asset ecosystem.

When utilities regulators met in Anaheim in November last year, tech firms were a prominent presence as delegates donned Google-branded lanyards while Microsoft and Amazon sponsored networking activities and led panel discussions, respectively. Apparently, Amazon and Microsoft are already repurposing old energy plants in Europe to power AI needs. Data centers drain energy, impacting domestic consumers This strong presence shows a significant shift as firms that used to be solely focused on digital services are now heavily involved in energy markets. In 2023, the power-draining data centers consumed about 4% of America’s generated electricity. Within three years from today, government analysis suggests this might reach about 12%. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has acknowledged the challenge, saying energy is the biggest constraint, a problem that is also piling pressure on households. A decisive confrontation occurred last December in Columbus. Technology companies, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft submitted an unprecedented independent proposal to utility regulator PUCO, seeking reduced infrastructure payments for their planned data centers. This followed American Electric Power’s warning that servicing 90 new facilities would need six times Ohio’s current output. The utility had also indicated that households would end up battling the high costs of energy without serious upfront planning. However, the commissioners, after months of deliberation, unanimously turned down the technology firm’s proposal. PUCO chair Jenifer French stated the ruling “safeguards non-data-centre customers” by creating a new rate classification. The immediate effect is clear: typical Ohio bills rose by at least $15 monthly from June. Northern Virginia exemplifies long-term consumer risks. In 2010, developer Unicorn Interests secured approval for a Manassas data center requiring $42 million (£33 million) in grid upgrades. When the project was delayed four years, residents absorbed maintenance costs for unused infrastructure. Google and other tech firms balance innovation and equity Technology companies found themselves in dual roles. While data centers drive unprecedented electricity demand, their energy subsidiaries have sold $2.7 billion (£2.1 billion) of power since 2015. Microsoft energy chief Bobby Hollis insists: “We don’t want to see other customers bearing the cost.” Yet, traditional utilities recover infrastructure investments through decades of consumer billing. The technology companies say they are open to compromises. In an interview, Amanda Peterson Corio, a Google executive responsible for data center energy, pointed to a deal with American Electric Power’s subsidiary in Indiana and consumer groups in that state, where tech companies agreed to pay some grid upgrade costs upfront to allay concerns about canceled or delayed projects. But under that deal, data centers are not put into a new rate class. “You start to isolate different classes and start to allocate who we’re going to give power to and who we’re not,” Ms. Corio said. “That goes against every construct of how our electricity system was designed, which is to be open access.” Tech companies say they plan to keep building data centers, but where those sites will be is uncertain. That puts utilities at risk of building more than their area needs. Microsoft, for example, announced plans in October to build three data center campuses that would require power from the Ohio utility. But six months later — before regulators ruled against the tech industry — Microsoft changed its data center strategy and said it was putting the Ohio projects on ice. For the foreseeable future, those sites would remain farmland. Complicating matters, technology firms operate without the ownership restrictions facing utilities. With artificial intelligence’s expansion accelerating, the question remains how society distributes both its benefits and costs.

This resurgence follows months of subdued activity, indicating that traders are re-engaging with significant positions. Open interest refers to the total value of outstanding futures and options contracts. An increase in open interest suggests that more traders are entering the market, often with leveraged positions, which can amplify price movements. The recent spike in XRP's open interest indicates a growing confidence among traders and a potential buildup of volatility. This uptick in open interest coincides with XRP's price trading at $3.11, within a range between $3.04 and $3.14. Technical indicators suggest that XRP is approaching a critical juncture. A breakout above the $3.40 resistance level could pave the way for a rally toward the $3.65 all-time high. Conversely, failure to maintain support at $3.00 might lead to a decline toward lower support levels. The resurgence in open interest is also mirrored in the futures market. XRP futures have seen a significant increase in open interest, with some exchanges reporting levels as high as $8.68 billion. This indicates a substantial influx of capital and heightened speculative activity. The weighted funding rate, a metric indicating the cost of holding long positions, has also risen, suggesting that traders are increasingly betting on upward price movements. Market analysts view this resurgence as a precursor to potential increased volatility. The combination of rising open interest, technical resistance levels, and speculative positioning sets the stage for a significant price movement in the near future. XRP ETFs Offer a Paradigm Shift Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is clear, “XRP ETFs represent the transition from speculative retail trading to institutional adoption.” His words capture a simple market truth that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) don’t just expand access, they transform ownership and usage. If XRP follows suit, the playbook is clear just like spot Bitcoin ETFs, a regulated XRP ETF would provide compliant custody, tickered access for institutions, and a frictionless path for long-term capital, potentially reshaping market structure as $65 billion did for Bitcoin. The infrastructure is already in motion fast with major asset managers, such as Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21Shares, having already filed for XRP products, with U.S. regulators formally acknowledging several proposals, a key step signaling imminent approvals and listings. Regulatory uncertainty around XRP has eased in 2025, such as the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC case, paving the way for mainstream products, a backdrop fueling manager filings and Ripple CEO Garlinghouse’s optimism. What Garlinghouse’s statement really signals is a change of narrative. ETFs recast XRP from an exchange-traded speculative token into an investable institutional asset class candidate, one that could sit alongside stocks and bonds in portfolios rather than only in crypto wallets. If regulators and exchanges follow through, the next wave of inflows would be less about retail FOMO and more about strategic allocation, liquidity, and productized access, the hallmarks of institutional adoption. Conclusion Garlinghouse’s point is precise that an approved XRP spot ETF would shift XRP from a retail-driven, OTC asset to a mainstream institutional investment. Meanwhile, the resurgence of XRP's open interest above $3 billion is a clear indicator that traders are re-engaging with the asset. This renewed interest, coupled with favorable legal developments, sets the stage for potential heightened volatility and significant price movements in the near future.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-15 13:53:38

On August 15, the proprietary non-invasive diagnostic technology platform Know Labs revealed a significant change: it has rebranded as USBC and will now focus its financial strategy on a bold Bitcoin investment strategy . This pivot marks a remarkable departure from its previous core business, signaling a new era for the company in the burgeoning digital asset space. Investors and industry observers are keenly watching this strategic evolution, eager to understand its potential impact on both the company’s future and the broader digital asset landscape. What Prompted the USBC Rebranding? Know Labs, a company previously recognized for its innovative non-invasive diagnostic technology, made a surprising move by announcing its USBC rebranding . This decision, formally communicated via a press release on GlobeNewswire, signifies a complete reorientation of the company’s strategic priorities. Instead of developing and commercializing healthcare solutions, USBC will now operate primarily as an investment vehicle, with a clear focus on digital assets. The shift raises important questions about the fate of its diagnostic technology portfolio. It appears the company has made a deliberate choice to reallocate its resources, aiming to capitalize on the potentially high returns offered by the cryptocurrency market. This strategic pivot highlights the increasing allure of digital assets for traditional businesses seeking new avenues for growth and profitability in an ever-evolving global economy. Embracing a Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy At the core of USBC’s new direction is its unwavering commitment to a comprehensive Bitcoin investment strategy . This involves allocating a significant portion of its capital to acquire and hold Bitcoin, with the explicit goal of benefiting from its long-term appreciation. The company asserts that Bitcoin, as the preeminent cryptocurrency, offers a robust store of value and substantial growth potential within the rapidly expanding global financial ecosystem. While many corporations are exploring digital asset investment , few make it their central business model. USBC’s decision to center its entire financial strategy around Bitcoin underscores a profound conviction in the cryptocurrency’s future trajectory. This direct approach could offer shareholders unique exposure to the digital economy without the complexities often associated with direct technological development or product commercialization. Key potential benefits of this strategy include: Exposure to a High-Growth Asset: Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant growth potential, offering a pathway for substantial returns. Inflation Hedge Potential: Many view Bitcoin as a hedge against traditional fiat currency inflation, providing a diversified asset class. Simplified Operations: Shifting from complex R&D and product cycles to asset management can streamline operations. Implications of this Corporate Strategy Shift The corporate strategy shift from a healthcare technology firm to a dedicated Bitcoin investment entity carries significant and far-reaching implications. For existing shareholders of Know Labs, their investment now directly correlates with the performance of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market, rather than the success of specific diagnostic technologies. This change fundamentally alters the risk profile and potential returns for investors, introducing a new level of market volatility. Moreover, this bold move could establish a precedent for other companies contemplating similar pivots in their business models. It clearly demonstrates a willingness to adapt and embrace emerging financial paradigms. However, it also introduces inherent challenges, as the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate dramatically. USBC will need to navigate these market dynamics with astute risk management and a clear long-term vision. Potential challenges include: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which could lead to significant fluctuations in USBC’s asset value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential risks. Public Perception: Shifting from a socially impactful tech to pure investment might affect public and investor perception. Know Labs Transformation: A New Era Unfolds The Know Labs transformation into USBC represents much more than a mere name change; it signifies a fundamental redefinition of its entire business model and purpose. This decisive move positions USBC squarely within the burgeoning digital asset economy, moving entirely away from its origins in healthcare innovation. It showcases a company willing to shed its past identity to pursue what it perceives as a more promising and profitable financial future. This transformation reflects a broader, accelerating trend where companies across various sectors are increasingly recognizing the immense potential of cryptocurrencies. It’s a compelling testament to the growing mainstream acceptance and burgeoning institutional interest in digital assets like Bitcoin. USBC’s journey from a diagnostic platform to a Bitcoin-focused investment firm is undoubtedly a unique and compelling case study in corporate adaptation and strategic foresight in the digital age. This evolution underscores the dynamic nature of modern business and finance. In conclusion, the rebranding of Know Labs to USBC and its adoption of a dedicated Bitcoin investment strategy marks a truly pivotal moment in corporate history. This bold corporate strategy shift into digital asset investment highlights the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and powerful asset class. While it introduces a new set of risks and challenges inherent to the crypto market, it simultaneously opens up exciting opportunities for significant growth in a rapidly evolving financial world. USBC’s future will now be intricately linked to the performance and trajectory of Bitcoin, making it a compelling case study for corporate adaptation and innovation in the digital age. This strategic move could inspire other companies to reconsider their own paths. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What was Know Labs’ original business focus?

Daily liquidations exceeded $963M as market reacted to policy uncertainty. Despite clarification, Bitcoin has yet to recover to its earlier all-time high. Treasury Minister’s Remarks Spark Bitcoin Sell-Off On the evening of August 14, 2025, Bitcoin’s price suddenly dropped from $123,800 to $117,180 after comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. In an interview with Fox Business, Bessent stated: “We’ve also started — to get into the 21st Century — a bitcoin strategic reserve. We’re not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up. We’re going to stop selling that.” Initially, this declaration signaled a halt in government Bitcoin accumulation, fueling panic and a sharp correction. At the time of writing, Bitcoin remains just below $119,000, with the all-time high above $124,000 reached earlier that night. When asked if initiatives like the Bitcoin reserve and gold revaluation were part of a sovereign fund plan, Bessent responded: “These are all great, original ideas. But they require the infrastructure to be built for legalization and oversight. However, it is the right step in terms of securing a future for the next generation.” Liquidation Wave and Market Sentiment Triggered by Bessent’s statements, the daily volume of liquidations exceeded $963 million, mainly affecting leveraged positions in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Market capitalization for Bitcoin fell from $2.48 trillion to $2.33 trillion, per TradingView. The crypto community also linked this turbulence to the resignation of Bo Hines, the head of the Presidential Working Group on Crypto Assets, deepening concerns about sector leadership. Treasury Walks Back Statement, Market Remains Shaken After backlash, Bessent issued a follow-up statement clarifying that the US Treasury seeks “budget-neutral” options for reserve growth, not direct purchases from the Treasury. Community members joked that “someone whispered” to the minister about the fallout, while others saw the shifting stance as evasion of responsibility. As one commentator noted: “It’s all out in the open now. The government doesn’t care about Bitcoin. They just want to line the pockets of insiders.” Braiins CEO Eli Nagar expressed frustration, remarking the agency was still “looking for ways,” and describing it as an attempt to shirk responsibility.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-15 13:59:27

Source: Coinmarketcap Kain Warwick launched Synthetix in September 2017 under Havven (HAV). The HAV Airdrop Campaign ran between 4 and 14 February 2018 and offered two million tokens for around $1 million. On November 30, 2018, Synthetic announced its rebranding from Havven. This included renaming its native token, HAV (Havven token), to SNX. The contract address did not change. It registered its lowest price at $0.03258 on January 5, 2019. Different from most mega-altcoins, SNX did not rally after launch; it consistently traded below $0.5 until the last quarter of 2019. In 2020, it made a mega rally to $7.3. In the 2021 bull cycle, it shot higher, and on February 14, it registered its all-time high at $28.77. It reversed to $5 in July before pumping again to $15 in September. In the 2022 crypto winter, SNX shed most of its value as it retreated to the $2 mark by the end of the year. In 2023, it consistently traded between $1.5 and $3 until the last quarter, when it had its break. In March 2024, SNX reached a high of $5; in July, SNX came down from the $2.01 to $1.65 range. In August 2024, the SNX token’s price dipped as low as $1.20, and September saw a maximum price of $1.71. In October 2024, SNX dipped and became rangebound. It closed the month with a $1.31 price tag, while December saw a stream of improved prices with a peak price of $3.38. During the remainder of December, SNX kept shedding its value, and it entered 2025 with a wave of correction to $1.90. The average price of the SNX token was 1.74 in January and has since corrected to $1.20 in February. In March, SNX price declined to $0.89, and in April it further descended to the $0.77 range. In May 2025, it saw some recovery to $0.926, improving its market capitalization, and in July, the token peaked at $0.781. At the start of August, SNX is trending near $0.56, as the current Synthetix sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,SNX|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|BNB|ETH|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-15 14:00:00

Reports from Whale Alert confirmed that a substantial 44,431 ETH, valued at approximately $205 million, moved from an unknown wallet directly to Coinbase Institutional . This substantial crypto whale transaction immediately sparked discussions about its potential implications for the Ethereum price and the broader landscape of institutional crypto adoption. What does such a significant movement truly signify for the market? What Just Happened? Decoding This Major ETH Transfer The cryptocurrency tracking service, Whale Alert, precisely pinpointed the transfer of 44,431 ETH. This large sum originated from a wallet tagged as “unknown,” meaning its owner’s identity is not publicly linked to a known entity or exchange. The destination was clearly identified as Coinbase Institutional, a specialized platform designed for large-scale corporate and institutional investors. Such a considerable ETH transfer , worth over two hundred million dollars, is not an everyday occurrence. It immediately draws attention from market analysts and participants alike. Understanding the nature of the sender and receiver is crucial to interpreting the potential impact of this event. Unknown Wallet: This term often refers to a wallet whose owner hasn’t been publicly identified or associated with a major exchange or service. It could belong to an individual whale, a private fund, or even an early investor. Coinbase Institutional: This is Coinbase’s dedicated arm for institutional clients, offering advanced trading tools, custody solutions, and prime brokerage services. Transfers to such platforms often suggest strategic financial moves rather than speculative retail trading. Why Does a Crypto Whale Transaction Matter? When a “crypto whale” — an individual or entity holding a massive amount of cryptocurrency — makes a significant move, the market often pays close attention. These large transactions can influence market sentiment and potentially affect asset prices. This particular crypto whale transaction to Coinbase Institutional raises several questions. One primary concern is whether such a large deposit to an exchange could signal an impending sale, which might exert downward pressure on the Ethereum price . However, the destination being Coinbase Institutional suggests other possibilities beyond a simple market dump. Often, large deposits to institutional platforms are for purposes like: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Whales might use institutional desks to execute large trades without directly impacting public exchange order books. This helps prevent significant price slippage. Custody Solutions: The ETH could be moving into secure, regulated custody for long-term holding by an institution or high-net-worth individual. Rebalancing Portfolios: Large funds frequently rebalance their asset allocations, and this transfer could be part of a broader strategy. Therefore, while the sheer size of the ETH transfer is notable, its implications are not always straightforward selling pressure. Is This a Sign of Growing Institutional Crypto Adoption? The transfer specifically to Coinbase Institutional is a key detail. It highlights the increasing role of professional financial entities in the crypto space. The demand for robust, compliant, and secure services for managing large crypto holdings continues to grow, underpinning the rise of platforms like Coinbase Institutional. This event could certainly be viewed as another piece of evidence pointing towards strengthening institutional crypto adoption. As more traditional financial players, corporations, and large funds enter the market, they often prefer regulated and secure avenues like institutional exchanges and custodians. Moreover, the continuous flow of capital into these institutional channels suggests a maturing market. These entities typically conduct extensive due diligence before committing significant capital, implying a long-term perspective on digital assets like Ethereum. What Could Be Next for Ethereum Price and the Market? Predicting the exact impact on Ethereum price following such a large ETH transfer is challenging. While some might fear a sell-off, the institutional nature of the receiving wallet suggests a more strategic purpose. Investors and analysts will closely monitor market movements for any signs of the ETH being sold or moved further. Ultimately, this transaction reinforces the growing importance of institutional crypto in shaping the market narrative. Their involvement often brings increased liquidity, stability, and legitimacy to the digital asset ecosystem. The long-term trend appears to be one of increasing institutional engagement. It is always advisable for market participants to conduct their own research and consider multiple perspectives when interpreting large whale movements. These transfers are often just one piece of a much larger, complex market puzzle. Key Takeaways: A significant 44,431 ETH moved to Coinbase Institutional. This crypto whale transaction highlights ongoing large-scale market activity. The destination suggests potential OTC deals or secure custody, not necessarily an immediate sell-off. It underscores the continuous growth in institutional crypto interest and adoption. Market watchers will monitor the Ethereum price for any subsequent movements or impacts. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market, where large players continue to make their presence felt, influencing trends and perceptions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a crypto whale transaction? A crypto whale transaction refers to the movement of a very large amount of cryptocurrency by an individual or entity (a “whale”) who holds significant digital assets. These transactions are closely watched due to their potential to influence market sentiment and prices. Q2: What is Coinbase Institutional? Coinbase Institutional is a specialized platform provided by Coinbase for institutional clients. It offers advanced trading, custody, and prime brokerage services tailored for large corporations, hedge funds, and other professional investors. Q3: Does a large ETH transfer always mean a price drop? Not necessarily. While a large transfer to an exchange can signal an intent to sell, a transfer to an institutional platform like Coinbase Institutional might indicate other strategic moves, such as OTC deals, secure custody, or portfolio rebalancing, which do not always lead to immediate selling pressure. Q4: How does institutional crypto adoption affect the market? Increased institutional crypto adoption generally brings greater legitimacy, liquidity, and stability to the cryptocurrency market. Institutions often conduct thorough due diligence, and their long-term involvement can foster market maturity and confidence. Did you find this analysis of the ETH transfer insightful?

While bearish pressure is building, indicators such as Bitcoin’s supply dynamics are providing insights about the current state of the market and investors’ sentiment. What Bitcoin Supply Data Says About The Market Bitcoin’s price has fallen sharply after reaching a new all-time high on Thursday, which has sparked speculation about the current state of the market. Amidst the growing speculations, Boris, a crypto trader and on-chain expert, has provided a detailed analysis of the current state of BTC’s market, using the supply dynamics. Bitcoin supply patterns are currently painting a vivid picture of investor behavior, accumulation tendencies, and possible price direction, as well as the market’s health . Boris’ examination of the supply dynamics hinges on the behavior of long-term holders and short-term holders. As Bitcoin rose to its all-time high, supply dynamics revealed a stark divergence between these different groups of investors. Presently, long-term BTC holders are steadily offloading their holdings while short-term BTC holders are persistently accumulating the asset at a rapid rate. This divergence in sentiment between the groups indicates that the market is currently in a post-all-time high stress test. A post-all-time high stress test reflects a phase where the boundaries of market resiliency and investor belief are being tested. With short-term holders holding strong and long-term traders responding aggressively to price fluctuations, the present phase is determining whether BTC can maintain its value and momentum following the recent high. Data shows that long-term holders’ supply saw a drop from 15.50 million BTC to 15.28 million BTC, which is an indication of profit-taking. Meanwhile, the supply of short-term holders rose from 4.38 million BTC to 4.61 million BTC, suggesting that the cohort is capitalizing on recent rallies . According to the on-chain expert, this change demonstrates that STHs followed the trend and increased risk, while LTHs responded to the rally with sales. After a short period, Bitcoin’s price quickly fell back from about $124,000, putting late buyers through a stress test. Furthermore, Boris noted that the final wave exhibits a classic market pattern where experienced holders limit their exposure and short-term holders accumulate close to the top. Such a development typically signals a loss of momentum. Short-Term BTC Holders Are Showing Strength A recent research from Glassnode, a leading on-chain data analytics firm, has also revealed an underlying strength among short-term BTC holders. The platform’s research is solely focused on the Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Indicator . Specifically, this key metric tracks whether new investors are selling at a profit or loss. As BTC’s price surges, the metric temporarily dipped below neutral levels, but quickly recovered and rose above neutral. This move, according to Glassnode, shows limited realized losses and indicates that new Bitcoin investors are prepared to protect their cost basis, which is currently close to $112,000.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Indicator|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|Bitcoin Supply Dynamics|Boris|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Glassnode,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 14:00:21

The milestone sparked excitement among bulls, but also renewed caution among analysts who warn that slowing momentum could signal a potential market cycle top. Some see the recent hesitation as a sign that buyers may be losing steam at these elevated levels. Related Reading: TRON Long-Term Holders See Massive Gains As TRX Pushes Toward Multi-Year Highs Despite the growing bearish speculation, on-chain data from CryptoQuant offers a more optimistic perspective. The Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR-7d) has climbed to 1.04 with Bitcoin trading near $119,000. This reading means that, on average, short-term holders are selling their coins at a profit — yet the market is successfully absorbing this selling pressure without triggering a sharp correction. Historically, maintaining SOPR above the 1.00–1.02 range, with pullbacks to unity quickly bought up, has supported continued uptrends. While the current amplitude is still below the overheated peaks of past cycles, the data suggests that profit-taking remains moderate. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether BTC can overcome its current resistance zone or if it will face a deeper retracement before attempting another push higher. Moderate Selling Pressure Hits Bitcoin According to top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH SOPR-7d) remains in a healthy range, with amplitude still moderate and well below the peaks of 1.06–1.09 seen in previous bullish waves. This indicates that selling pressure from short-term holders is not extreme, even as BTC trades near its all-time highs. Adler notes that the bullish scenario hinges on maintaining the SOPR-7d above 1.00–1.02, as values above unity mean that short-term holders are, on average, selling at a profit — and the market is absorbing that supply without triggering a larger sell-off. Ideally, brief pullbacks toward 1.00 should be met with strong buying interest, as quick rebounds from unity historically confirm robust demand. However, the analyst cautions that if SOPR dips below 1.0 and stays there, it would signal weakening demand. This shift would increase the probability of a deeper market correction, as it implies that coins are being sold at a loss and buyers are not stepping in aggressively enough to absorb them. The coming days will be pivotal for Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. Many analysts see BTC pushing decisively above $125,000 as the next major breakout level. Others, however, remain cautious, expecting the market to face a sharp retracement before resuming its upward trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Hits 2-Year Low As 30-Day Range Tightens Bitcoin Tests Resistance After Sharp Rejection from New Highs Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the cryptocurrency recently tested a new all-time high near $124,000 before facing swift rejection, pulling back to current levels around $118,777. This drop marks a failure to sustain momentum above the crucial $123,217 resistance zone, highlighted in yellow on the chart. Despite the rejection, BTC remains well-supported above the 50-day moving average (blue), currently near $115,194. This level has consistently acted as a dynamic support during the 2025 uptrend. The 100-day MA (green) at $110,456 and the 200-day MA (red) at $100,144 remain far below, underscoring the strength of the broader bullish structure. Related Reading: Ethereum 30-Day Netflow Average Deepens Negative: Buyers Dominate Market The consolidation below resistance reflects a market pausing to digest recent gains. For bulls, reclaiming $123,217 and closing above $124,000 would signal renewed momentum and could open the path toward $125,000 and beyond. A break below the 50-day MA could trigger a deeper pullback, with the 100-day MA as the next support.

These aren’t major meme tokens such as Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, but rather brand-new coins that are currently going through presales: Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), Maxi Doge (MAXI), Snorter (SNORT) and TOKEN6900 (T6900). Each of these projects has already raised eye-watering amounts, and their momentum suggests explosive potential once they hit major exchanges. With the right timing, even a small investment in these tokens could be enough to ride a 1000x wave – turning just $1,000 into a life-changing $1 million . 4 Meme Coins to Turn $1,000 into $1 Million Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) A layer-two network for Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has raised $9.6 million in its ongoing presale, while it has also accumulated more than 18,000 followers on X . Fire up your Rockets. $HYPER just raised 9M. https://t.co/VNG0P4GuDo pic.twitter.com/zMNGUW6VqS — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) August 13, 2025 Of all the meme coins currently holding presales, it boasts the strongest fundamentals, given that its L2 platform will make using Bitcoin cheaper and faster for users. Its network will operate using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and will also harness zero-knowledge proofs, giving it a level of speed and security that should make it one of the fastest L2s around. Long term, its aim is to build a DeFi and Web3 ecosystem that will harness the enormous value of the Bitcoin network, which continues to fall short of its potential as a result of sticking to a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Its native token, HYPER, will have a max supply of 21 billion, while holders will be able to stake it for a regular income. Newcomers can buy it now as part of its presale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . It’s currently selling at $0.012725, but this price will rise again tomorrow. Click Here to Participate in the Presale Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Adding to this list of bullish meme coins is Maxi Doge (MAXI), an ERC-20 token that has taken the Dogecoin formula and turned it up to 11. It has now raised almost $1 million in its presale, which it opened only a couple of weeks ago. Caught the candle, escaped the matrix. pic.twitter.com/26d1sRTYO5 — MaxiDoge (@MaxiDoge_) August 13, 2025 This is an encouraging sign of its growth potential, with Maxi Doge’s edgy persona and marketing helping to win over converts quickly. While it is a meme coin at heart, it’s also planning to develop a community around aggressive, bullish trading. To this end, it has opened channels on Telegram and Discord on which its community will operate, and on which it will set community members regular challenges and contests. Winners of such contests will receive rewards and rank on an international leaderboard, motivating participation and engagement. Maxi Doge will also maintain a fund – equal to 25% of its total supply (150.24 billion MAXI) – that it will use to foster partnerships and promote itself. Combined with its community, this should help spread awareness of the coin, helping to boost its price over time. You can join its sale by going to the Maxi Doge website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as MetaMask or Best Wallet. MAXI now costs $0.000252, although this will continue to rise at intervals for as long as the sale lasts. Click Here to Participate in the Presale TOKEN6900 ($T6900) Taking its cue from the hugely successful SPX6900, TOKEN6900 (T6900) is an Ethereum-based coin that takes its memes from the dot-com bubble of the late 90s and early 2000s. It has now raised an impressive $2 million in its hugely popular sale, which will now end in 13 days. In contrast to meme coins that aim to offer some utility, TOKEN6900 unashamedly makes a virtue out of having no fundamentals. 2mill69hunnid $2M raised. 14 days left. pic.twitter.com/48gCM8JLzX — Token6900 (@Token_6900) August 14, 2025 As it writes on its website, the coin is “Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” It marries this philosophy to a proactive marketing campaign on X and other social media platforms, creating a viral sense of hype and FOMO that has helped its presale to grow. With a max supply of 930,993,091 T6900, it token will offer no particular utility, although holders will be able to stake the coin, earning an income on top of any price gains. While its presale will close within two weeks, latecomers can still join at the TOKEN6900 website . It’s selling at its final presale price of $0.006975, although the success of its sale would suggest that it could rise much higher than this soon. Click Here to Participate in the Presale Snorter ($SNORT) Rounding out this list of the best new meme coins to buy now is Snorter (SNORT), a Solana- and Ethereum-based coin that also doubles as a trading bot. It has raised $2.6 million in its ongoing presale, while it also reaches more than 14,000 followers on X . These are hugely positive numbers, and the reason why Snorter has been able to do so well is that investors are bullish for its trading bot. In particular, it will be an automated sniping bot, making trades on behalf of users just before a targeted coin surges. This will help users to stay ahead of whales and the wider market, while other features include copy trading, limit orders, atomic swaps, and protection against rugpulls. It promises to be one of the most comprehensive trading bots on the market once it launches, with SNORT necessary to pay for access. As such, SNORT could experience considerable demand once it launches, with investors able to buy it now at the official Snorter website .

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $117,987.07 on the Binance USDT market. This movement has certainly caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting many to question the underlying reasons for this shift in the cryptocurrency market . What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? When Bitcoin sees a significant price movement, especially a decline, several factors often contribute. This particular Bitcoin price drop could be influenced by a combination of macroeconomic trends and specific crypto-related developments. It is crucial to understand these elements for a comprehensive BTC price analysis . Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, such as inflation concerns or changes in interest rates by central banks, can lead investors to pull funds from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Scrutiny: News or rumors of increased regulatory oversight in major markets can sometimes cause apprehension among investors, leading to selling pressure. Large Liquidations: Significant sell-offs by large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can trigger cascading liquidations across exchanges, accelerating a price decline. Market Sentiment: Negative news or a general shift in investor confidence can quickly spread, influencing trading decisions and contributing to overall crypto price volatility . Understanding the Dynamics of Crypto Price Volatility The cryptocurrency market is known for its dynamic nature, and crypto price volatility is a characteristic that both excites and challenges investors. A Bitcoin price drop like this, while concerning to some, is not entirely uncommon in this space. Unlike traditional markets, crypto can react more sharply to news and sentiment due to its relatively smaller market capitalization and 24/7 trading. For a thorough Bitcoin market update , it is important to look at both technical indicators and fundamental news. Technical analysis involves studying price charts to identify patterns and predict future movements, while fundamental analysis looks at the underlying value and external factors affecting the asset. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Landscape: What Should Investors Do? During periods of a Bitcoin price drop , making informed decisions is paramount. Panic selling often leads to losses, while a strategic approach can help mitigate risks and even uncover opportunities. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Rely on reputable news sources and analytical platforms for accurate information. Avoid reacting to unverified rumors. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your risk tolerance and ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your long-term financial goals. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy can help average out your purchase price over time, especially during periods of crypto price volatility . Focus on Long-Term Potential: Many long-term investors view dips as opportunities to accumulate more assets at a lower price, believing in Bitcoin’s future growth. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price? A Look Ahead Predicting the exact trajectory of Bitcoin’s price is challenging, but historical patterns suggest that market corrections are a natural part of its growth cycle. Following this Bitcoin price drop , the market will likely consolidate before potentially finding new support levels or resuming an upward trend. Factors such as upcoming halving events, institutional adoption, and technological advancements continue to shape Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Many experts believe that despite short-term fluctuations, Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition as a decentralized, scarce digital asset remains strong. A comprehensive Bitcoin market update will always consider these underlying strengths alongside immediate price movements. In conclusion, while the recent Bitcoin price drop below $118,000 may seem unsettling, it is a reminder of the inherent crypto price volatility within the digital asset space. Understanding the contributing factors, practicing prudent investment strategies, and staying informed are key to navigating these market dynamics successfully. This period presents both challenges and potential opportunities for those who approach the market with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin fall below $118,000? A1: Bitcoin’s recent fall below $118,000 is likely due to a combination of macroeconomic concerns, potential regulatory news, large liquidations by significant holders, and shifts in overall market sentiment leading to increased selling pressure. Q2: Is this Bitcoin price drop a good time to buy? A2: A price drop can be seen as a buying opportunity for some long-term investors, especially if they believe in Bitcoin’s future potential. However, it’s crucial to conduct your own research, understand your risk tolerance, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging. Q3: How does market sentiment affect BTC price? A3: Market sentiment plays a significant role in BTC price movements. Positive news or widespread optimism can drive prices up, while negative news or fear can lead to selling pressure and a Bitcoin price drop . Social media and news cycles can amplify these sentiments. Q4: What is crypto price volatility? A4: Crypto price volatility refers to the rapid and often unpredictable changes in the price of cryptocurrencies. This characteristic is influenced by factors like market size, liquidity, news events, and speculative trading, making prices fluctuate more than traditional assets. Q5: Where can I get reliable Bitcoin market updates?

The forecast is based on a cup-and-handle formation visible on XRP’s two-week chart, with many traders viewing this pattern as a bullish continuation signal when confirmed. XRP’s Cup and Handle Pattern The chart, posted on X, tracks XRP’s price movements from 2020 through 2025 and highlights a gradual recovery after the asset’s decline from its 2021 peak of $1.96. The asset began forming the cup as it declined from this level, and the chart shows a rounded bottom from 2021 into late 2024. In late 2024, veteran trader Peter Brandt predicted a massive move if the asset could breach $1.96 , and that run peaked at $3.39, marking a multi-year high and completing the cup formation. Following this massive breakout, the asset entered a consolidation phase, dropping below $3 in early February and remaining below that level for months. This consolidation phase formed the handle, and XRP’s breakout in July validated this multi-year pattern. The asset rose to a new all-time high of $3.65 in mid-July , and Steph suggests this confirmation has set XRP on the path to $30. The price target of this #XRP cup & handle pattern is $30! pic.twitter.com/WD5EjVdMsl — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 14, 2025 Technical Significance of the $3.5 Level From a technical standpoint, the cup-and-handle pattern is typically interpreted as a sign of renewed bullish sentiment after a prolonged accumulation period. In this case, the rounded base spans several years, adding weight to the potential move if the pattern plays out fully. The recent breakout above a multi-year trendline, shown in the chart as a dotted diagonal, is another factor reinforcing the bullish projection. While the asset’s all-time high of $3.65 is a crucial level that could open doors to double-digit prices , Steph’s chart also highlights $3.5 as a notable resistance for the cup and handle formation. The asset is currently trading at $3.08 and will need to regain the $3.5 level to ensure the surge to $30 happens. While chart patterns do not guarantee outcomes, traders often monitor them closely for directional bias. The magnitude of this particular $30 target would represent a significant gain, and many analysts have shared bullish short-term expectations for the asset, reinforcing the belief that something big is coming.

A recent statement, attributed to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins by Cointelegraph on X, highlights a pivotal aspect of its future: the agency’s capacity for SEC blockchain regulation without needing new laws from Congress. This assertion signals a significant direction for the industry. Understanding the SEC’s Stance on SEC Blockchain Regulation Paul Atkins, as quoted, articulated a clear position for the SEC. He stated that the agency possesses the inherent authority to craft and enforce rules for blockchain-related activities. This perspective suggests that the existing framework of securities laws is sufficiently robust to cover novel digital assets. The implication is profound. It means the agency does not believe it must wait for specific congressional legislation. Instead, it can proceed with its regulatory agenda based on its current mandate. This approach could accelerate the pace of crypto regulation in the United States. The Path to Crypto Regulation Without Congressional Delays What are the potential benefits of this independent stance? Primarily, it could lead to quicker clarity for market participants. The digital asset space often grapples with regulatory uncertainty, which can hinder innovation and investment. By leveraging existing US SEC authority , the agency might: Provide much-needed guidance on what constitutes a security in the blockchain realm. Establish clear rules for token offerings and trading platforms. Enhance investor protection against fraud and manipulation more rapidly. This proactive approach aims to bring stability to a volatile market. It underscores the SEC’s view that blockchain technology, while innovative, operates within existing legal boundaries. Navigating Digital Asset Rules: Challenges and Industry Impact However, this path is not without its complexities. The industry often argues that applying traditional securities laws to decentralized technologies presents unique challenges. Critics suggest that existing frameworks may not fully accommodate the nuances of blockchain. Key challenges include: Defining decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and their legal status. Classifying various tokens, from utility tokens to stablecoins, under current laws. Addressing jurisdictional issues for global blockchain networks. Consequently, this assertion of independent digital asset rules could lead to increased enforcement actions. It might also trigger more legal battles between the SEC and crypto companies. The industry seeks tailored legislation, arguing that a “one-size-fits-all” approach may stifle innovation. What Does This Mean for Future Blockchain Policy? The SEC’s position on blockchain policy signals its readiness to act decisively. This firm stance indicates a continued focus on investor protection and market integrity within the digital asset ecosystem. It reinforces the idea that innovation should not come at the expense of regulatory oversight. For participants in the crypto space, understanding this perspective is crucial. It means: Expect continued scrutiny from the SEC. Prepare for potential new guidance or enforcement actions based on existing laws. Prioritize compliance with current securities regulations, even as the technology evolves. Ultimately, the agency’s belief in its inherent authority shapes the trajectory of digital asset regulation in the U.S. The statement from SEC Chairman Paul Atkins underscores a significant regulatory philosophy: the SEC feels equipped to manage SEC blockchain regulation using its current powers. This approach could bring faster clarity to the crypto market, yet it also presents challenges for an industry seeking bespoke legislative solutions. Navigating this landscape requires careful attention to evolving guidance and a commitment to compliance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does SEC Chairman Paul Atkins’ statement mean for blockchain regulation? A1: It means the SEC believes it has existing authority to regulate blockchain activities and digital assets under current securities laws, without needing new legislation from Congress. Q2: Why does the SEC believe it can regulate without Congress? A2: The SEC asserts that its current mandate and existing securities laws are broad enough to cover novel financial instruments and activities, including those involving blockchain technology. Q3: What are the potential benefits of the SEC regulating blockchain independently? A3: This approach could lead to faster regulatory clarity for the crypto market, enhanced investor protection, and quicker establishment of rules for digital asset offerings and trading. Q4: What challenges might arise from the SEC’s independent regulation of digital assets? A4: Challenges include potential legal disputes with the industry, arguments that existing laws don’t fit decentralized tech, and concerns that this approach might stifle innovation if not carefully applied. Q5: How might this impact crypto companies and investors? A5: Crypto companies may face increased scrutiny and enforcement actions based on existing laws, while investors could see clearer guidelines and potentially enhanced protections in the digital asset space.

Despite hotter-than-expected U.S. PPI data, investor sentiment remains risk-on, driven by speculation that interest rate cuts could begin as soon as September. That backdrop is fueling renewed retail momentum for SOL, with the altcoin showing signs of decoupling from macro headwinds. With technicals turning increasingly bullish, the near-term Solana price prediction now puts $500 well within reach – possibly in just two weeks. Both Polymarket and Fedwatch still expect rate cuts in September. This was simply a liquidity flush. A massive bounce is inevitable! pic.twitter.com/GfDJfjUvuM — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) August 14, 2025 The 5% dip during Thursday trading has largely been dismissed as a shakeout of weak hands rather than a sell-the-news event, keeping the path open for continuation. New Buyers and Smart Money Fuel Solana Rally According to Glassnode data , recent retail demand appears to be driven by new buyers entering the market. The number of new addresses participating in SOL transactions for the first time is up 51% since August 3, suggesting Solana is the play of choice amid a fresh wave of retail liquidity.

Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Hit $500 in 2 Weeks? The Daily RSI supports further upside, with the rally yet to hit the overbought threshold at 70, typically the point where bull runs stall as buyers exhaust. SOL / USDT 1-day chart, ascending triangle pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Since the PPI-driven drawback, the RSI has cooled to 60, an even stronger floor for another push. The MACD tells a similar story, continuing to widen its lead above the signal line, a sign that bullishness remains the driving force as the uptrend holds with conviction. Still, should the sell-off continue, $175 is the next Solana price floor for a potential reversal. The $207 level remains the key breakout threshold, acting as the ceiling of an ascending triangle that has been forming since the mid-April market bottom. A flip of $207 into support would open a clean path for Solana to reclaim its $300 all-time high , with little historical resistance overhead. If fully realized, the breakout could propel the Solana price to $500 , a potential 183% gain from current prices. However, such a move is a long shot within the next two weeks, with the interest rate cut decision still 33 days away, marking the next major demand catalyst. That $500 target becomes far more plausible as the bull market matures, particularly with untapped TradFi demand through potential 401(k) inclusion and a spot SOL ETF approval.

Since returning to the White House in January 2025, President Donald Trump has made it clear that he wants the United States to dominate the global crypto market. His administration has already taken major steps toward that goal by appointing crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC Chair, creating a national Bitcoin reserve , and reversing restrictive digital asset rules from the previous administration.SEC Chair Atkins Affirms Mission to Make America the Global Crypto CapitalThe latest step so far is ""Project Crypto,"" an initiative from the SEC looking to modernize digital asset regulation. This week, Atkins appeared on FOX Business' Mornings with Maria to discuss the plan and explain how the agency will help turn Trump's pro-crypto vision into reality.Atkins said the push gained momentum after the President's Working Group on digital assets released its latest report . The group, which includes the SEC, presented specific actions to make the U.S. the world's crypto capital and ensure that global blockchain adoption relies on American innovation. SEC Chair Atkins on FOX Business SEC Chair Atkins on FOX Business Importantly, the SEC Chair explained that the agency is mobilizing every division, including corporation finance and investment management, to get the job done. Notably, the SEC is updating regulations to include the crypto sector while working with Congress on new legislation. Atkins pointed to the recent signing of the GENIUS Act at the White House as an important milestone and noted that several other crypto-friendly bills will be back on the table once lawmakers return from recess.Project Crypto and the SEC's Pro-Crypto StanceFor the uninitiated, Project Crypto seeks to remove uncertainty in the digital asset sector by creating clear rules for token distribution, custody, and trading. It narrows the scope of securities laws for crypto, meaning most digital assets would no longer be treated as securities.The plan focuses on five priorities: defining clear classifications for crypto assets, giving investors freedom to choose their custody and trading options, supporting all-in-one ""super-app"" trading platforms, boosting on-chain innovation and DeFi, and introducing fast-track approvals for new products. The SEC also plans to work with other regulators, like the CFTC, to cut overlapping rules. In addition, they seek to strengthen competition and attract crypto businesses back to U.S. soil.Atkins confirmed that the agency will use both formal rule changes and targeted exemptions to update outdated securities laws. Specifically, the goal is to get the right balance between protecting investors and encouraging the growth of decentralized finance.Notably, his FOX Business interview builds on a series of pro-crypto statements he's made this year. In April, during the Crypto Custody Roundtable, Atkins criticized the old ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0"" approach for leaving the U.S. with too few crypto custody options. Meanwhile, three months back at the ""SEC Speaks"" event, he highlighted the importance of ""super-apps"" that can handle both securities and non-securities under a single license. Last month, Atkins claimed that the U.S. government has placed a stamp of approval on crypto.",Market|Latest SEC Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-08-15 15:05:41

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-holders-definitely-deserve-to-make-money-heres-why/,"Popular market analyst XRPunkie believes the patience of long-term XRP holders is about to be rewarded. In a recent post on X, he noted that XRP has been trapped in a sideways trading range for the past 256 days—roughly eight and a half months—but insists that this prolonged consolidation is simply the calm before the storm. According to him, those who held firm without panic selling “definitely deserve to make money,” as the next major rally could drive XRP into the $10–$15 range. This isn’t the first time XRPunkie has projected a significant breakout. His recent chart analyses suggest that the current price action is a textbook consolidation pattern within a larger bullish trend, laying the groundwork for a sharp upward leg once market momentum returns. $XRP has been in the sideways range for the last 256 days. If you've been sitting throughout the last 8.5 months, didn't panic sell & totally unfazed, U definitely deserve to make money. We should be commencing our next leg up soon. $10-$15 pic.twitter.com/XSXdxHTWoJ — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) August 15, 2025 Understanding the 256-Day Sideways Range The consolidation phase began in early December 2024, with XRP trading within a relatively tight band. Over the past several months, the cryptocurrency has repeatedly tested resistance between $3.15 and $3.40, while finding support in the low-$3 range. This coiling price structure aligns with technical theories that prolonged sideways action often precedes explosive moves in either direction. Key Catalysts Supporting the Bullish Case Two major developments bolster XRP’s long-term outlook. First, Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been resolved. The case concluded with a $125 million penalty and both parties dropping their appeals , leaving Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling intact: institutional XRP sales can be classified as securities offerings, but secondary-market sales are not. This legal clarity removes a cloud that had hovered over XRP for years. Second, Ripple’s December 2024 launch of RLUSD , a dollar-backed enterprise-grade stablecoin, strengthens the XRP Ledger’s utility. Designed to function seamlessly alongside Ethereum, RLUSD is expected to expand Ripple’s market presence, boost on-chain liquidity, and attract more institutional participants to the ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Levels to Watch As of report time, XRP remains in the low-$3 range, with traders eyeing $3.30–$3.40 as the breakout zone. A decisive close above this resistance could signal the start of the anticipated rally toward double-digit territory. On the downside, $3.00 serves as immediate support, with $2.80–$2.60 as secondary cushions if selling pressure intensifies. XRPunkie’s $10–$15 price target is ambitious but rooted in a combination of technical analysis, legal clarity, and product innovation. While no forecast is guaranteed, the prolonged consolidation, improved regulatory standing, and growing utility of the XRP Ledger create conditions that could favor a major upside breakout. For those who have remained patient throughout the past 256 days, the stage may finally be set for the move they’ve been waiting for.

Calling out this development, renowned market analyst Ali Martinez pointed out , “120 million XRP bought up by whales on the dip.” At the current price of $3.10, the 120 million XRP are worth a whopping $372 million, suggesting that whale confidence in the altcoin remains rock solid. Meanwhile, in a swift market jolt, XRP whales scooped up roughly 900M tokens in just 48 hours this week, a buying spree first flagged by Martinez. Therefore, these analyses by Martinez indicate that whales are continuously seizing the dip, a move that often signals strong confidence in the asset’s future. XRP Army Buzzes After SWIFT Executive Reacts to Ripple’s $200M Rail Acquisition The XRP Army has erupted after a senior SWIFT official appeared to publicly acknowledge Ripple’s strategic momentum following its reported $200 million agreement to acquire stablecoin-payments platform Rail, a deal that’s already reshaping the narrative around cross-border rails and stablecoin settlement. A LinkedIn conversation revealed by crypto researcher SMQKE sent sentiment soaring when Franz Steinbeib called the Rail purchase 'Ripple’s $200M Checkmate.' SWIFT’s Chief Innovation Officer Tom Zschach replied, 'Another “checkmate” moment,' noting the payments race is 'nowhere near over' and 'just got a little more crowded,' a brief remark that triggered optimism. Many in the XRP camp saw Zschach’s words as grudging recognition. Analysts and social posts highlighted the exchange as proof that incumbents are monitoring Ripple, with the Rail deal accelerating its ability to connect stablecoins to bank-grade payout rails. Supporters say the acquisition strengthens Ripple’s stack, linking RLUSD and Liquidity solutions to infrastructure banks and corporate trust. On the other hand, skeptics read sarcasm in Zschach’s 'another' remark, noting SWIFT emphasized rivalry and regulatory oversight. Nevertheless, the split reaction highlights a broader truth that competition between legacy networks and blockchain-native firms will intensify through standards, integrations, and regulatory frameworks, not a single decisive win. This development is coming at a time when the established SWIFT network is facing growing pressure from faster, cheaper blockchain alternatives, such as the XRP Ledger (XRPL). For instance, SWIFT’s transaction volume recently dropped by 15% whereas XRPL’s activity continued to surge. Conclusion Zschach’s comment signals perspective. For XRP holders and payments architects, the Rail purchase and SWIFT’s response make it clear that the race to modernize cross-border settlement has accelerated, with victories to be decided by clients, compliance, and live integrations. On the other hand, the substantial whale accumulation of 120 million XRP, reflects investor confidence in XRP's long-term prospects, even amid short-term market volatility.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-15 15:06:49

U.S. hedge fund Brevan Howard recently made headlines by disclosing approximately $2.3 billion in Bitcoin ETF holdings . This monumental revelation, confirmed by filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), signals a profound shift. It highlights the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin investment and its growing acceptance within traditional finance. This move is more than just an investment; it’s a powerful endorsement from a major financial player. What Do These Astounding Bitcoin ETF Holdings Mean? Brevan Howard, a well-respected name in the hedge fund industry, now holds a substantial stake in Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This isn’t just a casual investment; it’s a strategic move reflecting deep conviction in the digital asset space. Their significant Bitcoin ETF holdings indicate increasing confidence among major financial players. They see Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component for diversified portfolios. Moreover, this disclosure adds a crucial layer of transparency to the previously opaque world of large-scale crypto investments. The Rising Tide of Institutional Bitcoin Investment Why are established hedge funds like Brevan Howard making such substantial moves into digital assets? The answer lies in a confluence of factors. Institutional investors are seeking new avenues for growth and diversification, especially in an evolving global economy. This substantial institutional Bitcoin investment underscores a broader trend. More traditional financial entities are exploring, and indeed embracing, cryptocurrencies. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s maturing ecosystem and its increasing liquidity, making it accessible even for vast capital allocations. Consider the compelling benefits that draw these large players: Diversification: Bitcoin offers a low correlation with traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a robust store of value, particularly against inflationary pressures. Growth Potential: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin still presents significant upside potential for long-term holders. Unpacking Hedge Fund Crypto Exposure Brevan Howard’s move is a prime example of growing hedge fund crypto exposure . Historically, many traditional funds shied away from digital assets due to regulatory uncertainties and perceived risks. However, the landscape is rapidly changing, driven by clearer regulations and accessible products. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has been a game-changer. These regulated products provide a familiar and secure vehicle for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This ease of access significantly lowers the barrier to entry for large-scale investors. This trend is not isolated. Many other hedge funds and asset managers are quietly, or sometimes publicly, increasing their allocations to digital assets. They are recognizing the undeniable shift in financial paradigms, ensuring they do not miss out on this evolving asset class. Navigating the Evolving Bitcoin ETF Market The emergence of Brevan Howard as a major holder further solidifies the legitimacy and growth of the Bitcoin ETF market . This market has seen unprecedented inflows since the approval of spot ETFs earlier this year. It serves as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset space. The sheer volume of capital flowing into these ETFs demonstrates robust demand. This demand comes from a diverse range of investors, from retail participants to sophisticated institutions. The market’s liquidity and regulatory oversight are also continually improving, fostering greater trust. What does this mean for you as an investor or observer? Increased Legitimacy: Large institutional involvement significantly enhances Bitcoin’s credibility as an asset class. Market Stability: Greater institutional participation can potentially lead to more stable price action over time, though volatility remains a characteristic. Innovation: The growing market encourages further innovation in crypto-related financial products and services. Decoding Current Crypto Investment Trends Brevan Howard’s significant investment is a clear indicator of broader crypto investment trends . The narrative around cryptocurrencies is evolving from speculative novelty to a serious asset class. We are witnessing a maturation of the market, driven by institutional adoption and clearer regulatory frameworks. For those interested in navigating these trends, staying informed is crucial. Understand that while institutional backing brings a level of stability, the crypto market can still be volatile. Always conduct thorough research and consider your own financial goals before making investment decisions. This moment in time marks a pivotal point. The integration of digital assets into mainstream finance is no longer a distant possibility; it is a present reality, spearheaded by influential entities like Brevan Howard. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Digital Assets Brevan Howard’s disclosure of $2.3 billion in Bitcoin ETF holdings is more than just a headline; it’s a landmark event. It powerfully demonstrates the increasing confidence of major financial institutions in Bitcoin. This substantial institutional Bitcoin investment is a clear signal that digital assets are firmly establishing their place in global portfolios. As the Bitcoin ETF market continues to expand and crypto investment trends evolve, we can anticipate even greater integration of traditional and decentralized finance. The future of finance is undoubtedly becoming more intertwined with the digital realm, promising exciting developments ahead.

What Platforms Like SUBBD Are Getting Right, ICO Hits $1M",https://cryptonews.com/news/onlyfans-8b-subbds-web3-growth/,"Most have seen the headlines about OnlyFans, which is reportedly valued at a staggering $8 billion. Yet for a platform that acts as a middleman between creators and fans, that number prompts the question of how much more a Web3 platform like SUBBD (SUBBD) could be worth. However, SUBBD delivers far beyond just disintermediation. Its technology is built for ownership and scalability, with creator-first tools powered by two of today’s most transformative technologies: AI and crypto. The result is a system in which creators control their brand and content workflow, while fans experience more personal connections with the creators they support. Right now, much of the subscription content space still hasn’t caught up to what SUBBD is building, and that’s the opportunity. As the market begins to see the full value of what it offers, the numbers we now associate with Web2 platforms like OnlyFans could start to make sense in SUBBD’s case. Right now, early positioning is what matters most. Billion-dollar exits don’t go to those who come in late. The SUBBD token is priced at $0.055775, but this tier closes in 24 hours, after which the price will move higher. Creators Are Rethinking the Platforms They Rely On When OnlyFans owner Leonid Radvinsky entered talks to sell the platform, the deal was reportedly valued at $8 billion. Yet with a sales multiple of just 1.2x on its reported $6.6 billion in gross revenue from 2023, that price tag starts to look difficult to justify REPORT: OnlyFans brought in $1.7 billion more than NBA player salaries according to a new report from Sportskeeda. In the 2023 year, OF creators made a whopping $6.6 billion. The NBA players on the other hand, which includes star players like LeBron James and Steph Curry,… pic.twitter.com/0v3SjE0lAG — Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) September 13, 2024 This suggests, however, that investors are pricing in long-term dominance, brand entrenchment, and confidence that the platform will continue generating massive cash flow. OnlyFans may still be raking in profits, but without meaningful innovation, it’s starting to look like a modern-day Nokia. It’s confident in its position but unprepared for what’s coming next. Because the truth is that the curtain is closing on Web2. It doesn’t take much to spark an exodus when creators realize their income and presence can be deleted overnight. Just ask Bonnie Blue. Her ban from OnlyFans took place before she could stage her “petting zoo” challenge. Bonnie Blue has been permanently banned from OnlyFans over her planned ‘petting zoo’ stunt in a glass box pic.twitter.com/gC4jxhH32V — FearBuck (@FearedBuck) June 12, 2025 As a result, her million-dollar income stream vanished in an instant. Today, creators often compete for shock value just to get noticed and convert subscribers because the alternatives aren’t any safer. Using Instagram or YouTube to market themselves carries the same risks, especially when even PG content can cross the invisible lines of what those platforms tolerate. So if creators can’t pull a “Bonnie,” how are they supposed to make money? What’s worse is that even when creators find real success on OnlyFans, 20% of their income is taken off the top. That cut can climb to 70% once you factor in managers and agencies handling content, marketing, and messaging. That’s why the shift has already begun, with creators wanting more control. And the platforms that offer it while evolving with both creator and fan needs are the ones that will win. OnlyFans reportedly has over 3.5 million active creators. Submitted accounts dropped to 170,000 in both November 2024 and February 2025, with a spike to over 200,000 applications in January 2025 in between. That contrast could be a sign of growing hesitation among creators. And even a fraction of that user base rethinking their future could spark a major migration. SUBBD is the platform trying to lead creators out of the restrictive grips of Web2 as it was designed from day one to put creators and fans at the center of everything. Although its current user base may be smaller than OnlyFans’, its foundation of on-chain ownership, flexible monetization, and tools powered by crypto and AI could ultimately deliver it an even larger audience. SUBBD Makes Creating Easier, Discoverability Smarter, and Earnings Fairer Creators are tired of platforms that dictate the rules and keep most of the rewards. SUBBD flips that dynamic, letting them keep more, reach their audience directly, and build something that lasts. Over on its AI tech stack, SUBBD automates the backend work that usually slows creators down. Images and videos are automatically tagged using models like Florence-2 and Tag2Text. Audio content, on the other hand, is transcribed using Whisper. This makes everything searchable by theme, tone, or context so fans can find exactly what they’re looking for. Thus, creators no longer need to spend time adding metadata or writing captions. Their content is organized, discoverable, and ready to generate revenue from the moment it’s uploaded. That also means creators don’t have to rely on virality or shock value to grow. SUBBD makes it so much easier to get found through smart, intent-based search, not algorithms or trends. SUBBD also includes AI Creator Chat, a digital assistant trained to reflect each creator’s voice and style. Fans can chat, get updates, or interact more personally without creators having to be online 24/7. It’s scalable engagement that still feels authentic. What’s more is that instead of taking up to 70% in combined platform and agency fees like OnlyFans, SUBBD charges a flat 20%. This fee covers infrastructure, ongoing R&D, and access to powerful built-in AI tools that streamline a creator’s entire workflow. More tools are already in development, and the platform continues to release features that make creators’ work easier, their audience reach wider, and their income streams more dependable. You Missed the OnlyFans Exit – You Don’t Want to Miss SUBBD’s Entry When the creator exodus kicks into high gear, the ones backing the right platform – one actually built for creators and fans – could be looking at their own Radvinsky moment. Not everyone gets an $8 billion exit, but supporting the right infrastructure early? That’s where those stories start. The SUBBD platform is already live, with over 2,000 creators using its tools to manage content, engage fans, and earn without middlemen. Core functions such as payments, tipping, staking, content unlocks, and governance all operate on the $SUBBD token, directly linking the platform’s growth to real utility rather than hype. Owning SUBBD now means getting ahead of a shift that’s already underway. Head to the SUBBD presale site and secure your tokens using ETH, BNB, USDT, or even a bank card. Connect your wallet ( Best Wallet is the official self-custody partner), and you’ll be ready to claim at the end of the presale. Stake your SUBBD for a fixed 20% APY and help shape the next generation of creator tech. Stay updated by following SUBBD on X , Instagram , and Telegram .

The use of cryptocurrency today is a tiny fraction of what it could be. ILP enables seamless transfer of value across payment networks. Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, has explained how parties can create trust relationships on XRPL using the ledger’s elements, including XRP and ILP. In a recent thread on X, the Ripple executive noted why he expects institutions to explore the platform’s resources for their benefit. I really hope institutions do form trust relationships and leverage them. This was the original vision for trust lines (going back to 2004 and Ryan Fugger's work), the core concept behind ILP and I still think it's a huge win for everyone.

But analysts now voice concern that these meme coin staples are losing their spark, even as new, utility-driven alternatives ignite fresh FOMO among retail and institutional investors. In the past week, chatter on X (formerly Twitter) and crypto forums show a shift. Memecoin glory days seem to be giving way to smarter, tech-forward projects. As Dogecoin and Shiba Inu stall, whispers grow louder around a quietly powerful contender, one that blends real use with community energy and may reshape which new altcoin to watch rises to the top. Dogecoin: Whale Hype but Structural Strain Dogecoin recently reclaimed multi-week resistance at around $0.23, stirring hope for a rally toward $2 if meme momentum meets ETF optimism. Analysts have also observed that the DOGE daily chart is shaping into a classic cup and handle pattern , which is one of the most reliable bullish patterns in technical analysis. Still, DOGE’s appeal for whales persists, highlighting that investor emotion often outpaces fundamentals. Its legacy as the original meme coin remains undeniable but does it match the needs of a maturing market? Shiba Inu: Short-Term Hype Hides Long-Term Risk Shiba Inu recently hit a short-term high of $0.00001359 after breaking above a key 50-day moving average which is a signal of bullish momentum. Analysts caution, though, that this momentum may fade without real use cases or a supply fix. Experts have revealed that the Shiba Inu price is currently consolidating near the breakout zone. It is also showing signs of an accumulation phase . Analysts also said that a sustained bounce from this level could push the Shiba Inu price toward targets at $0.00001400, $0.00001750, $0.00002050 and $0.00002500. Remittix: Best Crypto to Buy And A Practical Powerhouse Amid the flurry around meme nostalgia, Remittix stands out as a best crypto presale to buy for investors craving real utility, not just hype. Remittix introduces a future-ready wallet set for Q3 launch. It brings fast, cross-chain access, low gas fees and a tight-knit ecosystem.

Bottom Line: A Shift From Meme to Meaningful Movement Dogecoin and Shiba Inu may still spark nostalgia and short-term FOMO. But their lack of utility and structural limits hamper long-term relevance. Market wise, investors now lean toward crypto with real utility and projects that solve real-world needs. Remittix ticks those boxes and then some. Its wallet reveal, upcoming launch and live giveaway signal something tangible and future-ready.

By 2028, ENS could see significant growth, with predictions suggesting a potential maximum price of $106.33 ENS could achieve its highest price yet, reaching up to $319.75 by 2031. The Ethereum Name Service is a network that enables crypto enthusiasts to rename their cryptocurrency addresses into something simpler, making them easier to remember. Renaming crypto addresses through ENS will enable users to recollect and write them quickly. Even though Ethereum Name Service is based on the Ethereum blockchain, it uses its cryptocurrency, ENS. ENS is used for governance purposes on the blockchain network. Users can also send and receive any cryptocurrency with the system’s wallet. The price of ENS has experienced ups and downs since it launched on the market, dropping to as low as $6.7 and hitting an ATH of $85.69. As decentralized identities and Web3 technology are adopted, ENS positions itself as a key player in this transformative space. How will this affect investors’ perceptions of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) token? Will ENS go up? How high can ENS go? Will ENS recapture its ATH soon? Let’s get into the Ethereum Name Service price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ethereum Name Service Token ENS Price $26.97 Market Cap $968.76B Trading Volume (24-hour) $61.11Million Circulating Supply 100 Million ENS All-time High $85.69, Nov 11, 2021 All-time Low $6.70, Oct 19, 2023 24-h High $28.82 24-h Low $26.02 Ethereum Name Service technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility (30-day Volatility) $ 19.73 (-25.17%) 50-Day SMA $ 23.30 14-Day RSI 52.64 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 54 (Neutral) Green Days 18/30 (60%) 200-Day SMA $ 19.47 Ethereum Name Service price analysis TL;DR Breakdown : ENS is consolidating near $27 with neutral momentum and support around $24.28 A breakout above $28 could target the $29 to $30 range Failure to hold $27 may lead to a drop toward $26.50 or $24.28 Ethereum Name Service 1-day price chart ENSUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 1-day chart, ENS shows recent volatility with a sharp drop from near $30 toward current levels around $27. The RSI at 49.62 suggests a neutral momentum, while price is testing the mid-Bollinger Band near $27.71, which acts as short-term resistance. Support lies around $24.28, aligned with the lower Bollinger Band. If buyers defend this area, a rebound toward $29–$31 is possible. However, failure to hold above $26.50 could trigger further downside toward $24. The MACD indicates slowing bullish momentum, so consolidation or mild pullback is likely unless strong buying volume emerges to reclaim $28. ENS/USD 4-hour price chart analysis ENSUSD chart by TradingView Based on the 4-hour chart, ENS is consolidating after recent volatility, with price holding near $27 but facing resistance at the mid-Bollinger Band around $27.71. The MACD shows a flat trend with minimal momentum, while the Balance of Power at -0.26 suggests sellers currently have an edge. Support sits around $26.50 and stronger support near $24.28 if selling pressure intensifies. A breakout above $28 could invite a retest of $29–$30, but failure to sustain above $27 may lead to further downside. The current setup points to indecision, with traders awaiting a clear volume-driven move to define the next trend. ENS technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $22.26 BUY SMA 5 $23.95 BUY SMA 10 $26.21 BUY SMA 21 $ 27.43 SELL SMA 50 $23.30 BUY SMA 100 $ 22.40 BUY SMA 200 $19.47 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 25.66 BUY EMA 5 $24.30 BUY EMA 10 $ 22.15 BUY EMA 21 $20.02 BUY EMA 50 $19.98 BUY EMA 100 $ 22.22 BUY EMA 200 $23.51 BUY What to expect from ENS? Based on the 1-day chart, ENS is trading near $27 after a pullback from the $30 zone, with the RSI around neutral at 49.62, suggesting balanced momentum. Price is between the middle and lower Bollinger Bands, with key support near $24.28 and resistance at $31. On the 4-hour chart, ENS is consolidating, facing mid-Bollinger resistance at $27.71, while the MACD is flat and Balance of Power negative at -0.26, indicating mild selling pressure. A push above $28 could trigger a move toward $29–$30, but failure to hold $27 risks a decline toward $26.50 or $24.28, depending on market sentiment. Is ENS a good investment? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be a good investment if you believe in the long-term potential of decentralized domain names and the growing adoption of blockchain technology. ENS offers a unique utility by allowing users to register human-readable names for Ethereum addresses, which simplifies transactions and interactions within the Ethereum ecosystem. Its value could increase as more users and businesses adopt decentralized web services. Will ENS recover? The ENS price has experienced a sharp drop followed by a gradual recovery, indicating some resilience in the market. While there has been a rebound from the low, whether ENS will recover depends on continued buying interest and broader market conditions. Will ENS reach $100? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years, with the price projected to reach $130.79 on average by 2029. This implies that reaching $100 is plausible within the next few years, driven by positive market trends and increasing adoption. Will ENS reach $500? Forecasts for ENS indicate significant growth potential over the coming years. However, attaining $500, while attainable, might not happen anytime soon. Does ENS have a good long-term future? Ethereum Name Service (ENS) shows a strong long-term potential based on current predictions. The price is expected to increase significantly over the next several years, with forecasts extending to $319.75 by 2031. This indicates a positive outlook for ENS, supported by ongoing market developments and growing investor interest.

Digital Currency Group (DCG), a prominent cryptocurrency investment firm, has initiated legal action against its own subsidiary, Genesis Global. This surprising move involves a significant claim of $105 million, adding another layer to the complex legal landscape facing major cryptocurrency firms . For anyone following the ups and downs of the digital asset space, this unfolding crypto legal battle between parent and child company is a must-watch. What Sparked the DCG Genesis Lawsuit? Digital Currency Group alleges that it extended a crucial lifeline to Genesis Global during the turbulent market downturn of 2022. This support came in the form of a promissory note, designed to bolster Genesis in the wake of the infamous Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapse. DCG provided these funds to help stabilize Genesis’s operations and navigate the challenging financial environment. Interestingly, as crypto prices later rebounded, the value of the collateral Genesis had secured from 3AC also saw a significant increase. This appreciation led to profits for Genesis that reportedly exceeded the original promissory note amount. Now, DCG is demanding repayment of the $105 million, plus accrued interest, asserting its right to these funds. This claim highlights the intricate financial relationships within large crypto conglomerates and the challenges that arise when market conditions shift dramatically. The initial support, intended to prevent further distress, has now become the basis for a contentious legal dispute. Genesis’s Counter-Claim and Broader Context of the Crypto Legal Battle While DCG pursues its claim, Genesis Global itself has been grappling with severe financial difficulties. The company filed for Genesis bankruptcy in January 2023, struggling to recover from the widespread contagion caused by the collapse of FTX. The failure of such a major exchange sent shockwaves through the industry, leaving many firms, including Genesis, in precarious positions. Adding to the complexity of this crypto legal battle , Genesis had previously launched its own substantial lawsuit against its parent company, DCG. Genesis’s claim amounted to a staggering $2.1 billion, alleging that DCG improperly withdrew large sums of funds just prior to Genesis’s bankruptcy filing. This counter-claim suggests a deep-seated dispute and differing interpretations of past financial transactions between the two entities. The intertwining of these lawsuits paints a vivid picture of the financial distress and legal challenges that continue to plague the cryptocurrency market following the 2022 and 2023 crises. Both companies are fighting for significant sums, reflecting the immense financial pressures involved. What Does This Mean for Cryptocurrency Firms? The ongoing DCG Genesis lawsuit serves as a stark reminder of the risks and complexities inherent in the digital asset space. It underscores the importance of transparent financial dealings and robust risk management within large corporate structures. For other cryptocurrency firms , this case offers several key takeaways: Intercompany Lending Scrutiny: Loans and financial agreements between parent companies and subsidiaries must be meticulously documented and structured to avoid future disputes. Contagion Risks: The domino effect of major collapses like 3AC and FTX continues to impact even well-established entities, emphasizing the need for diversified exposure and strong liquidity. Legal Precedents: The outcome of this high-profile crypto legal battle could set important precedents for how intercompany liabilities and bankruptcy proceedings are handled in the crypto industry. As the legal proceedings unfold, the broader crypto community will be watching closely. The resolution of this dispute will undoubtedly influence perceptions of stability and accountability among major Digital Currency Group entities and beyond. In conclusion, the DCG Genesis lawsuit is more than just a financial squabble; it is a critical test of corporate governance and legal frameworks within the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. The $105 million claim, coupled with Genesis’s counter-suit, highlights the severe challenges faced by firms navigating the aftermath of market turmoil. As the dust settles, the lessons learned from this intense crypto legal battle will undoubtedly shape future practices for cryptocurrency firms worldwide, emphasizing the need for clear financial structures and robust legal safeguards. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the primary claim in the DCG Genesis lawsuit? A1: Digital Currency Group (DCG) is suing its subsidiary, Genesis Global, for $105 million plus interest.

A2: DCG provided funds to Genesis via a promissory note in 2022 to support the subsidiary after the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), aiming to stabilize its operations during a period of market turmoil.

A3: Genesis Global previously filed a $2.1 billion lawsuit against DCG, alleging that its parent company improperly withdrew significant funds just before Genesis filed for Genesis bankruptcy in January 2023. Q4: How did the FTX collapse impact Genesis Global? A4: The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly worsened Genesis Global’s financial struggles, contributing directly to its decision to file for bankruptcy in early 2023 due to widespread contagion in the crypto market.

According to DLNews, the BIS is proposing an AML compliance scoring system for cryptocurrencies. The BIS stated that the scoring system aims to enhance anti-money laundering efforts and identify cryptocurrencies linked to illicit activities. The system will target cryptocurrencies linked to illicit activities. Accordingly, BIS researchers proposed scoring investors' cryptocurrencies based on their transfer history. At this point, BIS researchers suggested assigning anti-money laundering compliance scores to cryptocurrencies based on their transaction history. Accordingly, it has been suggested that cryptocurrencies that pass through suspected criminal wallets or protocols frequently used to launder stolen funds may receive a lower score. The BIS also proposed that exchanges in each country would block the conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat currency if they fall below a certain threshold. This would allow each country to set a threshold score that would determine whether users can convert their cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. BIS listed the benefits of this system as follows: ” Enhanced Security: Reducing the flow of illicit funds through the crypto ecosystem. Increased Trust: Increasing trust in institutional investors and traditional finance.” The BIS recently reiterated its skeptical approach to cryptocurrencies, saying they are risky and warning that they could undermine financial stability and regulators' attempts to oversee financial markets. *This is not investment advice.

In particolare, ETH sta guadagnando slancio in modo costante, con il prezzo che si avvicina sempre più a un nuovo massimo storico. Negli ultimi giorni, la principale altcoin ha registrato un’impennata dell’attività di rete, una domanda crescente e una diminuzione delle riserve sugli exchange — tutti fattori chiave per un potenziale movimento esplosivo. La crescita della rete spinge il prezzo di Ethereum verso un nuovo ATH Ethereum si sta rapidamente avvicinando al suo precedente massimo storico, grazie a un’impennata dell’attività di rete a livelli mai visti prima. Secondo la società di analisi on-chain CryptoQuant, il numero di transazioni giornaliere su Ethereum ha raggiunto un record di circa 1,875 milioni, evidenziando un forte aumento del coinvolgimento degli utenti e della domanda sulla rete.Questa impennata dell’attività ha coinciso con un forte rally del prezzo di ETH, passato da circa 3.150 $ a fine luglio a 4.563 $ in agosto, posizionando la criptovaluta a un passo dal suo picco storico. Attualmente, Ethereum viene scambiato a 4.737 $, quindi è solo al 2,67% dal superare l’ATH di 4.867 $, registrato durante il bull run del novembre 2021. Nell’ultimo mese, Ethereum ha mantenuto una forte traiettoria rialzista, guadagnando circa il 60% secondo CoinMarketCap. Il momentum si è ulteriormente rafforzato nell’ultima settimana, con la criptovaluta in rialzo di oltre il 27% e capace di sovraperformare Bitcoin del 124% dai minimi di aprile. ETH Season, Not Alt Season Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin by 124% since April's lows. First Bitcoin, then Ethereum, then alt season. Very simple actually. pic.twitter.com/N4yeQpYOIe — Carlitosway (@Carlitoswa_y) August 14, 2025 Se questa corsa rialzista dovesse continuare, ETH potrebbe essere sul punto di registrare un nuovo massimo storico, segnando un momento storico per il mercato crypto. Al momento della stesura dell’articolo Ethereum vale circa 4.500 dollari. A rafforzare il sentiment positivo c’è anche il Netflow SMA30 di Ethereum, che secondo CryptoQuant è attualmente a -40.000 ETH. Come mostra il grafico, flussi in uscita sostenuti indicano che gli investitori stanno spostando i propri fondi in cold storage anziché lasciarli sugli exchange per vendite rapide, riducendo così la liquidità sul lato vendita e aumentando la pressione d’acquisto. Questa tendenza è stata particolarmente evidente tra la fine di luglio e l’inizio di agosto. Il 12 agosto, Ethereum ha registrato un ingente afflusso netto di 186.000 ETH e, nello stesso giorno, il prezzo ha toccato i 4.589 $. Ciò supporta la tesi di CryptoQuant secondo cui ETH si sta avvicinando rapidamente a un nuovo massimo storico, spinto non solo dall’aumento dell’attività di rete ma anche dall’accelerazione dell’accumulazione. Rischio di short squeeze e afflussi negli ETF aggiungono slancio Mentre il prezzo di ETH è in forte ascesa, l’analista di mercato Coin Bureau avverte che un nuovo massimo storico potrebbe innescare una serie di liquidazioni di posizioni short, potenzialmente introducendo ancora più volatilità sul mercato. L’analista prevede che potrebbero essere spazzati via quasi 2 miliardi di dollari di posizioni short, costringendo i trader a ricomprare l’altcoin a prezzi più alti e accelerando ulteriormente il rally. $2 BILLION ETH SHORTS AT RISK! If #Ethereum rallies to its all-time high, nearly $2 billion in shorts could get liquidated. Why short $ETH ? pic.twitter.com/0nhxekBEJE — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) August 14, 2025 Interessante notare che la rapida ascesa del prezzo di Ethereum è amplificata anche da una crescente domanda istituzionale. L’analista crypto Ted Pillows ha riportato in un post su X che gli ETF Spot su Ethereum hanno registrato in un solo giorno afflussi per ben 729,1 milioni di dollari — un segnale che la FOMO istituzionale potrebbe essere tornata sul mercato. Insieme a questo boom degli ETF, anche la domanda da parte delle società di tesoreria Ethereum è cresciuta in modo marcato, rafforzando ulteriormente il momentum rialzista di ETH. .",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 15:30:03

The Chairman and CEO of TeraWulf, Paul Prager, said the $3.7B deals could potentially go up to $8.7B if lease extensions were exercised. The CEO clarified that the two 10-year HPC (high-performance computing) colocation deals with Fluid Stack represented $3.7B in contracted revenue over the first decade, including two five-year extensions. The company will deliver over 200 MW of critical IT load (~250 MW gross capacity) at its Lake Mariner, Western New York data center. The facility is designed to meet density, scale, and resilience needs for TeraWulf’s next-generation compute. Google will also back the deal with about $1.8B to support the financing of project-related debts over the next 10 years. Google will get 41M TeraWulf common shares in exchange, translating to about 8% of pro forma equity ownership. The company also disclosed that it would approach capital markets to fund parts of the project. TeraWulf expects the first phase of roughly 40 MW of critical IT load to be online by mid-2026. The full 200+ MW should be deployed by the end of 2026. Prager calls it a defining moment for his company Chair and CEO, Prager, said this was a defining moment for TeraWulf. He added that the partnership aimed to deliver predominantly low-cost, zero-carbon energy-powered AI infrastructure. Prager boasted that in addition to accelerating the company’s expansion into high-performance computing, the Lake Mariner facility was hyperscale-ready. Nazar Khan, the Chief Technology Officer at TeraWulf, chimed in, saying the partnership highlighted the readiness of the Lake Mariner facility and the capacity of the team. Khan also claimed that Lake Mariner was purpose-built for high-demand AI workloads that fit today’s standards. The data center was connected to ultra-low-latency fiber, dual 354kV transmission lines, and had a closed-loop water-cooled system. Khan believes the partnership with FluidStack allowed his company to engineer a fully customized and scalable solution. “Fluidstack is proud to be a trusted provider of critical compute for the world’s leading AI labs…Our partnership with TeraWulf reflects our shared commitment to delivering rapid, scalable infrastructure for the AI frontier.” – César Maklary , Co-Founder and President of Fluidstack Patrick Fleury, TeraWulf’s Chief Financial Officer, said that, given the company’s expected credit profile boost, TeraWulf had refined its financing strategy to focus on initiatives in capital markets. He added that his company was benefiting a lot from its updated lease agreements and Google’s support. TeraWulf said it aimed for long-term success by balancing Bitcoin mining and AI, as previously reported by Cryptopolitan. The latest deal with FluidStack is expected to rake in over $350 million in Annual revenue, with net operating margins of about 85% at the site level. TeraWulf brings in Cayuga Prager said the company’s second step in its long-term strategy was bringing in Cayuga through an eight-year ground lease with purchase options, securing exclusive rights to develop a 400 MW digital infrastructure site. The CEO claimed the site was fully equipped with redundant fiber, industrial water intake, and high-capacity transmission. TeraWulf expects to bring over 130 MW online in 2027, with the potential to expand beyond that. Prager boasted that these two deals increased the company’s platform capacity to more than one gigawatt (1 GW). He added that this capacity firmly positioned Lake Mariner and Cayuga as the company’s cornerstone assets for its future AI venture. TeraWulf’s CFO, Fleury, also mentioned that the Lake Mariner and Cayuga sites had the same advantages. He added that acquiring Beowulf Electricity and Data in Q2 further streamlined the company’s structure. Prager also mentioned his company’s first HPC tenant, Core 42. Adding that the partnership was still outstanding and anticipated further growth for the relationship. Fleury said his company had invested heavily in its HPC business over the past 12 months. The CFO explained that everything was on schedule and on budget to deliver the anticipated capacity.

Both projects occupy different positions in the blockchain sector, with Nexchain focused on AI-powered scalability and XRP leading in cross-border payment solutions. XRP Market Performance XRP started the day trading above $3.30, with bullish sentiment across the market. However, US wholesale inflation data, showing the highest increase since June 2022, triggered a downturn. The token dropped to a weekly low of $3.00 on several exchanges before rebounding to $3.10. Over the last 24 hours, XRP has declined by more than 5.5%. Data from CoinGlass shows traders lost over $60 million, with more than 92% of that from long positions. Across the market, total liquidations exceeded $1 billion, with ETH and BTC leading the totals. ​​Source: Coinglass XRP continues to serve as the native asset of the RippleNet network, facilitating fast and low-cost international payments.

A significant event drawing attention is the upcoming Trump Putin meeting , a high-stakes diplomatic encounter that could ripple through international relations and, by extension, financial markets. This anticipated discussion highlights how major political events can shape global sentiment, which sometimes subtly impacts various asset classes, including digital currencies, by influencing overall investor confidence and risk appetite. What to Expect from the Extended Kremlin Summit? The Kremlin has officially stated that the highly anticipated Kremlin summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, set to take place in Alaska, is projected to last a substantial six to seven hours. This extended duration immediately signals the depth and breadth of topics expected to be covered by the two leaders. Typically, such lengthy meetings are reserved for critical discussions aimed at tangible outcomes. Walter Bloomberg’s economic news account on X (formerly Twitter) corroborated these reports, providing additional insight into the official stance. Furthermore, Russian authorities conveyed a strong belief that this extensive meeting will indeed yield tangible results. This expression of confidence from official sources often sets a hopeful tone for international dialogue, suggesting that both sides are approaching the talks with a serious intent to make progress. Optimism Ahead of Key US Russia Talks Prior to this announcement, U.S. President Donald Trump himself had expressed considerable optimism regarding the upcoming discussions. This positive outlook from both leaders suggests a mutual desire to achieve progress on various fronts during these pivotal US Russia talks . Such a shared sense of optimism is a foundational element for productive diplomatic engagement. An extended meeting duration, like the six to seven hours projected, is highly noteworthy in diplomatic circles. It indicates that the agenda is likely comprehensive, covering a range of complex issues rather than just superficial exchanges. Long meetings often pave the way for more detailed negotiations, allowing leaders to delve deeply into contentious points and explore potential compromises. This commitment to extended dialogue suggests a serious attempt to address pressing global and bilateral matters. Unpacking the Significance of a Presidential Meeting Every presidential meeting between leaders of major global powers carries immense weight and symbolic importance. These direct dialogues are crucial for navigating complex international landscapes and addressing pressing global challenges. While specific agenda items were not detailed by the Kremlin, such summits typically involve discussions on a wide array of topics. These often include global security, arms control, economic cooperation, regional conflicts, and the overall state of bilateral relations between the two nations. The expectation of ‘results’ from the Russian authorities underscores the high stakes involved. Both nations likely aim to find common ground, de-escalate existing tensions, or even forge new agreements on key issues. A successful outcome could foster greater stability in international affairs, potentially influencing broader market confidence globally. Furthermore, these meetings provide a vital platform for direct communication, reducing misinterpretations and building a foundation for future cooperation, even on challenging topics. Anticipating the Broader Impact of this Diplomatic Summit This upcoming diplomatic summit represents a critical moment for international relations, drawing significant global attention. The unprecedented duration and the expressed optimism from both sides suggest a serious commitment to constructive dialogue.

Investors and analysts across the financial spectrum closely monitor such high-level interactions for any signals regarding global stability, economic policy changes, or shifts in international alliances. A productive meeting could contribute to a more predictable and stable international environment, which generally supports broader financial market stability and can indirectly affect investment flows.

OFAC Reintroduces Garantex, Grinex, and Related Entities to Sanctions List The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has reintroduced Garantex, its successor Grinex, and a number of other individuals and entities to its sanctions list. The reason for this update is accusations of laundering illegally obtained funds and facilitating the circumvention of restrictions imposed on the Russian Federation. Timeline of Sanctions and Freezing of Assets Recall that OFAC added the Garantex crypto exchange to the sanctions list in April 2022. According to authorities, the platform facilitated the laundering of more than $100 million related to illegal activities. In February 2025, restrictions against the platform were introduced in the EU. It suspended operations in March amid the freezing of wallets by Tether, the issuer of USDT. The accounts were blocked in assets in the stablecoin for 2.5 billion rubles (about $28 million at the time). Emergence of Grinex and Connections to Garantex Soon after, another exchange, Grinex, appeared on the Russian market. We previously covered a report by Global Ledger, according to which this platform is effectively the successor to Garantex. According to a new release from the US Treasury, Grinex is indeed closely linked to the sanctioned exchange. The department also imposed sanctions against three Garantex executives and six related companies in Russia and the Kyrgyz Republic. According to the agency, after the platform's wallets were blocked, clients' funds were redirected to Grinex accounts. At the same time, Grinex's advertising materials state that it was created in response to sanctions. Transaction Data and Associated Wallets According to a Global Ledger report provided to Incrypted, Grinex processed USDT worth 7.3 billion in transactions between March 5 and August 14. The company identified 312 wallets associated with the exchange, four of which are still active and have not been sanctioned. The company's experts also found 180 exchanges that carried out direct or indirect transactions with wallets associated with Grinex, totaling $1.66 billion. Use of A7A5 Ruble Stablecoin and Its Owners To conduct transactions and replenish the losses of Garantex clients, the ruble stablecoin A7A5, issued by the Kyrgyz company Old Vector, was used. The asset was created for A7 Limited Liability Society, which, along with its affiliates, is owned by sanctioned oligarch Ilan Shor and the Russian bank Promsvyazbank (PSB), according to an OFAC release. According to Global Ledger, the bulk of A7A5 liquidity is so-called wash-trading. Despite this, the project is aimed at the long term, the organization believes. This is indicated by structural and consistent growth: “The project is showing stable, albeit likely simulated, trading dynamics and continues to infuse USDT liquidity while strengthening its off-chain presence, focusing on brand growth, reputation, and formal presentation as a Kyrgyzstan-based company,” the report said. Comprehensive Sanctions List To summarize, OFAC has designated: Garantex; Grinex; Old Vector; A7, A71 and A7 Agent; co-founder of Garantex Sergey Mendeleev; co-owner and commercial director of Garantex Alexander Mira Serda; co-owner and regional director of Garantex Pavel Karavatsky; payment platforms InDeFi Bank and Exved, created by Mendeleev to simplify access to Garantex services, and later Grinex. Effects and Implications of Sanctions As a result of the measures taken, all property and property rights, as well as companies in which the share of the said persons exceeds 50%, are blocked. Sanctions may also be imposed against any counterparties that carry out activities with them, including financial ones. Reward for Information In addition, US authorities are offering a reward of up to $6 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Garantex's management.

The person was detained in a major raid in eastern Czechia, local media reported. Meanwhile, law enforcement authorities also seized digital coins from the department. Bitcoin donor detained and charged with money laundering Czech police officers and prosecutors have carried out a large-scale operation in connection with the scandal over a controversial crypto donation for the Ministry of Justice in Prague. The overnight raid was carried out by the National Center against Organized Crime (NCOZ) and the High Public Prosecutor’s Office in the eastern city of Olomouc on Thursday, the Czech radio reported. Among several individuals detained during the action is Tomáš Jiřikovský, a former drug dealer and darknet market operator, who gave the justice department 468 BTC, worth around 1 billion Czech koruna at the time (approx. $45 million). The ministry’s decision to accept the crypto gift in March, without thoroughly checking the origins of the digital money, shook the Czech government earlier this year. It also led to the resignation of its head, Pavel Blažek, as reported by Cryptopolitan in May. Blažek, who stepped down to take political responsibility for the scandal, maintains no wrongdoing on his part. While surviving a no-confidence vote in parliament, the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Fiala was forced to deal with the fallout that threatens the ruling coalition’s chances in the upcoming elections this fall. Blažek’s successor, Eva Decroix, pledged to investigate the case ahead of the vote in October. An external audit, the results of which are yet to be published in full, recently concluded that the justice ministry should have rejected the suspicious donation. According to a summary of the document that’s being prepared by the global accounting and consulting firm Grant Thornton, officials failed to take appropriate steps to address the risks, falling short of the principles of good governance. In the press release quoted by the national radio broadcaster, prosecutors said: “The NCOZ is currently carrying out intensive criminal proceedings in the case linked to the donation of bitcoins to the Ministry of Justice. Investigators are taking steps both to clarify the matter and to secure persons and assets involved.” Their office also highlighted that they are investigating suspected legalization of illicit money and unlawful production and handling of narcotics and psychotropic substances. Jiřikovský, who has already spent time in prison for similar crimes, has been charged again with drug trafficking and money laundering. Czech police seize remaining bitcoins from justice ministry Meanwhile, Czech law enforcement also seized crypto donated by the convicted drug trafficker from the Ministry of Justice. On Friday, the ministry took to X to confirm the seizure and reiterate its support for “earlier legal opinions warning that the cryptocurrency likely stems from criminal activity.” Ministerstvo spravedlnosti ČR via X (formerly Twitter) Previous media reports revealed the department had organized a series of public auctions to sell the digital assets. Investigators have now seized the remaining coins. The ministry also said it’s currently consulting lawyers and contacting potential buyers while considering its next steps. Czech police are also investigating whether the decision to accept the Bitcoin donation involved abuse of power. Following the partial release of the Thornton report, former Justice Pavel Blažek insisted he acted in good faith and within the law. Posting on social media earlier this month, he noted the audit did not register violations of any legal obligations or regulations.

50136889,558126,1755272908,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50136889.jpeg,"$BTC Breaks Records on Fed Rate Cut Prediction, Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 Nears $10M",https://bitcoinist.com/btc-breaks-records-bitcoin-hyper-near-10m/,"$BTC is the world’s largest crypto, commanding an eye-boggling 58.6% of the entire market. Just yesterday, it hit its pinnacle at $124K, setting a new ATH. Its rise came on the heels of mounting speculation that the US Federal Reserve may slash interest rates in September. Naturally, macroeconomic tailwinds like this boost demand for risk assets like $BTC. But as $BTC continues to attract attention, can the Bitcoin network handle the workload? A glimpse at its track record suggests no. Don’t worry, the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Layer-2 solution is gearing up to deliver the solution – and it’s just $300K shy away from raising $10M on presale. Fed Rate Cut Odds Hit 92.5%, Perk Up $BTC According to CME’s FedWatch tool , markets are pricing in a 92.5% probability that the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter-point to between 4% and 4.25% – the first reduction since December 2024. Typically, lowering borrowing costs pushes investors toward higher-yielding, risk-on assets, like $BTC – after all, it’s the world’s largest crypto, with a $118K price tag . It’s just one piece of a much bigger bullish picture for $BTC. For instance, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold a whopping $170.22B in assets . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone manages a sizable $86.83B. Such a surge in institutional investment reduces the amount of $BTC readily available and attracts HODLers – both of which underpin the likelihood of $BTC rising to even greater heights. And then there’s the US’s pro-crypto stance. Recent legislative moves, like the ‘ GENIUS Act ’ and ‘ Clarity Act ,’ are set to significantly improve understanding regarding digital asset regulation. Also paving the way for Web3 innovation is ‘ Project Crypto ,’ an initiative that aims to modernize securities laws. Given that major crypto companies like Ripple , Coinbase , and Kraken have all been hit with SEC lawsuits over allegedly offering unregistered securities, such a shift is long overdue. Not to mention the US Bitcoin Reserve . It’s designed to secure the US’s leadership in the crypto sector, all while serving as a potential hedge against economic instability. Highlighting its influence on $BTC’s trajectory, when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested the government wouldn’t be purchasing any more $BTC , it wiped roughly $55B from $BTC’s market cap. Nevertheless, he later clarified on X that the Treasury remains committed to pursuing ‘budget-neutral pathways’ to grow its $BTC holdings. After doing so, $BTC recovered and lifted the broader market alongside it. Such developments strengthen $BTC’s outlook; they encourage institutional adoption and provide a strong anchor of market confidence, even during periods of volatility. What remains to be seen, however, is whether the Bitcoin network can scale to meet the highly anticipated surge in activity ahead. Bitcoin Faces Scalability & Smart Contract Woes Bitcoin’s network isn’t built for speed. It can only handle around 7 transactions per second (tps) . Compare that to Ethereum’s 15–30 tps and Solana’s 1K tps. With Bitcoin’s block size being capped at 1MB and its 10-minute block time limit, transaction throughput often drives up fees during peak demand. In stark contrast, Ethereum benefits from faster block times (around 12 seconds) and a dynamic block size mechanism. As shown in the chart, its average block size has climbed to around 123,024 bytes . This adaptability allows Ethereum to maintain higher throughput, better handle network demand, and support a diverse ecosystem full of DeFi protocols, dApps, and NFTs. Bitcoin, however, was designed with only security in mind. Hence, it cannot natively support complex smart contracts or host large-scale DeFi and NFT ecosystems, like Ethereum. As a consequence, Ethereum has the largest total value locked (TVL) at $94.356B , over 91% more than Bitcoin’s $7.63B. These are precisely the issues that Bitcoin Hyper aims to solve. Bitcoin Hyper Layer-2 to Give Bitcoin a Much-Needed Upgrade Set to go live this quarter, Bitcoin Hyper aims to solve the Bitcoin network’s pain points by making it faster, cheaper, and DeFi-friendly. Its approach is simple yet powerful: batch transactions off-chain and settle them on Bitcoin’s base layer. Doing so would reduce competition for block space, slash fees, and deliver near-instant confirmations. Plus, it’ll integrate with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to finally bring smart contract functionality to Bitcoin. Then, the network can open the doors to DeFi protocols, dApps, and even the best meme coins . A Canonical Bridge will verify the SVM smart contracts, plus mint wrapped $BTC on the Layer-2 for use across DeFi platforms. And all will be achieved without compromising security. Bitcoin Hyper pledges to use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for fast, trustless transaction verification. This will also be instrumental in ensuring that the Bitcoin blockchain doesn’t get clogged up. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Nears $10M Amid $BTC Demand With macro tailwinds, institutional demand, and pro-crypto policy already driving $BTC to rosier pursuits, the need for a network upgrade has never been more necessary. Bitcoin Hyper is poised to launch at the perfect time, supercharging the Bitcoin network as global adoption of $BTC takes off. To get the most out of the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem (lower fees, governance rights, and 112% staking rewards), buy $HYPER on presale for $0.012725. It’s already raised over $9.7M on presale and shows no signs of slowing down.

According to live market monitoring, the flagship digital asset has fallen below the critical $117,000 mark. This sudden movement has caught the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting discussions about the immediate future of the crypto market . On the Binance USDT market, BTC price is currently trading at $116,988.64, a figure that signals a shift in recent market sentiment. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? The recent descent of Bitcoin price below $117,000 is a significant event that many are trying to understand. While specific catalysts can sometimes be pinpointed, often these movements are a confluence of various factors. Global economic indicators, shifts in investor confidence, and even large institutional trades can all play a role in influencing the value of such a prominent digital asset . This particular drop, observed through comprehensive market monitoring, highlights the inherent dynamism of the cryptocurrency space. It is important to remember that the crypto market operates 24/7, reacting swiftly to global news and sentiment. Unlike traditional markets, there are no closing bells, meaning price action can occur at any moment. This constant activity contributes to the rapid shifts we frequently observe, including sharp corrections like the one seen with BTC price recently. Understanding Current Crypto Market Dynamics The broader crypto market often moves in tandem with Bitcoin, given its dominant position. When Bitcoin experiences significant market volatility , other altcoins often follow suit, albeit sometimes with greater intensity. This interconnectedness means that a drop in Bitcoin price can send ripples across the entire ecosystem of digital assets . Investors are constantly assessing these dynamics to make informed decisions. Current market conditions are influenced by a mix of factors, including inflation concerns, interest rate expectations, and geopolitical events. These macroeconomic elements can impact investor appetite for risk assets, which cryptocurrencies are largely considered to be. Therefore, understanding the bigger picture beyond just the immediate price action is crucial for any participant in this space. What Does This BTC Price Movement Mean for Digital Assets? For those holding or considering investing in digital assets , a dip in BTC price can present both challenges and potential opportunities. Short-term traders might see this as a chance to capitalize on volatility, while long-term holders often view such corrections as normal market cycles, or even opportunities to accumulate more at a lower cost. However, it is essential to approach such situations with caution and a well-defined strategy. The impact on other cryptocurrencies can vary. Some might show resilience, while others could experience sharper declines. This divergence underscores the importance of diversification within a crypto portfolio. Always conduct your own research before making any investment decisions, especially during periods of increased market volatility . Navigating Market Volatility: Key Considerations Periods of market volatility , like the recent dip in Bitcoin price , can be unsettling. However, adopting a disciplined approach can help investors navigate these times more effectively.

This Is the Target for ETH to Match the Historical Ratio",https://cryptopotato.com/9600-ethereum-this-is-the-target-for-eth-to-match-the-historical-ratio/,"Following the short-lived rally in the crypto market this week, Ethereum’s ratio against Bitcoin has climbed above its annual average. Newly emerged data suggest that Ethereum would need to reach approximately $9,600 to revisit its historical peak in the ETH/BTC trading pair. ETH/BTC Breakout According to CryptoRank’s latest observation, the ETH/BTC pair recently broke above its 365-day moving average for the first time since the Ethereum Merge, which demonstrates renewed upward momentum. This breakout follows a strong rebound from the 0.02 support level. It is important to note that the ETH/BTC ratio had previously hit a high of 0.08, a level that would require a significant price increase from current levels if Bitcoin remains stable around $120,000. The analytics platform added that this milestone highlights Ethereum’s potential for relative strength against Bitcoin if bullish momentum continues in the market. ETH Trajectory and Institutional Activity On the institutional side of things, US spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted over $3 billion in net inflows in the first two weeks of August, thereby making it their second-best monthly performance on record, with more than half the month remaining. Data compiled by SoSoValue revealed the ETFs are also on track for their strongest week since launch, as daily inflows during this period have averaged more than $700 million, after peaking at over $1 billion on Monday. The rally coincides with ETH’s strong price action, as it hit a yearly high of almost $4,766 on Thursday before briefly dropping below $4,500 and then recovering above $4,600. Despite the current setback, experts say that Ethereum’s all-time high is “imminent” as market rotation into ETH gains momentum. Large-cap altcoins appear to be leading breakouts, as mid- and low-caps follow. The Altseason indicator stands at a strong 67, well above the 50 threshold, which shows structural strength in the altcoin market. Currently, 9% of top coins have a Positive Impulse, and none show a Negative Impulse. A move above 20% Positive Impulse could trigger an even wider market-wide breakout. The post $9,600 Ethereum?

Here’s What We Know,https://cryptopotato.com/will-trump-and-putin-mention-bitcoin-btc-during-their-meeting-heres-what-we-know/,"TL;DR Global attention turns to Alaska, where Trump and Putin will hold rare US-based talks. Polymarket gives a slim chance of Bitcoin being mentioned, while investors should be prepared for volatility during and after the meeting. BTC on the Agenda? The highly anticipated meeting between American President Donald Trump and the Russian leader Vladimir Putin is just hours away. The world has fixed its eyes on it, as it may lead to de-escalation in Ukraine. While the war (and particularly the prospect of a peace pact) appears to be the most likely focus, that hasn’t stopped the crypto community from speculating that the two men could touch on other topics during their talks. According to Polymarket, there is a 4% chance that they could mention Bitcoin. Chances of Mentioning BTC, Source: Polymarket It is worth mentioning that this is the least possible subject of discussion, while mentioning Zelensky at one point during the summit has a 90% probability. Other topics that are likely to be brought to the table include NATO, BRICS, Joe Biden, and even Crimea (a peninsula almost entirely surrounded by the Black Sea, which has been a longstanding bone of contention between Russia and Ukraine). The meeting between the leaders will take place in Anchorage, Alaska, in a few hours. Minutes ago, Trump posted a video on his social media platform Truth Social showing that he is about to depart for the northern state. Some members of the Russian delegation have already made their way to Alaska. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, provoked the hosts upon his arrival by wearing a sweater with the inscription “USSR,” possibly making a reference to the former country that existed until 1991 and which included Ukraine within its borders. Summits between the leaders of the world’s two military superpowers are a rare sight on American soil. The last time a Russian president visited the US for such a meeting was in 2007, when Vladimir Putin met with George W. Bush in Maine. That encounter was intended to halt the growing rift between the two nations, which had serious disagreements over NATO expansion and missile defense plans. Expect Volatility It goes without saying that any breaking news coming after the meeting is expected to trigger substantial turbulence in the financial and crypto markets (even if BTC is not mentioned ). Progress toward a truce in Eastern Europe could boost investor confidence and positively impact the prices of the digital assets. On the other hand, disagreement and further escalation may cause a significant correction. The post Will Trump and Putin Mention Bitcoin (BTC) During Their Meeting?

50137351,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78553,1755273602,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,2660% ROI on the Table: BlockDAG’s Breakout Vision Alongside TRON Price Target and Ethereum Market Moves,https://timestabloid.com/blockdags-breakout-vision-alongside-tron-price-target-and-ethereum/,"The crypto market is delivering a rare trifecta of headlines, technical milestones for TRON, whale-fueled optimism for Ethereum, and a presale project, BlockDAG, that analysts say could deliver over 2,660% ROI. For TRON (TRX), the price is pressing against long-term resistance with a possible breakout toward $0.60 and $0.90, energizing discussions around its multi-year rising channel. Ethereum (ETH) is benefiting from heavy whale accumulation, over 1.8 million ETH bought in a month, feeding into a bullish market forecast that some see topping $6,400. Then there’s BlockDAG, still in presale but already priced at $0.0276 in Batch 29, with confirmed listings, live product demos, and aggressive growth projections. This blend of established momentum and new-entry potential is defining the week’s most popular cryptocurrency narratives. TRON Price Target Gains Strength from Rising Channel Momentum TRON’s technical structure is drawing attention after a consistent 90-day uptrend that has kept most long-term holders in profit. The coin is trading near $0.34, just below the $0.36–$0.45 resistance zone that has capped gains for years. This range also sits along the upper boundary of a rising channel in place since 2019, a breakout here could trigger a macro-level shift. Analysts see two primary TRON (TRX) price targets in play: $0.60 and $0.90, aligned with the channel’s upper extension. The argument is strengthened by TRON’s deflationary model, with more than 40 billion TRX burned since inception and an average 1.2 billion TRX removed from circulation each month. The combination of sustained network activity, reduced supply, and historical trend alignment is creating a favorable setup. For traders, the key will be whether TRX can break above its resistance zone with enough volume to sustain momentum toward those targets. Ethereum Market Forecast Rises on Whale Accumulation Ethereum’s latest market narrative is being shaped by a wave of large-scale buying. More than 1.8 million ETH has been accumulated by major holders over the past month, a signal many see as a precursor to a significant price move. This has revived discussions about the Ethereum (ETH) market forecast, with some calling for a push toward $6,400 if current resistance levels are cleared. The buying spree follows a relatively calm period for ETH, during which prices held between $3,500 and $3,800 before breaking the $4,000 mark for the first time this year. Increased on-chain activity, combined with favorable regulatory and institutional trends, is bolstering the bullish case. Wall Street strategist Tom Lee has even suggested a longer-term potential of $16,000, comparing ETH’s stage now to Bitcoin’s in 2017. While optimism is high, analysts note that a breakout will require stronger trading volume and consistent follow-through from whale buyers. BlockDAG Targets Over 2,660% ROI with Listings and Live Demos BlockDAG is appearing as one of the most popular cryptocurrency stories of the year thanks to its aggressive growth forecast and hands-on technology demonstrations. Currently in Batch 29 of its presale, BDAG is priced at $0.0276, with an estimated launch price of $0.05. Having already raised over $375 million, the project has analysts projecting potential post-launch gains of over 2,660% if adoption targets are met. One of BlockDAG’s biggest strengths is its pre-secured exchange presence. Confirmed listings on 20 platforms, including MEXC, BitMart, and LBank, mean liquidity and accessibility from day one, critical factors for sustaining early market momentum. Equally important is the July 23 live demo showcasing the X1 mobile miner and X10 hardware miner in action. The X1 app, already boasting over 2.5 million users, allows BDAG mining without expensive hardware, while the X10 device offers up to 200 BDAG per day. Together, they demonstrate a functioning ecosystem before launch, a rarity in the presale space. This mix of tangible technology, confirmed exchange access, and high-end ROI potential sets BlockDAG apart from speculative presales, making it a top choice in discussions about the best performing crypto today, and a project many expect to dominate headlines well into next year. The Bottom Line TRON’s price target toward $0.60 and $0.90, Ethereum’s whale-driven market forecast, and BlockDAG’s over 2,660% ROI potential each highlight different paths to crypto growth. TRON offers a steady, trend-backed climb fueled by deflationary supply mechanics. Ethereum’s setup is more momentum-driven, tied closely to whale confidence and institutional adoption trends. BlockDAG, meanwhile, combines the accessibility of a low presale price with the credibility of confirmed exchange listings and a live product ecosystem, creating a compelling narrative for investors seeking early-stage upside. As the market weighs established blue chips against fast-rising challengers, these three stories are shaping the conversation around the most popular cryptocurrency investments right now, offering a range of risk profiles and potential rewards for different types of traders.

This rapid unwind, part of a larger $409 million futures liquidation over the past 24 hours across major exchanges, highlights the inherent volatility and risks in leveraged trading. When such significant cryptocurrency liquidations occur, it sends ripples throughout the entire digital asset ecosystem, leaving many traders grappling with substantial losses. Understanding the mechanics behind these sudden market movements is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space, especially concerning Bitcoin futures and other altcoin derivatives. What Exactly is Futures Liquidation in Crypto? For those new to the derivatives market, futures liquidation might sound complex. Simply put, it occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. Traders use leverage to amplify their potential returns, borrowing funds to open larger positions than their initial capital would allow. However, this also magnifies potential losses. If the market moves sharply against their position, the exchange steps in to prevent the trader from incurring a negative balance, forcibly closing the trade. Leverage: Allows traders to control large positions with a small amount of capital. Margin Call: When a trader’s margin falls below a certain level, they may receive a request for more funds. Automatic Closure: If margin is not topped up or price moves further, the position is liquidated. Why Does Crypto Market Volatility Lead to Such Events? The recent wave of futures liquidation is a direct consequence of the cryptocurrency market’s notorious volatility. Unlike traditional markets, crypto assets can experience extreme price swings within very short periods. These rapid movements, often triggered by macro-economic news, regulatory announcements, or even large whale movements, can quickly push leveraged positions past their liquidation price. When one large liquidation occurs, it can create a cascade, forcing other positions to close, further accelerating price movements and leading to more liquidations – a phenomenon often called a “liquidation cascade.” Consider the scenario: a trader opens a highly leveraged long position on Bitcoin, expecting its price to rise. If Bitcoin suddenly drops by 5-10% in minutes, their margin might no longer be sufficient, triggering a swift liquidation. This quick downturn in Bitcoin futures can have a domino effect across the market. Understanding Leveraged Trading Risks: A Crucial Lesson The significant sum of $103 million worth of futures liquidated serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with leveraged trading. While it offers the allure of amplified profits, it equally amplifies losses. Many traders, especially newcomers, might underestimate the speed at which their capital can be wiped out in a volatile market. Responsible trading practices involve understanding and managing these risks effectively. Key takeaways for managing risk: Start Small: Use low leverage, especially when beginning. Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Risk Management: Never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Market Awareness: Stay informed about market news and trends that could impact prices. What Does This Mean for the Cryptocurrency Liquidations Landscape? Such large-scale liquidations often precede or accompany significant price corrections. They can clear out excessive leverage from the market, potentially setting the stage for more stable price action in the future. However, they also instill fear and uncertainty, leading some investors to pull back. For experienced traders, these events can present opportunities to enter positions at more favorable prices, but only with careful planning and robust risk management strategies. The immediate impact is often a sharp drop, but the long-term effect depends on broader market sentiment and fundamental developments. The recent events underscore the importance of caution and informed decision-making in the fast-paced world of digital assets. While the promise of high returns is tempting, the reality of high risks, as demonstrated by the recent futures liquidation figures, demands respect and careful consideration. Navigating the Future: Lessons from the Liquidation Wave The $103 million futures liquidation event is a powerful reminder that the crypto market operates with extreme sensitivity to leverage. Traders and investors should prioritize education and sound risk management over chasing quick profits. Understanding the tools available, such as stop-loss orders and proper position sizing, becomes paramount. Furthermore, diversifying one’s portfolio and not putting all eggs in one basket, especially in highly volatile assets like Bitcoin futures , can cushion the blow during downturns. This incident also serves as a market “reset,” flushing out over-leveraged positions and potentially leading to a healthier market structure in the long run. While painful for those affected, such events are a natural part of maturing, albeit still nascent, financial markets. In conclusion, the recent futures liquidation across major exchanges underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. The rapid loss of $103 million worth of futures liquidated within an hour, alongside the broader $409 million futures liquidation over 24 hours, serves as a critical lesson in risk management. For both novice and seasoned traders, understanding the mechanisms of leverage, implementing strict risk controls, and staying informed about market conditions are not just recommendations, but necessities for navigating the volatile waters of crypto trading successfully. These events, while disruptive, are integral to the market’s ongoing evolution, highlighting both its immense potential and its inherent dangers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is a futures liquidation in cryptocurrency trading? A futures liquidation occurs when an exchange automatically closes a trader’s leveraged position because their margin balance falls below a required level. This happens to prevent further losses and ensure the trader does not incur a negative balance. Q2: Why did such a large futures liquidation event occur recently? Large liquidations are often triggered by significant and rapid price movements in the highly volatile crypto market. When prices move sharply against leveraged positions, traders’ margins become insufficient, leading to forced closures and a potential cascade effect. Q3: How can traders protect themselves from being liquidated? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin, and practicing sound risk management. It’s crucial to never risk more capital than you can afford to lose. Q4: Does a futures liquidation impact the broader crypto market? Yes, large-scale liquidations can cause significant price drops, increase market volatility, and create a sense of fear or uncertainty among investors. However, they can also clear out excessive leverage, potentially leading to a healthier, more stable market in the long run. Q5: What is the primary difference between futures trading and spot trading? Spot trading involves buying or selling cryptocurrencies for immediate delivery at the current market price. Futures trading, on the other hand, involves agreements to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date, often utilizing leverage, which amplifies both potential gains and losses.

50137367,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=805223,1755273631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/50137367.jpeg,Here’s Why Bitcoin And Ethereum Prices Are Crashing,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-and-ethereum-crashing/,"The Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have crashed significantly in the last 24 hours. This follows developments on the macro end, which have sparked a bearish sentiment among investors, leading to a wave of sell-offs. Why Bitcoin and Ethereum Prices Are Crashing CoinMarketCap data shows that the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices are crashing, down over 3% and 2%, respectively, in the last 24 hours. This crash is partly thanks to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s statement about the proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In a Fox Business Interview, he said that the country won’t be buying Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $124,400 ATH, Ethereum Next In Line, What’s Driving It? However, Bessent added that they have no plans to sell the Bitcoin they currently hold, which he claimed is worth between $15 and $20 billion. Instead of buying, the U.S. government plans to use only confiscated assets and opt against selling them. Investors viewed Bessent’s statement as bearish, considering that Donald Trump’s executive order establishing the strategic reserve said the U.S. would consider ways to buy more Bitcoin. Furthermore, Bessent’s statement had also suggested that the U.S. Congress wasn’t going to follow through with Senator Cynthia’s BITCOIN Act. This bill proposes that the country will buy 1 million BTC over five years. The market has been pricing in the possibility of this happening, given its bullish implications for the Bitcoin price and the Ethereum price by extension. However, a positive for the Bitcoin and Ethereum prices is the fact that Bessent’s statement about the current value of the U.S. BTC holdings shows that they haven’t sold their coins. There were earlier reports that the U.S. had sold a significant portion of its Bitcoin holdings after the U.S. Marshals said they held only 28,988.356 BTC in response to an FOIA request. Arkham data shows that the U.S. holds 198,022 BTC, worth around $23 billion. U.S. PPI Data Contributes To Crash The U.S. PPI data that was released yesterday also contributed to the Bitcoin and Ethereum price crash. Data from the Labor Department showed that PPI inflation rose to 3.3% year-on-year (YoY) in July, which was way above expectations of 2.5%. Meanwhile, the monthly PPI came in at 0.9%, also way above the expected 0.2%. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Ethereum Price Is Rallying Toward New All-Time Highs Bitcoin and Ethereum had witnessed a sharp drop following the release of the data. The PPI data is bearish for crypto prices because it could make the Fed reconsider cutting rates at the September FOMC meeting. Before the PPI release, CME Fedwatch data had shown that there was a 99% chance that the Fed would make a 25 basis point cut in September. However, these odds have dropped to around 93%. Although this suggests that the Fed will still cut rates, rising inflation in the U.S. isn’t good for Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, since it could restrain how much investors can invest in these risk assets.

However, the price has quickly reversed, indicating a bull trap, increasing the likelihood of a sideways consolidation within the $116K-$124K range. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin buyers successfully pushed the asset above its previous all-time high, recording a new peak at $124.4K. However, this breakout was short-lived, as heavy selling pressure swiftly reversed the move, trapping late long entries, a classic bull trap. The retracement has now brought BTC back toward a key confluence support zone around $118K, aligning closely with the ascending channel’s lower boundary. This area will be crucial in determining whether the long-term bullish trend remains intact. A decisive breakdown from this level could open the path toward deeper supports, while a rebound here could reignite bullish momentum. The 4-Hour Chart In the 4-hour timeframe, the recent action clearly shows a classic liquidity hunt, price swept above the recent high (BSL), triggering breakout buys and stop-loss orders, before reversing sharply. Subsequently, the asset experienced a cascade, breaking below the most recent swing low (MSS), signaling the early signs of a potential market structure shift. Currently, Bitcoin appears to be consolidating within a range between $116K and $124K. Until price breaks convincingly out of this range, short-term movements are likely to remain choppy, with traders focusing on liquidity pools at both range boundaries. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets Recent on-chain data shows a sharp spike in Binance’s Mean Inflow (7-day SMA), reaching one of the highest readings in recent months. This metric tracks the average amount of BTC being deposited to the exchange, and such jumps often align with preparation for selling, collateralizing margin positions, or institutional portfolio rebalancing. Sustained high inflows indicate that more BTC is being transferred from external wallets into Binance’s trading wallets. Historically, significant inflow surges — when not met with equally strong buying demand have often preceded periods of short-term selling pressure. Supporting this signal, positive netflow (inflows exceeding outflows) has also risen, confirming that Binance’s total BTC balance is increasing rather than being offset by withdrawals. Without matching spot demand, this imbalance can tilt the market toward short-term downside volatility, particularly if large holders are preparing to sell or hedge positions via derivatives.

For anyone tracking the confluence of technology and finance, particularly within the cryptocurrency and broader tech ecosystem, the app’s financial performance is nothing short of astounding. Since its launch in May 2023, the mobile version of OpenAI’s groundbreaking chatbot has not just entered the market; it has absolutely redefined it, achieving a staggering $2 billion in global consumer spending. How Has the ChatGPT Mobile App Achieved Such Monumental Success? The numbers speak volumes about ChatGPT’s rapid ascent. This remarkable figure, according to an analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures, is approximately 30 times the combined lifetime spending of its closest mobile rivals, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok. This isn’t just a win; it’s a landslide victory that highlights ChatGPT’s unparalleled traction with users globally. Looking at the year-to-date performance (January-July 2025), the ChatGPT mobile app has already generated $1.35 billion. This represents an incredible 673 percent year-over-year increase from the $174 million it earned during the same period in 2024. On average, the app is pulling in close to $193 million per month, a significant jump from last year’s $25 million monthly average. To put this into perspective, ChatGPT’s average monthly consumer spending is about 53 times higher than its next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date, averaging $3.6 million per month. This stark contrast underscores ChatGPT’s overwhelming lead in the AI app revenue landscape. Here’s a snapshot of the mobile AI app market, highlighting ChatGPT’s commanding lead: Metric ChatGPT Grok Claude Copilot Lifetime Global Spending $2 Billion ~$25.6 Million (YTD) (Lower than ChatGPT) (Lower than ChatGPT) Avg. Monthly Spending (Current) ~$193 Million ~$3.6 Million – – Spending Per Download (Global) $2.91 $0.75 $2.55 $0.28 Spending Per Download (U.S.) $10 – – – Lifetime Global Downloads 690 Million 39.5 Million – – What Does This Mean for the Generative AI Landscape? The impressive figures for ChatGPT’s mobile app highlight a clear trend: consumers are rapidly adopting Generative AI tools, and they are willing to pay for premium experiences. While these numbers offer a compelling window into app store traction, it’s crucial to remember that they don’t paint a complete picture of these AI companies’ overall revenue streams. Companies like OpenAI also generate substantial revenue through web subscriptions, enterprise plans, and API usage, which cater to a broader range of users, teams, and businesses. However, the mobile app data is invaluable for understanding consumer behavior. It shows where users are discovering, engaging with, and ultimately investing in these AI assistants. The ease of access and intuitive interface offered by mobile applications play a significant role in widespread adoption, especially for everyday use cases. Navigating the Mobile AI Market: A Tale of Two Strategies The competitive dynamics within the Mobile AI market are also illuminated by this data. While ChatGPT launched its mobile app in May 2023, xAI’s Grok, for instance, initially integrated its chatbot within the X platform (formerly Twitter) after its November 2023 launch. Grok only became available as a standalone iOS app in early January 2025 and on Google Play in March 2025. This later entry into the dedicated mobile app ecosystem likely contributed to its comparatively lower download and revenue figures. Despite Grok’s later start, the disparities in spending per download are striking: ChatGPT: $2.91 (Global), $10 (U.S.) Claude: $2.55 Grok: $0.75 Copilot: $0.28 In the U.S., ChatGPT’s per-download spending is exceptionally high, accounting for 38% of the app’s total lifetime revenue. Germany follows as the second-largest market, contributing 5.3%. The Global Reach of Consumer Chatbots: Downloads Tell a Story Beyond revenue, downloads underscore the global reach and user preference for consumer chatbots . ChatGPT has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, vastly outperforming Grok’s 39.5 million downloads. This significant lead in installations helps contextualize recent discussions, such as Elon Musk’s complaints about the App Store’s alleged favoritism towards ChatGPT in its Top Charts. Average monthly downloads for ChatGPT globally now stand at approximately 45 million, marking a substantial 180% increase from about 16 million in January through July of 2024. In 2025 alone, the app has seen 318 million downloads, which is 2.8 times more than the 113 million recorded during the same period last year. Interestingly, while the U.S. leads in revenue generation, India is the top market by install count, accounting for 13.7% of ChatGPT’s lifetime downloads, with the U.S. in second place at 10.3%. Conclusion: ChatGPT’s Enduring Mobile Supremacy The data unequivocally demonstrates ChatGPT’s dominant position in the mobile AI application space. Its ability to generate billions in revenue and attract hundreds of millions of downloads solidifies its status as the leading consumer-facing AI product. While competitors are making strides, the gap remains substantial, indicating that OpenAI’s early mover advantage, continuous innovation, and user-centric approach have created a formidable barrier to entry. The future of AI is undeniably mobile, and for now, ChatGPT reigns supreme, setting a high bar for what is possible in the rapidly expanding world of artificial intelligence.

According to SMQKE, SWIFT messages function much like one-way emails, meaning transactions cannot be fully settled until each party has manually screened them. This separation between messaging and settlement introduces delays and additional administrative steps. Ripple’s system addresses this by synchronizing the messaging flow that covers the transaction information, status updates, and related data, with the actual movement of value through XRP. This ensures that communication and settlement occur simultaneously, linking confirmation to the actual execution of the transfer. Instant Connectivity and Deterministic Outcomes The documentation referenced by SMQKE explains that Ripple’s approach enables banks to connect within milliseconds, allowing settlements to either succeed or fail in real time. This removes the uncertainty present in traditional cross-border payments, where messages often pass through multiple intermediaries before funds are cleared. By aligning the transmission of payment instructions with the actual transfer of funds, Ripple creates a process in which settlement status is immediately clear, eliminating the need for separate reconciliation after the fact. HOW RIPPLE IS USING XRP TO TRANSFORM SWIFT MESSAGES INTO REAL-TIME ISO 20022 COMPLIANT TRANSACTIONS SWIFT messages are traditionally one-way, much like emails. This means transactions cannot be fully settled until each party has manually screened them. Ripple improves… pic.twitter.com/IG8jpXVDrW — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 14, 2025 Integration With Existing Banking Infrastructure SMQKE points out that Ripple integrates directly with a bank’s existing databases and ledgers. This integration enables a faster, two-way communication protocol compared to SWIFT’s one-directional message flow. Through this approach, banks exchange updates and confirmations as value moves, providing both real-time transparency and operational efficiency. The ability to integrate without requiring a complete overhaul of internal systems is presented as a key advantage for financial institutions considering adoption. Liquidity Provision and Settlement in Seconds The tweet highlights the role of XRP in enabling immediate liquidity on both sides of a transaction. By synchronizing message transmission and value transfer, Ripple’s system allows counterparties to settle in seconds. This reduces the reliance on pre-funded nostro accounts and supports just-in-time liquidity, which can lower capital requirements for participating banks. The use of XRP as a bridge asset is central to achieving these settlement speeds while maintaining the ability to operate across multiple fiat currencies.

This compliance is important for institutions seeking to maintain compatibility with the SWIFT network and other ISO 20022-enabled systems. It also positions Ripple as a standards-aligned solution capable of fitting into existing regulatory and operational frameworks without sacrificing speed or functionality. Market Recognition and Technological Positioning The referenced documentation describes Ripple as “the most advanced startup in this field,” underscoring its dual focus on blockchain settlement and financial messaging. By combining these two components into a single, integrated process, Ripple provides a framework that can meet modern demands for speed, transparency, and compliance in cross-border payments.

Yet, while momentum has slowed, the charts still indicate a generally bullish structure, with multiple key support levels remaining firmly in place. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the XRP/USDT daily chart, the price is currently trading near the $3.10 mark, facing a strong resistance zone around $3.40. This follows a breakout above the $2.70 range in July, which has now flipped into a support area. Both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are also trending upward and recently formed a bullish crossover around $2.45, reinforcing the medium-term bullish sentiment. If the $3.40 resistance breaks, a push toward the critical $4.00 range becomes likely. However, the RSI hovering near the neutral 50 level suggests a lack of strong momentum for now, meaning a short-term pullback into the $2.80 support zone is still possible. This zone will be key for maintaining the bullish structure. Losing it could open the door for a deeper correction toward the 200-day moving average located around the $2.40 mark. Yet, as long as the price stays above the moving averages, the broader trend remains bullish. The BTC Pair Looking at the XRP/BTC chart, the pair has recently pulled back after hitting the 3,000 SAT resistance, with the price currently around 2,600 SAT. This follows a clean breakout above the long-term descending channel and a successful retest of its upper boundary, which coincided with the 200-day moving average and the 2,400 SAT support zone. This confluence remains a key bullish technical factor, as holding above it could attract renewed buying pressure. That said, RSI levels around 48 show that momentum has cooled after the sharp July rally, meaning XRP may continue ranging between 2,400 SAT and 3,000 SAT in the near term. A decisive close above 3,000 SAT would likely open the path to the 3,400 SAT zone, while losing 2,400 SAT could shift the bias back toward 2,000 SAT support. For now, the structure still favors the bulls as long as higher lows remain intact.

The two frontrunners, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, are being challenged by Dogelon Mars in the race to $0.01. Shiba Inu and Dogelon Mars are planning to compete with Dogecoin in the foreseeable future.

DOGE Is Closer Than SHIB, But Still Faces the Weight of Legacy Dogecoin has stood the test of time better than most expected. Due to its active community and regular support from Elon Musk, Dogecoin has managed to survive multiple market cycles. One issue, however, is Dogecoin's limited uses and the fact that it is an older blockchain, which newer ones are constantly outpacing in development. While it does have a strong cultural significance and a lower token supply, reaching a value of $1 is not likely to happen anytime soon. In contrast, Shiba Inu, despite a vibrant ecosystem and the launch of Shibarium, remains bogged down by its trillion-token supply, requiring enormous market cap growth to reach $1. Even bullish analysts only foresee SHIB hitting fractions over the next few years. Between the two, DOGE clearly has the upper hand in reaching the $1 mark, but it’s still years away unless a market mania-level surge reappears. That’s where Little Pepe comes in—not just as a meme, but as an ecosystem optimized for speed, adoption, and viral growth. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): A Meme Coin With Real Utility and Zero Tax Now in Stage 10 and selling for only $0.0019, Little Pepe is the native utility token of the Little Pepe Layer 2 blockchain, built to redefine the meme coin landscape. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype and community, Little Pepe comes fully packed with infrastructure: A fast, EVM-compatible Layer 2 chain built for meme coins Ultra-low gas fees and instant finality A sniper-bot-proof trading environment—a first in crypto Zero buy and sell tax, making it perfect for active traders and DeFi lovers Its smart contracts are secured by one of the most reputable firms in the blockchain industry, Certik. This level of due diligence is rare in the meme coin world and in turn, boosts credibility and investor confidence. With a fixed listing price of $0.003, current buyers at $0.0019 are positioned to gain over 57% instantly upon launch—and that's before factoring in organic growth or CEX listing surges. Why $LILPEPE Could Hit $1 Before DOGE The secret to Little Pepe’s rapid rise lies in its strategic design. The project isn’t just about virality—it’s about velocity. Its tokenomics, capped tax-free structure, and aggressive roadmap (now way ahead of schedule) are crafted to drive both utility and hype. Additionally, the project is backed by anonymous meme veterans who’ve helped several top meme coins reach multi-million-dollar market caps. And with plans to launch on two major centralized exchanges immediately post-presale—and a roadmap targeting the biggest global exchange—visibility and access won’t be an issue. More importantly, Little Pepe is positioned in a way that neither DOGE ever was in their infancy: as a meme coin with its own blockchain, one that hosts a dedicated memes Launchpad, a growing DeFi ecosystem, and community governance in the pipeline. These features give it more in common with early-stage Solana or Polygon than with traditional meme tokens. With its strong fundamentals and high-octane community support, Little Pepe’s journey to $1 could come faster than anyone expects—and certainly before DOGE finishes its own marathon. Conclusion: The Meme Coin Race Has a New Front-Runner While Dogecoin may have the edge over Shiba Inu in the race to $1, it’s Little Pepe that could surprise the market entirely by beating both of them to the punch. Backed by advanced tech, Certik-level trust, and meme-powered virality, Little Pepe is more than just hype—it’s a hypercharged, next-gen meme coin ready to dominate. If you're looking for the next breakout star in crypto's meme arena, this frog might just out-hop the dog.

Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with significant insights from Glassnode co-founders Jan Hapel and Jan Aleman. They shed light on what appears to be deliberate crypto market manipulation by powerful entities, influencing the market for strategic gains. What’s Driving the Recent Bitcoin Price Decline? Hapel and Aleman, through their X account, brought a critical observation to the forefront. They reported that influential market makers are actively depositing substantial amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) onto exchanges. This isn’t random; it’s a calculated maneuver designed to exploit existing market weakness. Their primary objective? To deliberately drive down the Bitcoin price decline and that of Ethereum. This creates an environment where they can acquire assets at more favorable, lower prices. Unpacking Sophisticated Market Maker Strategies Market makers are pivotal players in financial markets, providing liquidity by simultaneously quoting both buy and sell prices. However, their role can extend beyond mere facilitation. The Glassnode founders highlight specific market maker strategies currently in play. Increased Sell Pressure: By depositing large volumes of BTC and ETH, they artificially inflate the available supply on exchanges. Exploiting Weakness: This increased supply, coupled with existing bearish sentiment, amplifies selling pressure, leading to price drops. Accumulation Phase: Their ultimate goal is to buy back these assets at significantly lower prices, accumulating a larger position before the next upward movement. Understanding these tactics is crucial for any investor navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Is This Crypto Market Manipulation a Hidden Opportunity? While the notion of crypto market manipulation might sound alarming, Glassnode’s founders offer a compelling silver lining. They emphasize that these very movements, characterized by short-term price suppression, often serve as a clear prelude to the next significant uptrend. This perspective shifts the narrative from fear to potential. Their advice is straightforward: if you missed the initial surge or feel you’re behind, this short-term decline could be your golden chance. It provides an opportune window to strategically enter or expand your holdings, setting the stage for future gains. Strategic Steps for Building Crypto Positions This current market dynamic presents a prime opportunity for building crypto positions effectively. Instead of succumbing to panic or despair, consider adopting a more strategic, long-term approach: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Commit to investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy mitigates risk and averages out your purchase price over time. Set Limit Buy Orders: Utilize exchange features to place buy orders at specific, lower price points. This allows you to automatically acquire assets if the price drops to your desired level. Conduct Thorough Research: Focus on cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, and robust development teams. Informed decisions are key during volatile periods. Maintain a Long-Term Outlook: Recognize that short-term price fluctuations are part of the market cycle. Focus on your long-term investment goals rather than reacting to daily volatility. Navigating Current Cryptocurrency Trends with Insight The broader landscape of cryptocurrency trends is inherently cyclical, characterized by periods of rapid growth, consolidation, and sometimes, strategic pullbacks. Market makers play a significant role in these cycles, creating volatility that, while unsettling, can be highly profitable for informed and patient participants. Staying updated with data-driven insights, such as on-chain analytics provided by platforms like Glassnode, empowers investors. This knowledge allows you to differentiate between genuine market downturns and engineered price suppressions, enabling smarter, more confident investment decisions. The insights from Glassnode founders underscore a critical aspect of the crypto market: what appears to be a downturn driven by market makers can, in fact, be a strategic setup for future growth. By understanding these dynamics and employing smart investment tactics, you can transform perceived market weakness into a powerful opportunity for building crypto positions . This period might just be the crucial dip you’ve been waiting for to strengthen your portfolio. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is crypto market manipulation? A1: Crypto market manipulation refers to deliberate actions taken by individuals or entities, often large players like market makers, to artificially influence the price of cryptocurrencies for their own financial gain, typically by creating false supply or demand. Q2: Who are market makers in the cryptocurrency space? A2: Market makers are professional trading firms or individuals who provide liquidity to markets by simultaneously placing both buy and sell orders. They profit from the bid-ask spread, but can also use their influence to strategically move prices. Q3: How do market makers drive down prices? A3: They can drive down prices by depositing large amounts of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) onto exchanges, increasing the available supply and creating sell pressure. This can lead to a temporary price decline, allowing them to buy back assets at lower costs. Q4: Is now a good time to buy Bitcoin or Ethereum? A4: According to Glassnode founders, short-term declines driven by market makers can be a prelude to the next uptrend. This suggests it could be an opportune time to consider building or adding to your positions, especially using strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging. Q5: What is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)? A5: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money into an asset at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of its price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of volatility and averages out your purchase price over time. Q6: How can I protect myself from market manipulation? A6: While complete protection is difficult, staying informed through reputable sources like Glassnode, understanding market cycles, diversifying your portfolio, and using long-term strategies like DCA can help mitigate risks associated with market manipulation.

50140840,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-vs-kaspa-two-speed-focused-networks-one-clear-winner-in-2025/,1755277216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/50140840.jpeg,"BlockDAG vs Kaspa: Two Speed-Focused Networks, One Clear Winner in 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-vs-kaspa-two-speed-focused-networks-one-clear-winner-in-2025/,"Speed has become the defining metric for next-generation blockchains, and both Kaspa and BlockDAG are leveraging DAG-based architectures to push transaction throughput to new highs. But while Kaspa has already proven itself on public markets, BlockDAG is in the middle of what could become the largest Layer-1 presale in seven years — with $376 million raised so far and Batch 29 pricing at $0.0276. Kaspa has built a loyal following thanks to its GHOSTDAG consensus, which enables faster block times without sacrificing decentralization. Its ability to process multiple blocks per second gives it a significant technical advantage over older chains. On the market side, Kaspa’s circulating supply and active trading base have given it stability, and its price trajectory over the past year has rewarded long-term holders. However, Kaspa’s growth curve is now more incremental, meaning that while it remains a strong performer in the Layer-1 space, the exponential upside has already been partially realized by early investors. That’s where BlockDAG enters the conversation. BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum and Infrastructure Depth BlockDAG isn’t just adopting a DAG structure — it’s combining it with Proof-of-Work to achieve up to 10 blocks per second while maintaining high security. This hybrid architecture is designed for both speed and resilience, giving it scalability that rivals Kaspa’s while appealing to miners who want sustainable rewards. The presale’s numbers speak volumes: $376M raised, 25B coins sold, 200,000 holders onboarded, and 19,000 ASIC miners purchased. With a $600M presale target, BlockDAG is already past the halfway point, and investor demand in Batch 29 at $0.0276 remains intense. Many analysts believe this is the final phase before a public listing at $0.05 — with speculation of a $1 rally in the months following. Kaspa’s ecosystem is still largely in the early stages of dApp development, with most of its community engagement focused on the token itself. BlockDAG, on the other hand, has rolled out a multi-pronged adoption plan even before listing. Its EVM compatibility makes it instantly accessible to Ethereum developers, and over 4,500 builders are already working on 300+ dApps for the network. Consumer adoption is also a strength. The X1 mobile miner app has more than 2.5M users mining BDAG from their phones, creating a grassroots network effect that Kaspa never had at launch. Add to this high-visibility partnerships with Inter Milan and other sports brands, and BlockDAG is positioning itself as a household name rather than a purely technical project. Key Milestones Fueling BlockDAG’s Momentum BlockDAG’s remarkable growth is a direct result of strategic milestones that have effectively cultivated investor interest and community engagement. These include: Financial Success: Over $376 million raised in record time, with funding accelerating rapidly across recent batches. Strong Community Backing: More than 200,000 committed holders pre-listing, demonstrating profound grassroots support. Expansive Mobile Mining Network: Over 2.5 million users on the X1 mobile miner, establishing one of the world’s largest pre-launch mining communities. Decentralized Hashrate Assurance: Sales of over 19,000 hardware miners, guaranteeing a robust and decentralized hashrate upon launch. Thriving Developer Ecosystem: A vibrant community of over 4,500 developers actively building within the ecosystem, with more than 300 dApps poised for mainnet deployment. Rigorous Security Validation: Successful completion of security audits by Halborn and CertiK, with all findings addressed to ensure comprehensive network integrity. Furthermore, the Primordial Testnet is currently live, with a six-week roadmap leading to the highly anticipated full mainnet launch. Each milestone reinforces the project’s credibility — a crucial factor in an industry where overpromising and underdelivering is common. Why BlockDAG Might Outpace Kaspa in 2025 For Kaspa to deliver a 20x return from its current levels, it would require a market cap expansion into the upper tiers of global crypto rankings — possible, but challenging. BlockDAG, starting from a presale base of $0.0276, only needs a 36x move to hit $1. Given its locked-in holder base, mining activity, and presale demand, a supply squeeze post-listing could drive aggressive price action. While $1 is an ambitious target, it’s within reach if momentum carries over into public trading and exchange liquidity is strong. Both projects are built for speed and scalability, but BlockDAG’s presale structure, early adoption metrics, and marketing strategy give it a growth curve that’s still in its infancy. Kaspa is a solid, established performer — but BlockDAG offers something Kaspa no longer can: early-stage exponential upside.

Instead of purchasing expensive hardware setups, anyone with a smartphone can now mine BDAG coins directly through a lightweight, energy-efficient process. This “tap-to-mine” design has already attracted over 2.5 million users globally, making it one of the largest mobile-based mining communities in existence. At the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276, every user entering through the app is participating in the presale well below the confirmed listing price of $0.05. That means early participants are effectively positioned for an 81% return before public trading begins. The X1 Miner is not just a promotional tool—it’s a central part of BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof-of-Work + DAG framework, designed to bring new users directly into the ecosystem while giving them a tangible role in its growth. With $373M raised so far and momentum accelerating toward the $600M presale target, the app has become the front door for mass adoption. Mobile Mining at Scale Unlike traditional mining methods that demand costly ASIC rigs and high energy output, the X1 app relies on background validation processes that run smoothly without draining a phone’s battery. This makes mining possible even in regions where energy costs or hardware availability typically limit participation. The onboarding process is quick and intuitive, users can download, register, and begin mining in under a minute. Early adopters are already earning daily BDAG allocations, which both reinforce network activity and provide personal benefits tied to future price increases. The global reach of the app explains BlockDAG’s rapid user expansion, with adoption stretching across multiple continents. What’s more, the X1 Miner isn’t just providing passive benefits; it’s channeling participants directly into BlockDAG’s presale. Many who begin by mining eventually transition into direct BDAG purchases, especially while Batch 29 pricing remains at $0.0276. With the $0.05 listing price already set, entry today offers a compelling upside. A Catalyst for the $600M Goal The X1 Miner is more than a utility app—it’s become one of the largest onboarding funnels in the market. By simplifying mining to a single tap, BlockDAG has been able to channel millions into the presale effort, which has already surpassed $373 million. Each participant helps secure the network while also creating steady demand for BDAG, linking mining directly with presale momentum. This combination of grassroots adoption and structured fundraising is why analysts describe BlockDAG’s approach as uniquely positioned for growth. The snowball effect is clear: once users are introduced to the ecosystem through the X1 app, they are more likely to expand their involvement through direct purchases, staking, or participation in decentralized applications. This strategy accelerates the path to the $600M presale goal, ensuring BlockDAG maintains strong traction long before its official listing. The $1 Post-Listing Outlook Although the confirmed listing price sits at $0.05, discussions around BlockDAG’s potential trajectory are already turning toward higher milestones. Many analysts project a run toward $1 within the first major cycle after launch. That would represent a 36x increase from the current presale price of $0.0276. The X1 Miner app plays a key role in this forecast. With its ability to onboard new participants continuously, it ensures both network stability and liquidity. As more miners join, transaction capacity expands, which draws in developers, decentralized applications, and enterprise-level projects. BlockDAG now counts 4,500+ developers working on 300+ dApps, many of which will integrate the X1 user base directly into their ecosystems. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: users mine BDAG, spend within the network, and contribute back to its growth. Such adoption mechanics help support not just short-term listing success but long-term value stability. Final Thoughts The BlockDAG X1 Miner app has moved beyond being a crypto experiment. It’s proving to be a scaling engine for the entire network. With Batch 29 priced at $0.0276, more than $373M already raised, and the presale charging toward $600M, the app shows that mainstream adoption can be achieved without complexity or costly setups. If current trends hold and BlockDAG’s listing momentum pushes toward $1, those joining through the X1 app today could be the ones securing early life-changing returns tomorrow. By bridging accessibility with real ecosystem value, BlockDAG is showing how mobile mining can anchor one of the strongest growth stories in 2025.

50139536,557523,1755277222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50139536.jpeg,Ethereum Tipped To Be The Biggest Macro Trade of The Next Decade – Tom Lee,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-the-biggest-macro-trade/,"As cryptocurrency gained significant recognition in the financial sector, Ethereum is experiencing notable adoption at the institutional level, with big firms hoarding the altcoin in their treasury reserves . Following this massive wave of accumulation from individuals and institutions, Tom Lee believes ETH could become the leading asset in the future, as the financial system evolves. The Next Biggest Investment Story Is Ethereum In the midst of robust adoption and interest in Ethereum, Tom Lee , the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, has dropped a bullish comment about the altcoin’s future in the financial world. His bullish remarks on ETH come as the asset demonstrates significant upward performance, drawing closer to its all-time high. During an interview on the CNBC Squawk Box, Tom Lee made a bold proclamation that Ethereum is poised to become the biggest macro trade opportunity in the next 10 to 15 years. Lee’s statement is backed by ETH’s growing role in tokenization, decentralized finance, and blockchain infrastructure. Ethereum’s network effects and usefulness put it in a position to play a revolutionary role in the global digital economy. In addition to being a cryptocurrency, the founder’s prediction paints ETH as a long-term, highly conviction investment that is set to revolutionize technology and banking. One of the major factors that solidifies Lee’s claim is the notable role of stablecoins on the ETH network, which has become the ChatGPT moment for crypto. Adding to this is the recently signed GENIUS Act and the Project Crypto from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reflecting Wall Street’s growing interest in the blockchain landscape. As Ethereum gains ground in the financial sector, the founder stated that the Ethereum treasury is revolutionizing exposure to the altcoin, becoming the best approach in recent times. When asked about his unwavering bullish stance on ETH, Lee pointed to the distinction between the altcoin and Bitcoin. According to Lee, Ethereum is able to perform several programmable contracts like Smart Contracts, which Bitcoin fails to do, and Wall Street needs it. “It is the place where Wall Street is essentially financializing the system,” he added. Being the second-largest blockchain, ETH now handles the majority of stablecoin creations in the crypto sector. Prominent companies such as JP Morgan, Coinbase, and Robinhood are building their Layer 2s on Ethereum, cementing its position as a leading blockchain. ETH To Rise Beyond $7,500 Target Ethereum is seeing multiple bullish forecasts as its price surges. The most recent bullish prediction comes from Standard Chartered , which has forecasted a move to new all-time highs, particularly to the $7,500 level. Offering his insights on this bold forecast, Lee has backed the prediction, stating that the target is within the realm of expectations for this cycle. However, for the altcoin to achieve this new target, it needs to clear its current all-time high of $4,891. Once the altcoin manages to surpass its all-time high , the founder believes that $7,500 might be a low target. Considering ETH’s potential, Lee foresees a much larger rally to the $10,000 and $15,000 price range.",Ethereum|bitcoin|ChatGPT|CNBC Squawk Box|coinbase|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum treasury|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Fundstrat Global Advisors|GENIUS Act|JPMorgan|Layer 2|Robinhood|Securities and Exchange Commission|Smark contracts|stablecoin|Standard Chartered|Tom Lee|US SEC|wall street,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 17:00:22
50139597,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78556,1755277233,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"With 2.5M Global Miners in Play, BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles Put It Ahead of Solana’s $1,200 Rally and Dogecoin’s $1 Dream",https://timestabloid.com/with-2-5m-global-miners-in-play-blockdags-buyer-battles/,"Three cryptocurrencies are dominating market chatter, but they’re doing it in very different ways. Solana is drawing attention with a strong technical setup that has analysts projecting a possible run toward $1,200 by late 2025. Dogecoin remains locked in a battle with its own history, edging ever closer to the elusive $1 mark after years of hype, memes, and retail enthusiasm. But neither of these stories combines technical delivery, community engagement, and long-term adoption quite like BlockDAG . Currently in its presale’s Batch 29, BDAG has drawn over $375 million, set at $0.0276 with an estimated launch price of $0.05. Powered by 2.5 million active miners and the daily excitement of its Buyer Battles feature, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the best performing crypto today, not just in market projections, but in measurable user activity. Solana’s $1,200 Rally Prediction Gains Traction The Solana (SOL) bullish rally prediction is being fueled by a breakout from a textbook cup and handle formation, a setup that historically precedes strong upward moves. At current levels near $179, the move has already triggered bullish sentiment across technical circles, with Fibonacci extensions pointing to potential targets of $787, $1,200, and even $1,314 in the long term. Crucial to sustaining this rally will be holding key supports at $136 and $74. Analysts note that maintaining price action within its ascending channel on the weekly chart will be critical for momentum. While these levels give traders confidence, Solana’s long-term climb to $1,200 hinges on macro sentiment, liquidity inflows, and consistent developer activity on its network; factors that can shift quickly in today’s volatile market. Dogecoin’s $1 Dream Remains a Cultural Force When it comes to the Dogecoin (DOGE) market outlook, the focus is firmly on one number: $1. The meme coin has only ever crossed the $0.50 mark on 15 occasions out of more than 4,200 trading days, making it one of crypto’s toughest psychological and technical barriers. Breaking it could unleash a wave of momentum trading that may carry DOGE toward its long-awaited dollar target. This level has proven frustrating for bulls, with December 2024 marking the most recent near-miss, DOGE got within 1.5 cents of $0.50 before sellers slammed the brakes. Still, community-driven optimism keeps the $1 goal alive. With DOGE hovering close to this milestone again, traders are watching for the kind of decisive breakout that could cement it as one of the best performing crypto today. BlockDAG’s Presale Power and Buyer Battles While Solana and Dogecoin generate buzz on price predictions, BlockDAG is making headlines for a different reason; it’s actively building and engaging its ecosystem before launch. Currently in Batch 29 of its presale, BDAG is priced at $0.0276 with an estimated launch value of $0.05. The project has already raised over $375 million, putting it among the largest active presales in the market. The promise of a massive ROI post-launch isn’t just marketing; it’s backed by three major growth levers. First is the Buyer Battles feature, a gamified presale mechanic that rewards the day’s highest BDAG purchaser with an allocation of unsold tokens at no cost. This daily competition drives repeat participation, sustained liquidity inflows, and a sense of urgency rare in early-stage crypto projects. Second, BlockDAG’s Seattle sports partnerships with the Orcas cricket team and Seawolves rugby team are giving it visibility outside traditional crypto circles. These collaborations bring fan coins, NFTs, and exclusive content into the mix, tapping into global sports audiences and building real-world use cases for BDAG. Third is the rollout of Dashboard V4, a presale interface that functions like a live crypto exchange simulator. Participants can track real-time BDAG prices, wallet balances, leaderboards, and referral metrics, while engaging in a gamified buying environment that mirrors post-launch trading conditions. This feature has been crucial in reinforcing investor trust and ensuring a transparent buying process. Together, these elements have given BlockDAG something most presales lack: a functioning, engaged ecosystem before its token even hits the market. It’s this combination of technology, partnerships, and active community participation that’s putting BDAG ahead in conversations about the best performing crypto today. The Closing Word The current crypto race is a mix of technical setups, historical milestones, and pre-launch momentum. The Solana (SOL) bullish rally prediction toward $1,200 reflects strong technical formations and disciplined support levels. The Dogecoin (DOGE) market outlook remains fixated on the $1 dream, a cultural and psychological target that could trigger a retail buying frenzy if breached. But in terms of tangible pre-launch delivery, BlockDAG is appearing as a standout. With over $375 million raised, 2.5 million miners active, and developments like Buyer Battles, Seattle sports partnerships, and Dashboard V4, it’s not just riding speculative hype, it’s creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. If Solana delivers on its rally and Dogecoin finally breaks its $1 barrier, both will dominate headlines. Yet, for now, BlockDAG is holding the momentum in the race for the best performing crypto today, powered by a strategy that blends user engagement with real-world adoption.

The central bank established its short-lived Novel Activities Supervision Program during the tenure of Vice Chairman Michael Barr, the board's supervision chief appointed by then-President Joe Biden, and the agency is now sunsetting the effort and will ""return to monitoring banks' novel activities through the normal supervisory process,"" according to a Fed statement on Friday. Since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, the Fed has tended to move in step with the other banking regulators who've pulled back on aggressive digital assets scrutiny. In April, the Federal Reserve withdrew its earlier crypto guidance that directed bankers to get approvals from the government supervisors before engaging in new crypto activity. The other two U.S. federal banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. made matching moves to toss out the previous guidance, leaving banks to make their own crypto decisions under existing risk-management expectations. The idea behind the novel-activity program was that the Fed needed to gather special expertise and put a closer focus on risks to the banking system that might emerge from innovative and untested technologies. The initiative followed closely in the aftermath of the 2023 crisis in which three U.S. lenders closely associated with technology and crypto clients — Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank — failed about five months earlier. In the two years since establishing the program, though, the Fed has ""strengthened its understanding of those activities, related risks, and bank risk management practices,"" according to Friday's statement, so the work will be directed back to the regular supervisory process. The crypto industry and U.S. banking regulators have been through a tumultuous few years in which digital assets firms and insiders have complained of an organized campaign from government entities to cut them off from bank services — a campaign the industry and its Republican lawmaker allies call Operation Chokepoint 2.0. But Trump has appointed crypto-friendly officials to redirect the banking agencies, and though the Fed is protective of its independence, it's generally joined the OCC and FDIC in the trend of relaxing crypto constraints.

Five specific assets stand out to me as August 2025 approaches because of their strong fundamentals and a strategy that implies they can replicate—possibly even surpass—the incredible spike that sent Solana skyrocketing in 2021. Imagine momentum-driven DeFi leaders, app-centric rollups riding the meme wave, and a few well-placed outliers that all converge on compelling stories, strategic roadmaps, and reaffirming on-chain indicators. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) – The New SOL Next Stage Price: $0.0020 Stage 10: 1 LILPEPE = $0.0019 USD Raised: $17,142,562 / $19,325,000 Tokens Sold: 11,601,347,946 / 12,750,000,000 (90.99%) Little Pepe isn’t just another meme coin — it’s a Layer-2 blockchain engineered for speed, security, ultra-low fees, and powered entirely by meme culture. The $LILPEPE token fuels every corner of this ecosystem, from DeFi and NFT marketplaces to a dedicated meme coin launchpad. Its most notable distinction? It’s the only chain where sniper bots won’t work, giving everyday traders a level playing field. Security has been a core focus from day one. Little Pepe’s smart contracts have been fully audited by CertiK, earning a 95.49% score, placing it among the most secure meme tokens in DeFi. The audit covered smart contract logic, admin privileges, vulnerabilities, gas optimization, and ERC-20 compliance, offering investors peace of mind in a space often plagued by exploits. The tokenomics are designed for long-term sustainability: 26.5% Presale – rewarding early believers. 10% Liquidity – ensuring smooth trading and deep order books. 30% Chain Reserves – supporting Layer-2 operations. 10% DEX Allocation – for listings and market-making. 10% Marketing – to flood the internet with $LILPEPE memes, influencer collabs, and even billboard campaigns. 13.5% Staking & Rewards – rewarding holders. 0% Tax – no buy or sell fees. To celebrate its rapid rise, Little Pepe is running a $777,000 giveaway, with ten winners each receiving $77,000 in $LILPEPE. With exchange listings already confirmed on two major CEXs at launch and whispers of the largest global exchange in the pipeline, $LILPEPE is positioning itself as the next Solana-level breakout — but with a meme-driven twist. Bonk (BONK) – Testing a Make-or-Break Support Bonk, Solana’s flagship meme coin, has pulled back sharply from its July peak, dropping 42% after an 80% rally. The current price zone around $0.00002345 aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, daily high-time-frame support, and a major volume node — a rare triple confluence that could spark a reversal. However, derivative market weakness — with Open Interest down 47% since July — shows that bullish conviction has faded. If support holds, a rebound toward $0.00002739 is plausible, but a breakdown could send BONK toward $0.00001971. As a long-term meme brand with deep integration in the Solana ecosystem, BONK’s ability to defend this support will determine whether it remains a top momentum play for the rest of the year. XRP – Legal Clarity Unlocks New Momentum The Ripple vs SEC saga has finally ended after nearly five years, with both sides filing a joint dismissal of their appeals. Judge Analisa Torres’s 2023 ruling now confirms that secondary market XRP sales are not securities transactions. The market reaction was immediate: XRP surged to $3.29, with analysts eyeing $3.60 as the next resistance. With the legal overhang gone, Ripple can now fully focus on expanding the XRP Ledger, pursuing partnerships, and possibly pushing for an XRP ETF. Regulatory clarity gives XRP a competitive advantage in attracting institutional adoption, a crucial factor in reclaiming or surpassing its $3.40 all-time high in this cycle. SEI – Bullish SuperTrend Meets Key Resistance SEI is showing a textbook bullish reversal setup, with the SuperTrend flipping green while price trades near the bottom of an ascending channel. Currently at $0.29, a breakout above the $0.34 resistance could trigger a rally toward $0.54 — the channel’s upper boundary. Volume has been strong, with $121.68 traded in the past 24 hours, but chart watchers are keeping a close eye on a potential Head and Shoulders formation that could flip the bias bearish if $0.28 support breaks. If meme coin momentum returns — as it often does in late-cycle surges — SEI could ride that wave higher. For now, it’s a classic risk-reward entry for traders willing to play the breakout. Arbitrum (ARB) – Layer-2 Leader Eyes $2 Arbitrum’s DeFi ecosystem is thriving, with TVL nearing $3B and stablecoin inflows topping $8.29B, beating all other Ethereum L2s. On the charts, ARB has broken out of a long-term downtrend, reclaimed its 200 EMA, and moved above key resistance, pushing toward $0.50 in the short term and $2.00 in the higher-time-frame view. With liquidity and user adoption surging, ARB is emerging as the most credible Ethereum scaling solution in 2025. If the trend continues, Arbitrum might mimic a similar trajectory that made SOL a revelation in 2021. Final Thoughts These five tokens represent distinct narratives driving the crypto market in August 2025: Little Pepe – Meme culture meets Layer-2 scalability and security. Bonk – Solana’s OG meme coin at a technical inflection point. XRP – Regulatory clarity opens doors to institutional adoption. SEI – Low-cap technical breakout candidate with bullish structure. Arbitrum – L2 dominance with growing liquidity and ecosystem strength. The “next Solana” could emerge from any of these — but in terms of early-stage potential, Little Pepe offers the rare combination of meme virality, technical innovation, and exchange-ready infrastructure that could replicate SOL’s meteoric rise.

According to him, “the breakout already happened,” and the market is simply awaiting the “vertical move” next. Market Snapshot and Key Levels As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.12, placing it just below its long-standing all-time high. Many analysts agree that reclaiming and holding above this level would open the door to genuine price discovery . Recent rallies have brought XRP within striking distance of that threshold, with highs near $3.26–$3.29 in recent weeks. $XRP is going to $100 and beyond, and you can’t stop it Phase 1 was pure speculation Phase 2? Real-world utility + global liquidity demand Charts don’t lie. The breakout already happened. The vertical move is next. How high do you see $XRP going? pic.twitter.com/TNiPSC0cCE — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) August 15, 2025 This latest surge reflects growing bullish sentiment, with technical charts showing an extended breakout from multi-year consolidation. Increased trading volumes and stronger momentum indicators suggest that the market structure is favoring the bulls. The Utility and Liquidity Thesis Fundamental developments enhancing XRP’s real-world use case support the case for $100 XRP. Ripple’s December 2024 launch of RLUSD , a USD-backed stablecoin issued on both the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum, added a significant layer of liquidity to the ecosystem. RLUSD is designed to streamline settlement flows, making on-chain transfers between institutions faster and more efficient. Another major milestone arrived on June 30, 2025, with the mainnet debut of the XRPL EVM Sidechain . This upgrade brought full Ethereum-compatible smart contract functionality to the XRP ecosystem, enabling developers to deploy dApps directly connected to XRPL’s native speed and low-cost settlement features. Both RLUSD and the EVM sidechain have strengthened the case for XRP as a core bridge asset in global finance. On-chain data further reinforces the bullish outlook. Whale accumulation of XRP has increased notably in recent months , a trend historically linked to sustained upward market moves rather than short-term spikes. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical Perspective From a charting standpoint, XRP has already completed a breakout from its multi-year price range. The current consolidation is viewed by many analysts and traders as a healthy pause before the next leg higher. A confirmed close above that all-time high could mark the start of a fresh price discovery phase, potentially supporting X Finance Bull’s ambitious target. Outlook While calls for $100 XRP may seem extreme today, the combination of strengthened utility, growing liquidity infrastructure, and technical momentum has fueled the most optimistic forecasts in years. If adoption accelerates through stablecoin integration, DeFi expansion on XRPL’s EVM sidechain, and broader institutional uptake, the path toward double- and even triple-digit territory may eventually shift from speculation to possibility. For now, all eyes remain on the $3.65 level—a gateway price that could determine whether XRP’s next chapter is merely another rally or the start of a historic run.

At a basement $0.00155 per token in stage 10, BPENGU is presenting the same proven narrative that launched PENGU to a $2.3 billion market cap. While PENGU trades around $0.037 after recent volatility, Bitcoin Penguins is launching during market conditions similar to previous ""meme coin seasons"" - periods when casual crypto investors saw their holdings increase 100 to 1,000 times in value. With Bitcoin Penguins ending their presale on August 27th, competition amongst buyers snapping up the last tokens available is heating up. Is it possible for a relative newcomer to effectively challenge PENGU's dominance? The numbers suggest so. PENGU's impressive empire vs BPENGU's ground-floor opportunity Pudgy Penguins has evolved into a Web3 brand powerhouse, with physical toys available in Walmart, partnerships with Lufthansa and NASCAR, and over 100 billion views across social media, making it a cultural icon. We’re partnering with @Lufthansa ’s Miles & More program, Europe’s largest frequent flyer program to bring rewards to The Huddle.Every purchase in fiat or $PENGU on the Pudgy Shop earns you miles, redeemable with 300+ partners for flights, experiences, & more.Learn more below. pic.twitter.com/t114Fyypm5 — Pudgy Penguins (@pudgypenguins) June 12, 2025 The achievements are genuinely impressive. PENGU reached unprecedented heights in late 2024, when Pudgy Penguins launched their PENGU token on Solana in December. This transformed the project from a small NFT collection with 4,000 holder s into a massive community with nearly 1 million PENGU token holders. The project airdropped over $1.5 billion worth of PENGU tokens to early believers, with individual Pudgy NFT holders receiving approximately $75,000 worth of tokens per penguin they owned. The PENGU token saw an astounding liftoff, holding at an astonishing $2.1 billion at the time of writing. However, PENGU's success also limits its upside potential. Current forecasts predict it trading between $0.05 and $0.10 by 2026, representing solid but not extreme gains from current levels of around $0.037. Bitcoin Penguins targets the gap PENGU left open While PENGU conquered the Solana ecosystem, it left a massive opportunity untapped: Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin Penguins tempts all Bitcoin lovers with weekly Bitcoin giveaways worth $120,000 each and an outrageous declared ambition to purchase the entire continent of Antarctica for penguin conservation. The first Bitcoin prize winner was announced not long ago. They held just $17.5 worth of coins—so that’s a potentially life-changing sum. Meanwhile, the project's staking numbers show serious early engagement: Whale Tier (3 months, 100% APY): 53.67M tokens locked Fish Tier (2 months, 80% APY): 96.08M tokens staked Prawn Tier (1 month, 50% APY): 113.25M tokens committed That’s a total of 263 million tokens already locked before launch, creating a support platform for the project. The confirmed listing price of $0.00198 means current holders have built-in upside before the public starts trading. BPENGU also benefits from favorable timing. Current market analysis suggests that meme coins could see significant gains in Q4, with historical data indicating that the final rotation into narrative-driven projects typically occurs in the fourth quarter. The race heats up PENGU's established success proves the penguin narrative has staying power. Bitcoin Penguins launches with the benefit of learning from PENGU's playbook while targeting a wider audience. The $3.4m raised so far is indicative of valuable early momentum, and major influencers from the crypto world are helping to build virality for the meme. LIVE.

A single 900M DOGE transfer worth $208M to Binance drew attention to large exchange movements. DOGE broke key resistance, with momentum building for a possible push toward the $1 price mark. Price and Market Moves Dogecoin (DOGE) traded at $0.23 at press time, slipping 4% over the past day but still showing a 2% gain for the week. Daily turnover came in at about $6.18 billion. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market saw over $1 billion in liquidations. Hotter-than-expected US Producer Price Index data pushed traders to scale back expectations of a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. DOGE had roughly 290,500 coins liquidated during the sell-off. On the two-week chart, analyst Trader Tardigrade notes that DOGE has cleared a downward-sloping resistance line after completing what appears to be a “wave V” in an Elliott Wave sequence. Similar setups in the past, where prolonged declines stayed within falling channels before breaking higher, have been followed by sharp rallies. $Doge /2-week #Dogecoin is gaining strong momentum to surge above $1 pic.twitter.com/TuSEKr19nv — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) August 15, 2025 Momentum gauges are also turning up. The Stochastic RSI, which had dropped into oversold territory, is now heading higher. Previous reversals from this zone have coincided with sustained upward moves. The current formation points to a possible run that could carry DOGE past the $1 mark. Heavy Whale Buying and Large Transfers As reported by CryptoPotato , blockchain data shows large investors have added two billion DOGE in the past week, spending just under $500 million. That brings their holdings to about 27.6 billion coins, or 18% of the supply. The buying streak has prompted speculation within the community. Recently, Whale Alert flagged a 900 million DOGE transfer worth about $208 million into Binance. The tracking indicates that it originated from a wallet connected to the exchange, likely as an internal activity. The address involved holds 2.88 billion DOGE, one of the largest balances on the network. Ali Martinez also reports that transactions above $1 million reached a one-month high, with activity building since early August and peaking as DOGE traded at $0.25. Whales are back!

The Hong Kong-based luxury watch seller is now turning its focus to the digital asset market. Industry watchers say this is the first time a Taiwan-listed company has supported a business built around holding Bitcoin in its corporate reserves. Top Win now joins the growing list of companies that are adding crypto assets to their balance sheet. WiseLink Moves into Crypto Amid Global Uncertainty WiseLink’s chief executive, Tsai Kun Huang, sees the present moment as an ideal time to act. He pointed to global monetary easing and rising geopolitical uncertainty as reasons for the move. Both, he says, are pushing investors toward assets that are decentralized, limited in supply, and resistant to inflation. For WiseLink, the flagship crypto fits that profile better than any other digital asset. The company’s $2 million purchase of three-year convertible notes formed the cornerstone of the round. This structure allows WiseLink to convert the debt into shares later. In the meantime, it still keeps the protection of a fixed income. Top Win Rebrands and Integrates Bitcoin into Strategy Top Win International, already listed on Nasdaq, has been known for trading and retailing high-end watches. However, under the guidance of Jason Fang, the founder of Asia-focused crypto investment firm Sora Ventures, the company is rebranding to AsiaStrategy and embedding Bitcoin into its financial strategy. Fang says Top Win is unique as the only U.S.-listed public company with a Bitcoin treasury plan centered in Asia. With its new funding, Top Win aims to purchase Bitcoin directly and may also invest in other listed companies pursuing similar treasury strategies. A company spokesperson stressed that Top Win will not become an investment firm or focus on securities trading as its main business. Huang explained that WiseLink’s goal is not simply to stockpile Bitcoin. The firm intends to weave Bitcoin reserves into its cross-border business operations. This move aims to keep the company’s assets safe in uncertain times while also encouraging new ideas in its financial plans. WiseLink Enters Bitcoin Partnership from Strong Financial Position Unlike some businesses that turn to Bitcoin as a last chance to survive, WiseLink is starting from a strong position. Records show it ended 2023 with a profit and has made $46 million in revenue so far in 2024, and $53 million over the past 12 months. Top Win’s finances are modest, with $3.8 million in working capital and $3.0 million in cash. However, the company has admitted to weaknesses in its financial reporting, which could let serious mistakes go unnoticed.

The financing will support the agreement with CoreWeave Inc., which has committed to the approved capacity of 800 megawatts. The deal has been secured at an 80% loan-to-cost ratio for 36 months. Galaxy has generated $350 million in equity, while a debt facility covers the rest. According to the deal terms, the project’s first phase is set to begin in early 2026. Galaxy plans to repurpose the Helios campus into an AI and HPC service platform Galaxy acquired the Helios campus in 2022 and is now repurposing it as an AI and HPC service platform to meet the growing demand for AI services. The lease agreement covers 15 years and is expected to generate revenue exceeding $1 billion. CoreWeave has agreed to expand in stages, eventually using all the 800 MW capacity for IT load. We’ve closed a $1.4B project financing facility to accelerate development of our Helios AI datacenter in Texas, fast-tracking delivery of critical AI and HPC infrastructure under our long-term agreement with @CoreWeave . Helios is on track to become one of the largest AI… pic.twitter.com/fKcKaSGL4l — Galaxy (@galaxyhq) August 15, 2025 Helios’ site can scale up to 3.5 GW, with 2.7 GW under load study. Currently, an additional 1.7 GW is under construction, which, when fully operational, will advance the site to be among the most extensive AI datacenter facilities in the U.S. CoreWeave data centre deployment at Helios will utilize NVIDIA H100 graphics processing units (GPUs). Liquid cooling technology will also reduce energy consumption by up to 40%. Power utility will be sourced from 100% carbon-free onsite renewable energy. Galaxy and CoreWeave are reportedly working on a joint mission to establish AI governance frameworks to address regulatory and ethical requirements, such as algorithmic transparency and data privacy standards. The joint venture has also highlighted plans to expand beyond Texas and Nevada in a $1.2 billion expansion initiative. The plan will incorporate exascale computing and AI applications, supported by a proposed 10-year cloud service agreement. Galaxy will contribute $750 million towards the deal, and CoreWeave will deliver $450 million via a loan facility. In addition to the agreement with CoreWeave, Galaxy has secured a lease agreement for the second phase of the data centre development, which will offer CoreWeave an additional 260MW of IT load. The deal comes after CoreWeave completed its final option for 133 MW, culminating in a final commitment of 800 MW. All assets associated with the first phase have secured the financing deal for the Helios project. Galaxy appoints Matt Friedrich to oversee global legal functions The AI infrastructure firm replaced Andrew Siegel on 11th August with Matt Friedrich as Chief Legal Officer. He will be in charge of global legal and compliance functions from September 8, 2025. Friedrich will report directly to CEO Mike Novogratz. He possesses a wealth of experience from Cognizant, Chevron, and the Department of Justice. The AI firm reported its Q2 financial results, which show a gross profit of $299 million. According to the report, the company generated $3.2 billion in revenue throughout the last twelve months. Some analysts have adjusted the profit forecasts for the AI infrastructure firm for the upcoming quarter. The AI infrastructure firm has also committed to several partnerships previously, including a 48 MW deployment with Soluna Holdings Inc. at Project Kati 1 in Texas. The Project Kati 1 is expected to reach full capacity by Q1 2026. The firm has also collaborated with Mill City Ventures III Ltd. to manage a $450 million SUI treasury. The Helios facility design has combined advanced computing technology, renewable energy sources, and scalability to cater to the growth in demand for AI-related services. Galaxy Digital stated that the Helios project and associated expansions form part of its strategy to deliver predictable long-term revenue through fixed-price contracts. The project will be constructed in phases, followed by consistent investment in infrastructure, governance, and sustainable measures. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Despite mixed signals, Aave set new records in total deposits, surpassing $3 trillion to cement its status as a top DeFi lending protocol. Aave @aave · Follow Aave hit $3 trillion all-time deposits. 8:03 PM · Aug 15, 2025 542 Reply Copy link Read 71 replies The milestone comes after AAVE’s sudden price dip, as the PPI data triggered massive liquidations across the markets within minutes. The alt trades at $299 after losing nearly 6% of its value within the last 24 hours. While bears dominate short-term trends, AAVE is approaching a key support at $290, which has historically sparked substantial bounce-backs. The $3 trillion net deposits reflect confidence and deep liquidity. Thus, the fundamental backdrop will likely cement the $290 support barrier. If history rhymes, AAVE could use this foothold to stage long-term rebounds toward the resistance at $380. That would mean an approximately 30% surge from the potential Launchpad. Aave’s $3 trillion deposit milestone While the daily price chart remained red, Aave disclosed a key achievement as the protocol’s total deposits hit an all-time high above $3 trillion. The massive figure underscores the liquidity supplied to decentralized lending pools on Aave across supported networks. Most importantly, the milestone signals steady adoption since 2020, user trust, and Aave’s growing influence in the DeFi landscape. Initiatives like integrating with Ripple’s stablecoin and MetaMask’s new feature have enriched Aave’s lending and borrowing infrastructure. The massive deposits into Aave provide deeper liquidity, which translates to competitive yields for lenders and a smooth process for borrowers to secure funds. Moreover, the $3 trillion deposits hint at institutional participation. Companies and businesses have ventured into crypto over the past few years. Aave could have been a perfect destination for entities looking for permissionless and transparent alternatives as TradiFi and DeFi merge. Aave has cemented itself as a top lending platform. Such a milestone could attract more users, developers, and partners to ensure long-term stability. AAVE price outlook: 30% rebound looming? The altcoin trades in red after losing over 6% in the past day to press time’s $299. Chart by Coinmarketcap AAVE appears poised for further declines as sellers dominate the markets. Meanwhile, the altcoin hovers in a clear battleground. It is heading toward the crucial support zone at $290. The foothold has proven reliable since January, sparking significant bounce-backs and notable dips upon breach. The massive $3 trillion deposits and renewed market sentiments could help buyers hold the support zone. Bullish activity would see AAVE targeting the $300 psychological mark before reclaiming $320. That could clear the path to $355 and the December 2024 target of $380. Further uptrends amidst a potential altseason could stretch the rally to $450. However, a closing under $290 would shift the tone. That could plunge AAVE prices to $260, where buyers might regroup.

Mutuum Finance phase 6 presale is currently ongoing with the token being sold for $0.035. Investors buying the token now can expect their portfolios to grow over 400% in the coming months. MUTM presale has raised over $14.4 million in capital and brought in over 15220 token holders to date. While DOGE’s price action captures headlines, analysts are watching a broader mix of projects, from established smart-contract networks to next-generation scaling solution, Mutuum Finance. Dogecoin Falls Short of $1 Expectation Amid Alternative Project Buzz Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.236, holding modest gains despite significant hype and optimistic projections that it could reach $1 in 2025. However, broader market sentiment leans away from DOGE’s speculative meme-driven narrative, with analysts noting its fundamentals may not sustain such lofty targets. As meme coin enthusiasm recalibrates, attention is turning toward emerging DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as potential alternative opportunities. Presale Phase 6 for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance presale is getting hot. It has drawn more than 15,220 investors who have deposited a total of more than $14.4 million. The project is now in presale stage 6 priced at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is taking over the crypto market, not through hype but through utility and scale security, with its new dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin. Mutuum Finance Bug Bounty Now Open Mutuum Finance has also initiated a Bug Bounty Program where CertiK made the reward amount of $50,000 USDT. It is a four-level reward program i.e., critical, major, minor and low where every level of vulnerability is rewarded. It is yet another feature which shows that Mutuum is leading in establishing trust in the backdrop of good infrastructure and good security. Mutuum Finance Giveaway: $100K Reward Mutuum Finance has created a $100,000 giveaway . 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 MUTM. The giveaway is available for new project investors and also indicates the efforts of the project to build a long-term and dedicated community. Mutuum Finance liquidity model gives the user convenience of using his or her money in a decentralized lending process from start to finish. Two-model approach taken in the platform offers greater flexibility and efficiency such as Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Focus on Security and Stability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a stablecoin to be pegged to USD on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be a stable and secure investment product to avoid risk and volatility that are usually associated with algorithmic stablecoins. Dual-Lending: Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance pursues a twin-model approach towards achieving maximum flexibility and effectiveness using Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract uses self-executing smart contracts, which carry out the lending independently without any human intervention at all. They have been programmed to operate at variable speeds within the market with an unknown interest rate based on the then-prevalent demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and allows lenders to communicate directly with borrowers. Dogecoin may keep attracting headlines, but the road to $1 is looking increasingly unrealistic without a seismic market shift. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is quietly building momentum with a rapidly growing investor base already topping 15,220 holders. Stage 6 presale is live at just $0.035, but the clock is ticking, Stage 7 will lift the price to $0.04, delivering instant upside for early buyers. With $14.4 million already raised, a $100K token giveaway, and a 95.0 CertiK trust score, MUTM is shaping up as the altcoin that could leave DOGE in the dust. Every presale stage has sold out faster than the last, and once this phase closes, cheap entry will be gone for good. Buy now before the next jump, and position yourself where the growth is actually happening.

TeraWulf's asset-light strategy focuses on infrastructure rather than GPU ownership, minimizing depreciation risk and ensuring predictable, high-margin revenue streams. Signed contracts, clear unit economics, and secured power capacity provide strong visibility into future cash flows and support a Buy rating upgrade. Despite recent price surges, I see a 2.5x upside potential for WULF as HPC revenue ramps, with manageable execution risks and a positive risk-reward profile. TeraWulf Overview TeraWulf Inc. (NASDAQ: WULF ) might well be considered a late mover among the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) miners in high performance computing [HPC]. They only began any serious HPC pivot last year when they announced (in their September 2024 monthly production update ) the successful completion of their 2MW proof of concept project called “Wolf Den” to showcase their HPC hosting capabilities. Despite the late pivot, TeraWulf is now targeting the right opportunities and building a strong HPC backlog. The latest $3.7 billion contract with Google ( GOOG )-backed Fluidstack is a prime example of well-timed execution resulting in successful contracts. There are several things TearWulf has done right to get here. One of them being that their HPC pivot strategy has been less exposed to GPU hardware lifecycles and depreciation because CaPex allocated to HPC has been focused more on power and infrastructure, which retain value longer than GPUs. TeraWulf does not maintain a large, depreciating fleet of GPUs for revenue generation. Spendings on GPU for the company’s Compute business line recorded so far was when the proof-of-concept Wolf Den was being built, which involved operating a compact Nvidia A100 GPU system at the Lake Mariner Facility. And this strategic execution was the highlight for me when I last covered WULF in May . Looking back, I think the more cautious Hold rating was overly conservative, and a Buy would have been a better call. I believe TeraWulf is now at the ""right place at the right time"" in HPC hosting. Among the miners, TeraWulf can be considered a late bird in HPC hosting. I believe this has allowed TeraWulf to craft a better strategy for the WULF Compute business line. Sometimes it’s the ones who come late to the party that leave with the best gains, after watching the early guests spill their drinks. In its HPC approach, TeraWulf is avoiding the operational complexity that purchasing and maintaining GPUs for HPC hosting presents, and will be focusing on providing infrastructure to HPC clients – power, cooling, rack, and space – as the management has iterated. TeraWulf’s HPC hosting is basically: bring your GPUs and we’ll host them. - Excerpt from my WULF coverage in May. Bitcoin miners who pivoted to HPC earlier took the GPU risk and will likely incur the depreciation. I think it is risky enough for a Bitcoin miner to be exposed to crypto price cycles, then to compound that with further exposure to hardware cycles doubles the risk. Seeking Alpha WULF is up 180% since visiting it on the release of the Q1 earnings in May, and is up ~59% since the Fluidstack-Google announcement yesterday. For investors who may have been on the sidelines, I believe the main question now is whether conditions support for more upside (from a fundamentals perspective), or if entry at this stage would be a case of an overhang of missed buying opportunity that presents the risk of catching the top, since WULF is already up a lot. WULF Still Presents a Compelling Buy Despite Its Price Surge Without beating around the bush, I strongly believe that the outlook for TeraWulf has changed greatly for the better, and I am upgrading my stance to Buy at this point. The pivot to HPC hosting has moved from talk to signed contracts, and revenue recognition from HPC is already underway, beginning Q3 2025, according to management’s guidance in the Q2 earnings call. The outlook for strong HPC revenue is now highly visible. The Fluidstack agreements anchor about $3.7 billion of contracted revenue over ten year period, with two five-year options that lift the total to about $8.7 billion, under a modified gross lease (meaning TeraWulf is paid a fixed fee for infrastructure services while most variable costs are passed through to the client, keeping revenue predictable and limiting operational risk). Google will backstop $1.8 billion of those obligations and receive warrants equal to roughly 8 percent pro forma WULF ownership. The deployment will start with about 40 MW online in the first half of 2026 (just months away) and the full 200+ MW by year end 2026. Unit economics also look attractive and visible per management’s guidance. Management disclosed an expected site net operating income [NOI] margin of 85% on the Fluidstack deployment, which implies about $315 million of annual site NOI at full run rate ($3.7B contract / 10 years = $370M/yr in revenue; $370M x 0.85 NOI margin = ~$315M annual NOI). The revenue from the Fluidstack contract is highly predictable and grows over time due to built-in price escalations (starting around $370 million per year and rising over the 10-year contract). Under the modified gross lease, TeraWulf collects a fixed fee for providing power, cooling, and rack space, while most variable costs are passed through to Fluidstack, keeping revenue predictable and margins protected - an example of TeraWulf’s asset-light HPC hosting approach, which caught my attention in May. The earlier Core42 lease also validates the above approach. Terms of the Core42 deal call for 60 MW of critical IT load at $125 per kilowatt per month, equal to $1.5 million per MW per year, with a 3% annual escalator and a twelve-month prepayment. Management framed EBITDA margin at ~70% and an unlevered return of 17 to 18% on a $6 million per MW build, which is compelling in today’s data center market. Scale optionality remains, with an expansion option up to 108 MW of additional critical load. On the infrastructure side, TeraWulf’s power and sites provide strong capacity optionality for lessees. Lake Mariner has interconnection approval for 500 MW with applications pending to reach up to 750 MW, and the Cayuga site adds an 80-year ground lease with rights to develop up to 400 MW, with 138 MW expected ready online in 2026. These are zero-carbon, low-cost power markets with existing transmission and water, which shortens timelines. This infrastructure and power base is TeraWulf’s potential moat in AI infrastructure. I believe TeraWulf’s financial base is on the verge of improving, while HPC ramps. Q2 2025 revenue was $47.6 million, up 34% YoY. Bitcoin mining capacity reached 12.8 EH/s also up around 45% YoY. Though net loss widened, TeraWulf returned to positive adjusted EBITDA of $14.5 million in Q2 - a notable improvement over Q1's negative adjusted EBITDA of -$4.7 million. Management guided to recognizing HPC hosting revenue beginning in Q3 2025, which marks an inflection point for TeraWulf's financial profile. And at $3.88 billion EV and TTM revenue of $144.1 million, WULF currently trades around 27x EV/Sales. Now, with the $3.7 billion Fluidstack contract potentially adding roughly $370 million a year in revenue at full deployment, sales could potentially rise to over $500 million annually (if TeraWulf maintains around the current annual run rate from its current revenue streams). If the market continues to value WULF at the same EV/Sales multiple of 27x, the enterprise value could increase proportionally to about $13.83 billion (or more conservatively above $10 billion). Assuming net debt remains stable (which is also plausible given early cash inflows from Fluidstack, projected high NOI margins, and phased capital spending as the rollout of HPC infrastructure will be in phases), this would imply a share price around 2.5x above current price (if we stick to our more conservative ~$10 billion EV). A ~2.5x or ~250% upside from the current $8.85 share price would make WULF trade around $22. Any expansion of the multiple due to factors like higher margins, as execution of the Fluidstack and Core42 contracts scale, would potentially push the upside further. Risks and Takeaway Execution risk remains real in the HPC hosting business, so I model in some cushion (a conservative 10–15% adjustment to projected revenue and phased deployment assumptions). The critical variables here are managing the construction schedule and coordinating with clients on the on-time arrival of their hardware. The Google backstop reduces counterparty risk on the Fluidstack deal. The prepayment and escalators on Core42 improve returns while the team funds and builds. I believe WULF's risk-reward skews positive at this point of the build phase. TeraWulf's entry into HPC is based on an approach that minimizes capital and market risks. This approach makes WULF a Bitcoin miner worth being on the watch list. In a sector where timing and strategy are everything, TeraWulf may have just found its sweet spot in HPC. - Except for my WULF coverage in May. In May, I initiated coverage with a takeaway that WULF was watchlist-worthy because of its HPC business approach. My current takeaway is simple: TeraWulf now has contracts, credible partners, clear unit economics, and secured power (Lake Mariner and Haynesville sites, totaling ~40 MW to start with full 200+ MW capacity by end of 2026). If you were sidelined earlier, I believe the setup has improved. I see enough line of sight to future cash flows to upgrade to Buy .",BTC-USD|GOOG|GOOGL|GOOG:CA|WULF,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-15 17:30:32

The two leaders are meeting for the first time in six years at a military base near Anchorage, Alaska, and the Kremlin is not looking for symbolic gestures. Moscow wants actual outcomes, especially when it comes to Ukraine, NATO, sanctions, and the economy. Trump made it clear on his way to Alaska that Russia won’t be getting any business deals from the U.S. unless there’s progress on ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking on Air Force One, Trump told reporters he’s aware Putin wants economic talks, but “they’re not doing business until we get the war settled.” He said he’s open to discussing deals if there’s forward movement, but added that Ukraine has the final word on territorial matters. “We’ll talk about land, but Ukraine has to agree,” he said. The summit starts with a private one-on-one at 11:00 a.m. local time, followed by a broader session with five officials on each side, and ends with a press conference before Trump flies back to Washington by 5:45 p.m. Trump holds back economic talks, warns of severe consequences Trump is locking down any chance of economic talks unless Putin shows he’s serious about changing course. While the Kremlin sent a delegation of Russian business figures to the summit, Trump said that doesn’t mean much unless there’s real change. “I noticed he’s bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that’s good,” Trump said. “But we’re not talking business until the war is over.” He also gave a warning. If Putin keeps dragging out the war, Trump promised economic consequences that would hurt. That includes threats of new tariffs targeting buyers of Russian crude oil, like China and India. Russia’s war economy is already under pressure, and further U.S. action could cut deeper. Putin, trying to show cooperation ahead of the summit, called Trump’s efforts “energetic and sincere” on Thursday. But Trump wasn’t handing out praise. He referred to Putin as “a smart guy” and made it clear that playing games won’t get him anything. If Putin doesn’t step up with actual movement toward a resolution, there won’t be talks, deals, or relief. Putin may freeze war if NATO backs off, Ukraine says no deal Putin, facing internal pressure, may be ready to make a limited offer. People familiar with Kremlin planning say Putin could agree to freezing the conflict where it stands, but only if the West guarantees NATO stops expanding and rolls back some sanctions. Putin’s team wants a legally binding promise that NATO won’t keep moving east. But NATO’s already said that Ukraine’s future is inside the alliance, not outside it. Meanwhile, Russia has floated another offer. With the last remaining nuclear arms deal set to expire in February, Putin is now open to a new agreement. That’s something Trump would probably want, but it’s clearly a bargaining chip, not a goodwill gesture. Ukraine’s not impressed. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Putin is “playing for time” to dodge U.S. secondary sanctions. He also ruled out any deal that involves giving up territory. Kyiv wants a U.S.-backed security guarantee instead, though no one’s sure what that would even mean or how it would work in practice. On Friday, several Ukrainians in central Kyiv told Reuters they weren’t hopeful about the summit. Many believe Putin is just stalling while trying to reduce pressure from Washington. And until something changes on the battlefield or in the negotiations, Ukraine doesn’t think the summit will mean much. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

QCP Capital Explains!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-bitcoin-btc-and-altcoins-bullish-after-the-ppi-driven-drop-qcp-capital-explains/,"This week, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies were closely monitoring critical economic data from the US. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data was released first, followed by the Producer Price Index (PPI). Higher-than-expected US PPI figures shook global markets, including cryptocurrencies, overnight. PPI data show that tariff-related cost pressures are being passed on to consumers faster than expected, increasing the risk of inflation. While the data negatively impacted crypto markets, Singapore-based analytics platform QCP Capital said that the US PPI figures caused a brief pullback in cryptocurrencies, but Bitcoin's uptrend remained intact. QCP analysts said the better-than-expected PPI data shook the crypto market, strengthened the US dollar, and pushed up Treasury yields. US stocks held firm. Analysts also noted that the CPI data released earlier this week supported expectations of a larger Fed rate cut in September, but the higher PPI data largely eliminated the possibility of a 50 basis point cut, lowering the probability of a 25 basis point cut to 90%. The probability of leaving interest rates unchanged has begun to be priced in at 9.4%. Analysts recently said that the PPI data, which came in above expectations, strengthened the dollar and yields, leading to a brief pullback in cryptocurrencies, but the upward trend in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that began in April continues robustly, supported by increasing institutional adoption. *This is not investment advice.

The assault, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, has tanked global prices and put American output on track for its biggest non-pandemic decline in a decade. According to the Financial Times, what’s unfolding is a full-scale oil war, one that’s pulling the floor out from under U.S. shale just as President Donald Trump’s administration demands more domestic production. Last week, the number of crews fracking U.S. wells dropped to the lowest in four years. Only 167 teams were still out there working, down 76 since the start of 2025. And nearly $1.8 billion in capital spending has already been wiped off the books by top shale players over the last two quarters. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts now show U.S. oil output falling in 2026, after peaking this year at 13.6 million barrels per day. Drillers freeze spending as crude drops below survival levels The EIA’s new projections show a painful drop in American oil production, falling to 13.1 million barrels per day by December 2026. That comes as crude prices collapse to $47.77 a barrel, almost $20 below the break-even point for most U.S. shale companies. Kirk Edwards, CEO of Latigo Petroleum, based in Odessa, Texas, said his company’s plan is simple: sit tight. “We’ve gone from drill, baby, drill to wait, baby, wait,” Kirk said. He added that no new rigs will go out unless prices stabilize closer to $75. This comes at a time when Trump is publicly calling for more pumping to strengthen U.S. energy dominance. But those calls don’t match the numbers. Right now, only 539 rigs are drilling onshore in the U.S., 10% fewer than the same period last year, based on Baker Hughes data. Saudi barrels flood the market as prices sink fast Saudi Arabia, which can pull oil out of the ground for as little as $4 to $5 per barrel, has been increasing output since April. Francisco Blanch, who leads commodity research at Bank of America, said the goal is obvious. “They’re trying to win back what they lost to U.S. shale,” Francisco said . He expects a long, painful price fight where Saudi and OPEC keep the pressure high for years. The extra supply is massive. OPEC plans to add more than 2 million barrels a day, equal to the daily demand of Germany. They already agreed this month to raise supply again in September. Meanwhile, demand hasn’t kept up. The International Energy Agency said weak global growth and higher OPEC output could leave the market with a massive glut. In Texas, the heart of U.S. oil country, anxiety is rising. What used to be fear about war in the Middle East choking global supply has flipped into dread about oversupply. That’s because West Texas Intermediate has dropped to $62.21 per barrel, well under the $65 minimum that producers in the Dallas Fed’s latest survey say they need to turn a profit. The financial pressure is real. TD Cowen, an investment bank, said shale drillers will cut 2025 capex by 4% compared to last year. And those top 20 shale producers (excluding ExxonMobil and Chevron) have already slashed $1.8 billion this year alone, based on Enverus data. To stay alive, companies are drilling smarter. Permian Resources said speeding up drilling has helped cut costs fast, as every day shaved off the job saves around $100,000. But that’s a short-term fix. Kaes Van’t Hof, CEO of Diamondback Energy, admitted they’re “pushing the limits” of what their teams can do. Markets this week have gone flat. ICE Brent crude is stuck at $66. Trading activity is dead. Everyone’s watching the upcoming Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska, waiting to see if any kind of deal affects supply. Until then, the market is frozen. Gas prices aren’t immune either. LNG is already down $0.50 per MMBtu this week. Traders expect some kind of breakthrough, but there’s nothing yet. For now, the oil market is just holding its breath.

Despite the recent Hydra upgrade and partnerships with World Mobile, ADA’s performance has lagged in comparison to other altcoins, leaving traders questioning its momentum amid a crowded altcoin landscape. As attention moves away from ADA forecasts, new projects like Layer Brett are drawing in traders, especially those hunting for outsized returns and innovative staking opportunities. This presale excitement is fueled by Layer Brett’s unique position as a Layer 2 crypto and Meme Token, offering a blend of viral meme culture and actual blockchain utility. With analysts projecting that $LBRETT could deliver the next 100x altcoin move, early access is generating real FOMO among both retail and DeFi-focused investors. Layer Brett’s Layer 2 edge: Speed, savings, and staking rewards What sets Layer Brett apart from ADA and other competitors? As an Ethereum Layer 2, Layer Brett processes transactions off-chain using zk-rollup technology for near-instant, low gas fee settlements, just $0.01 compared to ETH’s $2.80. This architecture delivers a true Web3, decentralized, and scalable experience that neither Shiba Inu nor Dogecoin can match, despite their popularity as top meme coins. Presale entry $LBRETT is available now for $0.0042 per token in its early presale. Massive staking APY: Early stakers can access between 20,000% and 25,000% APY, dwarfing the passive earning options of Pepe, Bonk, and Layer Brett . Community-first: No KYC, full control, and a $1 million giveaway for buyers who stake and follow the official socials.User-friendly: Buy with ETH, USDT, or BNB using MetaMask or Trust Wallet and stake in seconds. How $LBRETT rewards early buyers versus traditional meme coins Unlike Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Pepe, which are often criticized as “utility-free” meme tokens, $LBRETT combines meme energy with real DeFi coin incentives. The tokenomics are transparent, with a capped supply of 10 billion to prevent dilution, and the ecosystem is designed for ongoing engagement through staking, NFT rewards, and cross-chain bridging. Early buyers not only benefit from the presale price but also get first access to the highest staking yields. As more participants join, APYs will decrease, making first movers the biggest winners, a dynamic absent from legacy meme coins like Bonk or Layer Brett. This is why Layer Brett is being hailed as the next big crypto and a top gainer crypto candidate for the 2025 bull run. The crypto community pivots: Best crypto presale of 2024? Momentum is building around Layer Brett as traders chase the best crypto to buy now and look for the next 100x meme coin. Social buzz and DeFi communities are increasingly favoring projects with real utility, low-cap crypto gems, and transparent governance. This shift is leaving projects like ADA and Shiba Inu vulnerable to further dips, as growth capital migrates to the innovative staking crypto ecosystem of $LBRETT. Conclusion: Urgency as LBRETT presale nears end With the Cardano Price Prediction narrative stalling and ADA’s upside limited, Layer Brett offers a compelling alternative. The combination of high staking rewards, ultra-low gas fees, and community-driven growth makes $LBRETT a standout in the crowded altcoin space. The presale will not last forever; securing $LBRETT now could position buyers for explosive returns as the next crypto bull run approaches. This opportunity won’t stay open long.

While whale inflows and new validator developments fueled earlier momentum, the asset’s price movement now reflects growing selling pressure and fading bullish strength.

The shift in attention shows how rapidly narratives evolve in the meme sector, making sustained relevance a constant challenge. Despite the recent price drop, on-chain data presents a compelling narrative of growing fundamental support for $WIF. In July, whales actively accumulated the token, adding a substantial $39 million worth of $WIF to their holdings. This accumulation is particularly noteworthy given that the top 100 addresses control over 771 million tokens. $WIF now leads in whale inflows .

While $WIF’s value is deeply rooted in its meme status, the project is taking steps to add a layer of utility. In a major move, DeFi Development Corp announced the launch of the Official DogWifValidator—DFDV Powered validator, allowing holders to earn a share of validator-generated revenue (after operational costs).

This pattern has a peak (formed in the shape of a “head”) joined by two lower peaks, otherwise known as the “shoulders.” A neckline connects the troughs between the peaks. A break below this neckline confirms the reversal. $WIF/USDT price chart, August 15 (Source: TradingView) As observed in the chart, $WIF’s trend reversal is further validated by a clean neckline break around $0.94, setting the stage for a projected move toward the $0.65–$0.66 area. Price has now retested the underside of that neckline but has failed to reclaim it convincingly. The volume chart also displays aggressive sell deltas, especially during the breakdown and the subsequent attempt to bounce. Cumulative delta remains negative, with multiple 4-hour candles printing high sell imbalances, particularly at market lows, a sign that bears remain active and are absorbing bullish attempts. $WIF/USDT volume footprint, August 15 (Source: TradingView) In addition, the RSI hovers just above 40, avoiding oversold extremes but suggesting waning bullish momentum. The MACD histogram continues to decline below the baseline with a flattening signal line crossover, further reflecting a loss of upward momentum. With the 20-period SMA now trending below the 100-period SMA, the short-term bias has turned bearish. Price also remains trapped below both moving averages, adding weight to the downside case. For bulls to invalidate this breakdown, WIF would need to reclaim the $0.94–$0.96 range with strong volume and positive delta shifts. Until then, downside continuation remains the likely path. If the projected target of the head and shoulders formation plays out, the next key levels of interest lie around $0.80 for interim support, and eventually $0.65 as the measured move completes. Traders should monitor volume reactions at each support test to gauge potential absorption or capitulation. The tone of trade has turned defensive, and unless bulls step in with conviction, WIF may continue retracing deeper.

Many in the crypto community are closely watching the growing queue for Ethereum unstaking . This process is crucial for the health and liquidity of the network, and understanding its dynamics offers valuable insights into Ethereum’s evolving Proof-of-Stake ecosystem. Understanding the Ethereum Unstaking Queue Currently, a substantial amount of Ether (ETH) is in line to be withdrawn from the network. This queue reflects the ongoing activity of validators adjusting their staked positions. Here’s a snapshot of the current situation: Significant Unstaking Demand: A remarkable 831,056 ETH are presently awaiting unstaking on the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network. Extended Wait Times: Unstaking these funds is not an instant process; it is expected to take over 14 days to complete, according to data from validatorqueue.com . Balancing Act: Conversely, 355,919 ETH are awaiting staking, indicating a healthy interest in joining the network’s validation process. Staking is a quicker process, typically taking over 6 days to complete. Network Scale: The Ethereum network currently boasts 1,085,264 active Ethereum validators, collectively securing the blockchain with approximately 35.6 million ETH staked. These figures highlight a dynamic environment where large volumes of ETH are constantly moving in and out of the staking mechanism, directly impacting the ETH unstaking queue . What Drives Ethereum Staking and Unstaking? Ethereum staking is a fundamental component of the network’s security and operation under its Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Individuals and entities stake their ETH to become validators, earning rewards for verifying transactions and proposing new blocks. This system replaced the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work model, making Ethereum more sustainable. However, participants also need the flexibility to withdraw their staked assets. Unstaking allows validators to exit the network, access their funds, or reallocate their capital. The presence of an ETH unstaking queue ensures network stability by preventing a sudden, large-scale withdrawal that could compromise security. It’s a carefully designed throttle to maintain equilibrium. Navigating the ETH Unstaking Queue: Challenges and Insights The length of the ETH unstaking queue directly impacts liquidity for validators. A longer queue means a longer wait to access funds, which can influence investment decisions. While a queue is a necessary mechanism, its size is often a topic of discussion within the community. Observing these queue lengths provides valuable insights into validator behavior and overall network sentiment. A consistently long unstaking queue might suggest validators are taking profits or re-evaluating their commitments, while a balanced queue indicates healthy participation and a stable ecosystem for Proof-of-Stake Ethereum . The Role of ETH Validators in Network Security ETH validators are the backbone of the Ethereum network. They are responsible for processing transactions, creating new blocks, and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. Their commitment of staked ETH acts as a security deposit, ensuring they act honestly and in the best interest of the network. Any malicious behavior can lead to “slashing,” where a portion of their staked ETH is forfeited. The robust number of over a million validators and 35.6 million ETH staked demonstrates the strong confidence and decentralized nature of the network. This collective effort secures billions of dollars in value and supports a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. The Future of Proof-of-Stake Ethereum The transition to Proof-of-Stake Ethereum was a monumental achievement, significantly reducing the network’s energy consumption and paving the way for future scalability upgrades. The current dynamics of the Ethereum unstaking and staking queues are natural parts of a maturing system. They reflect the constant ebb and flow of participants, all contributing to a more secure and efficient blockchain. As the network continues to evolve, these metrics will remain key indicators of its health and the confidence of its participants. The transparent nature of these queues, publicly available through tools like validatorqueue.com , empowers users and stakeholders to monitor the network’s operational status in real-time. Conclusion: A Dynamic Ecosystem in Motion The substantial amount of ETH awaiting unstaking and staking underscores the vibrant and dynamic nature of the Ethereum network. While the ETH unstaking queue requires patience, it is a testament to the network’s robust design, ensuring stability and security. As Ethereum continues its journey, understanding these fundamental mechanics is crucial for anyone engaging with this revolutionary blockchain. The network is not just about transactions; it’s about a community of validators and users collectively building the future of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions About Ethereum Staking and Unstaking What is Ethereum staking? Ethereum staking involves locking up your ETH to help secure the network and validate transactions, in return for earning rewards. It’s a core part of Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Why is there an ETH unstaking queue? The ETH unstaking queue is a built-in mechanism designed to manage the flow of withdrawals. It prevents sudden large-scale unstaking events that could destabilize the network and ensures an orderly exit process for validators. How long does Ethereum unstaking take? Based on current network conditions, unstaking ETH can take over 14 days. The exact time depends on the size of the Ethereum unstaking queue and network activity. What is a validator on Ethereum? An Ethereum validator is a participant who has staked 32 ETH and runs validator software to propose and attest to blocks on the blockchain, helping to secure the network and earn rewards. Is the long unstaking queue a concern for Ethereum’s health? Not necessarily. While a long queue means longer wait times, it also indicates significant activity and participation. The system is designed to handle these queues to maintain network stability, showcasing the resilience of Proof-of-Stake Ethereum .

Due to daily resets and compounding, holding XRPT longer than one day can lead to value decay and performance divergence from the 2x target. XRPT has decent liquidity and a lower expense ratio than peers, but spread risk and short-term tax implications must be considered. Leveraged ETFs like XRPT amplify both gains and losses. Strict risk management and clear trading mandates are essential for traders. Volatility Shares' 2x XRP ETF ( XRPT ) is a leveraged strategy designed to provide traders with 2x the daily performance of Ripple (XRP-USD). Because this is a leveraged strategy, XRPT should only be used for daily exposure and should not be considered as a long-term investment vehicle. XRP Background XRP is one of the most heavily traded cryptocurrencies , with recent volumes being in the $11b per day range. XRP Ledger was launched in 2012 as an open-source, permissionless, and decentralized technology designed to enhance transaction speed. XRP has historically received substantial support across financial institutions, aiming to enhance efficiency, reduce transaction time, and offer an alternative for international payment services. XRP recently had a major win against a 2020 legal case brought by the SEC. On August 7, 2025, the lawsuit was abandoned with a $125mm fine to the SEC. XRPT Features XRPT is a leveraged strategy designed to provide 2x the daily performance of XRP. This strategy executes this by investing in XRP futures, providing investors with 200% exposure. Futures are settled on a daily basis, meaning that profits and losses determine margin requirements at the end of each trading. If losses mount, the counterparty may request additional collateral in good faith of covering at settlement. As a result of daily settlement, performance will reset on a daily basis, making performance metrics meaningful on a daily basis. This is reflected in XRPT as an investment vehicle in which performance is reset on a daily basis. This means that returns can be compounded over time, resulting in returns above or below the 2x daily performance target. For this reason, XRPT should only be held for no longer than a single trading period. Holding periods longer than a single trading day can also result in value decay. TradingView Comparing the 1-month performance between XRPT and XRP, XRP substantially outperformed XRPT in terms of total returns. Because of the daily reset, returns over long periods of time will not reflect the indicated target return profile. This means that during periods of significant price increases or decreases, XRPT can substantially deviate in terms of performance, resulting in differentiated returns. Comparing daily performance, XRPT may not achieve its target 2x daily performance depending on trading volumes and volatility. There may be other underlying factors at play relating to the pricing of the futures contracts that may also impact the pricing of the ETF. TradingView Nonetheless, there may be periods where XRPT returns exceed those of XRP. TradingView Looking at liquidity, XRPT is a relatively small portfolio strategy with $125mm in assets under management, with an average of 573k shares changing hands on a daily basis. Despite the strong liquidity, XRPT exhibits some spread risk, or cost-in/cost-out, with a 24 bps spread. The strategy has a relatively low expense ratio of 94 bps. By comparison, peer strategy Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF ( XXRP ) has a relatively larger fee of 189 bps. Despite the higher expense ratio, XXRP may provide traders with significantly more depth with $462mm in AUM and an average trading volume of 1.11mm shares. Risks Related to Leveraged Strategies There are inherent risks in investing in leveraged strategies. Because these strategies are meant to achieve their stated multiple over the underlying index on a daily basis, holding these strategies beyond a single day can lead to skewed performance, especially following consecutive days of upside or downside risk. This can lead to a compounding effect as well as value decay as a result of the daily reset in the derivatives positions. Leveraged strategies also add an extra layer of risk to amplified downside potential. For example, if the underlying index were to appreciate by 2% in a single day, a 3x strategy would appreciate by 6%, meaning that an investment of $100 would increase to $106. If the following day results in a -2% decline in the underlying index or a -6% decline in the leveraged strategy, the investment will decline to $99.64. Holding leveraged strategies for longer than a single day can lead to a compounding effect on one’s position, potentially leading to significant skews from the intended multiplier. During multiple days of downside risk, an investor can experience significant value decay, potentially resulting in the inability to recover losses. Liquidity must be considered prior to investing in a leveraged fund strategy. Given that these funds are designed to be traded daily, trading volumes must be considered to ensure that cost-in/cost-out isn’t deteriorated by spreads. Traders must also consider additional taxes on short-term capital gains as well as trading fees prior to considering a leveraged trading strategy. You can review additional risks here and here . Before making a trading or investment decision in leveraged strategies, be sure to fully understand your risk profile and set a trading mandate to manage these risks. I believe preemptively setting parameters for selling out of a position is prudent in ensuring that an investor appropriately manages downside risk. Final Thoughts XRPT can be an appealing strategy for traders seeking amplified exposure to the daily performance of XRP. Because XRPT is a leveraged strategy, this ETF should only be used for daily exposure.",XXRP|XRP-USD|XRPT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-15 17:56:34

Ruvi AI (RUVI) is moving fast, and the window for the lowest pricing is almost closed. Phase 2 of the presale is 90% complete at $0.015. Once it sells out, the token steps up 33% to $0.020 as Phase 3 begins, with a final presale price of $0.070. Backed by a CoinMarketCap (CMC) listing, a completed CyberScope audit, and a WEEX exchange partnership, RUVI is shaping up as one of the fastest-paced presales of the season. Why buyers are rotating into RUVI now CMC listing pushed RUVI into top-trending sections, boosting discovery and watchlists. Clear price ladder: $0.015 now, $0.020 next (+33%), and $0.070 at presale close. Strong traction: $3M raised, 230M tokens sold, and 2,900+ holders. Trust and access: CyberScope audit completed; WEEX partnership to simplify trading. Extra kicker: Leaderboard giveaway rewarding top contributors. That combo, visibility, credibility, and access, turns attention into allocations and compresses the time to act. Real utility: a creator-first AI super app RUVI isn’t just a ticker; it’s a product built for creators and teams who want more output with fewer tools. The Ruvi AI super app consolidates the end-to-end content workflow: Research: Uncover live trends to pick topics with real demand.

RUVI’s listing put the project in front of a flood of watchlists right as Phase 2 sprinted to 90% completion. With the pricing roadmap set in stone, buyers have a clear reason to position before the next programmed jump. That clarity reduces hesitation and fuels steady daily inflows. Trust and access reduce friction CyberScope audit: Independent review adds confidence to RUVI’s smart contracts and security posture. WEEX partnership: Alignment with a major exchange boosts visibility and helps streamline trading for token holders post-presale. For both retail and larger allocators, these signals shorten the path from interest to action. Key milestones to watch $3M raised across the presale 230M tokens sold 2,900+ holders and rising Phase 2 at 90% with a 33% step to $0.020 as Phase 3 begins Final presale price set at $0.070 Live leaderboard giveaway to incentivize bigger entries Measured progress plus transparent pricing often creates a self-reinforcing loop of demand. VIP tiers: modeled upside at a $1 valuation If you’re planning a larger allocation, RUVI’s VIP structure shows how bonuses can amplify modeled outcomes if adoption scales: VIP 2 ($750 investment): Receive 70,000 tokens with a 40% bonus (20,000 additional tokens). At $1 valuation, this equals $70,000, resulting in a 9,233% ROI. VIP 3 ($1,500 investment): Secure 160,000 tokens with a 60% bonus (60,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $160,000, delivering a 10,566% ROI. VIP 5 ($7,500 investment): Unlock 1,000,000 tokens, boosted by a 100% bonus (500,000 additional tokens). At $1, this equals $1,000,000, achieving a 13,233% ROI. These are modeled scenarios, not guarantees, but they explain why momentum-focused investors are front-running the Phase 3 step. Bottom line If you want high-growth AI exposure with real utility and clear catalysts, RUVI checks the boxes: a CMC-fueled discovery surge, a completed CyberScope audit, a WEEX partnership for post-presale access, and a super app that streamlines the entire content pipeline. With Phase 2 at 90% and a programmed move to $0.020 ahead, then $0.070 at presale close, the chance to enter at the lowest bracket is fading.

Technical indicators suggest that momentum could continue, with strong buying volume underpinning the rally. While traders focus on potential breakouts, seasoned investors are looking beyond short-term moves toward assets and tools that offer lasting value. At the same time, PI has entered a bullish channel, with analysts eyeing a potential 30% rally from current levels. This has raised questions about which crypto will explode next. While both ETH and PI offer upside, Cold Wallet’s security-driven ecosystem is making a strong case for being the smarter choice for investors who value protection alongside potential profit. Ethereum Maintains Strong Momentum Near Record Levels The Ethereum price surge has drawn attention from institutional and retail investors alike. With ETH trading within $200 of its all-time high, sentiment remains bullish. Standard Chartered’s updated Ethereum price target points to further gains as network activity and staking participation continue to rise. Increased on-chain activity and reduced exchange balances are often seen as bullish signals, suggesting that holders are committed to keeping ETH off the market. Layer-2 adoption has also contributed to this momentum, as faster and cheaper transactions attract more decentralized applications to the Ethereum ecosystem. This could accelerate network growth, pushing the Ethereum price surge even further. While analysts debate which crypto will explode in the coming quarter, Ethereum’s established position and proven utility make it a key watch for long-term portfolios. Pi Network Builds Bullish Case for Gains Pi Network is turning heads with its recent breakout from a descending channel. Traders believe this could be the start of a significant rally, with targets set for a 30% upside. While Pi’s unique mining model and large community give it a strong foundation, questions remain about its liquidity and broader market integration. Analysts tracking which crypto will explode note that PI’s growth potential depends heavily on its ability to transition from community hype to real-world adoption. Technical patterns show promising signs, but the asset will need sustained demand to maintain upward momentum. If these bullish signals hold, Pi could be one of the altcoins to watch alongside the Ethereum price surge and other top movers. Cold Wallet: Lockdown-Level Security Meets Growth Potential While traders chase short-term gains from assets like ETH and PI, Cold Wallet is positioning itself as a long-term powerhouse in both security and utility. Built with a self-custodial framework, Cold Wallet ensures users maintain full control over their private keys, delivering cold-storage-level security without sacrificing accessibility. The platform offers multi-signature approvals, meaning large transfers or treasury moves can only be completed with authorization from multiple parties. For DAOs, corporate accounts, or shared investment pools, this adds a vital layer of governance. Alongside this, time-locked transactions allow users to add a deliberate delay before funds move, creating an extra safeguard against mistakes or unauthorized transfers. Perhaps the standout feature is emergency wallet lockdown. With a single tap, all transactions are frozen, instantly halting any suspicious activity. This function can be critical during phishing attacks, compromised device scenarios, or sudden security breaches. From an investment standpoint, Cold Wallet is in Stage 17 of its presale with a current price of $0.00998. Over 716.99 million coins have been sold, raising $6.1 million. With a projected ROI of 50×, it has captured the attention of investors asking which crypto will explode in 2025. Combining top-tier security with significant upside potential, Cold Wallet is carving its position as both a protective tool and a wealth-building asset. The Final Verdict The Ethereum price surge and Pi’s bullish setup prove there’s no shortage of opportunities in crypto. Ethereum’s proximity to its all-time high and Pi’s potential 30% move will keep them in focus for traders. However, neither offers the built-in protection or tailored safety features of Cold Wallet. For those wondering which crypto will explode, the answer may not be limited to traditional tokens. Cold Wallet’s combination of biometric access, multi-signature security, time-locked transactions, and emergency lockdown capabilities makes it a unique contender in the race for both growth and safety. While markets chase the next Chainlink price surge, long-term investors may find their smartest move is locking in security and ROI potential with Cold Wallet.

Chainlink (LINK) bullish trend is gaining pace after breaking multi-month resistance, hinting at a potential 60% upside and new long-term highs. But the most disruptive play may not be live on exchanges yet. Cold Wallet (CWT) , in Stage 17 of its presale at $0.00998, already has over 2 million users from its $270M Plus Wallet acquisition. With Stage 1 starting at $0.007 and a confirmed $0.3517 listing, its built-in market gives it a sharper ROI profile than ETH or LINK. Ethereum’s $1B ETF Surge Puts $4,800 in Sight Ethereum is trading near $4,293 after a record $1.02 billion flowed into spot ETH ETFs in a single day, led by BlackRock’s $640 million purchase of 150,000 ETH. Fidelity and other funds also joined the buying spree, pushing total ETF inflows to $10.8 billion. This marks Ethereum’s highest price level in over two years and places it just 15% below its all-time high from November 2021. On-chain data shows exchange-held ETH at a nine-year low, hinting at reduced sell pressure. The technicals point to strong momentum, with resistance at $4,352 and targets up to $4,800. If institutional demand holds, Ethereum could be positioned for a breakout, making it a candidate for investors watching the next market leader. Could $50 Be Next for Chainlink? Chainlink is showing strength today, with prices climbing past long-held resistance and hinting at a possible 60% move. Its recent breakout, combined with shrinking supply and growing demand, has pushed LINK through a downward trend that held it back for months. Chainlink’s real-world connections are also expanding. A new partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) means financial-grade data now extends to the blockchain, expanding Chainlink’s reach beyond DeFi. If the current momentum holds, the analysts say LINK could aim for roughly $26 short term, surge to $31–$32 over a few months, and potentially reach $35–$36 longer term. Those watching for the next big move might want to consider Chainlink; its technicals and utility suggest the upside is strengthening. Cold Wallet Presale Locks $6M With Millions of Users Cold Wallet is rewriting how crypto launches happen. Instead of raising funds and scrambling for adoption later, it is entering the market with more than 2 million users already in place, thanks to its $270M acquisition of Plus Wallet. This user base, combined with a fully functional cashback utility, means Stage 17’s $0.00998 price is more than an early entry; it is a ticket into a launch-ready ecosystem. Since Stage 1, when Cold Wallet was priced at just $0.007, each presale stage has inched closer to the confirmed $0.3517 launch price. That creates a shrinking ROI window for new buyers. With $6M already secured and over 700 million tokens sold, demand is clearly outpacing supply. Unlike speculative projects still searching for traction, Cold Wallet offers immediate utility. Every transaction, swap, or transfer through the wallet turns network activity into cashback rewards. The presale is not about proving interest; it is about scaling an existing user economy before listing. At the current pace, the remaining stages will not last long. Those waiting for post-launch access may find the best upside already gone. For anyone seeking a crypto entry with built-in adoption, Cold Wallet’s timing could be the decisive edge. Cold Wallet’s Presale Edge Could Outrun ETH and LINK Gains Ethereum (ETH) price prediction charts point toward $4,800, and the Chainlink (LINK) bullish trend is stacking partnerships to fuel further growth. Yet both remain bound by market volatility. Cold Wallet, priced at $0.00998 in Stage 17, offers a 3,423% upside to its $0.3517 launch; and unlike ETH or LINK, it enters with a preloaded user base and live cashback utility. This is not a speculative roadmap, but a functioning product scaling ahead of listing. While ETH and LINK may deliver strong gains, Cold Wallet’s early-stage entry and product-market fit could give it a faster, more certain path to exponential returns.

Ethereum Teeters at $4,700 — Breakout Oor Bloodbath? “The catch-up is over,” Kevin said, noting ETH has “finally caught up to basically where Bitcoin is at… it’s at its major resistance.” In his read, the $4,700 area is not a single tick but a supply zone defined by the prior cycle’s peak and reinforced by a “weekly downtrend on the RSI” that has capped every advance since early 2024. “Break resistance and the real bull will begin,” he added. Until that happens, he characterizes this band as the “line in the sand.” Momentum into the test was real. Kevin described money flow improving and “nice patterns forming on some altcoins” — including “textbook inverse head and shoulders” — before the follow-through failed and ETH stalled right at resistance. He pointed to the Asia session’s lack of continuation and, more forcefully, to a macro surprise that hit as the market was leaning long. Related Reading: Ethereum Still At Risk Of Being Overtaken By XRP? Analyst Walks Back Shocking Prediction That shock was the US Producer Price Index. “The PPI came in significantly hotter than expected,” Kevin said, emphasizing both the magnitude and where the pressure showed up: month-over-month +0.9% versus +0.2% expected, year-over-year 3.3% versus 2.5%, with core PPI +0.9% m/m versus +0.2% and 3.7% y/y versus 3.0%. In his view, this reflects tariff-driven costs being “brunted by the producer,” which is why the spike surfaced in PPI rather than CPI. The open question — and the risk to ETH at resistance — is whether those costs “trickle into the CPI” and, by extension, PCE. He underscored how quickly rate-cut probabilities whipsawed on the FedWatch tool intraday: September still heavily favored, October largely intact, and December “pricing out a third rate cut” before flipping back toward it as the day progressed. “This has been volatile this morning… let it settle out,” he cautioned, adding that next week’s Jackson Hole remarks from Chair Powell are the next major macro catalyst. Technically, Kevin’s checklist for Ethereum does not change with one data print. He stresses two confirmations: take out the horizontal supply around $4,700 with authority and “break the weekly downtrend on the RSI” to nullify the bearish divergence that has persisted since Q1 2024. “Resistance is resistance until it’s not,” he said. Fail there, and ETH risks another corrective leg as late longs are forced out at the worst possible spot. Succeed, and “the entire conversation changes,” opening a path to what he calls a “real bull” in ETH and, by knock-on effect, in the broader alt market. Related Reading: Ethereum CME Gap Threatens Recovery, Why A Crash To $4,080 Is Possible He ties ETH’s fate to broader market structure without diluting the focus. Total2 — his ETH-plus-alts proxy — “came up to 1.69 trillion” against a well-telegraphed breakout trigger at “1.72 trillion,” while tapping its own weekly RSI downtrend. The inability to push that last few dozen billions alongside the PPI shock explains the abrupt reversal across ETH and alts. Kevin also flagged stablecoin dynamics and seasonal liquidity as background variables, noting USDT dominance remains elevated and that September “usually” isn’t a great month as traditional funds return from summer, manage taxes, and prepare for Q4 risk. Operationally, he argues that the right trade location was behind us, not at resistance. “There’s no reason to be buying up in these crazy levels,” he said, advising patience for anyone positioned from lower. His framework is simple and strict: watch the weekly ETH chart, the $4,700 band, and the RSI trendline. If macro “stays steady,” he expects the break; if it deteriorates, he’ll reassess. Either way, the pivot won’t come from lower-timeframe noise but from ETH finally resolving its four-year wall. “Focus on these charts and nothing else,” Kevin concluded. For Ethereum, that means one test, one level, and one signal: clear $4,700 and retire the divergence — or wait. At press time, ETH traded at $4,619.

50141915,557677,1755280853,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50141915.jpeg,Ripple CTO Says XRP Ledger Has Been Battle-Tested To Power World’s Financial System,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-on-xrp-ledger/,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David JoelKatz Schwartz, has reaffirmed the XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) eagerness to serve as a core infrastructure for the world’s financial system . He emphasized that the XRPL has been thoroughly battle-tested, demonstrating both resilience and adaptability as blockchain adoption continues to expand globally. Ripple CTO Touts XRP Ledger’s Global Potential On Wednesday, Schwartz published a rather lengthy post on X social media, underscoring the XRP Ledger ’s proven durability and readiness to function as a critical infrastructure for the global finance system. The Ripple CTO pointed to the rising number of payment and stablecoin providers developing their blockchains. He interpreted this trend as evidence that blockchain technology is increasingly regarded as a fundamental pillar of modern financial architecture. Furthermore, Schwartz noted that Ripple has been working steadfastly toward its vision of establishing the XRP Ledger as a secure, scalable, and interoperable foundation for global finance for more than 13 years. During this time, the crypto payments company has gradually refined the ledger’s capabilities to meet institutional-grade demands. Unlike blockchains that rely on permissioned validator sets managed by a single entity or group of people, the XRPL operates as a public, permissionless network , while also providing optional permissioned features for regulated environments. The Ripple CTO argued that this flexibility allows the blockchain network to remain open and compliant, ensuring it can bridge markets, connect participants, and move assets efficiently across borders. Schwartz also revealed that the XRP Ledger’s architecture is designed to prioritize low, predictable fees without a separate gas token to facilitate transactions. He explained that all transfers are settled directly in XRP, thereby reducing friction and eliminating the cost of acquiring another token to transact. Notably, XRP itself was created to function as a counterparty-free bridge asset, facilitating payments, settlements , and liquidity with genuine real-world utility. According to Schwartz, every XRPL transaction burns a small amount of its token, further reinforcing XRP’s integrated role within the ecosystem. The Ripple CTO also pointed out that the ledger incorporates features such as deterministic finality and Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism , which have long provided predictable settlement times and reduced cost. He observed that many newer blockchain projects are beginning to adopt these capabilities. Schwartz suggests that this adoption is evidence of the network’s forward-thinking architecture and ability to serve as a blueprint for financial-grade blockchain solutions. The Next Phase Of The XRPL Looking ahead, Schwartz has outlined a roadmap for the XRP Ledger’s continued evolution , with a strong focus on programmability, compliance, and enhanced liquidity. The push for greater programmability signals an ambition to expand beyond its already proven payments and settlements capabilities, paving the way for the development of more complex and essential financial applications on the network. Schwartz’s emphasis on Compliance-grade features is also expected to play a central role in XRPL’s future growth, integrating characteristics that meet regulatory standards without compromising decentralization. In addition, the XRP Ledger will prioritize deeper liquidity to support large-scale institutional transactions without slippage or excessive costs.","Ripple|David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz|PoA|Proof of Authority|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-15 18:00:53

After surging to an all-time high of $124,457 on August 13, BTC plunged as low as $117,477 on Friday morning before stabilizing around $119,000.

Despite the correction, on-chain data suggests the market may be setting up for another leg higher. Exchange netflows have dipped to levels historically seen before major bull runs in 2017 and 2021, signaling reduced selling pressure from long-term holders. Short-Term Bitcoin (BTC) Holders Show Strength Amid Volatility One of the most striking trends has been the resilience of short-term holders (STHs), defined as addresses holding Bitcoin (BTC) for 155 days or less. Instead of selling into the rally, STHs have shifted toward accumulation, as reflected in the rebound of the STH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) above the neutral line. This indicates that coins moved by STHs are being sold at a profit, yet without triggering large-scale profit-taking. Market analysts view this conviction as a stabilizing force that could help absorb selling pressure and support higher prices in the coming weeks. BTC's price breaks below $120,000 on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Derivatives Market Points to Aggressive Buying The derivatives market has also flashed bullish signals. Over the past 24 hours, BTC recorded $24.28 million in short liquidations versus $17.16 million in long liquidations, alongside a 65% surge in trading volume to $149.47 billion. Options volume soared 128% to $9.43 billion, while the taker buy/sell ratio hit a monthly high of 1.16, a sign that buyers are aggressively absorbing supply. Positive funding rates further indicate traders’ willingness to pay premiums to hold long positions, suggesting confidence without excessive leverage risk. The NVT Golden Cross, a valuation-to-transaction metric, has dropped sharply, a pattern that has historically preceded strong rallies.

50141797,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78561,1755280856,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ethena’s Price Surge, PENGU’s Breakout Buzz, and Why Cold Wallet Could Be the Top Bullish Crypto for 2025",https://timestabloid.com/ethenas-price-surge-pengus-breakout-buzz-and-why-cold-wallet/,"Crypto’s most compelling opportunities often emerge when momentum meets real adoption, and today, three names stand out. The Ethena (ENA) price surge is powered by a $10 billion TVL milestone, a golden cross technical pattern, and consistent whale accumulation, making it a candidate for top bullish crypto status. PENGU price outlook has turned heads with a potential 100% breakout on the horizon, fueled by a sharp rise in trading volume and institutional moves like Nasdaq-listed BTCS adding Pudgy Penguins NFTs to its treasury. But neither matches the immediate adoption advantage of Cold Wallet , which enters the market with 706 million tokens sold, over 2 million preloaded users, and a cashback model designed to lock in engagement. At Stage 17’s $0.00998 price, it’s a rare case of built-in demand before supply caps, a setup that the top bullish crypto investors look for. Ethena Soars 150%. With TVL at $10 Billion, Is $1 the Next Easy Target? Ethena (ENA) is riding a powerful wave; its token has surged 150% in the past month , including a 40% jump this week, riding momentum and growing demand. The protocol’s Total Value Locked (TVL) has just broken past $10 billion , largely thanks to its fast-growing stablecoin, USDe , which now ranks among the top three globally by market cap. Analysts point to a bullish technical setup, the golden cross when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day, often signaling further upside. Combined with daily $5 million buybacks and increasing whale accumulation, Ethena’s ecosystem shows strong conviction. If you’re wondering which crypto to invest in during this rally, ENA stands out for its real adoption metrics, reinforced by both on-chain strength and market momentum. PENGU Soars Again: Is a 100% Breakout Next After NFT Treasury Signal? Pudgy Penguins’ token PENGU has rallied recently, climbing to approximately $0.0376 with a 17.5% jump in trading volume , hinting at a possible breakout beyond current levels. Analysts point to a technical “flag and pole” formation on the chart that could support a further 100% surge toward $0.075 by mid‑September. The push comes amid growing institutional interest. Nasdaq‑listed BTCS Inc. has added Pudgy Penguins NFTs to its corporate treasury. That signals increasing confidence from traditional finance players. While this remains speculative, the combination of on-chain momentum, ETF speculation, and brand visibility makes PENGU a token to watch. For investors looking to ride potential upside rooted in real-world adoption, now may be a timely entry point. Cold Wallet’s $0.00998 Stage 17 Is the Final Window Before Demand Outruns Supply In crypto, the biggest wins often come from projects where demand is locked in before supply is capped and Cold Wallet is a textbook example. With over 706 million tokens already sold and more than 2 million preloaded users from the Plus Wallet acquisition, it has both the audience and the adoption pathway secured before launch day. This isn’t a case of “build it and hope they come,” the user base is already here, ready to transact. The Stage 17 of best token presale price of $0.00998 Batch 17 is the final step before momentum shifts from steady accumulation to full-blown rush-buying. Once this stage closes, the gap to the fixed $0.3517 listing price becomes impossible to ignore. Cold Wallet’s cashback rewards model adds another layer, keeping users active and engaged, which strengthens network value over time. In a market full of speculative plays, this is a rare opportunity where supply dynamics, adoption, and utility are already aligned in the investor’s favor. Every day in Stage 17 is a day closer to the point where buying stops being strategic and starts being reactive. For those looking for a presale with built-in demand and clear upside, the window is open but not for long. Cold Wallet’s Demand-Ready Launch Puts It Ahead of ENA and PENGU as the Top Bullish Crypto While the Ethena (ENA) price surge reflects strong technical and on-chain health, and the PENGU price outlook suggests high upside speculation, Cold Wallet stands apart by removing uncertainty from the adoption equation. Fully funded with $5.9 million, it launches with a live audience, a transaction-reward model that sustains user activity, and clear visibility on value Stage 17’s $0.00998 entry against a fixed $0.3517 listing. In the search for the top bullish crypto , demand-versus-supply dynamics matter, and CWT already has both in its favor. ENA still needs to convert its momentum into sustained price action, and PENGU’s breakout depends on technical follow-through. Cold Wallet’s path is more direct: immediate usage, locked-in growth mechanics, and a presale stage about to shift from accumulation to rush-buying.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/trader-dumps-his-xrp-holdings-for-chainlink-link-at-10-discount-heres-why/,"A viral exchange on X has reignited the XRP-versus-Chainlink debate after prominent community watcher Mickle mocked a trader for selling all his XRP for “a 10% discount coin on Chainlink’s private oracle network.” Mickle’s comment was in response to a detailed post from Jazzappreciator, who explained why he liquidated his XRP and DOGE holdings in favor of Chainlink (LINK) after an eye-opening debate. Why the Switch Happened According to Jazzappreciator, his decision came after joining an XRP vs. LINK discussion in X Spaces. He claimed the XRP community often relies on “trust the plan” narratives rather than verifiable evidence. Dude sold all his XRP for a 10% discount coin on chainlinks private oracle network https://t.co/DjmqzhWpJ4 — mickle (@xrpmickle) August 15, 2025 When he asked XRP advocates for sources, they reportedly deflected with vague responses, while LINK supporters provided direct references to partnerships with banks, governments, and Fortune 500 companies. This contrast prompted him to research Chainlink extensively over the weekend, discovering a long list of documented collaborations that were easy to verify. Feeling disillusioned with XRP’s culture, he sold all his holdings for LINK, describing it as a project “that does something” and publishes transparent partnership details. The Case for Chainlink Chainlink’s public record includes partnerships across traditional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is being tested by major financial institutions for tokenization and settlement, with high-profile collaborations such as the SWIFT blockchain interoperability initiative. Public announcements, available on Chainlink’s website and in mainstream coverage, have strengthened its reputation as a key connectivity layer for institutional blockchain adoption.

In December 2024, it launched RLUSD, a USD-backed stablecoin now integrated into Ripple Payments. The company is also expanding its institutional reach, including the planned acquisition of Hidden Road, a move aimed at deepening its financial network capabilities. Ripple continues to position XRP at the center of its cross-border payment solutions while building out broader use cases in on-chain finance. XRP Price Action Today As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.06, within a daily range of $3.04–$3.14. The token is consolidating after recent market swings, with traders watching for a breakout as macroeconomic sentiment shifts. For comparison, Bitcoin is around $117,200, while Chainlink trades near $21.88. The Takeaway Mickle’s post highlighted one trader’s journey from XRP to LINK, but the larger message is universal: don’t trust—verify. Chainlink’s supporters point to a robust, publicly documented ecosystem, while Ripple is steadily rolling out products and integrations aimed at expanding XRP’s utility. For investors, the key is to track real-world adoption, measurable progress, and market performance—not just community narratives.

Its stock has also risen sharply this year to a near 12-year high earlier this week, as well as those of other European lenders. The bank’s shares dropped after a U.S. Republican lawmaker called for a probe into the bank over alleged financial misconduct. New York’s Representative, Elise Stefanik, wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the financial institution’s illegal payments to known terrorists. Stefanik accuses Standard Chartered of transacting illegal payments Today, I respectfully requested Attorney General @AGPamBondi to investigate Standard Chartered Bank's illicit payments to known terrorists and @NewYorkStateAG Tish James' inaction on the payments while approving bank licensure. https://t.co/l9CeNVEz82 pic.twitter.com/a5REsUhMav — Rep. Elise Stefanik (@RepStefanik) August 15, 2025 Stefanik also noted that Standard Chartered had made $9.6 billion in illegal transactions to known terrorists. She alleged that China has been using the bank’s systems to purchase sanctioned Iranian oil. According to the report, the transactions were hidden from required disclosures. The disclosures are under the current deferred prosecution agreement being supervised by the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., and the Southern District of New York. The lawmaker also called for a probe into Standard Chartered for allegedly evading ongoing sanctions. She said the lack of further action on the matter would cause the case to expire on Tuesday, August 19. “Without further action on this case there is grave risk of additional funds being funneled to terrorist organizations that endanger the United States and the American people.” – Elise Stefanik , U.S. Representative for New York. The lawmaker also called for a probe into the state’s Attorney General Letitia James’ inaction on the payments while approving the bank’s annual license. She alleged that terrorist financing experts and whistleblowers about the illicit payments notified James and her top officials. Stefanik said James’ failure to act raised questions regarding the illicit payments and their connection to the Biden Administration. The New York Representative also revealed that she received reports from whistleblowers that disclosed that the bank used servers based in Newark, New Jersey, to execute the payments. She called for the appointment of the Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey as Special Attorney to the Attorney General in charge of Standard Chartered matters. According to her, it was because there was an immediate national security risk presented by the financial institution’s activity and James’ failure to act against it. The bank’s drop in share price came amid its recent buyback of shares on July 31. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Standard Chartered spent $1.3 billion on the initiative after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profits. In 2019, the London-headquartered bank was also fined $1.1 billion by U.S. and UK authorities for money laundering and sanctions breaches. Standard Chartered agreed to pay $947 million to the U.S. over allegations it violated sanctions against countries including Iran, Syria, Sudan, Cuba, Zimbabwe, and Burma. The financial institutions also agreed to pay 102 million euros for anti-money-laundering breaches in the Middle East. The U.S. Treasury Department alleged that Standard Chartered processed illegal payments worth $438 million between 2009 and 2014. The majority of the transactions were linked to Iranian accounts from the bank’s Dubai branch. The financial institution acknowledged taking full responsibility for the violations and control deficiencies. Standard Chartered still put some blame on two former junior employees, alleging that they were aware some customers had Iranian connections.

Lewat suap, cuci uang,… pic.twitter.com/oGfnVYFen3 — Ardianto Satriawan (@ardisatriawan) February 18, 2025 The London-headquartered bank was also hit with a $2.7 billion lawsuit in early July. The lawsuit came from the lender’s alleged role in the 1MDB scandal, one of the world’s largest financial fraud cases. Standard Chartered was accused of allowing the movement of billions of dollars that were stolen from Malaysia’s 1MDB fund. It is alleged that the bank did not sufficiently confirm the origin of the funds or where it was going. According to the report, the financial institution allegedly allowed more than 100 suspicious transfers between 2009 and 2013, despite warning signs that the transactions might be illegal. The London-headquartered bank said the claims were without merit and it will vigorously defend any lawsuits initiated by the liquidators. 1MDB’s spokesperson said the board was pleased that court-appointed liquidators were taking action, which he said would benefit the victims of fraud, including 1MDB.
