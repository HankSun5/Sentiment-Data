Speaking to Reuters, Biswarup Chatterjee, Citi’s global head of partnerships and innovation for its services division, said the bank is looking at providing custody for the high-quality assets that back stablecoins. Citi’s Stablecoin Plans Could Reshape Digital Asset Payments and Settlement Under the GENIUS Act signed into law this year, issuers must hold safe assets like U.S. Treasuries or cash to support their tokens, creating an opening for traditional custody banks to step in. “Providing custody services for those high-quality assets backing stablecoins is the first option we are looking at,” Chatterjee said. Citi’s services arm, which includes treasury, cash management, and payments for major corporations, has been a core part of the bank even as it undergoes a sweeping restructuring. The interest comes as the stablecoin market grows beyond crypto trading into mainstream payments and settlements. McKinsey estimates about $250 billion in stablecoins have been issued, but usage is still largely concentrated within the crypto sector. Citi sees the recent legislation as a turning point. Citigroup @Citi is weighing its own stablecoin and diving into tokenized deposits, CEO Jane Fraser said during the Q2 earnings call, signaling a deeper digital pivot. #Citi #Stablecoins https://t.co/95SaJd4U7k — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 16, 2025 Citi is also considering issuing its own stablecoin, an idea CEO Jane Fraser confirmed in July during the bank’s second-quarter earnings call. “We are looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin, but probably most importantly is the tokenized deposit space, where we’re very active,” Fraser told analysts at the time. She said the goal was to modernize infrastructure and deliver “the benefits of advancements in stablecoin and digital assets to our clients in a safe and sound manner.” Citi’s ambitions extend beyond stablecoins. The bank is examining custody services for the crypto assets underpinning exchange-traded funds. Since the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs last year, the largest, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, has amassed a market cap of around $90 billion. “There needs to be custody of the equivalent amount of digital currency to support these ETFs,” Chatterjee noted. Coinbase currently dominates the ETF custody space, serving more than 80% of issuers. On the payments front, Citi already offers “tokenized” U.S. dollar transfers via blockchain between accounts in New York, London, and Hong Kong, operating 24 hours a day. The bank is now developing services to let clients send stablecoins between accounts or instantly convert them into dollars for payments. Chatterjee said discussions with clients are underway to identify use cases. Regulators, once cautious about traditional banks entering the crypto sector, have adopted a more accommodating stance under the current U.S. administration. Still, Citi will need to comply with anti-money laundering rules and international currency controls. Custody operations, Chatterjee stressed, must ensure assets were used for legitimate purposes before acquisition and must be backed by robust cyber and operational security. Fraser has framed Citi’s approach as a response to client needs and the broader shift toward always-on, instant settlement. “Digital assets are the next evolution in the broader digitization of payments, financing, and liquidity,” she said. “Ultimately, what we care about is what our clients want and how do we meet that need.” With $2.57 trillion in assets under custody, Citi’s entry into stablecoins and ETF crypto custody could reshape how traditional finance integrates with the digital asset economy. U.S. Banking Groups Urge Congress to Ban Stablecoin Yield Payments by Affiliates Major U.S. banking trade associations are urging Congress to bar stablecoin issuers’ affiliates from paying interest to token holders, warning it could drain deposits from banks and limit lending. U.S. bank groups seek to expand GENIUS Act limits on stablecoin interest, raising broader questions over global payments policy. #stablecoin #geniusact https://t.co/dhN9j0X3QZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 13, 2025 In a joint letter, the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Consumer Bankers Association, Financial Services Forum, and Independent Community Bankers of America said the GENIUS Act’s current language prohibits issuers from offering yield but leaves a gap that allows exchanges and related entities to do so. They cited Treasury estimates that interest-bearing stablecoins could trigger up to $6.6 trillion in deposit outflows, increasing funding pressure on banks and money market funds. The groups stressed that bank deposits remain a key source for loans, while stablecoins are not designed for lending and lack equivalent oversight. They warned that joint marketing between issuers and exchanges could accelerate withdrawals in times of stress, raising borrowing costs for households and businesses. They called for extending the prohibition to all intermediaries handling stablecoin transactions. The push comes amid rapid sector growth. CertiK reports stablecoin supply rose from $204 billion to $252 billion in early 2025, with USDT dominating and USDC expanding to $61 billion. PayPal’s PYUSD doubled via a Solana integration and launched a 3.7% yield program. Coinbase and PayPal maintain their reward programs, arguing the ban applies only to issuers. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse predicts the market could grow to $2 trillion , driven by institutional adoption and regulation.

Dominance just dropped to a six-month low. Money is shifting. Alts are running faster. Ethereum leads. New, crypto-friendly regs loosen the path for institutions and funds. That opens wallets, ETFs, and custody flows. The result is capital rotating into ETH and other majors. The dominance chart printed its first monthly bearish cross since January 2021. That cross mattered before. In 2021, it prefaced four months of alt strength. If the pattern repeats, markets could see an “up-only” stretch into December 2025. Bitcoin dominance hits 6-month low Altcoin market growth is beginning to outpace #Bitcoin , fueled by renewed strength in #Ethereum following the introduction of crypto-friendly regulations that support broader global adoption. pic.twitter.com/WeoIWW5bVx — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) August 14, 2025 Bitcoin still makes headlines. It logged a fresh all-time high this week, pushing prices into the mid-$124k range. The breakout tightened the narrative: BTC rallies, institutions cheer, and headline flow accelerates. From the August 3 low of $111,982, Bitcoin has bounced more than 9%, a clean reward for dip buyers. Some analysts now voice targets as high as $200,000 by year-end. SpaceX’s crypto position sits at the center of the story. Arkham’s on-chain tracking ties an address to SpaceX that holds 8,285 BTC. After the recent ATH, that stash crossed the $1 billion mark. The math is simple. SpaceX bought between December 31, 2020, and June 10, 2022. BTC traded near $30k when the firm last reshuffled. Today, at six-figure prices, that position has climbed more than 300% in value and now reads roughly $1.02 billion on the books. Arkham’s record also shows the company moved 17,314 BTC into Coinbase Prime across late May to early June 2022, a transfer market watchers treat as a past sell or custody reallocation. Three weeks ago the wallet moved 1,308 BTC to a new address labelled “bc1q8,” but Arkham flags that move as a relocation, not a liquidation. The coins remain on-chain and unsold. Musk’s Tesla Still Holds Bitcoin Position Tesla rounds out the Musk crypto picture. The carmaker still holds 11,509 BTC. At today’s prices that stake sits in the low-to-mid-billion range, bringing Elon-linked corporate BTC to roughly $2.4 billion combined. Arkham and corporate filings show the pair bought their positions at an average price near $32,000. That cost basis amplifies the unrealized gains on their balance sheets and normalizes the idea of corporate crypto allocation for other firms. Elon Musk’s SpaceX #Bitcoin Holding Exceeds $1B Amid $BTC Rally to New All-Time High. The SpaceX Bitcoin holding has surpassed $1 billion following the cryptocurrency’s rally to a new record high. Data from Arkham highlighted this, as SpaceX’s diamond hand continues to pay off.… pic.twitter.com/vQwdy6pZG2 — TheCryptoBasic (@thecryptobasic) August 14, 2025 Token data points punctuate the move. CoinMarketCap shows Bitcoin trading with a multi-trillion dollar market cap and Ethereum moving higher on the rotation. Quick drops matter. When a token is named, toss a snapshot. BTC: price in the six figures, market cap in the trillions. ETH : price in the low-to-mid thousands, market cap in the hundreds of billions, flows and yield chase now tilt toward smart-contract collateral and ETFable infrastructure. Why this feels structural: three forces line up. First, regulatory clarity in several jurisdictions reduces frictions for big money. Second, corporate treasuries with “diamond hands” sit on huge unrealized profits and show no intent to sell. Third, a bearish cross on BTC dominance signals rotation, not rejection. The net effect is broader market participation. Assets that were once niche now sit on institutional radars. Early entrants reap gains. Late entrants chase performance. What to expect next. Volatility stays high. Rotations accelerate. Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche and other majors can run hard while BTC consolidates at new highs. If the 2021 pattern holds, altcoins could enjoy multi-quarter upside that stretches into late 2025. That does not mean smooth sailing. Pullbacks and headlines will yank price action daily. But the macro setup leans bullish: clearer rules, corporate HODLers, and fresh capital seeking growth beyond a single coin. Quick facts: Bitcoin dominance at a six-month low with a monthly bearish cross; BTC ATH this week near $124k; SpaceX holds 8,285 BTC (~~$1.02B); Tesla holds 11,509 BTC (~~$1.4B); combined Musk firms sit on roughly $2.42B in Bitcoin at an average buy-in near $32k. The market is no longer a one-horse race. Bitcoin still leads the parade. But altcoins now sprint beside it. Institutions and corporate treasuries are watching. December 2025 looks set to be a defining checkpoint, and right now the tape favors a broad, multi-asset rally. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Many of the biggest opportunities for outsized gains are coming from altcoins with strong fundamentals, active ecosystems, and catalysts that could trigger substantial upside. As traders look beyond Bitcoin for the next breakout candidates, Ethereum, XRP and Toncoin are consistently appearing on analysts’ buy lists. Ethereum Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs, and smart contract innovation. The current Ethereum 2.0 updates have eased the gas a lot and also enhanced the scalability which are some of the major challenges that ETH network is facing. Solutions within the L2 sector – such as Arbitrum and Optimism – are also attracting additional users with cheaper and faster transactions . Institutional uptake is picking up pace, with ETFs and mega-partnerships fulfilling the status of Ethereum as a blue – chip crypto. Being the most popular platform among the developers, ETH will continue to become the main asset of those who plan to take part in the great market rally. XRP XRP has re-entered the spotlight following regulatory clarity in its case against the SEC. With that hurdle cleared , Ripple is focusing on expanding its global payment network, RippleNet, which enables fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Financial institutions are already adopting it in various parts and the layers of infrastructure have been supplied to it to go wider. Among the most interesting altcoins, which investors can consider, XRP would be one of the rare ones that combine an established utility and new activities levels. While established leaders like Ethereum and XRP provide stability, some of the highest percentage gains historically have come from early-stage projects just before their breakout moments. MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention for showing patterns similar to ETH and XRP in their formative stages – rapid community growth, limited early supply, and consistent sellouts in funding rounds . The project’s roadmap includes utility-driven features designed to support long-term adoption, rather than relying on hype alone. For traders looking to position ahead of a potential Q4 surge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as a strategic addition alongside more established assets. Toncoin Toncoin’s unique advantage lies in its deep integration with Telegram, one of the largest messaging platforms in the world. By embedding blockchain functionality directly into an app used by hundreds of millions, TON lowers the barrier to entry for new crypto users . Features like in-app payments, DeFi tools, and NFT marketplaces are already live or in development, potentially bringing Web3 capabilities to a massive mainstream audience. This ease of access and built-in user funnel give TON a distinct growth path that few other projects can match. Conclusion Ethereum, XRP, Toncoin, and Sei each bring unique strengths to the table – from established networks to emerging adoption models. Such balance (by the means of pairing them with early stage plays such as MAGACOIN FINANCE) enables one to capture the savour of two worlds in one, having both the low volatility and the huge upside potential . As market sentiment is already improving and new money is getting into altcoins – the next breakout could be well rewarding systematic positioning prior to the crowd.

The on-chain trail shows a basket of major and layer-2 assets. Here’s a quick price snapshot from CoinMarketCap at reporting time: ETH — ~$4,692 AVAX (Avalanche) — ~$24.11. ARB (Arbitrum) — ~$0.53. OP (Optimism) — ~$0.78. MNT (Mantle) — ~$1.11 MATIC / POL (Polygon) — ~ $0.24. Those tokens moved in slices across chains. The attacker then routed many of them through swaps and liquidity paths that end in ETH — a common laundering tactic because ETH offers deep liquidity on DEXs and easier aggregation. Lookonchain’s thread documents swaps and shows the piecemeal conversion into ETH. Why this matters now: converting to ETH lets an attacker fragment value across pools and DEX routes, then layer transfers through many addresses or services. That increases the chance of slipping funds into privacy rails or into centralized platforms that may be harder to freeze unless quickly alerted. Rapid cross-chain movement also raises the chance some portions slip out of easy reach. What BtcTurk users should know: deposits and withdrawals from hot wallets are paused. Trading and Turkish-lira operations continue. Check only official BtcTurk announcements for status updates. Do not follow unverified links or third-party instructions that claim to “fix” your account. What investigators are likely doing: security teams from major exchanges and chain-analysis firms typically coordinate fast. They try to trace the funds, identify known mixer or exchange on-ramps, and request freezes where possible. Public trackers and firms like Lookonchain and CyversAlerts are already mapping the flow; their threads present the real-time breadcrumbs. Bottom line: this is an active laundering event with clear signs of a hot-wallet compromise. $48M worth of assets moved across ETH, AVAX, ARB, BASE, OP, MNT and MATIC — most ending up in two addresses and being swapped into ETH. BtcTurk has paused crypto deposits/withdrawals while it investigates and promises to restore services once secure.

Market signs seem to support that view. Today, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,128, exactly one month after its previous historic peak of $122,838, suggesting bullish momentum is stirring. On the policy front, President Trump last month approved the GENIUS Act, the first federal framework requiring stablecoins to be fully backed by reserves. Soon after, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rolled out Project Crypto , a major modernization plan for securities regulation aimed at clearing up long-standing ambiguities in digital asset oversight. Together, these developments show the administration’s intent to follow through on its pledge to make America the global hub for blockchain innovation. With optimism building, some analysts expect the next gold rush across meme coins and altcoins could top 2021’s heady highs, led, if DeepSeek is correct, by XRP, Pepe, and Shiba Inu. XRP (Ripple): DeepSeek AI Model Predicts 3× Gains, Possibly Hitting $10 by December DeepSeek’s AI models suggest XRP ($XRP) could climb toward $10 before the end of 2025, more than tripling its current $3.12 price tag. XRP’s momentum has been strong. On July 18, it reached $3.65, beating its 2018 record of $3.40, before retracing about 14%. Still, the token has posted a 9% advance on last month, outperforming Bitcoin, which has remained static after falling 4.2% from its ATH over the last few hours. Global recognition for Ripple’s payment technology has been growing. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund named XRP a top contender for efficient international transactions. Ripple also closed a multi-year legal battle with the SEC this year after regulators dropped their case, cementing a key 2023 court decision that retail XRP sales are not securities. Should XRP reclaim its ATH and break higher, DeepSeek believes $5 is easily achievable, with $10 possible in a sustained bull market. Technical metrics are also promising: RSI is trending higher from 56, indicating increased buying. Over the past year, XRP has soared 452%, outpacing Bitcoin’s 95% and Ethereum’s 76% rallies. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Heavyweight Could Jump 6× Before Year-End Debuting in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly become one of the top three meme cryptocurrencies, now boasting a $4.8 billion market cap and leading all non-dog-themed meme tokens. Despite fierce rivalry in the meme sector, Pepe’s active community and deep liquidity keep it competitive. Elon Musk has hinted at holding Pepe alongside Dogecoin, occasionally teasing fans with subtle nods on X, including a brief stint using a Pepe avatar. Trading at $0.00001133, Pepe has gained 5% over the last seven days, outperforming Bitcoin. A 6% dip over the past 24 hours mirrors corrections across other meme leaders, with DOGE falling 5% and the entire sub-sector shedding 4% of its value to command a collective market cap of $77.3 billion. DeepSeek estimates a year-end target of $0.00005, just under five times the current price, well above its previous high of $0.00002803 set late last year. A descending wedge pattern on its chart, typically a bullish setup, between November and March, hints at a breakout. If market conditions remain favorable, Pepe could even exceed DeepSeek’s baseline forecast before 2025 begins. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Ethereum’s Most Handy Meme Coin Could 76× in a Bull Run, according to DeepSeek AI Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has cemented its place as Dogecoin’s largest rival, with a market capitalization of roughly $7.7 billion. Currently priced near $0.00001312, SHIB is edging out of two notable bullish setups, a bullish falling wedge and a flag pattern formed earlier this year. If it breaks resistance around $0.000025, DeepSeek projects a move into the $0.0003–$0.001 range, representing potential 23× to 76× gains. The RSI is climbing from 42, pointing to rising buying interest. Token burns are also accelerating scarcity: over the course of one week last month, over 1.3 billion SHIB were destroyed, spiking the burn rate above 2,000%. Beyond its meme roots, Shiba Inu now features the Shibarium Layer-2 network, designed to enhance scalability, cut transaction costs, and support decentralized applications. The coin has also added privacy features in a bid to enhance utility and make it a standout among meme coins. Maxi Doge Presale Nears $1M as Hype Grows Around Potential 100× Play For those chasing high-risk, high-reward meme plays, presales could yield potentially more substantial upside than the multibillion coins under analysis by DeepSeek AI. Maxi Doge (MAXI) , a Dogecoin-inspired newcomer, has already drawn over $904,000 just days after launch. Running on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, MAXI emphasizes community building through active social channels, trading competitions, and promotional partnerships. A quarter of its total 150.24 billion token supply is set aside in the “Maxi Fund” for marketing and collaborations. Stakers can currently earn up to 318% APY—though rates will decline as more participants join. Priced at $0.000252 during its current presale stage, the token will increase in price in under 48 hours as it enters the next round, giving early buyers extra value before listing. Interested investors can purchase via the Maxi Doge website using wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet . Follow Maxi Doge on X and Telegram to keep up to date with developments.

It hit $124,128 before declining 2.1% to its current price of $121,100. The achievement has reignited speculation that a long-anticipated post-halving bull run may finally be underway. Investor interest has expanded beyond Bitcoin, spilling into major altcoins and the best meme coins . Over the past year, assets like XRP, TRON, Solana, Sui Network, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each set new price records. U.S. policymakers further boosted sentiment recently when they took major steps toward cohesive crypto regulation. Just four days after BTC’s milestone, on July 18, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first comprehensive stablecoin law. Meanwhile, the SEC rolled out “ Project Crypto ,” a sweeping initiative to modernize securities laws and deliver long-awaited regulatory clarity for digital assets. With optimism running high, we take a look at how these high-performing altcoins could soon retest or surpass their historical peaks. Ripple (XRP): Ripple’s Signature Crypto Eyes New Price Highs Amid Growing Global Recognition Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) hit a fresh record of $3.65 on July 18, the day the GENIUS Act became law, eclipsing its 2018 peak of $3.40. Since then, it has eased to roughly $3.22, about 11% down from its historic peak. XRP remains a favorite for long-term investors thanks to its ability to facilitate fast, inexpensive cross-border payments without relying on traditional, slow-moving systems like SWIFT. Its competitive advantage has drawn notice from high-profile entities, including the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the White House. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was one of just two crypto executives invited to a presidential summit on digital assets. A pivotal win came in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that retail sales of XRP did not breach securities laws, effectively ending a lengthy SEC battle and restoring market confidence. In the last 12 months, XRP’s value has surged 459%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 99% gain. A bullish flag formation from January to April broke upward in June, and momentum is holding. Over the past week, XRP has climbed 7.6%, topping Bitcoin’s 5.4% rise despite the latter achieving an ATH. With its relative strength index (RSI) uptrending from 56 and price consolidating near its 30-day moving average at $3 at the start of August, the charts suggest a push toward $4 could happen as soon as September.

Launched in 2023, Sei ($SEI) boasts it is “at the pinnacle of high-speed blockchain platforms.” It utilizes a specialized consensus mechanism called Tendermint , which prioritizes low-latency, high-throughput transactions, making it validate blocks in 6 seconds, half the time of Ethereum. This makes it attractive for developers looking to build decentralized exchanges, DeFi protocols, and NFT marketplaces where speed and price fairness are crucial. While the race for “fastest chain” is crowded, Sei’s infrastructure-first approach and its backing by prominent venture firms indicates a lofty ambition to become the default settlement layer for on-chain trading activity. In the last seven days, Sei has surged 17% to hit a price of $0.3469, outperforming both Bitcoin and XRP along the way. The intraweek price surge is down to support from MetaMask , a bullish indicator that Sei’s ecosystem is growing. Sei hit an ATH of $1.14 in mid-March last year, which it has since pulled away from by about 69.6%. Still, Sei’s focus on delivering high-quality tech, along with increasing market appetite for altcoins that can outperform Ethereum, are strong indicators that it could be primed for a run soon. It’s likely to face resistance at $0.50 but once cleared, a run up to its December 2024 high of $0.71 is not inconceivable before the end of the year. OKB ($OKB): Price Surged 170% in Intraday Trading as OKX Team Executes Massive Crypto Burn OKB ($OKB) is the native utility token of OKX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume. Just yesterday, it surged 170% in intraday trading to hit an ATH of $135.32, after months of trading sideways. This was thanks to the OKX team executing a $7.6 billion $OBK token burn and announcing a major upgrade With this robust upgrade, we’re building the world’s most interoperable, accessible & compliant onchain ecosystem — and XLayer is the OS powering it all. https://t.co/d09izmHx5I pic.twitter.com/jH16wrK839 — OKX (@okx) August 14, 2025 Launched in 2019, OKB underpins a loyalty and rewards ecosystem that offers holders fee discounts, passive income opportunities, and access to exclusive trading events. The token also fuels OKX’s “Jumpstart” platform for new project launches, and holders can use it for payment across an expanding list of partner merchants. Periodic “buy-back and burn” programs reduce circulating supply, a strategy aimed at long-term value support. However, in the near term, OKB will struggle to maintain its current price of $102.11. That’s because the token is due for a correction. While it could still consolidate at a price significantly higher than it’s $2024 peak of $72.22, there will be a lot of traders taking profits from this overnight run. Its RSI is cooling from a way overscorched 92, which suggests the token is vastly overvalued right now, placing significant sell pressure on holders. Still, it’s likely any subsequent crash will bottom out around $70, where the token enjoys strong support. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Meme-Powered Layer 2 for Bitcoin Among the newest presale projects, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has turned heads as the first Layer 2 network for Bitcoin that blends scalability tech with meme-driven viral marketing and community-building appeal. Its mission is to accelerate BTC transactions, expand use cases, and maintain an approachable, community-led ethos.

The idea? Use government cash to prop up Intel’s struggling chip business and keep advanced manufacturing on U.S. soil. The news hit the markets fast, and traders responded even faster. That one headline alone was enough to shoot Intel’s stock straight up. The deal , if it happens, would send federal money straight into Intel’s new manufacturing sites in Ohio, a project that’s already faced delays and cuts. Trump has been loud about wanting more chips built in the U.S., and Intel remains the only American company still capable of building the most advanced processors in the country. Foreign rivals like TSMC and Samsung have factories on U.S. ground, but they’re not domestic players. Trump wants an American company leading that race, and right now, Intel’s the only one even remotely qualified. Trump slammed the CEO, then invited him to talk Just days before the equity stake talk broke, Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO, was publicly called out by Trump, who demanded he step down. Trump accused him of being “highly conflicted” over investments in Chinese tech firms. He posted it straight to his Truth Social platform. But even after that, Tan still went to the White House for a Monday meeting with Trump, where the equity idea was discussed. That detail was later confirmed by Wall Street Journal . The deal isn’t locked in, and it could still collapse. But the fact that they’re even talking about it, especially after the president’s attacks, says everything. Intel’s team is trying to stay quiet. A spokesperson said, “We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.” When pressed about Tan’s loyalty, the company said he’s “deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests.” That’s as far as they went. Tan took over as CEO earlier this year after Intel completely botched its attempt to grab a piece of the AI chip market. While competitors like Nvidia were blowing past benchmarks, Intel was stuck with old products and an identity crisis. To pivot, it dumped billions into a new foundry business, building chips for others. But the results haven’t shown up. No major customers have signed on. Without those deals, the entire foundry plan looks like a long, expensive gamble. Intel cuts back as Trump expands government control In July, Tan made a tough call: Intel canceled factory plans in Germany and Poland and said it would slow down spending in Ohio. That same Ohio development is now at the center of this new White House plan. The government stake would keep it alive… for now. But investors know Intel’s troubles run deeper. This isn’t just about buildings or machines. Intel lost $2.9 billion in Q2, and it hasn’t figured out how to fix its broken lineup. AI chips? Still behind. Business model? Still clunky. Trump’s not just watching. He’s getting involved. His administration already forced Nvidia and AMD to hand over 15% of their China chip sales just to keep their export licenses. Last week, the Pentagon took a $400 million stake in MP Materials, a rare-earth mining firm. Then came the “golden share” in U.S. Steel, giving Trump control in the Nippon Steel acquisition. Now he’s eyeing Intel as the next big move. Inside Trump’s camp, Intel is seen as the only real shot the U.S. has at challenging Taiwan Semiconductor. Everyone else is playing catch-up or building in foreign territories. Even though Intel is now up 19% for 2025, it’s coming off the worst year in its history, a brutal 60% drop in 2024. Wall Street hasn’t forgotten. Investors want to believe, but they want results more. One bad product cycle, one failed factory deal, and the government stake could turn into dead weight. Trump’s growing control of tech and heavy-handed intervention in private business isn’t slowing down. But Intel? Still trying to prove it can turn this thing around. They put out a final statement saying, “Intel is deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” while refusing to say a word about the equity stake.

The health insurance giant UnitedHealth, which had lost nearly half its value in 2025, suddenly surged 7% on Thursday after the Securities and Exchange Commission published Berkshire’s 13F filing. The buy included more than 5 million shares, placing UnitedHealth as the 18th largest stock holding in Berkshire’s $300 billion portfolio. That puts it right after Amazon and Constellation Brands. The trade happened during the second quarter but was only made public now. While Warren Buffett’s name sits at the top of the company, it’s widely assumed his two deputies, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, pulled the trigger on this one. Warren said back in 2019 that it was one of his managers who took the Amazon position. This feels similar. Berkshire team grabs falling stock while DOJ investigation hits UnitedHealth Before this trade surfaced, UnitedHealth was a disaster. Its stock had been obliterated, down 50% year-to-date, and its reputation had been wrecked. The Department of Justice is currently investigating how the company billed Medicare. The scrutiny comes as part of the federal crackdown on inflated claims across the health sector. In May, CEO Andrew Witty resigned, and the company pulled its earnings guidance for the rest of the year. That move alone triggered panic selling. Then in July, UnitedHealth released a new outlook for 2025 that missed expectations. The result? The stock kept sinking. There was no recovery in sight. The timing of the Berkshire purchase, then, was shocking. But it also fits a clear pattern: buy big names when everyone else is terrified. Warren once called the U.S. healthcare system a “tapeworm” on the economy. Back in 2018, he even teamed up with Jeff Bezos and Jamie Dimon to try and fix it through a joint health venture for employees. That project collapsed. But now, five years later, the team at Berkshire is buying in again; not to fix the system, but to own a piece of it while it’s dirt cheap. Other trades emerge as Apple gets sliced, markets rebound off inflation report UnitedHealth wasn’t the only move in Berkshire’s latest disclosure. The firm also picked up new stakes in Nucor, Lamar Advertising, and Allegion. Nucor, the steel manufacturer, jumped 8% in extended trading after the news. Homebuilders Lennar and DR Horton, both of which Berkshire had previously exited, were also back on the list. Their shares climbed 3% apiece. While all that buying was happening, there was selling too. The firm trimmed its Apple position by 7%. Apple is still the largest stock holding in the portfolio, followed by American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, and Chevron. But the reduction shows that Berkshire is adjusting. It also reduced its exposure to Bank of America, tightening its grip on the financial sector. This flurry of trades came on the same day U.S. indexes had to fight back from a brutal morning. A nasty wholesale inflation report hit just before the open. The Producer Price Index jumped 0.9% in July, smashing the 0.2% forecast. In June, the number had been flat. The spike spooked investors and instantly crushed hopes for a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were both down 0.4% at their lows. The Dow dropped more than 200 points. But dip buyers showed up late in the day, dragging the S&P back up to 6,468.54, a 0.03% gain. That tiny lift was enough for the S&P to notch its third straight record close. The Nasdaq closed at 21,710.67, down 0.01%, while the Dow slipped just 11 points to finish at 44,911.26. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Recently, it bounced back at the mark of $120,000. It is again starting to gain momentum as institutions start to flow in again. Market experts at Matrixport and VanEck predict a cycle-top price of $180K–$220K for BTC by 2026’s first quarter. While Bitcoin offers long-term confidence for investors, it is smaller altcoins that provide the trend of asymmetric upside that early-stage investors crave. A project creating some waves currently is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently impressed hype coin veterans and DeFi traders. Bitcoin Faces Resistance But Eyes $200K Institutional confidence remains strong as Bitcoin ETFs see above $1.2 billion in net inflows over the last 10 days. BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC are leading the way, seeing demand build at levels that most would not have thought possible in Q3 2025. On-chain metrics are also supportive. Since August 1, over 92,000 BTC have left exchanges, suggesting investors are preparing to hold Bitcoin. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) value is retracting from the overbought territory, and many analysts now believe that the BTC value could retest the $130K mark before a move towards $200K in 2026. Small-Cap Altcoin Eyes 55x Upside Despite the 65% potential upside presented by Bitcoin, it may not be enough for retail traders to flip five figures to seven. The select small-cap altcoins are now perking up! Analysts are focusing on low-market capitalization altcoins that have viral community potential and sound fundamentals. It will be ideal if they also possess security audits and tokenomics designed to ensure scarcity. Projects that fit these criteria often deliver 30x–80x in bull runs, especially if they are listed on Tier-1 exchanges when the hype is at its peak. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Forecast Models Predict a 61x Return MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining traction among both institutional players and retail investors. Forecast models predict a 61x return for early backers positioning before the next market expansion, with rising whale accumulation, increasing liquidity inflows, and a strategically timed roadmap ahead of key exchange listings, amplifying market confidence. As anticipation builds and momentum strengthens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being viewed as a high-potential play for those aiming to lock in substantial gains before the broader market rally takes shape. Final Thoughts As Bitcoin continues to grind toward $200,000 with institutional momentum behind it, early retail investors are looking for faster multipliers elsewhere. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE steps in — offering a uniquely timed opportunity at the presale stage. With strong fundamentals, social buzz, and whale accumulation on the rise, this altcoin could be the standout story of the next market expansion.

The stablecoin issuer, which started trading in early June, has seen its stock explode by 349%, and now insiders, including CEO Jeremy Allaire, are unloading fast. The planned sale includes 10 million shares, with 2 million coming from Circle itself and the rest from shareholders like Allaire. This offering was announced on Tuesday, only a day before crypto exchange Bullish skyrocketed 84% in its own public debut. The move is happening way earlier than expected (Circle’s insiders were supposed to be under lock-up until year-end), but JPMorgan, the lead underwriter and the one with the final say, gave the green light. According to Bloomberg, this all unfolded while investor demand for crypto IPOs was peaking. JPMorgan allows early selling amid record gains This new sale is moving quickly. It’s a two-day marketed offering and has already been oversubscribed, with pricing expected by Thursday. Circle hasn’t made any public comment, but the numbers speak for themselves. Even though the stock is now trading at less than half of its $298.99 peak from June 23, it’s still way up from the IPO price. And this $1.4 billion figure is larger than what the company brought in during the IPO itself. David Erickson, a finance professor at Columbia Business School and former co-head of equity capital markets at Barclays, called the move “a cash-in exercise,” pointing to the massive run-up since the IPO. He said that even though the shares are being dumped, they’ll probably sell at a steep discount compared to pre-deal trading levels. But after a 400% gain, the discount hardly matters; everyone selling is still walking away with profits. Sales like this, so soon after an IPO, used to be standard in the dot-com boom era. Erickson said he was surprised more 2025 IPOs hadn’t done the same this year, considering how many stocks have spiked. Circle joins a wave of early post-IPO offerings Circle may be moving fast, but they’re not alone. Just last month, Karman Holdings Inc. had its shareholders offload 21 million shares at over double the IPO price. That came six months after its February debut. In 2024, other firms like Viking Holdings, UL Solutions, and StandardAero also jumped the gun, selling shares before lock-ups expired. But Circle’s speed beats them all. Even with how fast this sell-off came, investors aren’t panicking. The stock has had two full months of heavy, high-volume trading, and the market seems used to the volatility. Jeff Zell, senior analyst at IPO Boutique, said the company’s wild debut and steady performance gave the market time to price things properly. “After such an enthusiastic IPO debut and two months of steady, high-volume trading at elevated levels,” he said, “the market has had time to price the company rationally.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Meanwhile, BTC reserves on Binance have surged significantly, raising concerns about a potential price correction. Bitcoin Reserves Spike On Binance: Time To Worry? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, Binance’s Bitcoin reserves have seen a sharp increase in recent months. The exchange holds the largest BTC reserves, supported by its high liquidity and the largest trading volume in the market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Eyes ATH With Falling Average Executed Order Size And Rising Retail Activity From the end of July until today, Binance-based BTC reserves have reversed a previous downtrend, climbing to 579,000 BTC. Arab Chain shared the following chart illustrating how BTC reserves – after a period of scarcity – have reversed course and now signal a short-term warning. Notably, BTC reserves on Binance had previously declined by approximately 50,000 to 60,000 BTC, a 9% to 10% drop from the 2024 peak to the July 2025 low. Recently, reserves recovered slightly, rising by 25,000 to 30,000 BTC, an increase of 5% to 6%. Despite this recovery, BTC reserves remain well below the peaks of late 2024, indicating that structural scarcity has not yet fully dissipated. Arab Chain highlighted two potential reasons for the recent spike in reserves. First, profit-taking or short-term supply could increase when traders – including whales and market makers – deposit BTC on exchanges. They may do this to sell part of their holdings or to use the digital asset as collateral in derivatives markets. Second, a liquidity boost for BTC can occur when growing demand leads to the replenishment of liquidity pools. Market makers may also rebalance their portfolios to help smooth price spreads. The analyst concluded: In practice, if daily or weekly reserve increases persist alongside high positive funding rates and rising open interest, the likelihood of a short-term correction grows. However, if reserves stabilize or decline quickly, this would suggest renewed scarcity and a continuation of the uptrend. BTC Rally Losing Momentum? BTC pulled back from its recent ATH, trading slightly above $118,000 at the time of writing, signaling a short-term price correction. Some analysts warn that this might indicate the flagship cryptocurrency is losing momentum. Related Reading: Two Forces Can Launch Bitcoin To $1 Million, Says Mike Novogratz In addition to rising exchange reserves, the Binance whale-to-exchange flow metric also points to increased selling pressure. The spike in Binance miner distributions reinforces this signal. That said, some analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Axel Adler notes that BTC’s current market structure makes a severe price correction unlikely. At press time, BTC trades at $118,464, down 0.8% in the past 24 hours.

USDT Most Used Crypto On CoinGate Overall, Bitcoin Second Cryptocurrency payments processor CoinGate has shared new data breaking down digital asset payments preferences around the world. First, below is a table showing how the composition of overall cryptocurrency orders has changed during the last few years. It would appear that Bitcoin was leading in payments on CoinGate back in 2023, with 35.4% of all orders involving it. In 2024, however, the original cryptocurrency lost dominance as its share dropped to just 21%, while Tether ‘s stablecoin grew from 25.5% to 39.7% and became the top choice on the platform. In the first half of 2025, though, USDT shed its gains with its payment share plunging back to 24.8%. That said, the stablecoin still kept the first place, as Bitcoin only recovered to 23.3%. One cryptocurrency that has shown consistent growth through the years is Litecoin . From the table, it’s visible that LTC has tightly held onto its third-place spot, with its share rising from 9.3% in 2023 to 13.6% in 2025. Thus, it seems the blockchain’s cheap and fast transactions are slowly attracting a consistent user base. Now, here is an infographic that shows the top 10 countries in terms of crypto payment usage in 2025: As displayed above, the US is the number one nation in terms of digital asset payments, with 23.28% of the world’s CoinGate orders occurring within it. Germany is second at 6.57% and the UK third at 4.88%. While this chart highlights the overall transaction share for each country, it doesn’t answer one important question: which cryptocurrencies are being used in these countries? According to CoinGate data, the distribution is different between the various regions. Bitcoin is the top choice of American users, finding use in 40% of transfers. “The U.S. is also the global leader in Lightning Network usage — more than half (54%) of all Lightning transactions come from American shoppers,” says CoinGate. Europe is more mixed in usage, with no coin in particular dominating and preferences varying across countries. When it comes to Asia, however, there is indeed a strong preference: stablecoins. USDT occupies 50% of all orders in Hong Kong and 43% in India. In terms of altcoin usage, one country that stands out is the African nation of Nigeria, making up for 8% and 7% of global BNB and Shiba Inu orders, respectively.

The most promising picks blend solid fundamentals, clear growth drivers, and active communities, and several names are emerging as front-runners. BlockDAG is drawing attention with its record-setting presale and advanced Layer-1 design, Dogecoin continues to show staying power with meme-driven appeal, Pepe benefits from whale-fueled momentum, and Shiba Inu is eyeing a possible technical breakout. While each asset has different strengths, they share one important factor: sustained momentum going into 2025. BlockDAG: Strong Presale and Rapid Growth Path BlockDAG is becoming a leading contender for the best crypto to invest in 2025, having already raised over $373 million in its presale while targeting $600M. Now in Batch 29 at $0.0276, it offers what may be one of the last early entry points before final stages lift prices higher. Forecasts suggest BlockDAG (BDAG) could reach $1 during its first major bull run, representing potential triple-digit gains. Its hybrid DAG and Proof-of-Work structure enables fast transactions while maintaining decentralization, positioning it as a serious competitor in the Layer-1 market. With EVM compatibility, Ethereum-based dApps can integrate smoothly, speeding up adoption. The scale of engagement is already significant: 2.5 million X1 app miners, more than 200,000 holders, and 19,000 ASIC miners sold ahead of mainnet launch. Global visibility is increasing through campaigns like the Inter Milan sponsorship. At $0.0276, demand is building quickly, and this presale stage may be one of the most critical opportunities before 2025’s major market shift. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin’s resilience within the meme coin space keeps it positioned as one of the best crypto to invest in 2025. With a 17% gain over the past week and strong liquidity supporting a $34.5 billion market cap, DOGE continues to draw active market participants. That said, with 84% of holders currently in profit, profit-taking remains a possibility. Analysts are divided, with some expecting DOGE’s deeply established community to drive it toward the $1 mark, while others highlight the risk of volatility ahead. For those committed to long-term meme coin exposure, DOGE still holds a central place. Pepe (PEPE) Pepe’s recent rally, marked by a 12.6% single-day surge, reinforces its presence in discussions about the best crypto to invest in 2025 among meme-focused traders. Trading at $0.000012 with close to $900 million in daily volume, PEPE’s momentum is currently supported by whale accumulation and strong market sentiment. While its high volatility leaves room for quick reversals, its active meme culture, sustained momentum, and consistent trading levels suggest it could remain competitive in the near to medium term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu is trading near the $0.000014 resistance level, with market analysts watching for a possible breakout that could yield a 156% rally. A bullish falling wedge pattern also points to potential gains of up to 30% in the shorter term. However, a drop in whale activity underscores the need for a decisive break above resistance. Despite this, its active ecosystem and loyal base continue to support SHIB’s status as a potential best crypto to invest in 2025 for those betting on meme coin durability. Conclusion The best crypto to invest in 2025 will ultimately depend on individual risk profiles and market strategies, yet these four stand out for different reasons. BlockDAG is notable for its early pricing, advanced design, and substantial presale progress, offering a mix of innovation and growth potential. Dogecoin and Pepe highlight the enduring influence of meme coin culture, while Shiba Inu is positioned for possible gains backed by technical setups and community support. In a fast-moving market, acting early on strong projects with defined growth pathways can be decisive. With fundamentals, momentum, and adoption aligning, these four are worth close attention, and for some, active positioning ahead of 2025’s market shifts.

With Bitcoin smashing past $120,000 and Ethereum holding over $4,600, altcoins are loading up for the next price surge. But while mainstream investors are still chasing the headlines, early movers are quietly securing positions in high growth Defi projects with massive ROI potential before the herd arrives. Four standouts Polkadot, VeChain, Litecoin and RTX, the explosive newcomer are creeping into crypto headlines and portfolios with strong fundamentals. Here’s all you need to know. Polkadot Price Predictions: Closing In on $10 Breakout Polkadot’s upgrade to Polkadot 2.0 has supercharged its interoperability edge. The top altcoin has ignited strong bullish momentum after recently breaking out, smashing through short positions and hitting its first target at $4.18. The momentum remains firmly in Polkadot bulls favor with no major selling pressure visible so far. In the future, analysts observe that DOT remains close to the lower end of its mid-range price band and therefore there remains substantial upside potential to the price, up to $5 in the near future and up to $8.20 by 2026 . VeChain: Supply Chain Adoption Pushes Higher VeChain’s bounce from $0.02220 to $0.0263 shows clear accumulation. Its real-world applications in supply chain verification, plus enterprise partnerships in food, pharma and fashion, give VET a powerful edge. Analysts see an 18% rally to $0.030575 this month as whale activity picks up and staking rewards expand. Litecoin: ETF Speculation and Adoption Spike Litecoin is up 6.4% in 24 hours, breaking $125 resistance and eyeing $180. With ETF filings from Grayscale and CoinShares in motion and network activity at record highs, LTC is attracting both institutional and retail investors. If momentum holds, a surge into the $200–$220 range isn’t off the table. Remittix: The Sleeper High Growth Crypto Set to Leave Top Altcoins Behind Forget chasing yesterday’s winners, Remittix is the next 100x crypto play that whales are loading up on now. Priced at just $0.0944 with over $19.3M already raised, RTX is weeks away from its September 15th beta wallet launch and once that drops, everything changes. Remittix isn’t hype; it’s infrastructure. It enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries with 40+ supported tokens, real-time FX rates and institutional-grade security. And with whales already shifting millions from Solana and Ethereum into RTX, the early-stage window is about to slam shut. Why you need RTX before the listing: First-mover advantage in the $19T global payments market Beta wallet launch in weeks Institutional security via CertiK audit Business-ready API for instant adoption Deflationary model = rising scarcity Remittix’s $20M presale milestone will trigger the first major exchange listing announcement and end the 40% bonus promotion. The $250,000 giveaway is the icing on the cake, every purchase now gets you entries. When that listing drops, the price will reprice instantly as liquidity floods in.

50101741,https://cryptonews.com/?p=408841,1755214200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/50101741.jpeg,"Bitcoin Mining Not Causing Any Energy Issues, Says Paraguay Power Provider",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-mining-paraguay-fears-allayed-power-provider/,"Bitcoin mining operators are putting less of a strain on Paraguay’s power grid than engineers initially feared, the nation’s power provider says. Per the Spanish-language news outlet Criptonoticias , the comments came from Félix Sosa, the President of the National Electricity Administration (ANDE). Speaking at a recent blockchain technology -related conference, the power chief said that crypto mining in Paraguay does not affect the population’s electricity supply. The Itaipú Dam. (Source: Wutzofant [CC BY-SA 3.0]) Bitcoin Mining: Paraguay Expansion Planned Sosa explained that BTC and crypto miners’ operations in Paraguay require just over 700 MW of energy. But the ANDE chief said that miners are required to operate in designated areas of the country. This ensures they do not put strains on areas that might otherwise experience power shortages. Sosa said that projected crypto mining-related electricity consumption for 2025 would be equivalent to the output of just one and a half turbines of the Itaipú Dam. Paraguay’s central bank held its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6% a week after it raised its outlook for inflation and economic growth https://t.co/V31pTte10p — Bloomberg (@business) July 22, 2025 Itaipú: Playing a Key Role The dam is one of the largest hydroelectric power plants in the world, and houses 20 turbines. However, the most powerful of these turbines (which operate at 60 Hz), produce power for Brazil. The Itaipú Dam straddles the river that separates the two Latin American nations. Despite the fact that Briazil takes the lion’s share of the dam’s energy output, the remaining 10 50 Hz turbines produce surplus power for Paraguay. The Paraná River, the waterway that separates Paraguay and Brazil. (Source: Deni Williams [CC BY 2.0]) In recent years, ANDE has agreed to let Bitcoin miners use much of this power, claiming that it is “abundant, renewable, and affordable energy.” The provider also says that as well as offering clean power, it also offers miners electricity at highly competitive rates. Paraguayan law stipulates that miners must pay differentiated rates based on their required electrical voltage level. The lowest rates apply for the sub-23 kV (medium voltage) group. The next level is sub-66 kV (high voltage), with users over 220 kV (very high voltage) making up the final category. Sosa said: “Our priority is to ensure responsible energy use, consistent with the capacity of the Paraguayan system.” While miners are now using just over 700 MW, ANDE plans to expand this to a capacity of 1,000 MW by the end of 2025.

The planned capacity expansion, the firm said, is set to generate revenues of approximately $240 million for ANDE. But Criptonoticias quoted an engineer named Axel Benítez as pouring scorn on Sosa’s claims. Benítez said that, per 2024 data, the actual consumption billed to crypto mining companies was only 255.5 MW. The engineer said: “If they are planning to go from 700 to 1,000 MW by the end 2025 and ANDE is set to collect $240 million, a simple math calculation results in a rate of $80 per megawatt hour. That is almost double the current rate for [crypto miners]. So, that means that either a rate hike is coming, or ANDE does not know how to use a calculator.” Communities Unhappy With Miners The media outlet added that some Paraguayans have also expressed their displeasure at the rise of Bitcoin mining in the nation. It reported that residents of the Santa Lucía District in Villarrica complain of “constant noise from fans and mining equipment.” The noise, they claim, is affecting families’ mental health, sleep patterns, and their quality of life. The problem is particularly acute for children with special needs, residents said. While ANDE has taken a welcoming stance to legal crypto miners, it has also been waging a war against illegal operators. Last year, the provider conceded that it loses about one third of all the energy it produces, with illegal miners responsible for at least some of these losses. It has also seized over 10,000 Bitcoin mining rigs from operators. Last year, a group of 14 senators petitioned the government to temporarily ban crypto mining in the country .

With both AVAX and BNB riding strong technical and fundamental momentum, analysts say this coordinated accumulation could signal an explosive catalyst once the presale concludes. BNB Poised for Breakout While Expanding Its RWA Footprint BNB has maintained a powerful upward trend, currently trading near $855 after a 5.5% surge in the latest session. Technical charts show a clear resistance at $919 — a breakout here could open the door to $1,036 and ultimately the ambitious $1,225 target, pushing its market capitalization close to $150 billion. The relative strength index (RSI) at 64 suggests room for further gains before overbought conditions emerge. Fundamentals remain equally bullish. BNB Chain’s rapid 1,500% monthly growth in the tokenized asset market has lifted its total value to $42.9 million, attracting more institutional attention. With open interest in BNB futures climbing to $1.18 billion and ongoing Binance token burns supporting scarcity, the network’s dominance in the exchange token sector (81% market share) remains unmatched. The combination of technical strength, expanding RWA presence, and limited exchange inflows creates a favorable environment for sustained accumulation — particularly from whales looking to capitalize on upcoming catalysts like MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Tier-1 listing. AVAX Targets Major Rally With Web3 Gaming Push Avalanche (AVAX) is on the verge of a significant technical breakout, testing the key $26 resistance that could propel it toward $74–$110 based on wave count analysis. The daily chart reveals an extremely bullish 1-2/1-2 wave formation — a pattern that recently preceded sharp gains in PENDLE and LINK. A close above $26 would put AVAX above its channel midline, triggering bullish momentum on both the RSI and MACD. Beyond the charts, Avalanche’s fundamentals are heating up. The $50 million accelerator program launched with Helika aims to onboard high-quality gaming projects, increasing on-chain activity and user engagement. The Octane upgrade, which drove a 40% rise in total value locked, further enhances AVAX’s network capabilities. With gaming narratives historically acting as powerful bull market catalysts, AVAX’s combined technical setup and fundamental growth are drawing in strategic whale buyers — many of whom are allocating fresh liquidity into MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale before its potential Tier-1 launch. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Presale Drawing AVAX & BNB Whales MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a prime accumulation target for AVAX and BNB holders seeking high-upside plays ahead of a Tier-1 exchange listing. Its ongoing presale has already attracted substantial whale participation, driven by expectations of strong post-listing momentum. Market chatter suggests that large addresses are quietly positioning now, anticipating a liquidity surge once the presale transitions into open trading. With Tier-1 listing rumors gaining credibility, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as one of the most closely watched presale opportunities in the current market cycle. Bottom Line Both AVAX and BNB are in strong bullish phases, and their whale holders appear to be converging on the same high-conviction play: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale. If the Tier-1 exchange debut materializes, early accumulators could be perfectly positioned for outsized gains. You can learn more about MAGACOIN FINANCE via the official website.

50101710,https://timestabloid.com/?p=78438,1755214219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Projected Timeline for $7 XRP,https://timestabloid.com/projected-timeline-for-7-xrp/,"Market analysts and industry observers have put forward different expectations for when XRP might climb to the $7 price point, a level viewed as a major milestone for the asset. Although the token remains within the $3 range, trading at approximately $3.07 at the time of writing, it has already delivered a year-to-date gain of about 59%. Many market commentators suggest that XRP’s current trading behavior reflects a period of consolidation aimed at establishing strong support before attempting a significant rally. Reaching $7 from current levels would require an increase of just over 110%. Estimates for when this could occur vary widely, with predictions ranging from the coming months to several years ahead. Analyst and Institutional Forecasts Some of the more optimistic short-term projections came earlier in the year. In July, commentator Zach Rector suggested XRP could trade between $7.01 and $15.14 over the mid to long term, with a potential breakout period between August 23 and September 7, 2025. Meanwhile, a report from digital asset manager Bitwise presented a longer-term outlook. In its bullish scenario, Bitwise forecast that XRP could reach $6.25 by 2027, before advancing toward $7.91 in 2028. Market analyst Crypto Bitlord took a more immediate stance earlier this month. Following XRP’s recovery from recent price dips, he suggested that the rebound could be the start of an advance toward the $7 mark within the current year. On the other hand, the crypto trading platform Changelly offered a more conservative timeline. Its analysis indicates that XRP might only approach $7 in early 2027, with a potential peak around $7.04 in March of that year. Researchers at Telegaon expect faster progress than Changelly’s projections. Their forecast anticipates XRP reaching $7 as early as 2026, with the average price for that year estimated at $7.53. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Google Gemini’s Three-Phase Projection In a separate analysis, Google’s Gemini AI outlined a hypothetical path for XRP to hit $7 during the current bullish cycle. Its scenario is divided into three stages. Phase One (Late August to Early September 2025): A potential regulatory win or major corporate partnership could drive prices toward $4.50. This would likely attract a wave of new retail investors, pushing trading activity higher. Phase Two (September to October 2025): XRP could move between $4.50 and $5.50, as profit-taking occurs, but overall market sentiment remains positive. Phase Three (November to December 2025): A combination of favorable macroeconomic conditions, a possible altcoin market surge, and heightened institutional activity could send prices from $5.50 to $7 or beyond in a short time frame. Across forecasts, the $7 level is widely recognized as a significant target for XRP, though opinions differ greatly on when it will be achieved. Some see it as a near-term possibility, while others expect it to take several years. Much will depend on broader market trends, regulatory developments, and the strength of investor demand in the coming cycles.

Shiba Inu is surfing the wave, while MAGACOIN FINANCE is also getting its fair share of attention. The two coins have dedicated communities and an increasing number of applications. However, when the next bull run hits, which one will take the crown? Shiba Inu Price Action Shows Strength but Faces Mixed Signals Shiba Inu has been on an ascending trend and has gained almost 4% in the past 24 hours. In the last week, it has increased by approximately 15%. The rally has been supported by a bullish symmetrical triangle pattern breakout, which is an indicator of great technical momentum. A sign that the coin is doing well is the decline in the exchange reserves. SHIB balances on exchanges decreased to 121.31 trillion on August 11 compared to 122.54 trillion on July 31. Lower reserves are usually associated with lower sell pressure, and they allow bulls more space to move the price up. Interestingly, SHIB surged right after the August 11 supply dip. This is similar to what happened on July 24 and August 6. Nevertheless, exchange supply has increased modestly since the recent low. Another increase in supply may restrict upward momentum. At the time of writing, the breakout has held firm, and SHIB is trading above $0.00001368. A break above $0.00001438 may reinforce the rally. Nonetheless, mixed on-chain indicators suggest the trend of the token is not fully evident. MAGACOIN FINANCE Positioned as a Top Contender MAGACOIN FINANCE has been making headlines as a presale with strong utility. Many see it as more than just another meme token. Industry watchers even say MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the top memecoin with real-world use in the next bull run. It is popular due to a combination of practical elements and a developing community. They plan to bridge the gap between meme culture and practical blockchain applications. This makes it stand out in the market. Meanwhile, PEPE and DOGE holders are locking in profits and looking for the next big move. Many of them are shifting capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE before the market rotation wave. Although SHIB has demonstrated resilience, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the new point of entry before the explosive growth may occur. Its combination makes it difficult to overlook among early investors eyeing 2025. Which Could Dominate the Next Bull Run? Shiba Inu possesses a massive following and has been resilient. The fact that it has recently broken out is a bullish indicator. However, it remains subject to unpredictability caused by fluctuating exchange reserves. MAGACOIN FINANCE is less established but has a high intensity of utility and adoption. It is rapidly grabbing the attention of investors. Both might do well in the next bull market. SHIB has history in its favor, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has momentum going forward. A balanced approach could work best for those pursuing the upside.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/galaxy-digital-ceo-praises-xrp-community-heres-why/,"Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has once again highlighted the resilience of the XRP community, stating that their dedication is on par with that of Bitcoin advocates. In a recent interview with Natalie Brunnell on Coin Stories, he described XRP supporters as one of the most committed groups in the cryptocurrency space. During the discussion, Novogratz questioned why XRP has remained relevant for so long. Brunnell attributed its longevity to effective marketing and strong financial resources. When he asked where those resources originated, she pointed to token sales and an initial coin offering (ICO). While Ripple never conducted an ICO, the company has funded operations by selling portions of the XRP it received as a gift early in the token’s history. Stories and lessons from a decade in crypto with Mike @Novogratz . We talk about $GLXY , the 80,000 bitcoin transaction, whether Mike has any investing regrets, maxis and altcoin communities, Bitcoin's roadmap to $1 million and much more. Timecodes: 00:00 Meet Mike Novogratz:… pic.twitter.com/4HrOi1juE5 — Natalie Brunell (@natbrunell) August 12, 2025 Community Strength as a Driving Force Novogratz emphasized that the XRP community, often referred to as the XRP Army , demonstrates a level of loyalty that matches Bitcoin’s strongest supporters. This view is consistent with his earlier remarks, suggesting that XRP’s survival is largely due to the dedication of its holders. He characterized the cryptocurrency sector as highly “tribal,” noting that communities are often built around shared beliefs and identity. Using himself as an example, Novogratz mentioned having tattoos of both Bitcoin and Terra Luna, reflecting his connections to different crypto communities. Novogratz also shared that his early perspective centered on Bitcoin as the sole form of “digital gold,” while he believed other cryptocurrencies needed tangible use cases to succeed. Over time, his outlook changed, recognizing that the broader appeal of crypto is rooted in declining trust in traditional systems, a sentiment that accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis and the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper. Recognition of Key Figures in the XRP Ecosystem The Galaxy Digital CEO credited Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse with fostering a strong and engaged community, though Garlinghouse himself has admitted uncertainty about the origins of the XRP Army. Novogratz also commended attorney John Deaton, who, despite no prior association with Ripple, became a vocal advocate for XRP holders during the SEC lawsuit, providing consistent legal updates and public commentary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Role of Community in Crypto’s Longevity According to Novogratz, the crypto market has introduced a sense of community into investing that traditional equities rarely replicate. He compared the loyalty of XRP holders to that seen among Tesla and Palantir supporters, noting that this level of engagement is absent in major companies like Oracle despite their financial success. He believes that such loyalty is fueled by public distrust in legacy financial systems and cannot be artificially created by corporate efforts alone. While not every cryptocurrency will endure over the long term, Novogratz acknowledged that XRP’s position among the top digital assets is a testament to the commitment of its supporters, who invest both financially and emotionally in the asset. These comments mark a significant change from Novogratz’s earlier stance . Two years ago, he openly doubted XRP’s staying power and raised concerns about Ripple’s large holdings of the token. Since then, he has repeatedly admitted that his skepticism was misplaced, crediting the XRP Army for proving him wrong. Following XRP’s rally after Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory, he reiterated that the token’s community has been the main reason for its sustained relevance over more than a decade. Novogratz’s remarks reinforce the importance of community in shaping the longevity and relevance of digital assets. For XRP, its survival and growth over the years highlight how committed supporters can be a decisive factor in a cryptocurrency’s enduring presence in a competitive market.

The move pushed the overall crypto market cap to a record $4.18 trillion. Related Reading: Ripple CTO Comments On Rising XRP Ledger Competition From Fintechs The rally followed a decisive breakout above key technical levels, including the 7-day SMA at $118,892 and the 200-day EMA at $101,566. The MACD histogram widened to its most bullish reading since July 2025, while the RSI14 at 68.5 suggests there’s still room before hitting overbought conditions. Fibonacci projections now place BTC’s next major resistance near $126,870. However, after briefly surpassing $124K, Bitcoin retraced to around $121,800, prompting traders to ask whether this is simply consolidation before the next surge. Institutional Demand and Policy Support Driving Momentum Corporate and institutional accumulation remains a major driver. SpaceX continues to hold 8,285 BTC worth over $1 billion, while Thumzup Media recently announced a $50 million crypto treasury. These moves mirror Metaplanet’s purchase of 2,205 BTC earlier this week. Political tailwinds are also in play. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has rolled back banking restrictions on crypto firms and signed legislation opening retirement accounts to digital asset investments. The GENIUS Act, introducing the country’s first federal stablecoin framework, has further boosted market confidence. ETF inflows have accelerated, with U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs pulling in over $1 billion in net weekly inflows. Total ETF holdings now stand at $154 billion, signaling deep institutional interest. BTC's price records some losses after a major spike on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Bitcoin (BTC) Pundits Eye $150K If Momentum Holds Despite a notable July sell-off by long-term holders, the largest since 2021, market analysts see the pullback as a healthy pause. Vikram Subburaj, CEO of Giottus Crypto Platform, views $120K as a new “sturdy floor” and $126K as the breakout point that could open the path toward $150,000. “With strong macro tailwinds, robust ETF demand, and rising corporate adoption, every dip may be viewed as a buying opportunity rather than a reversal signal,” noted Himanshu Maradiya, Chairman of CIFDAQ.

50103563,557011,1755216053,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/50103563.jpeg,"BNB Surges on $2B Investment: Analysts Debate If $1,000 Target Is Within Reach",https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-2b-in-investment-analysts-debate-1000-target/,"Binance Coin (BNB) has hit fresh record territory after Abu Dhabi-based MGX announced a historic $2 billion investment in Binance on August 12. The deal, entirely funded in stablecoins, marks the largest single investment ever made in a cryptocurrency company. Within 48 hours of the news, BNB surged more than 15%, breaking through key resistance levels and reaching a new all-time high of $864. The rally comes amid strong corporate demand for major altcoins, as Ethereum and BNB both approach record valuations alongside Bitcoin’s latest all-time high. Technical Outlook: Bullish but Overbought Despite the excitement, technical indicators suggest caution in the short term. BNB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits above 70, placing it firmly in overbought territory and hinting at the potential for a short-term pullback. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains bullish, with the MACD line well above the signal line and green histogram bars signaling ongoing momentum. Key resistance lies at $861.10, a level that, if broken convincingly, could trigger momentum buying toward the psychological $900 mark and possibly the $950–$1,000 range within the next 30 days. Immediate support is found near $820–$830, with stronger levels at $730.01 and $639.16. Volume remains strong, with over $345 million traded in the past 24 hours, suggesting there is still liquidity to sustain larger moves. Moving averages from the 7-day ($819.47) to the 200-day ($652.67) all trend upward, confirming the strength of the broader uptrend. BNB Price Target: $1,000 Within Reach or Due for a Cooldown? Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. Bullish scenarios see BNB pushing toward $950–$1,000 within a month, provided it holds above $850 and breaks through the $861 resistance. A mild pullback to cool the RSI could create an attractive entry point before the next leg higher. However, a failure to maintain above $850 could open the door to a 13% drop toward $730. A deeper correction to $639 remains a low-probability scenario given current fundamentals but cannot be ruled out if the broader market turns bearish. For now, the development of record-breaking investment news, strong technical momentum, and strong market sentiment keeps the $1,000 milestone firmly on the radar, but traders should expect volatility on the way up.

Over the past three days, blockchain trackers have caught billions of dollars quietly flowing into altcoins. Bitcoin is still hovering just below record highs, but the smart money has already begun to move on. This is the same slow build we’ve seen before every major altseason – the quiet phase when whales slip in early, stack their positions , and wait. And buried among the big-name plays they’re loading up on, one lesser-known project keeps showing up in their ledgers: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Storm anticipation Ahead of the storm Look at the statistics and the scene is clear. Aug 7-10, whales purchased $3.8 billion worth of XRP cooling the price of the token by moving it up to $3.3. That was no loosely-knit purchase, that was conviction. This type of accumulation puts a token in range of fresh highs and already there are analysts murmuring over $34 targets in this cycle . Ethereum has been showing off too, jumping more than 40 percent in a single month to bust through $4,500 in a move not seen since early in 2018. Other inflows are experiencing heavy inflows into ETFS with giants such as BitMine Immersion Technologies promising to put another $20 billion worth of ETH in their coffers. When whales make moves like this, they’re not chasing – they’re positioning. Now this is where it starts to become interesting. However, MAGACOIN FINANCE is another name quietly being sneaked into the carts of some whales despite the dominance of ETH and XRP when it comes to the headlines. The fun, instantly identifiable branding remains, too easy to share with friends that it can go viral in group chats but with actual, lasting utility that ensures it does not go out of fashion days after it hits the stores. Such combination is unusual, and anyone who saw PEPE or BONK before they became famous will be familiar with the trend. In recent weeks, whale wallets have been adding to their positions in slow, deliberate waves – not chasing spikes, but building patiently . It’s the exact rhythm you see before a project flips from under-the-radar to can’t-ignore-it. Insiders call this MAGACOIN FINANCE’s final allocation phase, and that phrase alone has traders paying attention . Supply is tightening, buzz is growing, and if history is any guide, the quiet part won’t last long. Reading the bigger picture Take a step back, and you could observe the whole set up. Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins have space to breath and money finally begins to move in a way that suggests that the intelligent money is getting positioned to take the next leg higher.It is not about riding out Ethereum to $5K, or watching XRP scaling a lifetime peak, it is about identifying the moves that will multiply long before the rest of the market soundly piles in. That is why MAGACOIN FINANCE has already entered into the same discussion with the majors. Nor is it the business motive in contesting with them on a hand-to-hand basis; but the idea is to provide an alternative upside. Whales do not play the guessing game either, by the time they begin to circle a project they have crunched the numbers and are liking what they see. Conclusion We’ve seen this play out before. One week the market is calm, the next it’s running, and those who waited for the “perfect time” are left chasing green candles . Whales move early because they know that once the breakout is obvious, the best entry points are gone. With MAGACOIN FINANCE’s final allocation phase now approaching, the entry window is narrowing by the day. The whales are already in motion – the question is whether you’ll be in the water with them when Altseason 2025 comes rushing in.

In a strategic move that has caught the attention of the entire crypto community, Nakamoto, a prominent Bitcoin (BTC) holding company, has officially merged with KindlyMD, a leading healthcare data firm. This exciting collaboration aims to bolster their collective Bitcoin holdings , marking a unique cross-industry convergence. What Does the Nakamoto KindlyMD Merger Mean for Bitcoin Holdings? This isn’t just another corporate announcement; it’s a powerful statement about the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. Nakamoto, co-founded by BTC Inc.’s David Bailey, has been a dedicated player in the Bitcoin space, focused purely on accumulating and securing BTC reserves. KindlyMD, on the other hand, operates within the healthcare data sector, making their pivot towards significant Bitcoin accumulation particularly noteworthy. The newly combined entity will operate under the KindlyMD name, as reported by The Block. This means a healthcare data firm now officially has a direct mandate to build substantial Bitcoin holdings , leveraging the expertise of Nakamoto’s team. This innovative approach could set a precedent for other companies looking to diversify their treasury reserves with digital assets. Why This Strategic Crypto Investment Matters The strategic intent behind the Nakamoto KindlyMD merger is clear: to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. This move highlights a growing trend where non-traditional finance companies are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and an inflation hedge. For the crypto market, this signifies a deeper integration of digital assets into diverse corporate strategies. Think about the implications: a healthcare data firm, typically focused on patient information and analytics, is now actively pursuing a robust crypto investment strategy. This isn’t just about a company buying some Bitcoin; it’s about a fundamental shift in how corporations view and utilize their capital. It showcases confidence in Bitcoin’s future and its role beyond speculative trading. The Financial Power Behind Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation To fuel their ambitious goal of increasing Bitcoin holdings , KindlyMD has already made significant financial strides. The company successfully raised an impressive $540 million through a private placement of public equity. This substantial capital infusion provides a strong foundation for their acquisition strategy. Furthermore, KindlyMD plans to complete a $200 million convertible note offering in the near future. This additional funding will further empower their efforts in Bitcoin accumulation , demonstrating a clear, well-funded roadmap for their digital asset strategy. Such large-scale financial maneuvers underline the seriousness of this venture and its potential impact on the overall market. Exploring the Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The Nakamoto KindlyMD merger represents more than just a single company’s strategy; it reflects a broader trend towards institutional Bitcoin adoption. As more companies witness successful integration of Bitcoin into corporate treasuries, we may see a ripple effect across various industries. Key aspects of this evolving landscape include: Diversification: Companies are seeking alternative assets to traditional cash reserves, especially in volatile economic climates. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, appealing to long-term treasury management. Innovation: Forward-thinking companies are embracing digital assets as part of their innovative growth strategies. Market Maturation: The increasing involvement of established firms lends credibility and stability to the cryptocurrency market. This merger serves as a powerful example of how diversified sectors are beginning to embrace Bitcoin, moving beyond initial skepticism to strategic integration. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing role in the global financial ecosystem. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin Holdings The combination of Nakamoto’s expertise in Bitcoin management and KindlyMD’s substantial financial backing and innovative approach creates a formidable entity poised for significant Bitcoin accumulation . This strategic alliance is a clear indicator of Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a treasury asset for companies across different sectors.

On August 15, nearly $4.7 billion worth of BTC options are set to mature, a moment that often draws considerable attention from traders and investors alike. This isn’t just about Bitcoin; a substantial $1.3 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options will also reach their expiry on the same day. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone involved in the digital asset space, especially concerning the upcoming BTC options August 15 event. Understanding Bitcoin Options Expiration What exactly happens when Bitcoin options expire ? Options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price before a certain date. When these contracts reach their expiration date, they either get exercised, closed, or become worthless. The sheer volume of this upcoming Bitcoin options expiration means it could potentially influence market dynamics. It’s a key date for many participants looking at market movements. Decoding the “Max Pain Price” A term often discussed around options expiry is the “max pain price.” This is the price point where the largest number of options contracts would expire worthless, causing maximum financial loss for the majority of options holders. For the upcoming Bitcoin options expiration , the max pain price is currently noted at $117,000. Similarly, for Ethereum options, the max pain price stands at $4,000. While not a definitive price prediction, it offers a fascinating insight into market positioning and where the market might gravitate as the expiry approaches. The Scale of Crypto Options Expiry on August 15 The figures involved in this particular crypto options expiry are substantial. Deribit data indicates that nearly $4.7 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) options will expire at 08:00 UTC on August 15 . This is a significant amount, representing a large portion of the open interest in the Bitcoin options market. Alongside this, approximately $1.3 billion in Ethereum (ETH) options will also mature. The put/call ratio, which indicates the sentiment of traders (more puts suggest bearish sentiment, more calls suggest bullish), is 0.90 for BTC and 1.02 for ETH. These ratios offer a snapshot of current market sentiment leading into the expiry of these massive Ethereum options expiration contracts. Potential Market Impact and What to Watch While a large options expiration event can create volatility, it doesn’t automatically guarantee a massive price swing. Sometimes, the market has already “priced in” the expiry. However, the unwinding of these contracts can lead to increased trading volume and short-term price movements as positions are closed or exercised. Here’s what market participants often observe: Increased Volatility: Prices might become more erratic leading up to and immediately after the expiry. Volume Spikes: Trading volume often surges as traders adjust their positions. Max Pain Price Gravitation: Some analysts believe the price tends to gravitate towards the max pain price as expiry approaches, though this is not a universal rule. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the period around a major Bitcoin options expiration . Navigating Your Strategy Around Options Expiry For traders and investors, being aware of such large crypto options expiry events is important. It’s not about predicting the exact price movement, but rather understanding the potential for increased market activity. Consider these actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on market news and analytics platforms for real-time data. Risk Management: Ensure your positions are well-managed, especially if you hold options contracts yourself. Observe Volume: High volume can indicate strong conviction in a price direction or simply a lot of position closing. Avoid Over-Leverage: Given potential volatility, excessive leverage can lead to quick liquidations. This August 15 expiry, with its substantial Bitcoin options and Ethereum options expiration components, serves as a crucial reminder of market mechanics. The impending Bitcoin options expiration , coupled with the significant Ethereum options expiration on August 15 , represents a pivotal moment in the crypto calendar. While the max pain price offers an interesting data point, the true impact will unfold as these billions in contracts settle. Market participants should remain vigilant, focusing on sound risk management and informed decision-making during this period of heightened activity around the crypto options expiry . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin option? A Bitcoin option is a financial derivative contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) Bitcoin at a predetermined price (strike price) on or before a specific date (expiration date). What does “max pain price” mean for options? The “max pain price” is the strike price at which the largest number of open options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, causing the maximum financial loss for options holders. It’s a point of interest for analysts, as some believe the underlying asset’s price may gravitate towards it near expiry. How significant is the August 15 Bitcoin options expiration? The August 15 Bitcoin options expiration is highly significant due to its massive scale, involving nearly $4.7 billion worth of BTC options. Such large expirations can lead to increased market volatility and trading volume as positions are closed or exercised. Will the market crash after options expire? Not necessarily. While options expirations can cause short-term volatility and price movements, they do not automatically lead to a market crash. The market often anticipates and prices in these events. However, it’s wise to be prepared for potential fluctuations. How can traders prepare for options expiry? Traders can prepare by staying informed about market data, practicing sound risk management, avoiding over-leverage, and observing trading volume. Understanding the dynamics of the max pain price and put/call ratios can also provide valuable insights. Did you find this article helpful in understanding the upcoming Bitcoin options expiration ?

Nasdaq-listed Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions (BTCS) has made headlines by revealing its substantial BTCS Ethereum holdings , totaling an impressive 70,140 ETH. This amounts to a staggering $320 million, as reported in their Q2 earnings by The Block. This bold move highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies embracing digital assets as strategic reserves, signaling a profound shift in corporate finance. What Are BTCS Ethereum Holdings All About? BTCS, a company known for its blockchain infrastructure and digital asset operations, has officially adopted Ethereum (ETH) as a strategic reserve asset. This means they are not just holding ETH speculatively but as a core part of their treasury management strategy. The sheer volume of their BTCS Ethereum holdings —70,140 ETH—positions them as a notable corporate holder in the cryptocurrency space. This decision reflects a forward-thinking approach, recognizing Ethereum’s potential beyond its current market value. By integrating ETH into their balance sheet, BTCS is demonstrating confidence in the long-term viability and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. This move could inspire other companies to consider similar strategies for their own corporate ETH reserves . Why Adopt Ethereum as a Strategic Asset? Many traditional companies are now exploring cryptocurrencies, but why specifically Ethereum as an Ethereum strategic asset ? Ethereum’s robust network supports a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi). Its utility and ongoing development make it a compelling choice for a long-term holding. Utility and Innovation: Ethereum is more than just a digital currency; it’s a foundational platform for innovation across various sectors. Network Effect: Its widespread adoption and massive developer community provide strong network effects, enhancing its value. Deflationary Mechanism: Recent upgrades, like EIP-1559, have introduced burning mechanisms, potentially making ETH a deflationary asset over time. For Nasdaq-listed BTCS , holding Ethereum aligns seamlessly with their core business, which is deeply rooted in blockchain technology. This strategic alignment can offer unique advantages and potentially unlock new revenue streams for the company. Implications of Corporate ETH Reserves on the Market When a Nasdaq-listed BTCS company makes such a significant cryptocurrency investment , it sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It legitimizes digital assets further and could pave the way for more institutional adoption. The ripple effect can be substantial: Increased Legitimacy: Large corporate holdings lend undeniable credibility to the entire digital asset class. Price Stability: As more companies hold crypto as reserves, it can reduce volatility and provide a more stable foundation for the market. New Investment Avenues: It opens doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to crypto through publicly traded companies. The trend of corporate ETH reserves is gaining momentum, following in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy with Bitcoin. This suggests a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly viewed as viable treasury alternatives for forward-thinking corporations. What Are the Challenges of Cryptocurrency Investment for Corporations? While the prospects are exciting, corporate cryptocurrency investment , particularly in an Ethereum strategic asset , comes with its own set of challenges. Companies must carefully navigate: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets can be complex and requires constant monitoring. Volatility: Despite growing maturity, cryptocurrencies can still experience significant price swings, which requires robust risk management. Security Risks: Protecting large digital asset holdings from cyber threats requires state-of-the-art security protocols and vigilance. Accounting Treatment: How to properly account for and report these assets on financial statements is a new frontier for many traditional finance departments. BTCS, as a Nasdaq-listed BTCS entity, likely has robust frameworks in place to manage these risks, setting a precedent for others considering similar ventures. Their transparent reporting of BTCS Ethereum holdings provides valuable insight. The substantial BTCS Ethereum holdings represent more than just a balance sheet entry; they signify a bold vote of confidence in the future of decentralized finance and blockchain technology. As more corporations follow suit, we may witness a transformative shift in how traditional finance interacts with the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic move by Nasdaq-listed BTCS underscores the growing importance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate and valuable assets for corporate treasuries. It’s an exciting time to watch the convergence of traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are BTCS Ethereum holdings? BTCS Ethereum holdings refer to the significant amount of Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency held by Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions (BTCS), a Nasdaq-listed company, as a strategic reserve asset. In their Q2 earnings, they reported holding 70,140 ETH, valued at $320 million. Why did BTCS adopt Ethereum as a strategic asset? BTCS adopted Ethereum as an Ethereum strategic asset due to its robust network, utility in decentralized applications (dApps) and DeFi, strong network effect, and potential deflationary mechanisms. This aligns with BTCS’s core business in blockchain technology. How do corporate ETH reserves impact the crypto market? Corporate ETH reserves , like those held by Nasdaq-listed BTCS , increase the legitimacy of digital assets, potentially contribute to price stability by reducing circulating supply, and open new avenues for traditional investors to gain crypto exposure through public companies. What are the risks associated with corporate cryptocurrency investment? Key risks for corporate cryptocurrency investment include regulatory uncertainty, price volatility, security threats, and complex accounting treatment. Companies must implement strong risk management strategies to mitigate these challenges. Is BTCS the only Nasdaq-listed company holding significant crypto?

Dogecoin whales are moving fast, but their latest target is not another meme coin. Instead, they are looking at MAGACOIN FINANCE. The token has started getting attention for its low price and strong presale momentum. Many retail investors are now watching closely. They want to see if this move will trigger a wave of new demand. Bitcoin remains steady, which gives traders some breathing room. Ethereum is holding its ground too, keeping market sentiment positive. When big players move funds during a calm phase, smaller investors tend to follow. That is exactly what is happening with DOGE whales right now. Their activity is pulling fresh eyes toward a token that most had not heard of until this month. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Gains Big Whale Support DOGE whales are quietly securing MAGACOIN FINANCE at $0.004 in advance of its first major exchange approvals. This early buying activity has sparked more curiosity in the market. Investors like the idea of entering before a possible listing bump. The project has been marketed as a mix of strong utility and early growth potential. Analysts have noted that such a low entry price gives room for significant upside. This is why experienced players are getting in before the public rush. It feels like a calculated move rather than blind speculation. The token’s appeal comes from more than just hype. The team behind MAGACOIN FINANCE has been actively promoting its use cases. They aim to give the project real adoption beyond the launch period. This has helped build confidence among both whales and small investors. In the past, early whale interest has often been a signal for potential growth. However, it does not guarantee returns, so smaller buyers still need to weigh risks. Dogecoin whales tend to act with strategic timing. They usually move into assets that are close to a major catalyst. A first exchange listing is exactly that kind of event. It can boost visibility, attract more volume, and push the price upward. That is why their MAGACOIN FINANCE accumulation is attracting headlines. Conclusion MAGACOIN FINANCE is clearly on the radar of big players, and that alone is turning heads. Whale activity often hints at market shifts, but timing matters. For now, $0.004 feels like a rare entry point before the bigger stage. Whether you are a whale or a small trader, this is one token worth keeping on your watchlist. The next move could belong to MAGACOIN FINANCE.

While the momentum has been strong, Severino emphasizes that traders should now prioritize risk management and establish clear exit plans. XRP’s Current Price Action and Technical Outlook XRP has recently attempted to break into a price discovery phase after moving out of a long-standing symmetrical triangle that had constrained its growth since 2018. The cryptocurrency reached $3.66 in July, marking a seven-year high, before experiencing a slight pullback. As of now, XRP trades at $3.11. Severino points to technical indicators, including the Fisher Transform, which is approaching levels observed during previous major peaks in 2017 and 2021. Both past instances were followed by substantial declines, suggesting that caution is warranted even amid the rally. Based on this pattern, Severino advises setting sell-limit orders in advance to secure profits before potential price exhaustion. The end is near in XRP, but it will be a glorious finale Make sure your sell limit orders are set up in advance pic.twitter.com/v7ot0t9B8O — Tony ""The Bull"" Severino, CMT (@TonyTheBullCMT) August 12, 2025 Potential Peak and Historical Comparisons Severino’s analysis draws parallels between the current movement and XRP’s late-2017 surge, when the token rose from under $0.01 to more than $3 within approximately nine weeks. He projects that the ongoing rally could follow a similar, compressed timeframe. In his previous commentary, Severino suggested that XRP’s “final wave” might reach as high as $12.73 within roughly 40 days, indicating a possible peak between late August and early September. Other market observers are even more optimistic, placing end-of-year targets in the $50 to $99 range. Despite these projections, Severino underscores the importance of measured trading, particularly for retail investors. Importance of an Exit Strategy While Severino maintains a bullish outlook, he stresses disciplined profit-taking. His personal target range for exiting trades lies between $8 and $13. He is not alone in warning of a potential reversal following a peak. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Jaydee cautions that although XRP may experience a sharp surge reminiscent of its 2017 performance, only a small fraction of investors are likely to capture substantial gains. He notes that many participants could be left vulnerable if they fail to exit strategically. EGRAG, another cryptocurrency analyst, shares this concern, projecting similar downturn scenarios once XRP reaches a peak. He has outlined two possible outcomes. One scenario sees the token reaching $27 before declining roughly 97% to $0.80 , while a more moderate scenario anticipates a high of $9 followed by an 85% drop to $1.30. EGRAG also notes that a fall below $0.30 remains within the realm of possibility based on historical cycle patterns. Although some experts, including Michael Saylor and Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, argue that institutional involvement has altered market dynamics, analysts like EGRAG contend that cyclical trends remain relevant and that price corrections are likely to occur. While projections for XRP’s peak vary widely, analysts agree that the current rally is in an advanced stage. Historical trends suggest that significant corrections often follow sharp gains, making disciplined exit strategies essential for protecting profits.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely recognized barometer of investor emotion, offers a fascinating glimpse into this sentiment. As of August 15, this key indicator, provided by the software development platform Alternative, registered a reading of 60. This figure marks a 15-point drop from the previous day, yet it impressively holds its ground within the ‘Greed’ zone. What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Reveal? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index operates on a straightforward scale from 0 to 100. A score closer to 0 signals ‘extreme fear,’ suggesting investors are highly apprehensive and potentially overselling their assets. Conversely, a score nearing 100 indicates ‘extreme greed,’ often hinting at an overheated market where prices might be unsustainable due to excessive buying. Despite its recent dip, the index’s continued presence in the ‘Greed’ territory (typically above 50) suggests that overall crypto market sentiment remains positive. This indicates that even with some weakening, a significant portion of market participants still feel optimistic about future price movements. Investors often monitor this index to gauge collective emotions, which can sometimes precede significant price shifts. Understanding the Drivers of Crypto Market Sentiment How does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index arrive at its daily reading? It synthesizes data from six distinct factors, each contributing a specific weight to the final score. These components provide a holistic view of the prevailing crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current Bitcoin price fluctuations and maximum drawdowns compared to average values over 30 and 90 days. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Social Media (15%): Scans various social media platforms for cryptocurrency-related hashtags, analyzing their volume and sentiment. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Currently paused, which means its weight is distributed among other factors). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. A rising dominance often indicates fear, as investors might be moving into the perceived ‘safer’ asset. Google Trends (10%): Examines search query trends for crypto-related terms, indicating public interest and emotional responses. How Does Bitcoin Dominance Influence the Index? It might seem counterintuitive, but Bitcoin dominance plays a crucial role in the Fear & Greed Index. When Bitcoin’s market share increases, it often suggests that investors are shifting their capital from altcoins into Bitcoin. This movement is frequently interpreted as a flight to safety, indicating a more cautious or fearful market outlook. Conversely, a decreasing Bitcoin dominance can signal a ‘risk-on’ environment where investors are more willing to explore altcoins, which often carry higher risk but also higher potential rewards. This factor helps provide a nuanced perspective on broader market dynamics beyond just price action, offering deeper insights into the collective investor mindset. Navigating Cryptocurrency Trends with Market Sentiment Analysis The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a valuable tool for market sentiment analysis , helping investors understand the psychological state of the crypto market. While it is not a predictive tool, it offers crucial context. When the index shows ‘extreme fear,’ it can sometimes present a potential buying opportunity for contrarian investors, as prices might be undervalued due to panic selling. Conversely, ‘extreme greed’ can be a warning sign, suggesting that the market might be due for a correction. For those tracking cryptocurrency trends , integrating this index into their analysis provides an emotional layer often missed by purely technical or fundamental approaches. It reminds us that markets are driven not just by data, but also by human emotions. However, it is essential to remember that the index is just one data point and should be used in conjunction with comprehensive research and risk management strategies. In conclusion, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a powerful snapshot of investor psychology, even as it fluctuates. Its current position in the ‘Greed’ zone, despite a recent dip, underscores persistent optimism within the market. By understanding its components and implications, investors can gain valuable insights into prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping them make more informed decisions when navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trends . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‘extreme fear’ (0) to ‘extreme greed’ (100). 2. How is the index calculated? It’s calculated by analyzing six key factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media activity, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends. 3. What does ‘Greed’ sentiment mean for investors? A ‘Greed’ sentiment suggests that investors are optimistic and may be buying aggressively, potentially leading to an overvalued market. It can be a signal for caution. 4. Can the index predict future crypto prices? No, the index is not a predictive tool. It reflects current sentiment and can offer insights into potential market reversals, but it should be used alongside other analytical methods. 5. Why are surveys paused in the index calculation? The index provider, Alternative, occasionally pauses the survey component, likely due to data collection or methodological adjustments. Its weight is then distributed among the other factors.

This strategic acquisition of 16,299 Bitmain Antminer rigs, valued at approximately $314 million, signals a major expansion and a bold statement in the competitive landscape of digital asset investment . What Does This Massive Crypto Mining Rig Purchase Mean for American Bitcoin? This isn’t just any purchase; it represents one of the largest single acquisitions of crypto mining rigs in recent memory. American Bitcoin’s investment in these Bitmain Antminer rigs positions them for substantial growth in their operational capacity. This kind of scale indicates a strong belief in the long-term profitability and stability of Bitcoin. The company, American Bitcoin (ABTC), aims to solidify its presence as a key player. Such an extensive order of high-performance mining equipment directly translates to increased hash rate and, consequently, a greater share of the Bitcoin block rewards. Increased Hash Rate: More rigs mean more computational power dedicated to solving complex cryptographic puzzles. Market Dominance: This move could help ABTC gain a more significant share of the global Bitcoin hash rate. Strategic Positioning: Investing heavily now prepares the company for future market cycles and potential network difficulty adjustments. Why Are Bitmain Antminer Rigs So Crucial for Profitable Bitcoin Mining? The choice of Bitmain Antminer rigs is strategic. Bitmain is a leading manufacturer of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, known for their efficiency and power. These machines are specifically designed to perform the intensive calculations required for Bitcoin mining , making them a preferred choice for large-scale operations. Acquiring such a large fleet of these advanced machines suggests American Bitcoin is prioritizing operational efficiency and maximizing its return on investment. The performance of these rigs directly impacts the company’s ability to mine Bitcoin profitably, especially as network difficulty continues to rise. This substantial investment also highlights a broader trend: the increasing institutionalization of digital asset investment . Large capital injections are becoming more common, signaling a maturing market where significant players are making long-term commitments. What Are the Broader Implications for Digital Asset Investment? The sheer scale of American Bitcoin’s purchase has several implications for the broader digital asset investment landscape. Firstly, it underscores the continued confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a viable asset for long-term holding. Despite market fluctuations, major players are still pouring significant capital into the infrastructure supporting the network. Secondly, it points to the ongoing centralization concerns within the Bitcoin mining industry. As larger entities acquire more hash rate, the distribution of mining power can become more concentrated.

A groundbreaking proposal from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) could reshape how we view digital asset security. Researchers at the BIS have put forward an innovative idea: a BIS AML compliance score system for crypto tokens. This system aims to enhance anti-money laundering efforts while respecting the core principles of decentralized finance. What is the Proposed BIS AML Compliance System? Imagine a world where every crypto token carries a reputation score, not unlike a credit rating. That is precisely what the BIS researchers are envisioning. Their proposal suggests assigning anti-money laundering (AML) compliance scores to crypto tokens. These scores would be based on the token’s transaction history. DL News reported that this system would allow exchanges to block conversions to fiat currency for assets falling below a specific threshold. The primary goal is to target tokens linked to illicit activity. Moreover, the system seeks to preserve the permissionless nature of blockchains. Crucially, it aims to do this without requiring the collection of user data. This approach marks a significant shift. Instead of focusing on individual users, it evaluates the inherent risk associated with the token itself. This method could streamline compliance for institutions dealing with a wide array of digital assets. It also introduces a new layer of scrutiny for all digital transactions. This could lead to more reliable crypto compliance scores across the ecosystem. How Will Crypto Compliance Scores Impact the Market? The introduction of crypto compliance scores could have far-reaching implications for the digital asset market. On one hand, it promises to clean up the space, making it less attractive for money launderers and criminals. This could foster greater trust among traditional financial institutions and regulators, potentially accelerating mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Benefits could include: Enhanced Security: Reduced flow of illicit funds through the crypto ecosystem. Increased Trust: Greater confidence for institutional investors and traditional finance. Regulatory Clarity: A standardized approach to assessing token risk. However, challenges are also apparent. Determining accurate scores while avoiding false positives will be critical. Furthermore, the impact on privacy-focused tokens or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols remains a key discussion point. The system’s effectiveness hinges on its ability to differentiate legitimate transactions from suspicious ones. It must do so without stifling innovation or penalizing innocent users. This delicate balance is vital for the success of any new anti-money laundering framework. Addressing Anti-Money Laundering Concerns Without Compromising Privacy One of the most compelling aspects of the BIS proposal is its stated commitment to privacy. The system aims to combat anti-money laundering without requiring the collection of user-specific data. This is a crucial distinction from traditional financial surveillance methods. Instead, it focuses on the inherent characteristics and historical movements of the tokens themselves. The researchers propose a method that analyzes the “taint” or risk associated with a token’s past transactions. This could involve tracing funds linked to known illicit addresses or activities. By assigning a token scoring system based on these on-chain patterns, the system attempts to flag problematic assets. It avoids directly identifying the individuals holding or transacting with them. This approach seeks to maintain the pseudo-anonymous nature of blockchain transactions. It offers a potential path forward for effective regulation that respects user privacy. This is a significant step towards balancing security with individual liberties in the digital age. The Future of Blockchain Regulation and Token Scoring The BIS proposal is a clear signal that global financial bodies are actively exploring sophisticated methods for blockchain regulation . This token scoring system represents a proactive step towards creating a more secure and compliant crypto environment. It acknowledges the unique challenges and opportunities presented by decentralized technologies. The implementation of such a system would require significant collaboration among exchanges, regulators, and blockchain analytics firms. Key considerations for the future: Global Consensus: Achieving widespread adoption and consistent application across jurisdictions. Technological Advancement: Continuous improvement of analytics tools to accurately assess token risk. Industry Adaptation: Crypto projects and exchanges will need to adapt to new compliance standards. This initiative could set a precedent for future regulatory approaches. It moves beyond traditional “know your customer” (KYC) requirements to a “know your token” paradigm. This shift could make the crypto space safer and more accessible for broader adoption. It highlights the growing maturity of the industry and the increasing focus on responsible innovation. Revolutionizing Compliance: The Impact of a Token Scoring System The BIS’s proposed token scoring system has the potential to revolutionize how we approach compliance in the crypto world. It offers a pragmatic solution to a complex problem: how to prevent illicit financial flows without stifling the very innovation that makes blockchain technology so powerful. By focusing on the token’s history rather than individual users, it seeks to strike a delicate balance. This initiative could lead to a cleaner, more trusted crypto ecosystem. It would pave the way for greater institutional participation and broader acceptance of digital assets. While challenges remain, the conversation around such intelligent regulatory tools is a positive development. It underscores a commitment to both security and the permissionless spirit of blockchain. The future of crypto regulation looks set to be more nuanced and technologically driven. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the core idea behind the BIS’s proposed system? A1: The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) proposes assigning anti-money laundering (AML) compliance scores to crypto tokens based on their transaction history. This aims to identify and restrict tokens linked to illicit activities. Q2: How would the AML compliance score be determined? A2: The score would be determined by analyzing a token’s transaction history, looking for links to known illicit activities or addresses. Tokens with a higher risk profile would receive lower scores. Q3: What is the main goal of this token scoring system? A3: The primary goal is to combat money laundering and illicit finance within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It also aims to achieve this while preserving the permissionless nature of blockchains and avoiding user data collection. Q4: Will this system require collecting user data? A4: No, a key aspect of the BIS proposal is that the system would evaluate tokens based on their on-chain transaction history, not by collecting personal user data. This maintains a degree of privacy for users. Q5: How might this impact cryptocurrency exchanges? A5: Exchanges would play a crucial role, potentially blocking the conversion of low-scoring tokens to fiat currency. This would require them to integrate the scoring system and adapt their compliance procedures. Q6: What are the potential challenges of implementing such a system? A6: Challenges include accurately determining scores without false positives, ensuring global consensus and consistent application, and adapting to the evolving nature of blockchain technology and new privacy solutions.

Onchain Lens reported a significant event: an address associated with the Ethereum Foundation recently executed further ETH sales , offloading an additional 2,099 ETH. This transaction, valued at 9.61 million DAI, adds to a larger trend observed over the past two days, where the address collectively sold 6,194 ETH, totaling 28.36 million DAI. This movement of digital assets naturally sparks questions about its potential impact on the wider crypto market . What Do Recent Ethereum Foundation ETH Sales Reveal? The Ethereum Foundation plays a pivotal role in the Ethereum ecosystem, supporting its development and research. Therefore, any significant movement of digital assets from addresses linked to them often draws considerable scrutiny. The recent transactions highlight a pattern of strategic asset management. Specifics of the Sales: An additional 2,099 ETH was sold for 9.61 million DAI. This follows previous sales, bringing the two-day total to 6,194 ETH. The cumulative value of these ETH sales reached 28.36 million DAI. This activity is not entirely unprecedented. Entities like the Ethereum Foundation periodically adjust their holdings for various reasons, including funding ongoing projects, covering operational costs, or rebalancing portfolios. Understanding these movements requires a closer look at the underlying on-chain data . How Does On-Chain Data Inform Our Understanding? Analyzing on-chain data provides transparency into these large transactions. Public blockchain ledgers allow anyone to track the movement of funds, offering valuable insights into the activities of major holders. When an entity like the Ethereum Foundation conducts substantial ETH sales , it becomes a crucial data point for analysts and investors. Transparency and Traceability: Every transaction is recorded and immutable, allowing for precise tracking. Market Sentiment Indicators: Large sales can sometimes be interpreted as a signal, potentially influencing short-term market sentiment. However, it is crucial to consider the context. Impact on Liquidity: Such sales introduce liquidity into the market, which can be absorbed by demand or, in some cases, contribute to price volatility if demand is low. These transactions are often executed via decentralized exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks to minimize immediate market impact. The conversion to DAI, a stablecoin, suggests a move to de-risk or prepare for future expenditures in fiat or other stable assets, rather than a direct exit from the crypto market . What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Market? The immediate reaction to large ETH sales can vary, but the broader implications for the crypto market depend on several factors. It is important to distinguish between routine treasury management and a signal of fundamental shifts. For example, if the Ethereum Foundation were consistently liquidating significant portions of its digital assets without clear communication, it might raise more concerns. Market Stability: Despite the size, these sales represent a small fraction of Ethereum’s total market capitalization, meaning their direct impact on price is often limited unless combined with other bearish factors. Funding Development: Often, these sales fund crucial development work, research, and community initiatives that ultimately strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem. This long-term benefit can outweigh short-term market jitters. Investor Perspective: Savvy investors look beyond the headline, examining the overall health of the network, development progress, and wider adoption trends rather than reacting solely to individual large transactions. The continued transparency from entities like the Ethereum Foundation regarding their financial activities helps maintain trust within the ecosystem. This openness, coupled with the inherent transparency of on-chain data , allows the community to form informed opinions. The recent ETH sales by an Ethereum Foundation -linked address, totaling 6,194 ETH, are a notable event within the digital asset landscape. While significant in volume, understanding these movements through the lens of on-chain data and considering the broader context of the crypto market is essential. These transactions likely represent strategic financial management aimed at supporting the ongoing growth and development of the Ethereum ecosystem. Rather than a cause for alarm, they often reflect the operational realities of a large, well-funded project. The transparency inherent in blockchain technology allows the community to monitor and understand these developments, fostering a more informed environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the development and growth of the Ethereum blockchain and its ecosystem. 2. Why would the Ethereum Foundation sell ETH? The Ethereum Foundation sells ETH primarily to fund its ongoing operations, research, development projects, and grants for ecosystem initiatives. It is part of their treasury management. 3. How do these ETH sales impact the market? While large sales can cause short-term fluctuations in market sentiment, their overall impact on the vast crypto market is often limited, especially when they represent a small fraction of the total supply. The funds generated typically support long-term ecosystem growth. 4. Can I track these transactions myself? Yes, because Ethereum is a public blockchain, all transactions are recorded on-chain. Anyone can use blockchain explorers (tools that allow viewing on-chain data) to track these movements transparently. 5. What is DAI? DAI is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. The Ethereum Foundation converting ETH to DAI suggests a move to a stable asset to manage funds without exposure to crypto market volatility, preparing for future expenditures.

Analysts are putting forward some bold year-end targets — some seeing Bitcoin at $200,000 and Ethereum heading towards $10,000. These projections have traders debating the best crypto to buy now, but there’s a twist. A growing number of market watchers believe a new altcoin 2025 contender could outperform both. That coin is MAGACOIN FINANCE — a rising star in the market. It’s being ranked among the few projects that could outpace the big names, making it one of the top crypto picks 2025 for those hunting the highest ROI. Bitcoin’s 2025 Price Outlook: $80,840 to $200K+ Bitcoin is showing strong momentum after climbing back above $121,000, gaining more than 5% in the last week. Institutional demand is a big driver here, with forecasts ranging from a conservative $80,840 to an aggressive $200,000+ before year-end. InvestingHaven expects a base range of $80,840–$151,150, with a “stretched” target as high as $181,000. A consensus of seven top forecasters puts BTC around $200,000. Standard Chartered is in the same camp with a $200,000 projection. These numbers keep Bitcoin in the spotlight for long-term investors weighing Bitcoin vs Ethereum, but also open the door to comparing how other coins might perform in this bullish cycle. Ethereum’s 2025 Targets: $7,500 to $10,000 Ethereum has surged nearly 30% in the past seven days, bouncing from $3,600 to $4,700. With ETF inflows, network upgrades, and stablecoin growth, analysts are predicting a strong year ahead. Standard Chartered now sees ETH at $7,500, up from its earlier $4,000 target. ETF-focused analysts believe $10,000 is possible, especially with the momentum from post-ETF approval buying. This makes Ethereum a contender for the best crypto to buy now — yet some traders are shifting their attention to emerging projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Analysts’ Dark Horse for 2025 Leading analysts rank MAGACOIN FINANCE among the few projects capable of outperforming both Bitcoin and Ethereum in the next cycle. They see it as a fresh, high-growth opportunity in a market still dominated by the big two. While BTC and ETH are expected to deliver solid returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is viewed as a new altcoin 2025 candidate with a better risk-to-reward profile for those seeking maximum upside. The project is touted by the analysts as one of the top crypto picks 2025 for aggressive investors. It’s still early in its growth phase, which is exactly why some traders believe the percentage gains could eclipse even the most optimistic BTC or ETH predictions. Where the Smart Money Might Flow in 2025 Bitcoin vs Ethereum will remain a central debate for crypto investors in 2025. Both are backed by strong technical and institutional narratives, and both have bullish forecasts. But while their potential gains may be substantial, their market caps make triple-digit percentage surges harder to achieve. This is where projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE enter the conversation. For investors aiming to spot the best crypto to buy now for outsized returns, this rising project is becoming hard to ignore.

The company said it will buy mining rigs and add assets such as XRP, BTC, ETH, SOL, LTC, USDC and DOGE to its balance sheet. The move comes after Thumzup set an internal target to grow a digital asset pool to $250 million and authorized up to 90% of its liquid assets to be held in cryptocurrencies. Thumzup Expands Crypto Treasury Robert Steele, Thumzup’s CEO, called the raise a step toward a “strategically managed” digital asset treasury. According to the company, Coinbase Prime will remain custodian and prime broker for the new holdings. The firm also disclosed a Bitcoin-backed credit facility arranged with Coinbase Prime in May 2025 that is meant to provide flexible capital to support its treasury plan. This is a bold pivot for a publicly traded firm and will draw close scrutiny from investors and regulators alike. Mining Push And Capital Use Based on reports, the $50 million proceeds will be split toward mining equipment purchases and direct crypto accumulation. Mining requires machines, space, and power, and Thumzup says it will deploy capital to expand operations. That’s the part that could either add steady revenue if done well or become a heavy drain on cash if costs rise or market prices tumble. The company didn’t give a detailed commissioning schedule in the initial release, so the timing of any meaningful hash rate increase remains unclear. Peers And Market Moves Reports have disclosed a string of similar corporate moves in recent days. Vivopower announced a partnership with Crypto.com for institutional custody. Metaplanet Inc. of Japan reported a 468% Bitcoin yield in the second quarter of 2025, after holding 18,113 BTC valued at $2.1 billion following a $61 million BTC purchase. Thumzup’s action sits squarely alongside these shifts as Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high. A Risky Bet For Shareholders? If cryptocurrency prices keep rising and margins in mining are still healthy, the plan could deliver very strong returns. But pooling as much as 90% of liquid assets into digital tokens will expose the company’s balance sheet to sudden swings. The mining expansion will be a big-ticket item that needs to be executed with care. Given that the company is associated with US President Donald Trump’s family , the expansion will draw increased media and political scrutiny.

Here’s what could happen next, according to history. Bitcoin Realized Price Has Overtaken 200-WMA For First Time This Cycle As pointed out by analyst James Van Straten in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Realized Price and 200-week MA have seen a crossover. The “Realized Price” here refers to an on-chain indicator that, in short, keeps track of the cost basis of the average investor or address on the BTC network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Options Traders Don’t Expect Volatility: Contrarian Signal Brewing? When the value of this metric is higher than the spot price, it means the holders as a whole are in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under BTC’s value suggests the average investor is underwater. The 200-week MA, the other metric shared by the analyst, is a technical analysis (TA) pricing model that averages BTC’s closing price over the last 200 weeks. Since 200 weeks roughly equal four years, this indicator is used to gauge BTC’s trend shifts over a classic four-year cycle. Now, here is the chart shared by Van Straten that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Realized Price and 200-week MA over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Price has gone up over the past year, a natural result of BTC’s spot price following an uptrend. As investors trade at the higher prices, they reprice the cost basis of their coins higher as well, thus raising the market average. After the latest increase in the indicator, its value has surged above the 200-week MA. The last time that the former was higher than the latter was in the previous cycle. Back then, the crossover occurred in 2020, and the orientation was maintained until 2022. Interestingly, the timing of the crossover coincided with the start of that cycle’s bull run. In the 2017 cycle, no crossover preceded the bull run as the Realized Price never dipped under the 200-week MA, but a retest did occur, which sent the metric flying up alongside the spot price. “When the uptrend begins, so does the bull market,” notes the analyst. It now remains to be seen whether something similar as in the past would occur, with the Bitcoin Realized Price seeing a sustained surge above the 200-week MA.
