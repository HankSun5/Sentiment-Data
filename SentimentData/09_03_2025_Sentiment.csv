Here are all the ways how,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-more-bitcoins-without-taxpayer-money/,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Bitcoin earlier this week, officially creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) using only the seized Bitcoin the US government already owns. This means no new purchases, no market buys—just stockpiling what’s already been taken from criminals and fraudsters. Crypto traders expected something different. They wanted the government to start buying more Bitcoin, which would push prices up. Instead, they got disappointment, and they’ve been sharing their frustrations all over X (formerly Twitter). Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast, responded to the outrage with a post on X today, saying , “If you think that the Bitcoin SBR is bad news because it will only contain seized Bitcoin, then you are bad at reading and worse at comprehending what you are reading. Sell me your Bitcoin.” XRP lawyer John Deaton backed him up, saying, “Scott, as usual, is 100% spot on. I’ve seen a lot of negative takes regarding the EO. I realize many crypto investors were hoping for a Strategic MultiCoin Reserve, not just a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Trump orders Treasury and Commerce to find ‘budget-neutral’ ways to acquire Bitcoin During his White House crypto summit, Trump said, “Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet and we’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” The executive order also directed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to figure out how to get more Bitcoin without spending taxpayer dollars. That means creative methods—loopholes, incentives, partnerships. Deaton pointed to a major tool at their disposal: the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The ESF gives the Treasury Secretary broad authority to buy and hold financial assets to stabilize the dollar. Could Bitcoin be included? It’s possible, but Deaton said it would likely be challenged in court. Another potential option is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). If Trump declared the $36 trillion national debt an economic emergency, he could use the IEEPA to justify Bitcoin purchases through executive action. But that would require printing money to buy Bitcoin, which would create a whole new set of problems. Then there’s the Defense Production Act. If Trump declared Bitcoin mining critical to national security, the government could start mining and acquiring Bitcoin directly. Deaton called this idea “insane,” but legally, it’s not off the table. President Trump at the White House crypto summit on March 7, 2025. Source: White House X/Twitter One of the easiest ways for the government to increase its Bitcoin holdings is through those criminal seizures. When authorities take Bitcoin from fraudsters, they usually auction it off. Trump’s executive order could mean keeping it instead. This would push law enforcement to crack down even harder on crypto-related crimes, and oh there are tons and tons of that still happening right now. Another way is taxing Bitcoin miners in BTC. The US is home to some of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operations, and they could be required to pay a small portion of their mining rewards to the government. In return, they’d get tax breaks or regulatory benefits. The IRS and Commerce Department could also start accepting Bitcoin for federal payments. People paying taxes, fines, and fees in Bitcoin wouldn’t just be converting it to dollars—the government could keep a portion in the reserve. This would allow the US to accumulate Bitcoin naturally over time. A particularly aggressive approach is requiring federal land and energy lease payments in Bitcoin. Companies mining coal, lithium, or drilling for oil on federal land could be required to pay part of their royalties in BTC. This would make Bitcoin a national asset while giving mining and energy companies a direct stake in its success. Deaton also suggested that: “Partnering with U.S. Tech & Finance Firms by creating incentivized partnership where companies like Coinbase and Ripple help acquire and manage Bitcoin reserves and digital asset stockpiles.” Swapping gold for Bitcoin, Bitcoin-based bonds, tariffs in BTC, and many more budget-neutral ideas for buying more Bitcoins Trump’s executive order didn’t mention gold reserves, but that doesn’t mean they’re off-limits, especially if you consider Crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis proposal in the BITCOIN Act, which actually first introduced the idea of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The US government holds over 8,100 tons of gold in reserves. If they swapped even a small portion for Bitcoin, they’d create a huge BTC stockpile overnight. (From the left) Howard Lutnick, Scott Bessent, Trump, David Sacks, Bo Hines, Brian Armstrong, and Michael Saylor at the summit. Source: White House Another possibility is tokenized US Treasury bonds. The government could issue Bitcoin-backed securities that investors buy with BTC, which would allow the US to acquire Bitcoin while still financing operations through debt instruments. Deaton said, “Trump could impose a “Bitcoin Tariff” instead of USD Tariff on Certain Imports. This is combining Tariff and BTC policy. For example, on high-tech goods, rare earth metals, or semiconductors, which are critical to national security or on electronics imported from China, given its dominance in global supply chains.” This of course comes as Trump is imposing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China almost every other week since taking back the Oval on January 20th. Another option Deaton gave was Bitcoin-pegged export credits. The Commerce Department could create export incentives where US companies receive BTC credits when selling goods abroad. Foreign buyers paying a portion in Bitcoin would allow the government to build reserves without direct market purchases. Deaton said the US could also strike energy deals where countries like Saudi Arabia (oil) or Canada (natural gas) accept US exports at a discount in exchange for BTC payments. This would push international demand for Bitcoin transactions involving the US government. Another idea is that the US could issue Bitcoin-backed bonds tied to energy reserves, kind of like El Salvador’s Bitcoin bonds. These bonds could be linked to future oil, gas, or federal land lease revenues, giving investors exposure to both Bitcoin and US energy production, said Deaton. Trump’s executive order doesn’t stop private companies or individuals from donating Bitcoin to the US reserve. A tax incentive for BTC donations could encourage people to send Bitcoin to the government without direct spending. Federal contractors could also pay in Bitcoin, with a small portion going directly into the reserve. This would allow the US to accumulate Bitcoin while still paying contractors as usual. Even regular taxpayers could be incentivized. If the government offered capital gains tax breaks for people paying taxes in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP, it could encourage crypto holders to pay directly in BTC. A tiny fraction of each payment could be kept in the reserve, steadily increasing holdings over time. “Hence, the EO we received is as aggressive as a President can do, absent invoking emergency powers. I’m surprised BTC isn’t $120K already. As for the MultiCoin debate and people disappointed, BTC has ALWAYS led the market. You can dislike it, but it’s reality,” Deaton said in his X post.

However, projects that perform well typically have high utility in the DeFi ecosystem. Analysts and experts have centered their research on BinoFi , a new hybrid crypto exchange project designed to redefine how traders interact with crypto assets. According to the analysts, the token is set to outperform XRP’s 5X rally by posting impressive 100X gains in 2025. BinoFi’s native token BINO is currently on presale onboarding investors to support its on-chain and off-chain infrastructure development. Will XRP go up? XRP has been one of the most volatile crypto assets in 2025. The asset entered a corrective phase and dropped to $1.76 in early February after climbing to a seven-year high of $3.40 in January. The crypto asset recently surged by 35% in a single day before dropping by more than 20% the following day. The recent XRP swings are credited to announcements made by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the proposed strategic crypto reserves for the U.S. Treasury. XRP has the potential to rally by 5X and could reach $10. Although experts think $10 may not be possible in 2025, they believe it will be possible by 2035 when crypto adoption picks up momentum. While 5X proves to be a huddle for XRP, the analysts cited BinoFi’s potential for 100X gains this year. BinoFi’s presale reveals a life-changing opportunity for crypto investors Crypto exchanges are the backbone of crypto trading activities and have evolved with new technology. Older exchanges such as Mt. Gox only provided investors with basic trading features but exposed market participants to security concerns leading to loss of investors’ funds to malicious hacks. As technology evolved, it paved the way for exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase that are more secure, user-friendly and possess advanced trading features such as margin trading. BinoFi developers have discovered new technological applications that will reshape how centralized and decentralized exchanges function. The developers are working on a new hybrid exchange that joins features from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The discovery prompts a new approach that integrates the best aspects of both exchange models to give traders control of their assets and convenience when trading them. BinoFi’s presale is currently underway. Investors are buying BINO tokens at a discounted attractive price of $0.02. The presale is designed so that prices increase gradually after each phase. The gradual price increase ensures early adopters get rewarded for believing in the project’s future success. The presale is currently selling out fast as traders and investors scramble for tokens. Analysts believe BINO will surge by 100X after launch making presale investors significant gains. Why BinoFi Could 100X in 2025 BinoFi’s 100X price prediction comes amid several factors. The project is pioneering the first hybrid crypto exchange making it a first market mover in the niche. The first-to-market advantage positions the project as a leading DeFi protocol operating without competition. BinoFi’s transparency feature involves on-chain proof of reserves. The ecosystem provides real-time on-chain proof of assets to assure users that all funds are safe. The project also employs deflationary tokenomics. BINO tokens have a maximum supply of 2 billion tokens meaning that the team will not mint any more BINO tokens to inflate the ecosystem. Additionally, the token has an in-built deflationary mechanism that constantly reduces the token supply through a buy-back and burn feature. The mechanism will steadily increase the token’s demand rewarding long-term supporters and early adopters.

Cardano (ADA) is in the spotlight with Grayscale’s proposal for a new Cardano ETF, listed as “GADA” on NYSE Arca. Simultaneously, Stellar (XLM) could be gearing up for a price increase, with predictions of a 16% rise as buying signals strengthen on the charts. Amid these developments, Web3Bay is emerging as a platform set to reshape the digital assets market. As the interest in tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and NFTs with practical applications grows, Web3Bay is preparing to stake its claim as the go-to marketplace for digital assets in 2025. By linking digital creators, asset holders, and purchasers in a user-friendly space, Web3Bay aims to offer a platform that competes with OpenSea, favoring those who join early. Web3Bay: A Leading Crypto Marketplace for Digital Assets in 2025 Web3Bay is distinguishing itself as a hub that might transform into the digital assets’ Amazon, fostering connections among digital creators, asset owners, and shoppers through its comprehensive platform. With the rising appeal of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and NFTs that serve more functional roles, Web3Bay provides a solid foundation for secure, clear, and effective transactions. This blend of RWAs and digital offerings could set the stage for a challenge to major players like OpenSea, marking it as a top long-term crypto prospect for digital market engagement. A key feature of Web3Bay is its readiness to embrace NFTs with expanded utility. Beyond just art and collectibles, the platform accommodates digital tickets, memberships, and assets for the metaverse, adapting to the trend towards more utility-based NFTs. As RWAs like real estate, high-end goods, and commodities are increasingly tokenized, Web3Bay presents early birds the opportunity to capitalize on these market shifts. This combination of tangible and digital assets positions it as a promising long-term crypto player for 2025. Currently, in its 5th stage of presale, Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.00524. The presale has already attracted over $1.6 million, indicating strong interest in the initiative. With plans to include PayPal and other integrations in its roadmap, Web3Bay is strategically poised to attract mainstream users, marking a significant period for early investors eager to carve out a niche in the burgeoning digital assets scene. Could a Cardano ETF Propel ADA to New Peaks? Excitement builds as Grayscale submits an application for the first standalone Cardano ETF, labeled “GADA” on NYSE Arca. Should it get the nod, this ETF would allow mainstream investors to tap into ADA without directly handling the cryptocurrency. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, will oversee custody, and BNY Mellon will manage administrative responsibilities. This initiative could boost ADA’s liquidity and demand, potentially elevating its price in the near future. After the announcement of the Cardano ETF, ADA’s value soared by 14.38%, reaching $0.8051. The forecast for 2025 looks bright, with an expected rise to $1.900281 as per CoinCodex. The Cardano community is optimistic about SEC approval, which could further ADA’s adoption and solidify its market presence. Can XLM Reach $0.4292? One Analyst Believes It’s Possible! Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests a 16% rise for XLM, citing a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern on Stellar’s 4-hour chart—a classic sign of an impending upward breakout. Currently priced at $0.32, Stellar (XLM) must overcome the $0.37 resistance to achieve a new target of $0.4292. Despite a recent 26.6% decline over the past 30 days, on-chain indicators hint at a turnaround. Stellar’s active addresses have hit a record high of 9 million, and $32.54 million in XLM has been withdrawn from exchanges, suggesting accumulation by investors. A 3.82% increase in Open Interest (OI) signals that traders are gearing up for a potential surge, keeping the outlook for XLM optimistic. The Bottom Line The anticipated Cardano ETF could catapult ADA to new heights, with a strong performance expected if the SEC approves. On another front, Stellar’s XLM is poised for a potential 16% increase to $0.4292 as momentum builds. Both projects hold exciting prospects, yet Web3Bay is making its mark as the best long-term crypto bet for 2025. Web3Bay’s cutting-edge marketplace for Real-World Assets (RWA) and NFTs positions it as the digital asset equivalent of Amazon, offering a streamlined platform poised to challenge OpenSea. Early backers of the Web3Bay presale, now in its 5th phase with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524, stand to gain as the platform expands. This digital asset boom is not to be missed!

The DeFi godfather points to rising competition from Solana and Tron and internal wrangling on Ethereum as reasons for the network’s decline. Andre Cronje Identifies A Boatload of Factors Affecting Ethereum As analysts continue to scratch their heads over Ethereum’s underperformance, Andre Cronje has thrown his hat in the ring to explain the asset’s decline. Cronje took to X (formerly Twitter) to rationalize falling Ethereum prices in the face of major catalysts for the network. Top on the list for Cronje are layer 2 projects “ruining” user experiences via fragmented liquidity and the use of centralized sequencers. Cronje notes that the decision of L2 projects to dump ETH adversely affects price performance. Furthermore, short pressure from USDe and a botched scaling roadmap contribute their share to falling Ethereum prices. Cronje argues that ETH defenders are podcasters rather than engineers while the question of network representation remains unsettled. The recent appointment of Ethereum Foundation directors does little to convince Cronje to invest in the largest altcoin. Cronje Will Rather Invest In Other Altcoins Over Ethereum The Sonic Labs co-founder confirmed that the dour sentiment surrounding Ethereum is linked to increased competition from other blockchains. Rival blockchains like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) offer improved speed and finality while offering superior user interfaces. For Cronje, these competing blockchains offer direct support to native projects rather than opting for neutrality. He argues that teams are just not building on Ethereum and are opting for other blockchains to host their projects. “Hell, I don’t invest, but if I did, I would choose Solana, Tron, and XRP over ETH,” said Cronje. Ethereum’s Grim Price Prediction After the largest altcoin slipped below the $2,000 mark, on-chain analysts presented theories of ETH falling to $1,000 . Ethereum currently trades at $2,215 with whales scooping up one million ETH on a discount. Despite key catalysts like ETH ETF approvals and inclusion in the Crypto Strategic Reserve , the asset’s price performance is underwhelming. Analysts have their sights on resistance levels at the $2,857 mark and $2,084 for support as the assets navigate a choppy season.

Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are considered cornerstones of Donald Trump’s digital asset reserve. XRP Mentioned As An Asset Of Interest For America’s Digital Asset Reserve President Donald Trump recently signed an Executive Order establishing the Crypto Reserve and US Digital Asset Stockpile. Crypto experts have called Donald Trump’s crypto reserve the most bullish political stance on digital assets ever. News has spread that the Federal Reserve will own XRP. Interestingly, the possibility of XRP being in the digital asset reserve has gotten backlash from crypto enthusiasts who say they do not understand the rationale behind having XRP in the reserve. Nonetheless, the White House will have a crypto summit to discuss Donald Trump‘s digital asset reserve in order to determine the tone for the US crypto policy moving forward. US Gains The Largest Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Following Donald Trump Announcement With Donald Trump’s recently announced digital asset reserve, the United States now has 198,109 Bitcoin (BTC) locked in . Experts have explained that the US will hold almost 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and develop budget-neutral strategies to buy more Bitcoin (BTC). Due to this large accumulation, the US now has the largest strategic Bitcoin reserve in the world.

Instead, the agency focused on denying transparency on their part. The crypto exchange compared FDIC’s effort towards crypto regulation to other agencies, citing that the former has been quite reluctant. Coinbase Drags SEC and FDIC on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal took to X on March 8 to backlash against the FDIC for failing to cooperate and resist essential transparency efforts towards unwinding Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This campaign was designed to debank crypto-related companies by cutting them off banking services. The goal was to siphon every liquidity firm within the reach of the crypto firms. Coinbase once sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the FDIC. The exchange aimed to force the agencies to hand over the records that confirm Operation Chokepoint 2.0. FDIC Fails to Provide Documentation on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Grewal asked the FDIC to provide details on how it conducted due diligence to ensure that no Operation Chokepoint 2.0-related document was destroyed to hide proof. The agency is unable to respond to this question. Coinbase has also accused the FDIC of repeatedly refusing to provide information related to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) practices. According to a status report filed on January 17, History Associates, a firm assisting Coinbase, accused the FDIC of “systematically thwarting FOIA requests.” So far, only “snippets from a few documents” unrelated to the specific FOIA policies or practices have been made available. In response to this action, Grewal queried the FDIC, “What exactly are they hiding?” White House Crypto Summit on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The administration of former President Joe Biden is believed to have facilitated the debunking campaign against crypto firms. During the recently held White House Crypto Summit in Washington, experts spoke about the rollback of Biden-era banking regulation. These are known to also involve the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The OCC has now reversed the 2020 guidance that prohibited crypto firms from custody services provided by banks. This is noteworthy because it is a significant pivot from the FDIC’s position on cryptocurrency.

Liquidity drain from memecoins and ETFs is consolidating capital back into Bitcoin. Left-translated cycle could trigger a sharp BTC decline and prolonged bearish trends. The launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs was initially hailed as a major shift for the crypto industry. Many believed these investment vehicles would unlock significant institutional demand, propelling Bitcoin to new heights. However, the reality has played out differently. Since January 20, 2024, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain upward momentum, prompting questions about whether the market priced in perfection too soon. Interestingly, historical market patterns may offer insights into Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Analyst Benjamin Cowen has pointed to similarities between Bitcoin’s ETF performance and the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) launched in 1999. The QQQ ETF peaked 54 weeks after its inception, a timeline that aligns with Bitcoin’s peak 54 weeks post-ETF launch.

The XRP community is calling on newly appointed SEC Chair Mark Uyeda to drop the agency’s appeal. Ripple Community Chatter on SEC Case It is important to state that since the SEC filed its appeal on October 2, 2024, challenging Judge Analisa Torres’ rulings on programmatic sales and other distributions, XRP supporters have been vocal about their frustration. Spearheaded by X user, Tanner, many community members believe the SEC’s continued pursuit of the case is unnecessary. This is because of the court’s ruling that XRP’s public sales did not violate securities laws. them permanently enjoined to the court. An Acting Chairman resolving a complex case like Ripple’s would be rather uncommon. The fact that Ripple requested an extension to April 16th might be in anticipation of Atkins’ arrival. At least this is my take on it all. — Sherrie (@CherryEmpress21) March 8, 2025 Some speculate that Ripple’s request for the brief extension until April 16th may be tied to Uyeda’s potential leadership shift. The firm is likely anticipating a more pragmatic resolution under his watch. In addition, prominent figures in the crypto community have suggested a compromise. They want both Ripple and the SEC to drop their appeals and agree to revise the $125 million penalty currently in escrow. This would allow Ripple to move forward without the lingering uncertainty of legal proceedings. It will also enable the SEC to avoid further reputational damage from a prolonged fight. The New US SEC and End to Crypto Litigations With Mark Uyeda now acting as chairman of the US SEC, there is renewed hope that a resolution could be reached in the Ripple versus SEC case. For context, Uyeda has been critical of the SEC’s regulatory overreach in the past, and his leadership thus far has signaled a shift away from aggressive enforcement actions. The SEC dropped its charges against Ripple executives in October 2023. In addition, the SEC closed the Coinbase lawsuit recently. Crypto community members believe that these moves mark a softening position on the SEC’s side. However, the ongoing Ripple lawsuit appeal remains a central sticking point. The XRP community argues that if Uyeda truly wants to address the regulatory missteps of the past, dismissing the SEC’s appeal would be a decisive step. Proponents argue that it will restore trust and set a new direction for crypto regulation. Ripple Labs Policy Initiatives Meanwhile, Ripple Labs has continued to strengthen its policy efforts in the United States. Presently, it is engaging with lawmakers and blockchain associations to advocate for clear cryptocurrency regulations. The organization’s efforts align with broader industry calls for regulatory clarity that gives room for innovation rather than stifling it through litigation. As the case with the US SEC progresses, all eyes are on the regulator’s next move. Will Uyeda take action to end the Ripple lawsuit appeal and bring long-awaited closure? The XRP community is watching closely. Also, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has commended President Donald Trump’s vision of a crypto strategic reserve, which might include XRP. He also expressed excitement that the industry is moving past the Biden administration’s regulatory approaches.

With digital assets constantly evolving, new projects with innovative mechanics capture attention quickly. Among them, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) is making waves, offering an adventurous presale structure and an aggressive token burn strategy. Meanwhile, Polkadot is pushing forward with key network updates, and Ethereum continues to refine its scalability initiatives. This article will cover the latest developments surrounding Arctic Pablo Coin, Polkadot, and Ethereum. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Strategy: Token Burns in Action The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) presale introduces a powerful deflationary mechanism—weekly token burns. Any unsold tokens are permanently removed, limiting supply and increasing scarcity. Additionally, after the presale concludes, remaining tokens will be burned to sustain a deflationary economy. With each burn, Arctic Pablo Coin enhances investor value, as reducing token supply tends to drive up price potential. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring credibility and verifiability. This unique strategy differentiates APC from other meme coins, positioning it as a top crypto to buy now. Arctic Pablo Coin’s ChillVille Takeover – Prices Won’t Stay This Low Arctic Pablo Coin has now reached the 13th phase of its presale—ChillVille. This milestone follows its lightning-fast journey through 12 locations, including Penguinopolis, which wrapped up in under six days. The project has surpassed expectations at every stage, drawing increasing investor interest. Currently, APC is priced at just $0.000070, with a staggering ROI of 11,285.71% from this phase to the listing price of $0.008. Over $1.78 million has already been raised. As each new location unlocks, the price climbs, meaning this could be the last chance to get in at this entry point. The Arctic expedition continues, but investors who wait may miss out on these early-stage gains. Polkadot’s Latest Expansion into Cross-Chain Interoperability Polkadot has unveiled a major breakthrough in its cross-chain messaging system, aiming to enhance blockchain interoperability. The network’s latest update streamlines communication between parachains, reducing transaction times and improving efficiency. This enhancement is expected to strengthen Polkadot’s ecosystem, enabling smoother integrations across various DeFi platforms. As interoperability becomes a crucial factor in blockchain adoption, Polkadot’s advancements place it among the top cryptos to buy now. Ethereum Gears Up for Dencun Upgrade to Boost Efficiency Ethereum’s long-anticipated Dencun upgrade is nearing deployment, bringing significant improvements to scalability and transaction costs. This update focuses on Proto-Danksharding, a mechanism designed to lower fees for layer-2 solutions. With Ethereum remaining a dominant force in the crypto space, these enhancements reinforce its position as a leading smart contract platform. As the upgrade rolls out, investors are keeping a close watch on how it impacts the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Final Thoughts – Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out While Polkadot and Ethereum continue to evolve, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale has captivated the market with its unique structure and aggressive token burn strategy. The current stage, ChillVille, offers a rare opportunity to enter at a low price before it rises in the next location. As investors search for the best opportunities, APC’s adventurous journey and high-growth potential make it a meme coin presale worth considering. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this thrilling crypto expedition.

41350328,https://coingape.com/?p=243040,1741474097,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Can Reach $90, Here’s When",https://coingape.com/analyst-confirms-dogecoin-price-can-reach-90-heres-when/,"Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has provided an ultra bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, predicting it could reach as high as $90. The analyst also revealed when the foremost meme coin could reach this price target. When The Dogecoin Price Could Reach $90 In an X post , DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach $90. He noted that the price target was the highest point of a red area, which he believes the top meme coin could peak at in this market cycle. Interestingly, the analyst’s accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach this price target by the end of 2025, which he noted. Based on DOGECAPITAL’s analysis, this parabolic rally to $90 will happen in phase 3 of the meme coin’s bull run when it reaches this parallel red zone. This move will mirror previous cycles when Dogecoin reached its peak before starting a new cycle. The analyst noted that the bottom of that red zone sits at $26, his minimum target for this cycle. He said that the bottom of this red zone could gradually increase over time due to the slope of the line. Meanwhile, DOGECAPITAL claimed that the timing of DOGE’s approach to this red zone will determine when market participants can expect this cycle’s ultimate peak. In the meantime, DOGECAPITAL noted that the weekly candle continues to hold the same parallel line level, mirroring its behavior during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. He predicts that phase 2 of DOGE’s bull run will begin once the bottom is fully confirmed. The accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price will surge above $2 during this phase 2 of its bull run. DOGE Could Soon Hit $3 Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could hit $3. This came as the analyst revealed that DOGE’s monthly candle had formed a Doji, which was mirroring the same position in the previous cycle. The analyst remarked that this Doji might kick off a bull run for the DOGE price , similar to the massive spike in 2017 and 2018. His accompanying chart showed that the top meme coin could reach $3 as it records this massive spike. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that if the Dogecoin price maintains support at the channel’s lower boundary at $0.17, it could trigger a strong rebound toward $2.74. However, according to a CoinGape market analysis, there is still the possibility of DOGE suffering downward pressure before any potential price rebound. The analysis noted that the Dogecoin price is on the verge of forming a death cross , which may trigger a 42% crash to a five-month low of $0.11.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto insiders are betting on PropiChain to skyrocket, with projections for a 40,000% breakout in the market. Table of Contents A 40,000% surge? Here’s why it’s possible Why crypto insiders are betting big on this altcoin Crypto insiders are accumulating, don’t wait? Investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing and it is not different in the crypto market. Every crypto investor dreams of finding that one hidden gem that goes from obscurity to dominance while delivering insane gains. Bitcoin had its moment. Ethereum followed. Then came Solana , BNB, and Avalanche. Now, crypto insiders and analysts have locked onto a new target, and if their projections are right, we’re looking at a potential 40,000% breakout. Sounds crazy? Sure. But so did Shiba Inu’s 45,000,000% surge in 2021 and Solana’s 20,000% rally. The crypto market rewards early believers, and crypto insiders are betting that this hidden gem altcoin is next. Forget the usual suspects, this altcoin is ready to explode. In the hunt for the next big crypto, crypto insiders have found PropiChain (PCHAIN) an altcoin that combines real-world asset tokenization, AI, and the metaverse to change the real estate industry. So what exactly is it and why is it about to skyrocket? Let’s break it all down. A 40,000% surge? Here’s why it’s possible The crypto market moves in cycles and the biggest gains are made by those that get in ahead of the crowd. Crypto insiders don’t gamble, they spot winners early and that is exactly what they are doing with this hidden gem, PropiChain. While most retail investors chase already pumped coins, crypto insiders accumulate quietly. With its real-world utility, low market cap, and blockchain solutions, it is little wonder why they are all over PropiChain. The last time crypto insiders moved this aggressively, we saw BNB explode from $0.10 to $700. Crypto insiders know something other people don’t. In crypto, history repeats itself and we have seen this type of growth multiple times. Still skeptical about a 40,000% breakout? Just look at these real examples: Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained over 45,000,000% in just over a year; Solana (SOL) surged 20,000% after launching at $0.20; and Polygon (MATIC) rose 29,000% from its lows. The key? Early adoption + strong fundamentals + market momentum. This hidden gem altcoin checks every box and the math checks out. Why crypto insiders are betting big on this altcoin One of the biggest problems in investing in the real estate industry is accessibility. The industry is a proven wealth builder but most people are locked out if they don’t have deep pockets. Through fractional ownership, PCHAIN is changing the game. Imagine a student with free cash being able to own a slice of real estate with just $100 without ever dealing with banks, paperwork, or middlemen. This isn’t just an idea — it is happening right now. AI is taking over every industry and crypto is no exception. With AI-driven analytics, PropiChain is letting its investors reap the rewards while AI does all the hard work. This is not just crypto but an AI revolution. Samantha is new to crypto and hates technical analysis but with AI-powered investment tools, her altcoin portfolio is automatically adjusted based on market trends, ensuring she buys low and sells high, all without lifting a finger. That is the power of crypto + AI. The Metaverse is no longer just a sci-fi fantasy. Major companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple are investing billions into virtual worlds, and this altcoin is at the forefront of the movement. Investors can buy, sell, and rent real estate, creating real income streams in a fully digital economy. Samantha can finalize transactions after conducting a virtual tour of the property with the help of the metaverse. Compare this hidden gem to meme coins that rely on pure hype, and it is clear where the real opportunities are. Crypto insiders are accumulating, don’t wait? If history has taught us anything, it is that early adopters win big. By the time most investors hear about a crypto gem, it is already too late. Right now, crypto insiders are still accumulating, meaning there is a chance to get in before the breakout. Unlike shady altcoins that disappear overnight, this one is designed for stability. This hidden gem altcoin stands out with verified audits from Block Audit, ensuring a safe smart contract and its CoinMarketCap listing provides real-time transparency.

The current price of $0.015 makes MUTM attractive for investors during its second presale stage because the value will reach $0.02 when proceeding to the next phase. Early token investors will experience a 300% profit when MUTM lists at $0.06 although the current price increase stands at 33%. Professional analysts have already calculated a $3.50 price projection for the project after its launch which provides investors with a unique opportunity to achieve substantial returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse with Real-World Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform which delivers actual financial utility through its features. Through its mtTokens system the project enables users to access three functions: passive income generation and lending and borrowing activities. Users who deposit their assets such as ETH or DAI receive mtETH or mtDAI that generates interest during the holding period. The transferable tokens function as an important addition to the DeFi ecosystem because users can both send them to other platforms and utilize them throughout different DeFi systems. The lending model of the platform includes overcollateralized transactions that create stability and minimize risks. The borrowing process requires users to present assets with a value that exceeds the loan amount for dual purposes of protecting lenders while sustaining system stability. Mutuum Finance will implement peer-to-peer (P2P) lending features which allow users to establish direct negotiations for loan conditions. Standard lending pools do not support the borrowing of meme coins but Mutuum Finance provides this functionality through its peer-to-peer loan feature. Presale Success and Growing Investor Confidence The presale achieved tremendous success through fast-selling of its first phase followed by enthusiastic participation in its second phase. Investors can access the lowest price of $0.015 now because the market will not see this value again before the next price increase. Early investors stand to gain a 300% return when the token lists at $0.06, with further growth expected as the platform gains traction. The value creation strategy of Mutuum Finance depends on its buy-and-distribute mechanism for MUTM tokens. Revenue from the platform allows MUTM token purchases to distribute them to mtToken staking participants. The continuous buying pressure from the mechanism encourages investors to keep their tokens long-term while maintaining stable prices. The buy-and-distribute mechanism of MUTM combined with its practical real-world application makes the token a resilient investment choice among other cryptocurrencies. Why Now Is the Time to Act The second stage of presale activities is reaching its end while the upcoming price elevation is rapidly approaching. Current investors who purchase MUTM tokens at $0.015 now will profit immediately when the price reaches $0.02 during the following phase. New investors who participate during the initial phase can expect their investment to appreciate by 300% due to the $0.06 listing price. Experts anticipate MUTM tokens will achieve $3.50 value following the launch because of how the platform gains adoption while implementing new features. Mutuum Finance is currently conducting a $100,000 giveaway which will distribute $10,000 each to ten selected participants. The giveaway program has introduced additional thrill to the presale period thus attracting additional investors to participate before the deadline expires. A Unique Opportunity in the Crypto Market The market characterized by speculative hype distinguishes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its practical applications and sustainable growth framework. A robust ecosystem for sustainable growth results from the combination of its lending and borrowing features alongside the mtTokens system and the buy-and-distribute mechanism. Investor confidence in the project continues to increase as the presale advances swiftly while attracting more owners. A price increase of 33% is upcoming during the second phase which will end soon thus making it the optimal moment to take action.

As this bearish pattern continues, investors are actively rotating to PropiChain as it aims to take the lead. In this text, we will discuss Shiba Inu’s price action and analyze why PropiChain stands out to investors. What is the Future Outlook of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands out in 2021 when it delivers massive gains to early adopters to make new crypto millionaires. However, it has failed to keep up with the rest of the meme market in this cycle. The question on every investors’ mind is will Shiba Inu recover and keep up with the rest of the market or is this the end of the road. Consequently, Shiba Inu investors are rotating to a new narrative with high potential. This is the best move, considering SHIB is finding it hard to regain its momentum. Even if Shiba Inu recovers, it will be unable to deliver the life-changing gains that investors seek. Why PropiChain Will Take the Lead in the Crypto World PropiChain aims to make real estate accessible to everyone with more advanced features and enhanced experience. Investors will easily access the real estate market as PCHAIN’s asset tokenization will help to eliminate the huge capital requirements through a fractional ownership model. This model will enable users of PropiChain to be able to own fractions of high valuable properties. Before even picking the asset to invest in, PropiChain offers advanced filtering systems. This enables traders to get assets that match their preferences. For instance, you may ask PCHAIN’s AI to list only assets with expected ROI increases or those with high rental income, depending on your objectives. Furthermore, you can automate lease and renewal contracts by programming the smart contract. Once you’ve set the terms for your property leasing agreement, the smart contract helps process the contract after a user meets the condition. Physical meetings or cumbersome legal papers are totally avoided as all transactions are processed and stored on the blockchain. Lease Renewals are also handled automatically, provided the lessee and lessor agree to the updated terms. The Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) is another way PropiChain will enhance the RWA sector. This system will ensure only actual and current property costs are quoted. The AVMs get accurate information from past and present sources to calculate a fair price for sellers and buyers. Accurate market analysis is another feature investors will enjoy when they join PropiChain . The AI will evaluate all industry statistics to give current appraisals of various assets. That’s not all; the PropiChain Artificial Intelligence can also predict possible changes in price and demand for assets to aid your investment decisions. The international market will also be accessible as PropiChain decentralized marketplace will also integrate Metaverse to simplify transactions and other real estate-related operations You can have your meetings with foreign sellers and buyers through the Metaverse interactive platform, saving the stress and cost of holding physical meetings. This advanced technology will also introduce virtual asset touring, which makes asset inspection simpler and more cost-effective. The 3D representation beats what pictures and videos can offer. Meanwhile, investors can conduct virtual staging where they furnish the property virtually to know what furniture to get. Navigation and operations are aided by AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools help investors have smooth sessions on the PropiChain marketplace with a 24/7 support system. For example, a virtual assistant can explain a complex legal term for PropiChain decentralized platform to new or existing users. With these incredible features, it is only normal for smart traders to rush PCHAIN’s presale. Because investment now is an easy gateway to NetGen real estate. The Market Advantage of PropiChain Over Shiba Inu Utility: Unlike Shiba Inu, PropiChain aims to offer unique real-world solutions that will make it a force to reckon with. Controlled Tokenomics: PCHAIN’s controlled tokenomics and limited supply will enable sustainable long-term growth. Early Mover Advantage: Shiba Inu losses more than 40% in the past year. However, investors that joined PCHAIN from its first phase of token presale are already in profit by more than 160%. If you join now, you will be in profit by more than 100% when the third phase starts. High growth Potential: Analysts have forecasted that PCHAIN could deliver more than more than 47471% by Q2 of 2025. This means an investment of $1000 in this round of its token presale could yield more than $470,000 for early investors. Is PCHAIN Credible and Legitimate? It is essential to invest in a project that can assure the protection of investors’ assets from fraudulent or any form of hack. PCHAIN has proven to be that project and the BlockAudit review on PropiChain showed that the project is highly committed to protecting users’ investment. This furthers investors’ confidence in the project. In its early stage, PropiChain got listed on CoinMarketCap and this increased the project’s recognition among Investors. Also, the listing shows that PCHAIN is a credible project that aims to earn a position among established projects in the world. Conclusion Experts believe PCHAIN’s token presale could be the best in 2025. More than $3 million has been raised from PropiChain’s token presale. This signifies the high confidence investors have in the token presale. As a result of the buzz surrounding PropiChain and the early success of its presale, investors are heavily rotating into it. Therefore, now is the best time to join as it could potentially replicate the early surge in price of many established projects.

Analysts Say This Altcoin Could Outpace the Market,https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025-analysts-say-this-altcoin-could/,"The crypto market is changing, and investors are looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025. While traditional assets have delivered steady gains, many are now shifting focus to disruptive altcoins that promise explosive growth. Leading analysts are spotlighting PropiChain as an asset set to outpace the market. And many have speculated that it could be the best crypto to buy at a time like this, and this article discusses why. The Competition: Market Leaders Under Pressure Projects with big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the crypto space. However, these giants are now matured, limiting their upside potential. Many investors feel that the future lies with emerging altcoins that offer real-world utility. Top performing altcoins and tokens in the crypto market are ones with real world use cases. That is where Propichain comes in, establishing its presence in the real estate niche, one of the most lucrative industries. PropiChain: A Game-Changing Altcoin for 2025 PropiChain is becoming the revolutionary altcoin that will redefine property investments. Many experts already proclaimed it as the best crypto to buy. It uses AI to conduct market prediction and analysis, offering real-time insights into trends, property values, and investment opportunities. For example, if an investor repeatedly shows interest in certain neighborhoods, the AI will prioritize similar listings, property, or similar areas, ensuring a customized, user-centered, and dynamic approach. PropiChain transforms high-value real estate into fractional, tradable tokens. This real estate tokenization means that an investor could own a portion of a $10 million property with just a modest investment. You can put in as little as $500 and gain exposure to premium assets that traditionally required millions in capital. This breakthrough opens the door to passive income through rental yields and appreciation. Beyond AI and tokenization, PropiChain’s metaverse integration redefines property interactions. In a virtual environment, users can explore properties via virtual tours and attend global meetings with buyers and sellers. And even more, it transforms marketing strategies for real estate agencies and enhances investor confidence by offering an engaging, interactive experience. PropiChain elevates the user experience by also integrating AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants that provide 24/7 real-time support throughout the entire real estate transaction process. These smart tools simplify interactions by guiding both new and seasoned investors through property searches, using personalized criteria such as location, price range, and property type. In addition, the virtual assistants break down complex legal contracts and financial terms by breaking down intricate language into simple, easily-understandable explanations, empowering users to make decisions with confidence while reducing the anxiety associated with legal and financial paperwork. Presale Opportunity: Unprecedented Early Gains PropiChain is currently in its presale phase, offering early investors an exceptional entry point. The token is priced at just $0.011 in Stage 2 before transitioning to Stage 3, where the price is expected to rise to $0.023. This doubling alone presents a significant opportunity, and with a potential forecast of over 50,000% upside, a $1,000 investment could potentially yield millions. This is an opportunity that should not pass any investor by, as securing PropiChain at this early stage might translate into explosive gains once the market recognizes its disruptive potential. Security and Market Credibility Security is a top priority for any crypto investment. PropiChain has undergone a thorough security audit by BlockAudit , ensuring its smart contracts are robust and transparent. This audit provides both investors and users with the confidence that their assets are protected. Moreover, PropiChain is already listed on CoinMarketCap , enhancing its market credibility and visibility. This prominent listing reassures investors that PropiChain is a secure and established asset in a rapidly growing market. Is PropiChain the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025? As the search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 intensifies, PropiChain stands out with its groundbreaking fusion of AI, real estate tokenization, and metaverse integration. With its presale price at $0.011 in Stage 2, set to jump to $0.023 in Stage 3, the potential for explosive gains is enormous. Imagine turning a $1,000 investment into a fortune as PropiChain surges ahead, potentially delivering returns that could redefine your financial future. The market is shifting, and the time to invest is now. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of a revolutionary project that could outpace traditional assets and change the landscape of crypto investing.

Crypto Analyst Identifies Pattern For Bullish Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/aave/aave-price-to-360-crypto-analyst-identifies-pattern/,"Despite the recent positive momentum in the market, the AAVE price seems to be back under bearish pressure over the past day. As a result of the dwindling sentiment, the price of AAVE has dropped beneath the psychological $200 level in the last 24 hours. However, a prominent crypto analyst on social media platform X has suggested that the DeFi token won’t be down for long. According to the crypto pundit, the AAVE price could begin a new bullish rally, with its sights on the $360 mark. AAVE Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts 80% Surge Popular crypto trader Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share a video, explaining AAVE’s potential path to return to its former price highs in the current cycle. This optimistic prediction is based on a developing “broadening formation” on a medium-term timeframe of the AAVE price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds For context, a broadening formation is a price pattern in technical analysis characterized by two diverging trendlines; a rising upper trendline (connecting a series of higher highs) and a falling lower trendline (connecting lower lows). This pattern is often associated with a period of increasing price volatility (or significant price action). Typically, broadening patterns are bearish chart formations for most asset prices, as they are often correlated with rising volatility without a clear indication of the next direction. However, the current formation appears to be bullish and could prove a pivotal turning point for the AAVE price. According to Martinez, the DeFi coin looks primed for a bullish break out of the developing broadening pattern. However, the AAVE price would need to breach the crucial resistance level of around $250 before this bullish breakout can be confirmed. If AAVE successfully closes above this $250 resistance zone, investors could see its price travel to as high as $360 over the next few weeks. This would represent an over 80% surge from the current price point. Can Whales Push AAVE To $250? As of this writing, the price of AAVE is hovering around the $200 mark, reflecting an over 6% decline in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the AAVE price is up by 4.3% on the weekly timeframe. While the DeFi coin is far away from the critical $250 mark, the appropriate positive catalysts might be all it needs to cross this level in a few days. One such catalyst that could prove crucial is the rising activity of AAVE whales in recent days. Data from Santiment shows that the AAVE token saw the largest increase in the amount of $100,000 whale transactions over the past week. The number of these large transactions skyrocketed by more than 267% in the highlighted period.

The drop, which slashed his $400 billion net worth by 45%, comes as the company struggles with declining sales in, a shrinking customer base, and political backlash in every single market out there. Now Tesla’s stock has been falling for months, but the latest crash has intensified concerns. The company reported declining vehicle sales worldwide in its latest earnings report, with deliveries down 1% last year—its first drop in over a decade—despite the EV market growing by 25%. In America, Tesla sales fell 7% in 2023 and continued dropping another 2% in early 2024, according to Wards Intelligence. In Germany, Tesla registrations collapsed 76.3% in February. France saw a 26% decline. Over in China, Tesla’s deliveries plunged 49% from last year to 30,688 cars in February, per Tesla’s own data. Elon Musk with “best buddy” president Donald Trump at SpaceX’s mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight from Starbase. Source: AP, File/Brandon Bell Tesla’s stock soared after Trump won the 2024 election, fueled by expectations that Elon’s influence would bring business-friendly policies. Investors also bet on Tesla’s AI and robotics projects, including the 2026 launch of its first fully self-driving car. But Tesla’s stock has since dropped 35%, wiping out most of those gains. Former Tesla enthusiasts are also abandoning the brand. Bob Eckert, a longtime Tesla fan, said he started questioning his decision to own a Model Y after Elon aligned himself with Trump. “As the days and weeks went on, we realized it was not something we could afford to support, even if we lost money,” he said. He sold the car in February, losing $3,000 in the process but replacing it with a Ford Mustang Mach-E. Ford even offered him 0% financing and a $1,000 cash bonus for switching from Tesla. For some, Elon’s politics were the final straw. Larry Boughton, a 76-year-old retired mortgage banker from Houston, said he canceled his reservations for two Cybertrucks in January. “As soon as he started doing all this stuff that Trump wanted him to do, I didn’t want to be a part of it,” he said. “I actually own some Tesla stock, and I’m thinking of selling that as well.” Customers are walking away from Tesla Elon has become a liability, and the shareholders are not happy with him. His political endorsements and controversial personal life are pushing buyers away. He literally backed Germany’s horrendous far-right AfD party publicly, then did what many in the world see as a Nazi salute. As if those weren’t bad enough, he was exposed for having yet another baby mama, who is not only already married, but also leaked their private messages that do not paint Elon in the most respectful of lights. The last straw for Tesla shareholders though was when his ex-girlfriend and mother of his three children Grimes publicly pleaded with him on X to please reach out to her about their sick child. Elon ignored her, which only harmed his reputation even more. Grimes begs for Elon Musk’s attention amid child’s medical crisis. Source: X You can’t claim to belong in the conservative party that lauds family values over anything, and then be estranged from all your baby mamas and children. Now most Tesla stock owners see Elon as nothing but a loser. Back in 2022, 22% of car buyers said they would consider Tesla. By mid-2023, that dropped to 7%, according to Strategic Vision, whose president, Alexander Edwards, said, “At this point, we don’t see any signs of recovery.” Some customers say it’s not even just about the cars anymore. Garth Ancier, a TV executive from Los Angeles, recalled a conversation with other Tesla owners about how driving a Tesla feels like “driving a big red MAGA hat”. That was over a year ago. Now, he’s trying to sell his Model X. “If not for his behavior, I’d probably stick with a Tesla,” he reportedly told WSJ. Protests have started popping up at Tesla showrooms in the US and Europe after Elon called for mass firings of federal workers and backed a far-right German party. Tesla’s Supercharger stations have even been vandalized, with spray-painted swastikas appearing in multiple locations. Protesters gathered earlier this month outside a Tesla showroom in New York. Source: Wall Street Journal Elon continues to alienate Tesla’s customer base Tesla has always had a strong customer base, but political tensions are shifting the brand’s appeal. Republicans are now more likely to buy a Tesla than Democrats, flipping the company’s long-standing demographic trend. Survey data from Morning Consult shows that 23% of Democrats were interested in buying a Tesla in August 2023, but as of February 2024, that number has dropped to 13%.Meanwhile, Republican interest jumped from 15% to 26% in the same period, per the survey. Meanwhile, 63% of those surveyed in December 2023 said they wouldn’t even consider a Tesla, up 10 percentage points from earlier in the year. The survey data also shows that sales collapsed in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Dallas—key cities for Tesla’s early success—but increased in Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and Miami-Ft. Lauderdale. Even inside Tesla, employees are questioning Elon’s leadership. Jared Ottmann, a supply-chain engineer, said in a LinkedIn post that he had raised concerns about Elon’s political direction “multiple times” with managers, HR, legal compliance, and investor relations. “The silence from Tesla is deafening,” he wrote. Shortly after, he was fired. Others are also speaking out. Thomas Temme, a senior software engineer in Germany, said Elon’s political shift is undermining Tesla’s mission. “Elon now supports political actors who not only don’t care about the mission but who proactively deny climate change and have a history of fighting everything Tesla stands for,” he also told WSJ. Tesla’s Berlin factory becomes ground zero for controversy Tensions escalated some more when Elon was caught on video during that Nazi salute I was just telling you about. He hasn’t commented directly on the incident but dismissed critics by saying, “The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” Elon Musk’s alleged Nazi salute. Source: Elon Musk X/Twitter Activists quickly projected an image of Elon making the gesture onto Tesla’s Berlin factory, with the word “heil” next to it. Meanwhile, Tesla owners in the US started finding flyers on their cars urging them to sell. Police in Arcata, California, reported at least four Tesla drivers receiving threatening messages on their windshields. Employees inside Tesla’s Palo Alto engineering office are reportedly worried about the impact of Elon’s behavior on hiring and recruitment, according to WSJ. Anil Patel, an engineer at Tesla for more than four years, left the company in December 2023. His resignation email read: “Elon’s company leadership and political actions are the biggest reasons I’m leaving Tesla.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

But there’s a whole new wave of cryptos that are shaking things up, and you’ve probably heard of Near Protocol. However, if you blinked, you might’ve missed its prime moment. While Near Protocol had a lot of potential early on, it’s clear that its momentum has slowed. That’s where Qubetics comes in. If you’re still on the hunt for the most popular cryptocurrency in 2025, Qubetics is here, and it’s not just any project—it’s positioned for some major significant returns. Qubetics is solving real-world problems in a way that Near Protocol couldn’t keep up with. As cryptos like Near Protocol start to lose their edge, Qubetics is proving it’s got what it takes to lead the charge with a real-world asset tokenization marketplace and a non-custodial multi-chain wallet that will make crypto easier and more accessible to the masses. With Qubetics’ presale in full swing and analysts predicting impressive returns, this is the top crypto to buy if you want to make some serious moves in 2025. It’s your chance to get in early on a coin that’s still in its prime. Qubetics: The Most Popular Cryptocurrency to Buy in 2025 Here’s the thing about Qubetics—it’s not just another coin. It’s the top crypto to buy in 2025 because it’s tackling real-world problems that have plagued earlier projects, including Near Protocol. One of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics is its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, which addresses a critical gap in the crypto space: ease of use and security. A Seamless Multi-Chain Wallet Whether you’re a crypto newbie or a pro, the Qubetics wallet simplifies managing assets across multiple blockchains. From Bitcoin and Ethereum to lesser-known altcoins, it offers a smooth, user-friendly experience—no more juggling multiple platforms. Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics’ tokenization marketplace is a game-changer. Businesses, professionals, and individuals can tokenize assets like real estate, fine art, and intellectual property, unlocking new financial opportunities. Imagine selling fractional shares of real estate or artwork globally—Qubetics makes it possible. Qubetics Presale & Price Predictions Currently in its 24th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 497 million tokens, raising $14.7 million. Analysts predict TICS could hit $1 post-presale and surge to $10–$15 after the mainnet launch. At just $0.0976 per token, this opportunity won’t last long. Near Protocol: A Missed Opportunity in 2025 If you had your eye on Near Protocol a while ago, you might’ve been intrigued by its promise of scalability and speed. It was quickly touted as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to watch. But, let’s be real—it’s been a rough road for Near Protocol. While it solved some of the biggest issues Ethereum faced, like high gas fees and slow transaction speeds, it failed to keep up with the wave of new technologies and projects that are reshaping the landscape in 2025. For a while, Near Protocol’s innovative technology gave it a leg up, but the crypto market has evolved. Other coins have stepped in with more robust solutions and real-world applications that Near Protocol simply doesn’t have. Projects like Qubetics are taking the lessons learned from Near Protocol and evolving them further. Near Protocol just can’t compete with Qubetics’ ability to integrate asset tokenization and provide a multi-chain experience in the way Qubetics does.

Crypto.news interviewed top women executives at blockchain and crypto firms to gather their insights, to unpack the recent developments with these leaders. Table of Contents Rachel Conlan, Global CMO, Binance Chrissy Hill, Chief Counsel/Interim COO, Parity Technologies Kyla Curley, Certified Cryptocurrency Forensic Investigator and Partner, StoneTurn Agne Linge, Head of Growth, WeFi Rachel Conlan, Global CMO, Binance Rachel Conlan opens with comments on Binance’s growth trajectory, fueled by increasing crypto adoption and institutional interest in the U.S. Conlan says that in Latin America alone, Binance recorded a 116% surge in crypto adoption in 2024 and reached 55 million users. 95% of these users plan to expand their holdings in 2025 as Binance surpasses 250 million registered users. With a mission of onboarding 1 billion users, the cryptocurrency exchange maintains optimism, expecting positive regulatory shifts and further institutional adoption in the U.S. Conlan said in the interview: “U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has reignited global interest, potentially acting as a catalyst for increased adoption and regulatory clarity. With the approval of Bitcoin ETFs boosting investor confidence, Binance is poised to support the growing interest in the market, reinforcing its role as a preferred platform for both retail and institutional users.” Discussing the ongoing Bitcoin price cycle’s top narrative, memecoins, Conlan says: “Memecoins have definitely lowered the barrier to entry for new participants in crypto trading, attracting and engaging a diverse audience with their viral and trendy appeal and community-driven narratives. While some memecoins may fade with market cycles, the industry has progressed beyond a mere trend.” The CMO highlights how few memecoin projects have expanded their ecosystems and offered features like staking and decentralized exchanges, signifying a shift toward sustainability. Along with growing institutional interest, they could soon be recognized as a legitimate asset class, according to Conlan. “Memecoins may continue to play an important role in the crypto ecosystem, functioning as both an entry point for new investors and a driving force for greater crypto adoption.” When asked about ETF approvals in 2025 and whether traders should prepare for Dogecoin, Cardano, XRP, Solana ETFs being approved in H1 this year, Conlan said that the industry remains optimistic. “With increasing institutional interest and regulatory clarity, the industry is optimistic about the expansion of ETF offerings to include other major digital assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA). These potential ETF approvals would mark a significant step in the broader institutionalization of crypto, bringing increased liquidity and legitimacy to these assets. However, approvals may depend on evolving SEC policies and market conditions.” Binance’s CMO believes that Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve, and related executive orders have sparked meaningful discussions about the role of digital assets in the future of finance. She further mentions that the initiative reflects growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as a strategic asset class, highlighting the need for the U.S. to remain at the forefront of innovation in blockchain technology. “While the proposal to build a Strategic Crypto Reserve faces important discussions in Congress, we hope to see constructive dialogue between policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders. Constructive collaboration can help shape a framework that ensures security, stability, and economic benefits for all. As global interest in digital assets continues to rise, countries are exploring regulatory approaches that best suit their markets. We look forward to policies that support technological innovation while balancing market needs and compliance requirements, fostering a more stable and healthy environment for the entire industry,” she said. Adding to her thoughts on the Strategic Crypto Reserve, Rachel told Crypto.news: “If implemented, such an initiative could lead to increased institutional and retail participation, further cementing crypto’s role as a mainstream financial asset. Binance is prepared to support this evolution by ensuring liquidity, security, and accessibility for traders globally. This will represent a pivotal moment for the industry, and Binance looks forward to contributing its expertise and experience in driving crypto adoption forward. A clear regulatory path, government engagement, and increased institutional confidence will play a crucial role in shaping the future of digital assets and Binance is ready to support this transformation at a global scale.” You might also like: Jake Chervinsky: SBR and stockpile “not enough” to make U.S. crypto capital of the world Chrissy Hill, Chief Counsel/Interim COO, Parity Technologies Crypto.news interviewed Chrissy Hill of Parity.io, a core blockchain infrastructure company known for creating Polkadot. Hill shed light on the groundbreaking White House Crypto Summit event, the regulatory landscape in the U.S., Polkadot’s initiatives and what to make of the rising institutional adoption of crypto. Hill considers Trump’s White House Crypto Summit to be “the highest level of political support for the crypto industry.” Commenting on the Strategic Crypto Reserve, Hill explains how centralization vs. decentralization play a key role in token selection and that the announcement has acted as a “Geopolitical driver.” Hill is quoted as saying: “The U.S. is positioning itself as a forward-thinking leader in digital world, and the initial token selection (e.g., Cardano, Solana) reflects the “Made in USA” concept. The discussion remains open for other tokens to join the strategic reserve.” When asked about the upcoming SEC crypto roundtable and the financial regulator’s shifting stance on litigation against crypto firms and exchanges, Hill stresses the importance of all three branches, the executive, legislative and judicial, in shaping crypto policy. “The timeline for crypto legislation (e.g., Genius Act, Fit 21) has been pushed back to year-end. There is a critical need for educating policymakers on digital assets fundamentals and the Polkadot Blockchain Academy is running a UK pilot in April, with plans to expand globally.” Commenting on SEC guidance on memecoins, Parity’s Chief Counsel explains that it provides clarity but doesn’t address the speculative nature of the tokens. Hill recommends traders do their own research before investing in memecoins. Hill concludes the interview with Polkadot’s technology and roadmap for 2025, stating that, “the focus is on a multi-chain world, interoperability, scalability, and security. The project’s long-term approach emphasizes innovation and Web3 principles, with an aim to attract diverse stakeholders: builders, users, institutions, and governments.” Hill is confident that altcoins have the potential to see similar interest as institutions have shown in Bitcoin treasury holdings and ETF investments. Parity’s interim COO identifies Trump administration’s crypto-friendly appointments (e.g., Jonathan Gould to OCC) as the foundation to potentially setting global benchmarks in other jurisdictions like the EU, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, that are reviewing crypto regulations.” Chrissy advises women in crypto to embrace curiosity and open-mindedness in exploring new areas. She quotes Sun Tzu in her chat with Crypto.news and says, “Opportunities multiply as you seize them – Sun Tzu.” Hill encourages women to recognize that the digital world (blockchain, AI, robotics, IoT) offers numerous opportunities and not be afraid to enter new spaces, as everyone is starting from a similar point. You might also like: David Sacks downplays Trump’s altcoin mention after Bitcoin reserve EO Kyla Curley, Certified Cryptocurrency Forensic Investigator and Partner, StoneTurn Kyla Curley, a leader in crypto forensic investigation, has over two decades of experience in financial investigations and business litigation. Curley discussed expectations from the upcoming SEC crypto roundtable, crypto regulation in the U.S., memecoins and institutional interest in crypto with Crypto.news. Curley doesn’t expect a significant downturn in litigation against crypto firms, even as the SEC warms up to exchanges and drops lawsuits. She said, “There is no doubt that the Trump Administration, and the SEC as an extension, has rolled out the welcome mat to the crypto industry from day one. The Administration has hit the pause button on certain enforcement actions and policies, but the bottom line is this: fraud is not good for business, and the industry wants to work with The Administration to ensure the business-side thrives. So, of course the SEC is going to support and encourage innovation so crypto can take the next step in their maturity in the financial world, but I don’t think there is going to be a significant downturn in litigation, if potential enforcement is merited. At the end of the day, U.S. consumer and investor demand for crypto is driven in large part by confidence in the security of the market. An inadequately regulated market with few guardrails will drive consumers and investors to send their money to safer, more regulated markets.” Sharing her thoughts on the pace of crypto regulation and litigation by the U.S. financial regulator, the StoneTurn partner says, “The prior SEC Chair undertook a “regulation by enforcement” stance, which may have been intended to install guardrails around the industry, but led to a spike in litigation and ultimately drove some of the crypto investment out of the U.S. The Trump Administration is telling us they are looking to find a middle ground and find that balance in crypto regulation. We’ve already seen action here through SEC guidance in January, Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 122, which broke down one of the greatest barriers to widespread adoption of crypto and other digital assets. SAB 122 repealed a widely unpopular reporting requirement contained in SAB 121 which placed significant and largely infeasible requirements on any financial institution wanting to custody digital assets for their customers.” Curley sees no intrinsic value in memecoins, guiding traders on the topic of meme tokens and the recent SEC guidance, the executive said: “Generally speaking, memecoins have no intrinsic value, so those launching projects should be aware that they are entering a space that is highly sensitive to any change in public perception and therefore more susceptible to potential market manipulation. A single social media post can impact the price, and the greater the audience, the greater the impact on the token.” As traditional financial institutions warm up to crypto, Curley says, “As I said before, business doesn’t like fraud. I think the traditional financial “gatekeepers” realize the inherent value of the industry, but they were always weary of the prevalence of “bad” business. As long as there is a balance between innovation and regulation, larger financial institutions will likely deepen their relationship with crypto in 2025 and beyond.” Agne Linge, Head of Growth, WeFi Linge observes the volatility in the crypto market and comments on the sentiment and unmet expectations of traders when referring to the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. Linge tells Crypto.news, “The tariff and trade war has continued to create headwinds for the US stock market and, by extension, risk assets like Bitcoin. Despite President Trump’s postponement of the tariff on Mexico, investors still considered the market too risky to bet on. The subpar strategic Bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market. With the Executive Order directing agencies to consolidate seized Bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new BTC purchase was announced.” Linge highlights how, despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the Bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of BTC through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. She explains, “The available options in this regard include Bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the Bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves. Pricing in the long term prospect is hard for now, and in the short term, investors are focused on the non-farm payroll report. This report will serve as a major insight into the Federal Reserve’s next monetary actions, which can go a long way in pacifying investors.” Linge is no outsider to the crypto market and has navigated previous cycles where the market faced intense volatility. The recent surge in crypto liquidations and Bitcoin flash crash highlighted the market’s uncertainty, she remarks. “Amid this price action, the conviction for sustainable growth in the near term remains low as significant headwinds lie ahead. Despite the market’s long-term prospects, the headwinds from the events of the week, the tariff announcements, Crypto Summit and the FTX repayment scheduled cannot be ignored and may trigger more volatility in the coming days,” she says.

From explosive launches to viral narratives, these digital assets continue to capture the imagination of investors hunting for the next big thing. Among them, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making headlines with its thrilling adventure-based presale, while Pepe and Bonk are also stirring up excitement with their latest developments. Arctic Pablo Coin has just entered its 13th phase, ChillVille, with its presale price now at $0.00007, promising a staggering 11,285.71% ROI from this stage to its listing price of $0.008. Meanwhile, Pepe is making waves with its latest exchange listing, and Bonk is attracting attention with its increasing trading volume. This article will cover the latest updates and breakthroughs of Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK)—three of the top meme coins with 1000X potential. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Explosive Token Burn: Boosting Scarcity & Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has implemented an aggressive token burn mechanism, ensuring a deflationary supply and long-term value appreciation. Every week, unsold tokens from the presale are permanently removed from circulation, reducing overall supply and increasing scarcity. This strategic burn system continues even after the presale, eliminating any leftover tokens and creating a controlled economic model. With each burn event recorded transparently on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), investors can verify the token reduction, reinforcing trust and stability within the community. By consistently decreasing the available supply, APC positions itself as one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. This structured approach not only enhances price stability but also fosters long-term sustainability. With fewer tokens available as the presale progresses, demand naturally increases, driving up APC’s value. The project’s commitment to continuous burns ensures that early investors reap significant benefits as the circulating supply shrinks. This deflationary model makes APC an enticing investment, especially with its rapid growth in the crypto market. Arctic Pablo Coin Reaches ChillVille: Prices Surge at $0.00007! Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) has entered its 13th phase, ChillVille, continuing its high-speed journey through various locations. After wrapping up its expedition in Penguinopolis in under six days, the presale has already surged past $1.78 million in total raised funds. This rapid progression highlights the immense demand for APC, as each phase sells out faster than expected. At its current price of just $0.00007, early investors are locking in an incredible ROI of 11,285.71% compared to the listing price of $0.008. The excitement surrounding Arctic Pablo’s journey is at an all-time high, as investors rush to secure their tokens before the next price jump. With each new location, Arctic Pablo Coin becomes more valuable, and ChillVille is no exception. As the presale nears its final destination, the opportunity to buy at a low entry price is disappearing fast. Given the exponential price increases with every phase, waiting too long could mean missing out on the next big meme coin presale . The limited supply and continuous burns only add to the scarcity, making now the perfect time to join Arctic Pablo Coin before it advances to its next thrilling stage. Pepe Coin Gains Momentum with Latest Developments Pepe Coin has recently experienced a resurgence in investor interest, following major ecosystem upgrades and increased trading volume. With new DeFi integrations, Pepe Coin is expanding its utility beyond just being a meme coin. These advancements have led to heightened on-chain activity, bringing renewed confidence among holders. Additionally, a significant uptick in whale accumulation has fueled bullish momentum, with analysts predicting further price surges in the coming weeks. This steady growth highlights Pepe Coin’s ability to remain relevant in the ever-competitive meme coin space. Beyond technical upgrades, the Pepe community remains a driving force behind its success. Social media platforms are buzzing with discussions about Pepe’s future, with many expecting it to break past key resistance levels. As one of the most recognizable meme coins, its strong branding and continuous updates make it a contender for long-term growth. With renewed enthusiasm and strategic developments, Pepe Coin is proving its staying power in the meme coin sector. Bonk’s Ecosystem Expansion: Paving the Way for Growth Bonk has been making waves with its recent ecosystem expansions, solidifying its place as one of the top-performing meme coins. The project’s latest developments include increased integration with major DeFi protocols, allowing users to stake and earn rewards. This move has attracted a surge of new investors, contributing to Bonk’s growing market capitalization. Additionally, strategic partnerships with NFT projects have further bolstered Bonk’s appeal, making it more than just a meme coin. These innovations are positioning Bonk for sustained growth in the crypto market. Furthermore, Bonk’s trading volume has spiked significantly, reflecting heightened interest from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts believe that this increasing momentum could lead to a new price breakout in the coming weeks. With an expanding ecosystem and a dedicated community, Bonk continues to show strong bullish potential. As the meme coin trend gains traction, Bonk’s ability to evolve and adapt sets it apart from other contenders in the space. Final Thoughts: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out With meme coins surging in popularity, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Pepe, and Bonk are leading the charge. While Pepe and Bonk continue to expand their ecosystems and drive investor interest, Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique presale structure and deflationary tokenomics make it an unparalleled opportunity. Its aggressive token burn strategy and rapid presale progression add to its growing appeal. The 13th phase, ChillVille, offers investors a rare chance to enter at a low price of $0.00007 before the price surges further. With a staggering 11,285.71% potential ROI, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. Don’t miss out—this meme coin presale won’t last forever!

41353015,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689638,1741477953,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41353015.jpeg,Trump transforms crypto from ‘oppressed industry’ to ‘centerpiece’ of US economic strategy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-changes-crypto-from-oppressed-industry/,"According to Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, President Donald Trump has embraced cryptocurrency as a core component of his economic strategy, representing a huge shift in U.S. blockchain policy. On March 7, Trump wooed the cryptocurrency industry’s elite at the White House, hosting a first-of-its-kind summit focused on his plans for a government-owned stockpile of digital assets. He welcomed a wide range of industry players to the event. The summit marked a “truly historic day at the White House,” Marszalek said in a March 8 X post . Trump’s crypto policies spark regulatory shifts and industry optimism Marszalek lauded Trump for reversing the policies (Operation Chokepoint 2.0) that he claimed resulted in crypto and tech companies being denied banking services during the Biden administration. Crypto firms may be on the verge of securing banking partners after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) softened its stance on banks engaging with crypto. The move came just hours after Trump promised to end a long-running crackdown that restricted the industry from financial services. During the summit, President Trump announced the establishment of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a cache of Bitcoin acquired primarily through legal asset seizures. The move has helped “normalize” Bitcoin as an instrument in the overall U.S. financial and monetary system. A “Digital Asset Stockpile” was also established to process other cryptocurrencies acquired through similar means. The administration’s boldness has given new momentum to legislative attempts on Capitol Hill. Two pieces of legislation are literally connected: the Stablecoin Bill and the Market Structure Bill. All these bills provide recommendations on establishing holistic frameworks to regulate digital assets to achieve regulatory clarity that encourages innovation while protecting investors. Kris Marszalek, the CEO of Crypto.com, said the industry was optimistic that “thoughtful conversations” with the relevant regulators—the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—would continue. Trump’s team lays the groundwork for U.S. Bitcoin integration David Sacks, the administration’s “crypto czar,” along with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, were praised for setting the country’s crypto policy. Marszalek’s remarks follow Trump’s signing of an executive order on March 7, outlining a plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency seized in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin through market purchases. While no direct BTC acquisitions were announced, the order stated that the U.S. Treasury and Commerce secretaries could explore “budget-neutral strategies” to expand the reserve—provided these strategies do not impose additional costs on American taxpayers. Some analysts view the U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan as the first significant step toward Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system. “The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” said Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained. Though Trump has expressed his commitment to advancing crypto innovation in the U.S., implementing regulatory frameworks takes time, and establishing the “right regulatory tone” will be essential for his administration, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum, a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

While responding to the White House official X account promoting Bitcoin, he revealed this on his X account. The Samson Mow Prediction and Rationale According to Samson, Bitcoin will reach $1 million much faster than expected. In the past, Mow has popularized the idea that he projects the token’s $1 million milestone by 2031. However, he is changing his position now, as President Donald Trump’s executive orders are rapidly evolving the US crypto ecosystem. Speaking on the above, Mow pointed to increased government backing as a major factor. He stated that the conditions for a price surge are aligning with the White House’s current pro-crypto and Bitcoin stance. Meanwhile, an X user reacted to Mow’s comments that $1 million by 2031 is conservative. Still, Mow believes that the rate at which everything is happening is fast, which might bring BTC’s price closer to the mark soon. White House Influence on Bitcoin and Regulation It is worth mentioning that one major factor pushing the current Bitcoin optimism is the recent support from the White House. For context, at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit , President Donald Trump declared his commitment to making the U.S. a global leader in cryptocurrency. Once things are certain in the global cryptocurrency community, America will become more welcoming to crypto businesses and Web3 entities. This is unlike the previous administration, which was more restrictive in its approach to managing digital assets. During the Crypto Summit, industry leaders praised Trump for reversing regulatory crackdowns on crypto firms. The SEC has since closed several legal actions against major crypto firms, proof of its enforcement pivot. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This means the U.S. government will HODL its Bitcoin holdings instead of selling them. The order also allow the Treasury Department to explore ways to acquire more Bitcoin, which was considered a sign of the government’s long-term commitment to the asset. Current Bitcoin Outlook and Key Catalyst Since the beginning of the month, BTC’s price has hovered between $80,000 and $90,000, despite the increasing demand from institutional investors. With adoption, especially through spot Bitcoin ETFs, growing globally, more businesses and nations are warming up to BTC. This is why market experts like Samson Mow believe the U.S. government’s latest position could encourage other countries to follow the trend. If achieved, this could further accelerate Bitcoin’s growth. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price was changing hands for $85,093, down by 0.69% in 24 hours.

Remittix Blasts Past the Competition With Unique PayFi Offering,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/dogecoin-price-prediction-is-070-on-the-cards-for-doge-remittix-blasts-past-the-competition-with-unique-payfi-offering,"The cryptocurrency space has recently become interested in Dogecoin after whale addresses demonstrated increased attention toward the world’s most famous meme coin. People are discussing a potential price increase for DOGE but doubt rises because it struggles to maintain support levels. The market displays erratic behavior through both its positive and negative signals since positive signs disappear quickly. However, not everyone is betting on meme coins. A new challenger, offering a streamlined method of making everyday transactions, is stepping into the limelight. Remittix, a PayFi-focused project—poised to transform cross-border settlements—could capture the momentum if Dogecoin stalls short of its goals. Dogecoin’s Whale Moves and Exchange Withdrawals Recently, analysts noted that big investors purchased 150 million DOGE at the edge of a strong support level. Others have interpreted the same as confidence in the asset even though the price continues to oscillate in a confined price range. Dogecoin is oscillating around the $0.19 mark, noting a subtle dip in value but confirming a 50% spike in trading volume. Support around $0.185 has so far held, but DOGE must break out above $0.21 on the daily chart if it is to stand a chance of hitting $0.25. Technicals appear split, with the Relative Strength Index at the mid-30s, a sign that momentum is still lacking. Holders' withdrawal of $43 million worth of DOGE is also quizzing analysts since they choose to hold their coins outside exchange platforms instead of selling them. Multiple indicators present a mixture of positive indicators that suggest optimism control exists, yet achieving $0.70 dollar price level demands a complete return of bullish market conditions. DOGE/USDT Source: Tradingview Remittix Blasts Past the Competition With Unique PayFi Offering While Dogecoin’s fate hinges on investor mood, Remittix is catching eyes with its practical vision for crypto payments. Priced at $0.0694, Remittix has raised over $13.7 million in its presale and sold over 516 million tokens—a milestone that sets it apart from purely speculative projects. With its unique twist on PayFi, Remittix addresses common crypto-to-fiat conversion issues by developing efficient cross-border solutions for business and personal transactions. For example, a specialty coffee exporter who wants to receive digital payments from international distributors usually faces delays with traditional banking. The conventional payment methods function at high cost levels while maintaining slow bank transaction times. Through its real-time settlement provision, Remittix enables businesses to get their local currency even when multiple transactions are traditionally needed. Users support Remittix because they view it as a logical option compared to meme-generated market swings, which they believe real-world solutions will surpass momentarily. The interest levels among investors have surged because they pursue tokens that demonstrate practical use. Remittix enthusiasts believe its adoption rate will shape its price direction more than viral memes or single tweet adoption. The project stands out from its market rivals because small businesses that handle cross-border transactions provide everyday support. Real-World Utility or Meme Coin Hype: Which Comes Out on Top? Dogecoin’s community-driven approach has served it well, but reaching lofty targets like $0.70 may require more than whale buys. Traders want sustained upside volume, decisive breaches of key resistance, and a shift in the RSI that confirms bullish strength. If these conditions don’t align, DOGE may linger near $0.19, unable to capitalize on whale activity. In contrast, a PayFi-focused project can thrive even when memes lose steam. Remittix’s price gains and sizable presale reflect a push for seamless crypto payments, an industry gap that remains largely unfilled. Business owners and freelancers alike need efficient ways to settle funds, and Remittix offers that simplicity—an appealing factor for those seeking stability over hype. Curious about how a payment-centered token could reshape your crypto experience?Take a look at Remittix and discover why practical solutions might leave meme coins in the rearview mirror—even if Dogecoin manages a short-term bounce.

The crypto jungle is a wild ride, but guess what? The real winners are those who snag the next big thing before the hype train goes full speed. This week, you’ve got three heavy hitters: BTFD Coin, rallying an army of Bulls in its insane presale run; Snek, a slithery Cardano-based gem that’s shaking up the ecosystem; and SPX6900, a quirky yet promising contender with innovative tokenomics. But first, here’s the golden ticket: BTFD Coin’s Stage 14 presale is almost sold out, and every token you buy right now is DOUBLED thanks to the LAUNCH100 bonus code. That’s right—twice the gains just for moving fast. Over $6.27 million raised, 71 billion BTFD tokens sold, and only two stages left before this beast hits the open market. BTFD Coin – The Bulls Squad Leading the Meme Coin Charge In the meme coin universe, hype isn’t enough—you need a story, a squad, and a movement. That’s where BTFD Coin stomps in with the Bulls Squad , a powerhouse lineup of mascots who represent every type of investor. Whether you’re a cautious newcomer (Baby Bull), a seasoned crypto warrior (Raging Bull), a numbers-driven strategist (Nerdy Bull), or the ultimate community leader (Peoples Bull), there’s a bull with your name on it. Now, why does this matter? Because community-driven tokens with strong narratives perform best—think Dogecoin, but with an actual financial strategy. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme; it’s a mindset, an identity, and a movement for those who buy the dip and win the game. It’s built for market turbulence, giving traders a haven when volatility strikes. Right now, the crypto market is throwing curveballs, but BTFD investors? They’re charging through the chaos with laser focus. Analysts are already whispering about BTFD Coin skyrocketing to $0.0006 post-launch, and if this bull run gains traction, a moonshot to $0.006 is on the table. That’s a jaw-dropping 3,650% ROI for those smart enough to lock in now at $0.00016 per token. But time’s running out—Stage 14 is closing fast, and once the final two stages wrap up, there’s no rewinding the clock. More Than Just a Meme—It’s Utility Too BTFD Coin isn’t all hype—it’s got staking rewards with 90% APY , a P2E game that rewards players with real tokens, and a community-driven approach that keeps engagement high. But first things first—grab your BTFD tokens now before the LAUNCH100 bonus expires. Double your bag, double your future gains. Go to the Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet – Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter the Bonus Code – Locate the bonus code field, enter LAUNCH100 (in ALL CAPS), and apply it. Enter Purchase Details – Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy. Confirm and Buy – Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Snek – The Cardano Meme Coin That’s Slithering to the Top Not all meme coins live on Ethereum—some thrive on Cardano, and Snek is the king of this ecosystem. Inspired by the snake meme culture that took over Twitter (X), Snek is proving that ADA-based projects can bring massive gains. What makes it stand out? Scarcity. Snek isn’t an inflationary free-for-all like some meme coins. It’s carving a space where community-driven scarcity fuels demand. Plus, it benefits from Cardano’s low fees and fast transactions, making it an easy choice for investors tired of ETH gas wars. Snek’s early backers have already seen triple-digit gains, and with DeFi integrations coming soon, this slithery token might just bite its way into the top new meme coins to invest in this week. SPX6900 – Meme Culture Meets DeFi Innovation Combining token burns, deflationary mechanics, and community rewards, this coin is fusing meme culture with long-term value. Its name is a playful nod to the stock market, but under the hood, it’s bringing serious innovation. The project’s auto-burn mechanism reduces supply over time, meaning early investors might see their holdings gain value just from holding. With a dedicated dev team and a loyal community, SPX6900 is proving that meme coins can be more than just hype—they can be smart investments. Final Thoughts – The Window Is Closing Fast on the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week Meme coin seasons don’t last forever, but those who jump in at the right time come out on top. BTFD Coin is leading the charge, backed by its Bulls Squad, insane presale momentum, and double-token bonus with LAUNCH100. Snek is proving that Cardano meme coins have legs (or scales), and SPX6900 is pushing meme innovation to new heights.

Some early investors generated massive profits, but do these coins still have room to develop, or are they past their prime? With industry trends changing, meme coins continue to be popular, but can they be the best cryptos to buy, or should investors look elsewhere? Shiba Inu Price Could Rise With Shibarium Transactions Up Shiba Inu may see a price push-up as activity on Shibarium increases. The network processed 947 million transactions, and based on data from ShibariumScan, it is on pace to hit 1 billion. This is up from the 500 million milestone attained in November. There are also more wallets on Shibarium, up from 100 million in January to more than 124.5 million, indicating growing adoption. More users mean higher transaction volume, which benefits SHIB’s price. A portion of the network's BONE fees is generated to buy and burn SHIB, reducing its supply over time. Although Shibarium still trails behind more extensive layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base, its growing adoption makes Shiba Inu one of the best cryptos to buy. As Shibariumexpands, SHIB’s value could increase, further solidifying its position among the best cryptos to buy. Dogecoin Whales Make Big Moves Amid Market Fluctuations Dogecoin (DOGE) is attracting significant attention from large investors. Data from Coinglass , a leading crypto analytics firm, reveals that whales have accumulated 150 million DOGE within three days. This large-scale buying spree occurred while DOGE traded near a key support level of $0.185. The move suggests that big investors see the lower prices as an opportunity and expect a future price surge. DOGE is trading at $0.19, and its trading volume has increased by 50%, showing increased market interest. This increase in activity signals that many traders still view Dogecoin as the best crypto to buy now despite short-term price swings. If momentum continues, DOGE could remain among the best cryptos to buy for those betting on meme coin growth. Dogwifhat Surges 21% as Whale Investments Fuel Market Excitement Dogwifhat (WIF) is making waves in the crypto market, surging 21% in just 24 hours. This rally extends a week-long uptrend, pushing WIF’s total gains to over 30%. Despite a broader market downturn, the WIF price increase is happening, highlighting strong investor confidence. Market data shows a 21% increase in open interest, now valued at $252 million, while trading volume has skyrocketed by 188% to $1.44 billion. This surge in whale accumulation often leads to further price growth, making WIF one of the best cryptos to buy now. If the trend continues, WIF could remain among the best cryptos to buy now for investors looking to ride the meme coin wave. Remittix: Best Crypto to Buy for Huge Profit Potentials Remittix (RTX) is changing international payments by connecting cryptocurrencies and conventional fiat banking. This groundbreaking platform allows users to convert over 100 cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and transfer cash into any bank account anywhere. The recipients receive these payments within their FIAT currency without a hint that the payment was set up via cryptocurrency. Remittix (RTX) combines blockchain technology with local payment systems to create a safe and quick worldwide payment solution. This approach improves financial privacy while offering users greater control over their funds without needing needless oversight or third-party interference. Pepe Coin's Potential Surge Amid Growing Investor Interest Pepe Coin (PEPE) has drawn attention recently for its substantial market movements. These days, PEPE trades at approximately $0.000007 per token, with a market cap of more or less $3.01 billion. The 24-hour trading volume is $684.58 million, signaling increased investor activity. Predictions of prices for PEPE are bullish. Forecasts put PEPE for 0.000009 by 2030, an increase of over twenty percent. This optimistic outlook can make PEPE a contender among the best cryptos to buy now. The influx of trading volume and upbeat price forecasts highlight PEPE's rising prominence in the cryptocurrency market. PEPE is probably the best crypto to buy for investors searching for increased growth opportunities. BONK Drops Despite Hype Around ETF Approval BONK has struggled to maintain momentum, and its price is currently around $0.000013. This downturn comes despite growing optimism about the potential approval of a BONKETF. While many expected the ETF speculation to push BONK higher, the token has instead followed the broader meme coin market’s volatility, which some analysts link to recent economic policies, including President Trump’s tariffs. Even with this dip, experts remain hopeful. Analyst Eric Balchunas believes the BONK ETF approval is likely, and if it happens soon, BONK could climb to $0.000031 by May 2025. Join the Remittix Presale Today! Investors have noticed Remittix's potential through its successful presale, which has generated more than $13.6 million. The tokens cost $0.0694, and analysts anticipate significant gains when the platform launches.

Although certain tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain industry mainstays, new projects vie for investor attention with promises of exponential returns. Two such projects, Hedera (HBAR) and Remittix (RTX), have been gaining steam with their respective enterprise adoption and bullish price action, as well as their bid to take over the DeFi landscape with cross-border payments. In this piece, we consider which of the two projects is more likely to be 10x investment by the end of the cycle. Hedera: Taking Aim at a $10 Dream Hedera's recent breakout busted out of a falling wedge pattern established since mid-December, indicating a wider uptrend is in progress. Though a run to $10 is a far-off dream in the future, most analysts view the breakout to establish a near-term target of $0.36—a 50% potential increase from current levels. Technicals are favorable: The RSI re-set at 52 after testing overbought levels, revealing ongoing buyer demand, and the MACD line still slopes higher above its signal line. For the bulls, the large question mark is whether HBAR can overcome overhead resistance, beginning with the 50 Exponential Moving Average (50EMA). The 20EMA has witnessed a few bounce attempts, but the next significant push must clear that 50EMA barrier. If there is sustained buying pressure throughout the weekend, a reversal back toward $0.36 is achievable. Hedera/USDT Daily Chart Breaking above that would set the stage for more forceful returns in 2025, but the likelihood of reaching $10 within a cycle would depend on if and how HBAR is going to make deeper enterprise use cases and maintain hype longer-term. With big players such as IBM, Google, and Boeing becoming part of Hedera's governing council, the project gets legitimized. But to 10x an investment, HBAR must capture retail traders and maintain institutional interest. A steady mix of real partnerships and positive market sentiment might just be the key to making that large $10 vision a reality. Remittix: A DeFi Disruptor Targeting Cross-Border Payments As Hedera prepares itself for a possible 50% growth in the short term, Remittix (RTX) has already surpassed expectations with returns several times greater. The platform has sold more than 516 million tokens and raised more than $13.6 million from its presale price of $0.0734. Early investors are beaming with more than 1000% returns, and analysts forecast an additional 200% growth before the end of March. Remittix's value lies in its practical application in the real world: simplifying $190 trillion of cross-border payments a year. Using local payment networks and the blockchain, users can exchange more than 40 cryptos for fiat, transferring money to bank accounts worldwide for minimal fees. Locked liquidity and a long-term plan to give up contract ownership are meant to assure skittish investors that Remittix is not another fleeting pump. Its presale health solidifies the token's DeFi credentials, with the indication that if Remittix maintains momentum, then it has what it takes to leave other altcoins mired in incremental updates in the dust. Just as XRP in its early days solved a gargantuan financial problem with the potential for faster, cheaper solutions, so does Remittix. While a 10x or higher rise is never guaranteed, initiatives that solve real-world pain points do have a better chance of attracting long-term attention. Once Remittix unlocks its use to merchants, gig economy workers, and international payers, there is potential for a wild price appreciation that could surpass even the most optimistic Hedera projections. Which Is More Likely to 10x This Cycle? Hedera's corporate partners and bullish wedge breakout lend the token some legitimacy and upside. However, the token's road to a $10 price point—equivalent to roughly a 20x from current levels—needs a sustained backdrop of strong partners, good retail pickup, and a raging bull market. Plausible but, with the high market cap and proportionately modest price moves on a daily basis, a ten-fold return on investment may take time and impeccable market conditions. Remittix, on the other hand, tackles a genuine day-to-day problem: remittances. As a more recent entrant, the lower market cap leaves room for more volatile price action to occur, and the token has already paid early investors with over 1000% returns. If the project's payment model gains traction internationally, Remittix could have sustained demand, propelling the token beyond typical DeFi growth projections. While not without risk, its strategy marries crypto's speed with real-world usefulness—a formula that might just deliver the sought-after $1,000-to-$10,000 makeover for bold investors.

41354088,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=709129,1741480221,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Price Forecast: LTF Head And Shoulders Pattern Predicts Crash – Here’s The Target,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-forecast-ltf-head-and-shoulders-pattern-predicts-crash-heres-the-target/,"Tony Severino, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a new Bitcoin price forecast, suggesting that the pioneer cryptocurrency is on the verge of another major correction. The analyst suggested that the formation of a Lower Time Frame (LTF) Head and Shoulders pattern on the Bitcoin price chart is a potential confirmation of a crash to mid-$80,000. Bitcoin Price Projected To Crash To $83,600 The market’s recent downturn has negatively impacted Bitcoin’s value, prompting less-than-favorable predictions from top analysts. Severino posted on X (formerly Twitter) on March 6 that Bitcoin could soon experience another major pullback to new lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides After Trump Signs Strategic Reserve Executive Order The analyst projected that Bitcoin could crash to $84,800 – $83,600. This bearish price outlook is supported by the recent formation of LTF Head and Shoulder pattern on the Bitcoin chart. A Head and Shoulder pattern is a technical analysis formation that usually indicates a potential reversal from bullish to bearish. It appears as three peaks on a price chart, with the middle peak, which is the head, being higher than the others (the shoulders). Notably, the Head and Shoulder pattern is considered one of the most recognizable patterns for projecting a downtrend in a cryptocurrency. In the case of Bitcoin, Severino’s chart illustrates a symmetrical triangle with an internal A-B-C-D-E wave-like structure. The black diagonal lines in the chart form the symmetrical triangle, which indicates lower highs and higher lows. Inside the triangle, red lines form the waves, suggesting that the Bitcoin price may be chopping sideways but with a bias towards completing the triangle. Due to the Head and Shoulder pattern formation, Bitcoin could see its price break down to the lower boundary of the triangle around the mid $80,000 region. This price crash would complete the D wave and possibly test the next critical support area. Once Bitcoin drops to this level, Severino predicts that it could bounce back to new highs. The chart shows that Bitcoin could rally toward the E wave in the triangle, which is positioned around the $90,000 price level. Furthermore, the analyst’s Bitcoin chart indicates another deeper pullback after this price rebound to $90,000. Toward the right side of the chart, an arrow points downwards, suggesting that after the final E wave rally, Bitcoin could drop down towards $83,600 to $80,200. Analyst Warns Of Bear Trap Before Bull Run Finale While many in the crypto market label this massive decline in the Bitcoin price as the beginning of the bear market, others believe that this price crash could be a mere bear trap. A market expert known as ’Crypto Caesar’ predicted that Bitcoin would be on the verge of its final bear trap before entering the last phase of this bull cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Predicts Massive Price Explosion—Is $6.24 Far-Fetched? This implies that Bitcoin is likely to face another sharp decline, shaking out weak hands before surging to a new all-time high. The analyst’s chart predicts that it could top out above $110,000, signaling the end of the bull market.

Chainlink – Who Wins In The Mid-Term Crypto Gains Race?,https://bitzo.com/2025/03/ondo-vs-chainlink-who-wins-in-the-mid-term-crypto-gains-race,"The battle for mid-term crypto gains is heating up between Ondo and Chainlink . Both projects hold promising potential, but which one will come out on top? Dive into this analysis to discover which coin might be poised for impressive growth and become a standout performer in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Ondo’s Volatile Journey: Charting Recovery and Key Levels Over the past month, Ondo experienced a sharp decline of about 26%, contrasting with a robust gain of over 63% in the last six months. The coin moved within a range of roughly 75 cents to $1.37. This performance highlights quick downturns amid longer-term recovery, indicating the asset’s vulnerability to rapid shifts in market sentiment while still holding long-term growth potential. The coin currently trades between roughly $0.75 and $1.37, with key support around $0.51 and resistance near $1.74. Bears exert some pressure as short-term indicators lean slightly negative, despite some oscillator hints of stability. Traders might watch the support zone for signs of reversal while being cautious of resistance at $1.74 when planning entries or exits. Chainlink Shows Mixed Performance Amid Price Fluctuations Chainlink dropped about 18.66% over the last month while showing a strong rally with a 50.77% gain over the past six months. The price action reflects short-term weakness amid long-term upward movement. Past performance indicates volatility with a clear recovery path that bolsters confidence despite recent declines. The current trading range sits between $10.20 and $22.70 with immediate support at $5.58 and resistance near $30.59. Bears currently influence the market as suggested by slightly negative moving average recommendations, although the trend remains unclear. Trading ideas include watching for a breakout above $30.59 or bouncing off support to capture potential gains within these levels. Conclusion In the mid-term, ONDO and LINK both show strong potential for gains. ONDO 's innovative approach attracts attention with its unique offerings. LINK continues to prove its reliability with established utilities and partnerships. ONDO might appeal more to those looking for fresh opportunities, while LINK remains a solid choice for its proven track record. Investors might consider spreading their investments to balance the potential benefits of both. Both coins present promising prospects, but individual preferences and risk appetite will ultimately guide the decision. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Arkham Intelligence compiled about 950 wallet addresses by March 8 Even before, Arkham provided information on key figures’ transactions, helping users identify market trends or possible price movements.
