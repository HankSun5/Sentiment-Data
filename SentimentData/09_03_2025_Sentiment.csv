Here are all the ways how,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-more-bitcoins-without-taxpayer-money/,"President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Bitcoin earlier this week, officially creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) using only the seized Bitcoin the US government already owns. This means no new purchases, no market buys—just stockpiling what’s already been taken from criminals and fraudsters. Crypto traders expected something different. They wanted the government to start buying more Bitcoin, which would push prices up. Instead, they got disappointment, and they’ve been sharing their frustrations all over X (formerly Twitter). Scott Melker, host of The Wolf of All Streets podcast, responded to the outrage with a post on X today, saying , “If you think that the Bitcoin SBR is bad news because it will only contain seized Bitcoin, then you are bad at reading and worse at comprehending what you are reading. Sell me your Bitcoin.” XRP lawyer John Deaton backed him up, saying, “Scott, as usual, is 100% spot on. I’ve seen a lot of negative takes regarding the EO. I realize many crypto investors were hoping for a Strategic MultiCoin Reserve, not just a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Trump orders Treasury and Commerce to find ‘budget-neutral’ ways to acquire Bitcoin During his White House crypto summit, Trump said, “Last year, I promised to make America the Bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet and we’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise.” The executive order also directed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to figure out how to get more Bitcoin without spending taxpayer dollars. That means creative methods—loopholes, incentives, partnerships. Deaton pointed to a major tool at their disposal: the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The ESF gives the Treasury Secretary broad authority to buy and hold financial assets to stabilize the dollar. Could Bitcoin be included? It’s possible, but Deaton said it would likely be challenged in court. Another potential option is the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). If Trump declared the $36 trillion national debt an economic emergency, he could use the IEEPA to justify Bitcoin purchases through executive action. But that would require printing money to buy Bitcoin, which would create a whole new set of problems. Then there’s the Defense Production Act. If Trump declared Bitcoin mining critical to national security, the government could start mining and acquiring Bitcoin directly. Deaton called this idea “insane,” but legally, it’s not off the table. President Trump at the White House crypto summit on March 7, 2025. Source: White House X/Twitter One of the easiest ways for the government to increase its Bitcoin holdings is through those criminal seizures. When authorities take Bitcoin from fraudsters, they usually auction it off. Trump’s executive order could mean keeping it instead. This would push law enforcement to crack down even harder on crypto-related crimes, and oh there are tons and tons of that still happening right now. Another way is taxing Bitcoin miners in BTC. The US is home to some of the world’s largest Bitcoin mining operations, and they could be required to pay a small portion of their mining rewards to the government. In return, they’d get tax breaks or regulatory benefits. The IRS and Commerce Department could also start accepting Bitcoin for federal payments. People paying taxes, fines, and fees in Bitcoin wouldn’t just be converting it to dollars—the government could keep a portion in the reserve. This would allow the US to accumulate Bitcoin naturally over time. A particularly aggressive approach is requiring federal land and energy lease payments in Bitcoin. Companies mining coal, lithium, or drilling for oil on federal land could be required to pay part of their royalties in BTC. This would make Bitcoin a national asset while giving mining and energy companies a direct stake in its success. Deaton also suggested that: “Partnering with U.S. Tech & Finance Firms by creating incentivized partnership where companies like Coinbase and Ripple help acquire and manage Bitcoin reserves and digital asset stockpiles.” Swapping gold for Bitcoin, Bitcoin-based bonds, tariffs in BTC, and many more budget-neutral ideas for buying more Bitcoins Trump’s executive order didn’t mention gold reserves, but that doesn’t mean they’re off-limits, especially if you consider Crypto-loving Senator Cynthia Lummis proposal in the BITCOIN Act, which actually first introduced the idea of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The US government holds over 8,100 tons of gold in reserves. If they swapped even a small portion for Bitcoin, they’d create a huge BTC stockpile overnight. (From the left) Howard Lutnick, Scott Bessent, Trump, David Sacks, Bo Hines, Brian Armstrong, and Michael Saylor at the summit. Source: White House Another possibility is tokenized US Treasury bonds. The government could issue Bitcoin-backed securities that investors buy with BTC, which would allow the US to acquire Bitcoin while still financing operations through debt instruments. Deaton said, “Trump could impose a “Bitcoin Tariff” instead of USD Tariff on Certain Imports. This is combining Tariff and BTC policy. For example, on high-tech goods, rare earth metals, or semiconductors, which are critical to national security or on electronics imported from China, given its dominance in global supply chains.” This of course comes as Trump is imposing tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China almost every other week since taking back the Oval on January 20th. Another option Deaton gave was Bitcoin-pegged export credits. The Commerce Department could create export incentives where US companies receive BTC credits when selling goods abroad. Foreign buyers paying a portion in Bitcoin would allow the government to build reserves without direct market purchases. Deaton said the US could also strike energy deals where countries like Saudi Arabia (oil) or Canada (natural gas) accept US exports at a discount in exchange for BTC payments. This would push international demand for Bitcoin transactions involving the US government. Another idea is that the US could issue Bitcoin-backed bonds tied to energy reserves, kind of like El Salvador’s Bitcoin bonds. These bonds could be linked to future oil, gas, or federal land lease revenues, giving investors exposure to both Bitcoin and US energy production, said Deaton. Trump’s executive order doesn’t stop private companies or individuals from donating Bitcoin to the US reserve. A tax incentive for BTC donations could encourage people to send Bitcoin to the government without direct spending. Federal contractors could also pay in Bitcoin, with a small portion going directly into the reserve. This would allow the US to accumulate Bitcoin while still paying contractors as usual. Even regular taxpayers could be incentivized. If the government offered capital gains tax breaks for people paying taxes in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP, it could encourage crypto holders to pay directly in BTC. A tiny fraction of each payment could be kept in the reserve, steadily increasing holdings over time. “Hence, the EO we received is as aggressive as a President can do, absent invoking emergency powers. I’m surprised BTC isn’t $120K already. As for the MultiCoin debate and people disappointed, BTC has ALWAYS led the market. You can dislike it, but it’s reality,” Deaton said in his X post.

However, projects that perform well typically have high utility in the DeFi ecosystem. Analysts and experts have centered their research on BinoFi , a new hybrid crypto exchange project designed to redefine how traders interact with crypto assets. According to the analysts, the token is set to outperform XRP’s 5X rally by posting impressive 100X gains in 2025. BinoFi’s native token BINO is currently on presale onboarding investors to support its on-chain and off-chain infrastructure development. Will XRP go up? XRP has been one of the most volatile crypto assets in 2025. The asset entered a corrective phase and dropped to $1.76 in early February after climbing to a seven-year high of $3.40 in January. The crypto asset recently surged by 35% in a single day before dropping by more than 20% the following day. The recent XRP swings are credited to announcements made by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the proposed strategic crypto reserves for the U.S. Treasury. XRP has the potential to rally by 5X and could reach $10. Although experts think $10 may not be possible in 2025, they believe it will be possible by 2035 when crypto adoption picks up momentum. While 5X proves to be a huddle for XRP, the analysts cited BinoFi’s potential for 100X gains this year. BinoFi’s presale reveals a life-changing opportunity for crypto investors Crypto exchanges are the backbone of crypto trading activities and have evolved with new technology. Older exchanges such as Mt. Gox only provided investors with basic trading features but exposed market participants to security concerns leading to loss of investors’ funds to malicious hacks. As technology evolved, it paved the way for exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase that are more secure, user-friendly and possess advanced trading features such as margin trading. BinoFi developers have discovered new technological applications that will reshape how centralized and decentralized exchanges function. The developers are working on a new hybrid exchange that joins features from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The discovery prompts a new approach that integrates the best aspects of both exchange models to give traders control of their assets and convenience when trading them. BinoFi’s presale is currently underway. Investors are buying BINO tokens at a discounted attractive price of $0.02. The presale is designed so that prices increase gradually after each phase. The gradual price increase ensures early adopters get rewarded for believing in the project’s future success. The presale is currently selling out fast as traders and investors scramble for tokens. Analysts believe BINO will surge by 100X after launch making presale investors significant gains. Why BinoFi Could 100X in 2025 BinoFi’s 100X price prediction comes amid several factors. The project is pioneering the first hybrid crypto exchange making it a first market mover in the niche. The first-to-market advantage positions the project as a leading DeFi protocol operating without competition. BinoFi’s transparency feature involves on-chain proof of reserves. The ecosystem provides real-time on-chain proof of assets to assure users that all funds are safe. The project also employs deflationary tokenomics. BINO tokens have a maximum supply of 2 billion tokens meaning that the team will not mint any more BINO tokens to inflate the ecosystem. Additionally, the token has an in-built deflationary mechanism that constantly reduces the token supply through a buy-back and burn feature. The mechanism will steadily increase the token’s demand rewarding long-term supporters and early adopters.

Cardano (ADA) is in the spotlight with Grayscale’s proposal for a new Cardano ETF, listed as “GADA” on NYSE Arca. Simultaneously, Stellar (XLM) could be gearing up for a price increase, with predictions of a 16% rise as buying signals strengthen on the charts. Amid these developments, Web3Bay is emerging as a platform set to reshape the digital assets market. As the interest in tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and NFTs with practical applications grows, Web3Bay is preparing to stake its claim as the go-to marketplace for digital assets in 2025. By linking digital creators, asset holders, and purchasers in a user-friendly space, Web3Bay aims to offer a platform that competes with OpenSea, favoring those who join early. Web3Bay: A Leading Crypto Marketplace for Digital Assets in 2025 Web3Bay is distinguishing itself as a hub that might transform into the digital assets’ Amazon, fostering connections among digital creators, asset owners, and shoppers through its comprehensive platform. With the rising appeal of tokenized Real-World Assets (RWA) and NFTs that serve more functional roles, Web3Bay provides a solid foundation for secure, clear, and effective transactions. This blend of RWAs and digital offerings could set the stage for a challenge to major players like OpenSea, marking it as a top long-term crypto prospect for digital market engagement. A key feature of Web3Bay is its readiness to embrace NFTs with expanded utility. Beyond just art and collectibles, the platform accommodates digital tickets, memberships, and assets for the metaverse, adapting to the trend towards more utility-based NFTs. As RWAs like real estate, high-end goods, and commodities are increasingly tokenized, Web3Bay presents early birds the opportunity to capitalize on these market shifts. This combination of tangible and digital assets positions it as a promising long-term crypto player for 2025. Currently, in its 5th stage of presale, Web3Bay’s 3BAY tokens are priced at $0.00524. The presale has already attracted over $1.6 million, indicating strong interest in the initiative. With plans to include PayPal and other integrations in its roadmap, Web3Bay is strategically poised to attract mainstream users, marking a significant period for early investors eager to carve out a niche in the burgeoning digital assets scene. Could a Cardano ETF Propel ADA to New Peaks? Excitement builds as Grayscale submits an application for the first standalone Cardano ETF, labeled “GADA” on NYSE Arca. Should it get the nod, this ETF would allow mainstream investors to tap into ADA without directly handling the cryptocurrency. Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, will oversee custody, and BNY Mellon will manage administrative responsibilities. This initiative could boost ADA’s liquidity and demand, potentially elevating its price in the near future. After the announcement of the Cardano ETF, ADA’s value soared by 14.38%, reaching $0.8051. The forecast for 2025 looks bright, with an expected rise to $1.900281 as per CoinCodex. The Cardano community is optimistic about SEC approval, which could further ADA’s adoption and solidify its market presence. Can XLM Reach $0.4292? One Analyst Believes It’s Possible! Crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggests a 16% rise for XLM, citing a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern on Stellar’s 4-hour chart—a classic sign of an impending upward breakout. Currently priced at $0.32, Stellar (XLM) must overcome the $0.37 resistance to achieve a new target of $0.4292. Despite a recent 26.6% decline over the past 30 days, on-chain indicators hint at a turnaround. Stellar’s active addresses have hit a record high of 9 million, and $32.54 million in XLM has been withdrawn from exchanges, suggesting accumulation by investors. A 3.82% increase in Open Interest (OI) signals that traders are gearing up for a potential surge, keeping the outlook for XLM optimistic. The Bottom Line The anticipated Cardano ETF could catapult ADA to new heights, with a strong performance expected if the SEC approves. On another front, Stellar’s XLM is poised for a potential 16% increase to $0.4292 as momentum builds. Both projects hold exciting prospects, yet Web3Bay is making its mark as the best long-term crypto bet for 2025. Web3Bay’s cutting-edge marketplace for Real-World Assets (RWA) and NFTs positions it as the digital asset equivalent of Amazon, offering a streamlined platform poised to challenge OpenSea. Early backers of the Web3Bay presale, now in its 5th phase with 3BAY tokens priced at $0.00524, stand to gain as the platform expands. This digital asset boom is not to be missed!

The DeFi godfather points to rising competition from Solana and Tron and internal wrangling on Ethereum as reasons for the network’s decline. Andre Cronje Identifies A Boatload of Factors Affecting Ethereum As analysts continue to scratch their heads over Ethereum’s underperformance, Andre Cronje has thrown his hat in the ring to explain the asset’s decline. Cronje took to X (formerly Twitter) to rationalize falling Ethereum prices in the face of major catalysts for the network. Top on the list for Cronje are layer 2 projects “ruining” user experiences via fragmented liquidity and the use of centralized sequencers. Cronje notes that the decision of L2 projects to dump ETH adversely affects price performance. Furthermore, short pressure from USDe and a botched scaling roadmap contribute their share to falling Ethereum prices. Cronje argues that ETH defenders are podcasters rather than engineers while the question of network representation remains unsettled. The recent appointment of Ethereum Foundation directors does little to convince Cronje to invest in the largest altcoin. Cronje Will Rather Invest In Other Altcoins Over Ethereum The Sonic Labs co-founder confirmed that the dour sentiment surrounding Ethereum is linked to increased competition from other blockchains. Rival blockchains like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) offer improved speed and finality while offering superior user interfaces. For Cronje, these competing blockchains offer direct support to native projects rather than opting for neutrality. He argues that teams are just not building on Ethereum and are opting for other blockchains to host their projects. “Hell, I don’t invest, but if I did, I would choose Solana, Tron, and XRP over ETH,” said Cronje. Ethereum’s Grim Price Prediction After the largest altcoin slipped below the $2,000 mark, on-chain analysts presented theories of ETH falling to $1,000 . Ethereum currently trades at $2,215 with whales scooping up one million ETH on a discount. Despite key catalysts like ETH ETF approvals and inclusion in the Crypto Strategic Reserve , the asset’s price performance is underwhelming. Analysts have their sights on resistance levels at the $2,857 mark and $2,084 for support as the assets navigate a choppy season.

Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are considered cornerstones of Donald Trump’s digital asset reserve. XRP Mentioned As An Asset Of Interest For America’s Digital Asset Reserve President Donald Trump recently signed an Executive Order establishing the Crypto Reserve and US Digital Asset Stockpile. Crypto experts have called Donald Trump’s crypto reserve the most bullish political stance on digital assets ever. News has spread that the Federal Reserve will own XRP. Interestingly, the possibility of XRP being in the digital asset reserve has gotten backlash from crypto enthusiasts who say they do not understand the rationale behind having XRP in the reserve. Nonetheless, the White House will have a crypto summit to discuss Donald Trump‘s digital asset reserve in order to determine the tone for the US crypto policy moving forward. US Gains The Largest Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Following Donald Trump Announcement With Donald Trump’s recently announced digital asset reserve, the United States now has 198,109 Bitcoin (BTC) locked in . Experts have explained that the US will hold almost 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC) and develop budget-neutral strategies to buy more Bitcoin (BTC). Due to this large accumulation, the US now has the largest strategic Bitcoin reserve in the world.

Instead, the agency focused on denying transparency on their part. The crypto exchange compared FDIC’s effort towards crypto regulation to other agencies, citing that the former has been quite reluctant. Coinbase Drags SEC and FDIC on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal took to X on March 8 to backlash against the FDIC for failing to cooperate and resist essential transparency efforts towards unwinding Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This campaign was designed to debank crypto-related companies by cutting them off banking services. The goal was to siphon every liquidity firm within the reach of the crypto firms. Coinbase once sued the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the FDIC. The exchange aimed to force the agencies to hand over the records that confirm Operation Chokepoint 2.0. FDIC Fails to Provide Documentation on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 Grewal asked the FDIC to provide details on how it conducted due diligence to ensure that no Operation Chokepoint 2.0-related document was destroyed to hide proof. The agency is unable to respond to this question. Coinbase has also accused the FDIC of repeatedly refusing to provide information related to its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) practices. According to a status report filed on January 17, History Associates, a firm assisting Coinbase, accused the FDIC of “systematically thwarting FOIA requests.” So far, only “snippets from a few documents” unrelated to the specific FOIA policies or practices have been made available. In response to this action, Grewal queried the FDIC, “What exactly are they hiding?” White House Crypto Summit on Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The administration of former President Joe Biden is believed to have facilitated the debunking campaign against crypto firms. During the recently held White House Crypto Summit in Washington, experts spoke about the rollback of Biden-era banking regulation. These are known to also involve the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The OCC has now reversed the 2020 guidance that prohibited crypto firms from custody services provided by banks. This is noteworthy because it is a significant pivot from the FDIC’s position on cryptocurrency.

Liquidity drain from memecoins and ETFs is consolidating capital back into Bitcoin. Left-translated cycle could trigger a sharp BTC decline and prolonged bearish trends. The launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs was initially hailed as a major shift for the crypto industry. Many believed these investment vehicles would unlock significant institutional demand, propelling Bitcoin to new heights. However, the reality has played out differently. Since January 20, 2024, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain upward momentum, prompting questions about whether the market priced in perfection too soon. Interestingly, historical market patterns may offer insights into Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Analyst Benjamin Cowen has pointed to similarities between Bitcoin’s ETF performance and the Nasdaq-100 ETF (QQQ) launched in 1999. The QQQ ETF peaked 54 weeks after its inception, a timeline that aligns with Bitcoin’s peak 54 weeks post-ETF launch.

The XRP community is calling on newly appointed SEC Chair Mark Uyeda to drop the agency’s appeal. Ripple Community Chatter on SEC Case It is important to state that since the SEC filed its appeal on October 2, 2024, challenging Judge Analisa Torres’ rulings on programmatic sales and other distributions, XRP supporters have been vocal about their frustration. Spearheaded by X user, Tanner, many community members believe the SEC’s continued pursuit of the case is unnecessary. This is because of the court’s ruling that XRP’s public sales did not violate securities laws. them permanently enjoined to the court. An Acting Chairman resolving a complex case like Ripple’s would be rather uncommon. The fact that Ripple requested an extension to April 16th might be in anticipation of Atkins’ arrival. At least this is my take on it all. — Sherrie (@CherryEmpress21) March 8, 2025 Some speculate that Ripple’s request for the brief extension until April 16th may be tied to Uyeda’s potential leadership shift. The firm is likely anticipating a more pragmatic resolution under his watch. In addition, prominent figures in the crypto community have suggested a compromise. They want both Ripple and the SEC to drop their appeals and agree to revise the $125 million penalty currently in escrow. This would allow Ripple to move forward without the lingering uncertainty of legal proceedings. It will also enable the SEC to avoid further reputational damage from a prolonged fight. The New US SEC and End to Crypto Litigations With Mark Uyeda now acting as chairman of the US SEC, there is renewed hope that a resolution could be reached in the Ripple versus SEC case. For context, Uyeda has been critical of the SEC’s regulatory overreach in the past, and his leadership thus far has signaled a shift away from aggressive enforcement actions. The SEC dropped its charges against Ripple executives in October 2023. In addition, the SEC closed the Coinbase lawsuit recently. Crypto community members believe that these moves mark a softening position on the SEC’s side. However, the ongoing Ripple lawsuit appeal remains a central sticking point. The XRP community argues that if Uyeda truly wants to address the regulatory missteps of the past, dismissing the SEC’s appeal would be a decisive step. Proponents argue that it will restore trust and set a new direction for crypto regulation. Ripple Labs Policy Initiatives Meanwhile, Ripple Labs has continued to strengthen its policy efforts in the United States. Presently, it is engaging with lawmakers and blockchain associations to advocate for clear cryptocurrency regulations. The organization’s efforts align with broader industry calls for regulatory clarity that gives room for innovation rather than stifling it through litigation. As the case with the US SEC progresses, all eyes are on the regulator’s next move. Will Uyeda take action to end the Ripple lawsuit appeal and bring long-awaited closure? The XRP community is watching closely. Also, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has commended President Donald Trump’s vision of a crypto strategic reserve, which might include XRP. He also expressed excitement that the industry is moving past the Biden administration’s regulatory approaches.

With digital assets constantly evolving, new projects with innovative mechanics capture attention quickly. Among them, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC ) is making waves, offering an adventurous presale structure and an aggressive token burn strategy. Meanwhile, Polkadot is pushing forward with key network updates, and Ethereum continues to refine its scalability initiatives. This article will cover the latest developments surrounding Arctic Pablo Coin, Polkadot, and Ethereum. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Strategy: Token Burns in Action The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) presale introduces a powerful deflationary mechanism—weekly token burns. Any unsold tokens are permanently removed, limiting supply and increasing scarcity. Additionally, after the presale concludes, remaining tokens will be burned to sustain a deflationary economy. With each burn, Arctic Pablo Coin enhances investor value, as reducing token supply tends to drive up price potential. All burn transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring credibility and verifiability. This unique strategy differentiates APC from other meme coins, positioning it as a top crypto to buy now. Arctic Pablo Coin’s ChillVille Takeover – Prices Won’t Stay This Low Arctic Pablo Coin has now reached the 13th phase of its presale—ChillVille. This milestone follows its lightning-fast journey through 12 locations, including Penguinopolis, which wrapped up in under six days. The project has surpassed expectations at every stage, drawing increasing investor interest. Currently, APC is priced at just $0.000070, with a staggering ROI of 11,285.71% from this phase to the listing price of $0.008. Over $1.78 million has already been raised. As each new location unlocks, the price climbs, meaning this could be the last chance to get in at this entry point. The Arctic expedition continues, but investors who wait may miss out on these early-stage gains. Polkadot’s Latest Expansion into Cross-Chain Interoperability Polkadot has unveiled a major breakthrough in its cross-chain messaging system, aiming to enhance blockchain interoperability. The network’s latest update streamlines communication between parachains, reducing transaction times and improving efficiency. This enhancement is expected to strengthen Polkadot’s ecosystem, enabling smoother integrations across various DeFi platforms. As interoperability becomes a crucial factor in blockchain adoption, Polkadot’s advancements place it among the top cryptos to buy now. Ethereum Gears Up for Dencun Upgrade to Boost Efficiency Ethereum’s long-anticipated Dencun upgrade is nearing deployment, bringing significant improvements to scalability and transaction costs. This update focuses on Proto-Danksharding, a mechanism designed to lower fees for layer-2 solutions. With Ethereum remaining a dominant force in the crypto space, these enhancements reinforce its position as a leading smart contract platform. As the upgrade rolls out, investors are keeping a close watch on how it impacts the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Final Thoughts – Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out While Polkadot and Ethereum continue to evolve, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale has captivated the market with its unique structure and aggressive token burn strategy. The current stage, ChillVille, offers a rare opportunity to enter at a low price before it rises in the next location. As investors search for the best opportunities, APC’s adventurous journey and high-growth potential make it a meme coin presale worth considering. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this thrilling crypto expedition.

41350328,https://coingape.com/?p=243040,1741474097,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,"Analyst Confirms Dogecoin Price Can Reach $90, Here’s When",https://coingape.com/analyst-confirms-dogecoin-price-can-reach-90-heres-when/,"Crypto analyst DOGECAPITAL has provided an ultra bullish outlook for the Dogecoin price, predicting it could reach as high as $90. The analyst also revealed when the foremost meme coin could reach this price target. When The Dogecoin Price Could Reach $90 In an X post , DOGECAPITAL predicted that the Dogecoin price could reach $90. He noted that the price target was the highest point of a red area, which he believes the top meme coin could peak at in this market cycle. Interestingly, the analyst’s accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach this price target by the end of 2025, which he noted. Based on DOGECAPITAL’s analysis, this parabolic rally to $90 will happen in phase 3 of the meme coin’s bull run when it reaches this parallel red zone. This move will mirror previous cycles when Dogecoin reached its peak before starting a new cycle. The analyst noted that the bottom of that red zone sits at $26, his minimum target for this cycle. He said that the bottom of this red zone could gradually increase over time due to the slope of the line. Meanwhile, DOGECAPITAL claimed that the timing of DOGE’s approach to this red zone will determine when market participants can expect this cycle’s ultimate peak. In the meantime, DOGECAPITAL noted that the weekly candle continues to hold the same parallel line level, mirroring its behavior during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. He predicts that phase 2 of DOGE’s bull run will begin once the bottom is fully confirmed. The accompanying chart showed that the Dogecoin price will surge above $2 during this phase 2 of its bull run. DOGE Could Soon Hit $3 Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade recently predicted that the Dogecoin price could hit $3. This came as the analyst revealed that DOGE’s monthly candle had formed a Doji, which was mirroring the same position in the previous cycle. The analyst remarked that this Doji might kick off a bull run for the DOGE price , similar to the massive spike in 2017 and 2018. His accompanying chart showed that the top meme coin could reach $3 as it records this massive spike. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez stated that if the Dogecoin price maintains support at the channel’s lower boundary at $0.17, it could trigger a strong rebound toward $2.74. However, according to a CoinGape market analysis, there is still the possibility of DOGE suffering downward pressure before any potential price rebound. The analysis noted that the Dogecoin price is on the verge of forming a death cross , which may trigger a 42% crash to a five-month low of $0.11.

The current price of $0.015 makes MUTM attractive for investors during its second presale stage because the value will reach $0.02 when proceeding to the next phase. Early token investors will experience a 300% profit when MUTM lists at $0.06 although the current price increase stands at 33%. Professional analysts have already calculated a $3.50 price projection for the project after its launch which provides investors with a unique opportunity to achieve substantial returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Powerhouse with Real-World Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform which delivers actual financial utility through its features. Through its mtTokens system the project enables users to access three functions: passive income generation and lending and borrowing activities. Users who deposit their assets such as ETH or DAI receive mtETH or mtDAI that generates interest during the holding period. The transferable tokens function as an important addition to the DeFi ecosystem because users can both send them to other platforms and utilize them throughout different DeFi systems. The lending model of the platform includes overcollateralized transactions that create stability and minimize risks. The borrowing process requires users to present assets with a value that exceeds the loan amount for dual purposes of protecting lenders while sustaining system stability. Mutuum Finance will implement peer-to-peer (P2P) lending features which allow users to establish direct negotiations for loan conditions. Standard lending pools do not support the borrowing of meme coins but Mutuum Finance provides this functionality through its peer-to-peer loan feature. Presale Success and Growing Investor Confidence The presale achieved tremendous success through fast-selling of its first phase followed by enthusiastic participation in its second phase. Investors can access the lowest price of $0.015 now because the market will not see this value again before the next price increase. Early investors stand to gain a 300% return when the token lists at $0.06, with further growth expected as the platform gains traction. The value creation strategy of Mutuum Finance depends on its buy-and-distribute mechanism for MUTM tokens. Revenue from the platform allows MUTM token purchases to distribute them to mtToken staking participants. The continuous buying pressure from the mechanism encourages investors to keep their tokens long-term while maintaining stable prices. The buy-and-distribute mechanism of MUTM combined with its practical real-world application makes the token a resilient investment choice among other cryptocurrencies. Why Now Is the Time to Act The second stage of presale activities is reaching its end while the upcoming price elevation is rapidly approaching. Current investors who purchase MUTM tokens at $0.015 now will profit immediately when the price reaches $0.02 during the following phase. New investors who participate during the initial phase can expect their investment to appreciate by 300% due to the $0.06 listing price. Experts anticipate MUTM tokens will achieve $3.50 value following the launch because of how the platform gains adoption while implementing new features. Mutuum Finance is currently conducting a $100,000 giveaway which will distribute $10,000 each to ten selected participants. The giveaway program has introduced additional thrill to the presale period thus attracting additional investors to participate before the deadline expires. A Unique Opportunity in the Crypto Market The market characterized by speculative hype distinguishes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its practical applications and sustainable growth framework. A robust ecosystem for sustainable growth results from the combination of its lending and borrowing features alongside the mtTokens system and the buy-and-distribute mechanism. Investor confidence in the project continues to increase as the presale advances swiftly while attracting more owners. A price increase of 33% is upcoming during the second phase which will end soon thus making it the optimal moment to take action. Investors should not let this opportunity pass them by to join a DeFi transformation project which provides significant returns to its initial supporters. Secure your position in this groundbreaking project today and take advantage of the final opportunity to buy before prices rise.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto insiders are betting on PropiChain to skyrocket, with projections for a 40,000% breakout in the market. Table of Contents A 40,000% surge? Here’s why it’s possible Why crypto insiders are betting big on this altcoin Crypto insiders are accumulating, don’t wait? Investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing and it is not different in the crypto market. Every crypto investor dreams of finding that one hidden gem that goes from obscurity to dominance while delivering insane gains. Bitcoin had its moment. Ethereum followed. Then came Solana , BNB, and Avalanche. Now, crypto insiders and analysts have locked onto a new target, and if their projections are right, we’re looking at a potential 40,000% breakout. Sounds crazy? Sure. But so did Shiba Inu’s 45,000,000% surge in 2021 and Solana’s 20,000% rally. The crypto market rewards early believers, and crypto insiders are betting that this hidden gem altcoin is next. Forget the usual suspects, this altcoin is ready to explode. In the hunt for the next big crypto, crypto insiders have found PropiChain (PCHAIN) an altcoin that combines real-world asset tokenization, AI, and the metaverse to change the real estate industry. So what exactly is it and why is it about to skyrocket? Let’s break it all down. A 40,000% surge? Here’s why it’s possible The crypto market moves in cycles and the biggest gains are made by those that get in ahead of the crowd. Crypto insiders don’t gamble, they spot winners early and that is exactly what they are doing with this hidden gem, PropiChain. While most retail investors chase already pumped coins, crypto insiders accumulate quietly. With its real-world utility, low market cap, and blockchain solutions, it is little wonder why they are all over PropiChain. The last time crypto insiders moved this aggressively, we saw BNB explode from $0.10 to $700. Crypto insiders know something other people don’t. In crypto, history repeats itself and we have seen this type of growth multiple times. Still skeptical about a 40,000% breakout? Just look at these real examples: Shiba Inu (SHIB) gained over 45,000,000% in just over a year; Solana (SOL) surged 20,000% after launching at $0.20; and Polygon (MATIC) rose 29,000% from its lows. The key? Early adoption + strong fundamentals + market momentum. This hidden gem altcoin checks every box and the math checks out. Why crypto insiders are betting big on this altcoin One of the biggest problems in investing in the real estate industry is accessibility. The industry is a proven wealth builder but most people are locked out if they don’t have deep pockets. Through fractional ownership, PCHAIN is changing the game. Imagine a student with free cash being able to own a slice of real estate with just $100 without ever dealing with banks, paperwork, or middlemen. This isn’t just an idea — it is happening right now. AI is taking over every industry and crypto is no exception. With AI-driven analytics, PropiChain is letting its investors reap the rewards while AI does all the hard work. This is not just crypto but an AI revolution. Samantha is new to crypto and hates technical analysis but with AI-powered investment tools, her altcoin portfolio is automatically adjusted based on market trends, ensuring she buys low and sells high, all without lifting a finger. That is the power of crypto + AI. The Metaverse is no longer just a sci-fi fantasy. Major companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple are investing billions into virtual worlds, and this altcoin is at the forefront of the movement. Investors can buy, sell, and rent real estate, creating real income streams in a fully digital economy. Samantha can finalize transactions after conducting a virtual tour of the property with the help of the metaverse. Compare this hidden gem to meme coins that rely on pure hype, and it is clear where the real opportunities are. Crypto insiders are accumulating, don’t wait? If history has taught us anything, it is that early adopters win big. By the time most investors hear about a crypto gem, it is already too late. Right now, crypto insiders are still accumulating, meaning there is a chance to get in before the breakout. Unlike shady altcoins that disappear overnight, this one is designed for stability.

As this bearish pattern continues, investors are actively rotating to PropiChain as it aims to take the lead. In this text, we will discuss Shiba Inu’s price action and analyze why PropiChain stands out to investors. What is the Future Outlook of Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands out in 2021 when it delivers massive gains to early adopters to make new crypto millionaires. However, it has failed to keep up with the rest of the meme market in this cycle. The question on every investors’ mind is will Shiba Inu recover and keep up with the rest of the market or is this the end of the road. Consequently, Shiba Inu investors are rotating to a new narrative with high potential. This is the best move, considering SHIB is finding it hard to regain its momentum. Even if Shiba Inu recovers, it will be unable to deliver the life-changing gains that investors seek. Why PropiChain Will Take the Lead in the Crypto World PropiChain aims to make real estate accessible to everyone with more advanced features and enhanced experience. Investors will easily access the real estate market as PCHAIN’s asset tokenization will help to eliminate the huge capital requirements through a fractional ownership model. This model will enable users of PropiChain to be able to own fractions of high valuable properties. Before even picking the asset to invest in, PropiChain offers advanced filtering systems. This enables traders to get assets that match their preferences. For instance, you may ask PCHAIN’s AI to list only assets with expected ROI increases or those with high rental income, depending on your objectives. Furthermore, you can automate lease and renewal contracts by programming the smart contract. Once you’ve set the terms for your property leasing agreement, the smart contract helps process the contract after a user meets the condition. Physical meetings or cumbersome legal papers are totally avoided as all transactions are processed and stored on the blockchain. Lease Renewals are also handled automatically, provided the lessee and lessor agree to the updated terms. The Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) is another way PropiChain will enhance the RWA sector. This system will ensure only actual and current property costs are quoted. The AVMs get accurate information from past and present sources to calculate a fair price for sellers and buyers. Accurate market analysis is another feature investors will enjoy when they join PropiChain . The AI will evaluate all industry statistics to give current appraisals of various assets. That’s not all; the PropiChain Artificial Intelligence can also predict possible changes in price and demand for assets to aid your investment decisions. The international market will also be accessible as PropiChain decentralized marketplace will also integrate Metaverse to simplify transactions and other real estate-related operations You can have your meetings with foreign sellers and buyers through the Metaverse interactive platform, saving the stress and cost of holding physical meetings. This advanced technology will also introduce virtual asset touring, which makes asset inspection simpler and more cost-effective. The 3D representation beats what pictures and videos can offer. Meanwhile, investors can conduct virtual staging where they furnish the property virtually to know what furniture to get. Navigation and operations are aided by AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants. These tools help investors have smooth sessions on the PropiChain marketplace with a 24/7 support system. For example, a virtual assistant can explain a complex legal term for PropiChain decentralized platform to new or existing users. With these incredible features, it is only normal for smart traders to rush PCHAIN’s presale. Because investment now is an easy gateway to NetGen real estate. The Market Advantage of PropiChain Over Shiba Inu Utility: Unlike Shiba Inu, PropiChain aims to offer unique real-world solutions that will make it a force to reckon with. Controlled Tokenomics: PCHAIN’s controlled tokenomics and limited supply will enable sustainable long-term growth. Early Mover Advantage: Shiba Inu losses more than 40% in the past year. However, investors that joined PCHAIN from its first phase of token presale are already in profit by more than 160%. If you join now, you will be in profit by more than 100% when the third phase starts. High growth Potential: Analysts have forecasted that PCHAIN could deliver more than more than 47471% by Q2 of 2025. This means an investment of $1000 in this round of its token presale could yield more than $470,000 for early investors. Is PCHAIN Credible and Legitimate? It is essential to invest in a project that can assure the protection of investors’ assets from fraudulent or any form of hack. PCHAIN has proven to be that project and the BlockAudit review on PropiChain showed that the project is highly committed to protecting users’ investment. This furthers investors’ confidence in the project. In its early stage, PropiChain got listed on CoinMarketCap and this increased the project’s recognition among Investors. Also, the listing shows that PCHAIN is a credible project that aims to earn a position among established projects in the world. Conclusion Experts believe PCHAIN’s token presale could be the best in 2025. More than $3 million has been raised from PropiChain’s token presale. This signifies the high confidence investors have in the token presale. As a result of the buzz surrounding PropiChain and the early success of its presale, investors are heavily rotating into it. Therefore, now is the best time to join as it could potentially replicate the early surge in price of many established projects.

Analysts Say This Altcoin Could Outpace the Market,https://timestabloid.com/best-crypto-to-buy-in-2025-analysts-say-this-altcoin-could/,"The crypto market is changing, and investors are looking for the best crypto to buy in 2025. While traditional assets have delivered steady gains, many are now shifting focus to disruptive altcoins that promise explosive growth. Leading analysts are spotlighting PropiChain as an asset set to outpace the market. And many have speculated that it could be the best crypto to buy at a time like this, and this article discusses why. The Competition: Market Leaders Under Pressure Projects with big names like Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the crypto space. However, these giants are now matured, limiting their upside potential. Many investors feel that the future lies with emerging altcoins that offer real-world utility. Top performing altcoins and tokens in the crypto market are ones with real world use cases. That is where Propichain comes in, establishing its presence in the real estate niche, one of the most lucrative industries. PropiChain: A Game-Changing Altcoin for 2025 PropiChain is becoming the revolutionary altcoin that will redefine property investments. Many experts already proclaimed it as the best crypto to buy. It uses AI to conduct market prediction and analysis, offering real-time insights into trends, property values, and investment opportunities. For example, if an investor repeatedly shows interest in certain neighborhoods, the AI will prioritize similar listings, property, or similar areas, ensuring a customized, user-centered, and dynamic approach. PropiChain transforms high-value real estate into fractional, tradable tokens. This real estate tokenization means that an investor could own a portion of a $10 million property with just a modest investment. You can put in as little as $500 and gain exposure to premium assets that traditionally required millions in capital. This breakthrough opens the door to passive income through rental yields and appreciation. Beyond AI and tokenization, PropiChain’s metaverse integration redefines property interactions. In a virtual environment, users can explore properties via virtual tours and attend global meetings with buyers and sellers. And even more, it transforms marketing strategies for real estate agencies and enhances investor confidence by offering an engaging, interactive experience. PropiChain elevates the user experience by also integrating AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants that provide 24/7 real-time support throughout the entire real estate transaction process. These smart tools simplify interactions by guiding both new and seasoned investors through property searches, using personalized criteria such as location, price range, and property type. In addition, the virtual assistants break down complex legal contracts and financial terms by breaking down intricate language into simple, easily-understandable explanations, empowering users to make decisions with confidence while reducing the anxiety associated with legal and financial paperwork. Presale Opportunity: Unprecedented Early Gains PropiChain is currently in its presale phase, offering early investors an exceptional entry point. The token is priced at just $0.011 in Stage 2 before transitioning to Stage 3, where the price is expected to rise to $0.023. This doubling alone presents a significant opportunity, and with a potential forecast of over 50,000% upside, a $1,000 investment could potentially yield millions. This is an opportunity that should not pass any investor by, as securing PropiChain at this early stage might translate into explosive gains once the market recognizes its disruptive potential. Security and Market Credibility Security is a top priority for any crypto investment. PropiChain has undergone a thorough security audit by BlockAudit , ensuring its smart contracts are robust and transparent. This audit provides both investors and users with the confidence that their assets are protected. Moreover, PropiChain is already listed on CoinMarketCap , enhancing its market credibility and visibility. This prominent listing reassures investors that PropiChain is a secure and established asset in a rapidly growing market. Is PropiChain the Best Crypto to Buy in 2025? As the search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 intensifies, PropiChain stands out with its groundbreaking fusion of AI, real estate tokenization, and metaverse integration. With its presale price at $0.011 in Stage 2, set to jump to $0.023 in Stage 3, the potential for explosive gains is enormous. Imagine turning a $1,000 investment into a fortune as PropiChain surges ahead, potentially delivering returns that could redefine your financial future. The market is shifting, and the time to invest is now. Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of a revolutionary project that could outpace traditional assets and change the landscape of crypto investing.

Crypto Analyst Identifies Pattern For Bullish Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/aave/aave-price-to-360-crypto-analyst-identifies-pattern/,"Despite the recent positive momentum in the market, the AAVE price seems to be back under bearish pressure over the past day. As a result of the dwindling sentiment, the price of AAVE has dropped beneath the psychological $200 level in the last 24 hours. However, a prominent crypto analyst on social media platform X has suggested that the DeFi token won’t be down for long. According to the crypto pundit, the AAVE price could begin a new bullish rally, with its sights on the $360 mark. AAVE Price Prediction: Analyst Forecasts 80% Surge Popular crypto trader Ali Martinez took to the X platform to share a video, explaining AAVE’s potential path to return to its former price highs in the current cycle. This optimistic prediction is based on a developing “broadening formation” on a medium-term timeframe of the AAVE price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Incoming? Why A Fall To $63,000 Is Possible If This Resistance Holds For context, a broadening formation is a price pattern in technical analysis characterized by two diverging trendlines; a rising upper trendline (connecting a series of higher highs) and a falling lower trendline (connecting lower lows). This pattern is often associated with a period of increasing price volatility (or significant price action). Typically, broadening patterns are bearish chart formations for most asset prices, as they are often correlated with rising volatility without a clear indication of the next direction. However, the current formation appears to be bullish and could prove a pivotal turning point for the AAVE price. According to Martinez, the DeFi coin looks primed for a bullish break out of the developing broadening pattern. However, the AAVE price would need to breach the crucial resistance level of around $250 before this bullish breakout can be confirmed. If AAVE successfully closes above this $250 resistance zone, investors could see its price travel to as high as $360 over the next few weeks. This would represent an over 80% surge from the current price point. Can Whales Push AAVE To $250? As of this writing, the price of AAVE is hovering around the $200 mark, reflecting an over 6% decline in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the AAVE price is up by 4.3% on the weekly timeframe. While the DeFi coin is far away from the critical $250 mark, the appropriate positive catalysts might be all it needs to cross this level in a few days. One such catalyst that could prove crucial is the rising activity of AAVE whales in recent days. Data from Santiment shows that the AAVE token saw the largest increase in the amount of $100,000 whale transactions over the past week. The number of these large transactions skyrocketed by more than 267% in the highlighted period.

The drop, which slashed his $400 billion net worth by 45%, comes as the company struggles with declining sales in, a shrinking customer base, and political backlash in every single market out there. Now Tesla’s stock has been falling for months, but the latest crash has intensified concerns. The company reported declining vehicle sales worldwide in its latest earnings report, with deliveries down 1% last year—its first drop in over a decade—despite the EV market growing by 25%. In America, Tesla sales fell 7% in 2023 and continued dropping another 2% in early 2024, according to Wards Intelligence. In Germany, Tesla registrations collapsed 76.3% in February. France saw a 26% decline. Over in China, Tesla’s deliveries plunged 49% from last year to 30,688 cars in February, per Tesla’s own data. Elon Musk with “best buddy” president Donald Trump at SpaceX’s mega rocket Starship lift off for a test flight from Starbase. Source: AP, File/Brandon Bell Tesla’s stock soared after Trump won the 2024 election, fueled by expectations that Elon’s influence would bring business-friendly policies. Investors also bet on Tesla’s AI and robotics projects, including the 2026 launch of its first fully self-driving car. But Tesla’s stock has since dropped 35%, wiping out most of those gains. Former Tesla enthusiasts are also abandoning the brand. Bob Eckert, a longtime Tesla fan, said he started questioning his decision to own a Model Y after Elon aligned himself with Trump. “As the days and weeks went on, we realized it was not something we could afford to support, even if we lost money,” he said. He sold the car in February, losing $3,000 in the process but replacing it with a Ford Mustang Mach-E. Ford even offered him 0% financing and a $1,000 cash bonus for switching from Tesla. For some, Elon’s politics were the final straw. Larry Boughton, a 76-year-old retired mortgage banker from Houston, said he canceled his reservations for two Cybertrucks in January. “As soon as he started doing all this stuff that Trump wanted him to do, I didn’t want to be a part of it,” he said. “I actually own some Tesla stock, and I’m thinking of selling that as well.” Customers are walking away from Tesla Elon has become a liability, and the shareholders are not happy with him. His political endorsements and controversial personal life are pushing buyers away. He literally backed Germany’s horrendous far-right AfD party publicly, then did what many in the world see as a Nazi salute. As if those weren’t bad enough, he was exposed for having yet another baby mama, who is not only already married, but also leaked their private messages that do not paint Elon in the most respectful of lights. The last straw for Tesla shareholders though was when his ex-girlfriend and mother of his three children Grimes publicly pleaded with him on X to please reach out to her about their sick child. Elon ignored her, which only harmed his reputation even more. Grimes begs for Elon Musk’s attention amid child’s medical crisis. Source: X You can’t claim to belong in the conservative party that lauds family values over anything, and then be estranged from all your baby mamas and children. Now most Tesla stock owners see Elon as nothing but a loser. Back in 2022, 22% of car buyers said they would consider Tesla. By mid-2023, that dropped to 7%, according to Strategic Vision, whose president, Alexander Edwards, said, “At this point, we don’t see any signs of recovery.” Some customers say it’s not even just about the cars anymore. Garth Ancier, a TV executive from Los Angeles, recalled a conversation with other Tesla owners about how driving a Tesla feels like “driving a big red MAGA hat”. That was over a year ago. Now, he’s trying to sell his Model X. “If not for his behavior, I’d probably stick with a Tesla,” he reportedly told WSJ. Protests have started popping up at Tesla showrooms in the US and Europe after Elon called for mass firings of federal workers and backed a far-right German party. Tesla’s Supercharger stations have even been vandalized, with spray-painted swastikas appearing in multiple locations. Protesters gathered earlier this month outside a Tesla showroom in New York. Source: Wall Street Journal Elon continues to alienate Tesla’s customer base Tesla has always had a strong customer base, but political tensions are shifting the brand’s appeal. Republicans are now more likely to buy a Tesla than Democrats, flipping the company’s long-standing demographic trend. Survey data from Morning Consult shows that 23% of Democrats were interested in buying a Tesla in August 2023, but as of February 2024, that number has dropped to 13%.Meanwhile, Republican interest jumped from 15% to 26% in the same period, per the survey. Meanwhile, 63% of those surveyed in December 2023 said they wouldn’t even consider a Tesla, up 10 percentage points from earlier in the year. The survey data also shows that sales collapsed in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Dallas—key cities for Tesla’s early success—but increased in Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and Miami-Ft. Lauderdale. Even inside Tesla, employees are questioning Elon’s leadership. Jared Ottmann, a supply-chain engineer, said in a LinkedIn post that he had raised concerns about Elon’s political direction “multiple times” with managers, HR, legal compliance, and investor relations. “The silence from Tesla is deafening,” he wrote. Shortly after, he was fired. Others are also speaking out. Thomas Temme, a senior software engineer in Germany, said Elon’s political shift is undermining Tesla’s mission. “Elon now supports political actors who not only don’t care about the mission but who proactively deny climate change and have a history of fighting everything Tesla stands for,” he also told WSJ. Tesla’s Berlin factory becomes ground zero for controversy Tensions escalated some more when Elon was caught on video during that Nazi salute I was just telling you about. He hasn’t commented directly on the incident but dismissed critics by saying, “The ‘everyone is Hitler’ attack is sooo tired.” Elon Musk’s alleged Nazi salute. Source: Elon Musk X/Twitter Activists quickly projected an image of Elon making the gesture onto Tesla’s Berlin factory, with the word “heil” next to it. Meanwhile, Tesla owners in the US started finding flyers on their cars urging them to sell. Police in Arcata, California, reported at least four Tesla drivers receiving threatening messages on their windshields. Employees inside Tesla’s Palo Alto engineering office are reportedly worried about the impact of Elon’s behavior on hiring and recruitment, according to WSJ. Anil Patel, an engineer at Tesla for more than four years, left the company in December 2023. His resignation email read: “Elon’s company leadership and political actions are the biggest reasons I’m leaving Tesla.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

But there’s a whole new wave of cryptos that are shaking things up, and you’ve probably heard of Near Protocol. However, if you blinked, you might’ve missed its prime moment. While Near Protocol had a lot of potential early on, it’s clear that its momentum has slowed. That’s where Qubetics comes in. If you’re still on the hunt for the most popular cryptocurrency in 2025, Qubetics is here, and it’s not just any project—it’s positioned for some major significant returns. Qubetics is solving real-world problems in a way that Near Protocol couldn’t keep up with. As cryptos like Near Protocol start to lose their edge, Qubetics is proving it’s got what it takes to lead the charge with a real-world asset tokenization marketplace and a non-custodial multi-chain wallet that will make crypto easier and more accessible to the masses. With Qubetics’ presale in full swing and analysts predicting impressive returns, this is the top crypto to buy if you want to make some serious moves in 2025. It’s your chance to get in early on a coin that’s still in its prime. Qubetics: The Most Popular Cryptocurrency to Buy in 2025 Here’s the thing about Qubetics—it’s not just another coin. It’s the top crypto to buy in 2025 because it’s tackling real-world problems that have plagued earlier projects, including Near Protocol. One of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics is its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, which addresses a critical gap in the crypto space: ease of use and security. A Seamless Multi-Chain Wallet Whether you’re a crypto newbie or a pro, the Qubetics wallet simplifies managing assets across multiple blockchains. From Bitcoin and Ethereum to lesser-known altcoins, it offers a smooth, user-friendly experience—no more juggling multiple platforms. Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics’ tokenization marketplace is a game-changer. Businesses, professionals, and individuals can tokenize assets like real estate, fine art, and intellectual property, unlocking new financial opportunities. Imagine selling fractional shares of real estate or artwork globally—Qubetics makes it possible. Qubetics Presale & Price Predictions Currently in its 24th crypto presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 497 million tokens, raising $14.7 million. Analysts predict TICS could hit $1 post-presale and surge to $10–$15 after the mainnet launch. At just $0.0976 per token, this opportunity won’t last long. Near Protocol: A Missed Opportunity in 2025 If you had your eye on Near Protocol a while ago, you might’ve been intrigued by its promise of scalability and speed. It was quickly touted as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies to watch. But, let’s be real—it’s been a rough road for Near Protocol. While it solved some of the biggest issues Ethereum faced, like high gas fees and slow transaction speeds, it failed to keep up with the wave of new technologies and projects that are reshaping the landscape in 2025. For a while, Near Protocol’s innovative technology gave it a leg up, but the crypto market has evolved. Other coins have stepped in with more robust solutions and real-world applications that Near Protocol simply doesn’t have. Projects like Qubetics are taking the lessons learned from Near Protocol and evolving them further. Near Protocol just can’t compete with Qubetics’ ability to integrate asset tokenization and provide a multi-chain experience in the way Qubetics does. Plus, as blockchain technology advances, coins that can’t adapt and offer real-world solutions risk falling by the wayside, which is exactly what’s happening with Near Protocol.

Crypto.news interviewed top women executives at blockchain and crypto firms to gather their insights, to unpack the recent developments with these leaders. Table of Contents Rachel Conlan, Global CMO, Binance Chrissy Hill, Chief Counsel/Interim COO, Parity Technologies Kyla Curley, Certified Cryptocurrency Forensic Investigator and Partner, StoneTurn Agne Linge, Head of Growth, WeFi Rachel Conlan, Global CMO, Binance Rachel Conlan opens with comments on Binance’s growth trajectory, fueled by increasing crypto adoption and institutional interest in the U.S. Conlan says that in Latin America alone, Binance recorded a 116% surge in crypto adoption in 2024 and reached 55 million users. 95% of these users plan to expand their holdings in 2025 as Binance surpasses 250 million registered users. With a mission of onboarding 1 billion users, the cryptocurrency exchange maintains optimism, expecting positive regulatory shifts and further institutional adoption in the U.S. Conlan said in the interview: “U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance has reignited global interest, potentially acting as a catalyst for increased adoption and regulatory clarity. With the approval of Bitcoin ETFs boosting investor confidence, Binance is poised to support the growing interest in the market, reinforcing its role as a preferred platform for both retail and institutional users.” Discussing the ongoing Bitcoin price cycle’s top narrative, memecoins, Conlan says: “Memecoins have definitely lowered the barrier to entry for new participants in crypto trading, attracting and engaging a diverse audience with their viral and trendy appeal and community-driven narratives. While some memecoins may fade with market cycles, the industry has progressed beyond a mere trend.” The CMO highlights how few memecoin projects have expanded their ecosystems and offered features like staking and decentralized exchanges, signifying a shift toward sustainability. Along with growing institutional interest, they could soon be recognized as a legitimate asset class, according to Conlan. “Memecoins may continue to play an important role in the crypto ecosystem, functioning as both an entry point for new investors and a driving force for greater crypto adoption.” When asked about ETF approvals in 2025 and whether traders should prepare for Dogecoin, Cardano, XRP, Solana ETFs being approved in H1 this year, Conlan said that the industry remains optimistic. “With increasing institutional interest and regulatory clarity, the industry is optimistic about the expansion of ETF offerings to include other major digital assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA). These potential ETF approvals would mark a significant step in the broader institutionalization of crypto, bringing increased liquidity and legitimacy to these assets. However, approvals may depend on evolving SEC policies and market conditions.” Binance’s CMO believes that Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve, and related executive orders have sparked meaningful discussions about the role of digital assets in the future of finance. She further mentions that the initiative reflects growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as a strategic asset class, highlighting the need for the U.S. to remain at the forefront of innovation in blockchain technology. “While the proposal to build a Strategic Crypto Reserve faces important discussions in Congress, we hope to see constructive dialogue between policymakers, regulators, and industry stakeholders. Constructive collaboration can help shape a framework that ensures security, stability, and economic benefits for all. As global interest in digital assets continues to rise, countries are exploring regulatory approaches that best suit their markets. We look forward to policies that support technological innovation while balancing market needs and compliance requirements, fostering a more stable and healthy environment for the entire industry,” she said. Adding to her thoughts on the Strategic Crypto Reserve, Rachel told Crypto.news: “If implemented, such an initiative could lead to increased institutional and retail participation, further cementing crypto’s role as a mainstream financial asset. Binance is prepared to support this evolution by ensuring liquidity, security, and accessibility for traders globally. This will represent a pivotal moment for the industry, and Binance looks forward to contributing its expertise and experience in driving crypto adoption forward. A clear regulatory path, government engagement, and increased institutional confidence will play a crucial role in shaping the future of digital assets and Binance is ready to support this transformation at a global scale.” You might also like: Jake Chervinsky: SBR and stockpile “not enough” to make U.S. crypto capital of the world Chrissy Hill, Chief Counsel/Interim COO, Parity Technologies Crypto.news interviewed Chrissy Hill of Parity.io, a core blockchain infrastructure company known for creating Polkadot. Hill shed light on the groundbreaking White House Crypto Summit event, the regulatory landscape in the U.S., Polkadot’s initiatives and what to make of the rising institutional adoption of crypto. Hill considers Trump’s White House Crypto Summit to be “the highest level of political support for the crypto industry.” Commenting on the Strategic Crypto Reserve, Hill explains how centralization vs. decentralization play a key role in token selection and that the announcement has acted as a “Geopolitical driver.” Hill is quoted as saying: “The U.S. is positioning itself as a forward-thinking leader in digital world, and the initial token selection (e.g., Cardano, Solana) reflects the “Made in USA” concept. The discussion remains open for other tokens to join the strategic reserve.” When asked about the upcoming SEC crypto roundtable and the financial regulator’s shifting stance on litigation against crypto firms and exchanges, Hill stresses the importance of all three branches, the executive, legislative and judicial, in shaping crypto policy. “The timeline for crypto legislation (e.g., Genius Act, Fit 21) has been pushed back to year-end. There is a critical need for educating policymakers on digital assets fundamentals and the Polkadot Blockchain Academy is running a UK pilot in April, with plans to expand globally.” Commenting on SEC guidance on memecoins, Parity’s Chief Counsel explains that it provides clarity but doesn’t address the speculative nature of the tokens. Hill recommends traders do their own research before investing in memecoins. Hill concludes the interview with Polkadot’s technology and roadmap for 2025, stating that, “the focus is on a multi-chain world, interoperability, scalability, and security. The project’s long-term approach emphasizes innovation and Web3 principles, with an aim to attract diverse stakeholders: builders, users, institutions, and governments.” Hill is confident that altcoins have the potential to see similar interest as institutions have shown in Bitcoin treasury holdings and ETF investments. Parity’s interim COO identifies Trump administration’s crypto-friendly appointments (e.g., Jonathan Gould to OCC) as the foundation to potentially setting global benchmarks in other jurisdictions like the EU, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, that are reviewing crypto regulations.” Chrissy advises women in crypto to embrace curiosity and open-mindedness in exploring new areas. She quotes Sun Tzu in her chat with Crypto.news and says, “Opportunities multiply as you seize them – Sun Tzu.” Hill encourages women to recognize that the digital world (blockchain, AI, robotics, IoT) offers numerous opportunities and not be afraid to enter new spaces, as everyone is starting from a similar point. You might also like: David Sacks downplays Trump’s altcoin mention after Bitcoin reserve EO Kyla Curley, Certified Cryptocurrency Forensic Investigator and Partner, StoneTurn Kyla Curley, a leader in crypto forensic investigation, has over two decades of experience in financial investigations and business litigation. Curley discussed expectations from the upcoming SEC crypto roundtable, crypto regulation in the U.S., memecoins and institutional interest in crypto with Crypto.news. Curley doesn’t expect a significant downturn in litigation against crypto firms, even as the SEC warms up to exchanges and drops lawsuits. She said, “There is no doubt that the Trump Administration, and the SEC as an extension, has rolled out the welcome mat to the crypto industry from day one. The Administration has hit the pause button on certain enforcement actions and policies, but the bottom line is this: fraud is not good for business, and the industry wants to work with The Administration to ensure the business-side thrives. So, of course the SEC is going to support and encourage innovation so crypto can take the next step in their maturity in the financial world, but I don’t think there is going to be a significant downturn in litigation, if potential enforcement is merited. At the end of the day, U.S. consumer and investor demand for crypto is driven in large part by confidence in the security of the market. An inadequately regulated market with few guardrails will drive consumers and investors to send their money to safer, more regulated markets.” Sharing her thoughts on the pace of crypto regulation and litigation by the U.S. financial regulator, the StoneTurn partner says, “The prior SEC Chair undertook a “regulation by enforcement” stance, which may have been intended to install guardrails around the industry, but led to a spike in litigation and ultimately drove some of the crypto investment out of the U.S. The Trump Administration is telling us they are looking to find a middle ground and find that balance in crypto regulation. We’ve already seen action here through SEC guidance in January, Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 122, which broke down one of the greatest barriers to widespread adoption of crypto and other digital assets. SAB 122 repealed a widely unpopular reporting requirement contained in SAB 121 which placed significant and largely infeasible requirements on any financial institution wanting to custody digital assets for their customers.” Curley sees no intrinsic value in memecoins, guiding traders on the topic of meme tokens and the recent SEC guidance, the executive said: “Generally speaking, memecoins have no intrinsic value, so those launching projects should be aware that they are entering a space that is highly sensitive to any change in public perception and therefore more susceptible to potential market manipulation. A single social media post can impact the price, and the greater the audience, the greater the impact on the token.” As traditional financial institutions warm up to crypto, Curley says, “As I said before, business doesn’t like fraud. I think the traditional financial “gatekeepers” realize the inherent value of the industry, but they were always weary of the prevalence of “bad” business. As long as there is a balance between innovation and regulation, larger financial institutions will likely deepen their relationship with crypto in 2025 and beyond.” Agne Linge, Head of Growth, WeFi Linge observes the volatility in the crypto market and comments on the sentiment and unmet expectations of traders when referring to the U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve. Linge tells Crypto.news, “The tariff and trade war has continued to create headwinds for the US stock market and, by extension, risk assets like Bitcoin. Despite President Trump’s postponement of the tariff on Mexico, investors still considered the market too risky to bet on. The subpar strategic Bitcoin reserve move triggered the uncertainty in the crypto market. With the Executive Order directing agencies to consolidate seized Bitcoin to form the reserve, crypto investors see the move as a trick, as no new BTC purchase was announced.” Linge highlights how, despite the knee-jerk reaction from investors, the Bitcoin reserve mandate authorizes the acquisition of BTC through means that will not cost taxpayers’ money. She explains, “The available options in this regard include Bitcoin bonds and the sales of its gold reserve to fund more purchases. In the long term, the Bitcoin reserve shift might benefit the coin. This thesis hinges on a possible race it has triggered that may see other sovereign nations make similar moves. Pricing in the long term prospect is hard for now, and in the short term, investors are focused on the non-farm payroll report. This report will serve as a major insight into the Federal Reserve’s next monetary actions, which can go a long way in pacifying investors.” Linge is no outsider to the crypto market and has navigated previous cycles where the market faced intense volatility. The recent surge in crypto liquidations and Bitcoin flash crash highlighted the market’s uncertainty, she remarks. “Amid this price action, the conviction for sustainable growth in the near term remains low as significant headwinds lie ahead. Despite the market’s long-term prospects, the headwinds from the events of the week, the tariff announcements, Crypto Summit and the FTX repayment scheduled cannot be ignored and may trigger more volatility in the coming days,” she says.

From explosive launches to viral narratives, these digital assets continue to capture the imagination of investors hunting for the next big thing. Among them, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making headlines with its thrilling adventure-based presale, while Pepe and Bonk are also stirring up excitement with their latest developments. Arctic Pablo Coin has just entered its 13th phase, ChillVille, with its presale price now at $0.00007, promising a staggering 11,285.71% ROI from this stage to its listing price of $0.008. Meanwhile, Pepe is making waves with its latest exchange listing, and Bonk is attracting attention with its increasing trading volume. This article will cover the latest updates and breakthroughs of Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Pepe Coin (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK)—three of the top meme coins with 1000X potential. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Explosive Token Burn: Boosting Scarcity & Value Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has implemented an aggressive token burn mechanism, ensuring a deflationary supply and long-term value appreciation. Every week, unsold tokens from the presale are permanently removed from circulation, reducing overall supply and increasing scarcity. This strategic burn system continues even after the presale, eliminating any leftover tokens and creating a controlled economic model. With each burn event recorded transparently on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), investors can verify the token reduction, reinforcing trust and stability within the community. By consistently decreasing the available supply, APC positions itself as one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. This structured approach not only enhances price stability but also fosters long-term sustainability. With fewer tokens available as the presale progresses, demand naturally increases, driving up APC’s value. The project’s commitment to continuous burns ensures that early investors reap significant benefits as the circulating supply shrinks. This deflationary model makes APC an enticing investment, especially with its rapid growth in the crypto market. Arctic Pablo Coin Reaches ChillVille: Prices Surge at $0.00007! Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC ) has entered its 13th phase, ChillVille, continuing its high-speed journey through various locations. After wrapping up its expedition in Penguinopolis in under six days, the presale has already surged past $1.78 million in total raised funds. This rapid progression highlights the immense demand for APC, as each phase sells out faster than expected. At its current price of just $0.00007, early investors are locking in an incredible ROI of 11,285.71% compared to the listing price of $0.008. The excitement surrounding Arctic Pablo’s journey is at an all-time high, as investors rush to secure their tokens before the next price jump. With each new location, Arctic Pablo Coin becomes more valuable, and ChillVille is no exception. As the presale nears its final destination, the opportunity to buy at a low entry price is disappearing fast. Given the exponential price increases with every phase, waiting too long could mean missing out on the next big meme coin presale . The limited supply and continuous burns only add to the scarcity, making now the perfect time to join Arctic Pablo Coin before it advances to its next thrilling stage. Pepe Coin Gains Momentum with Latest Developments Pepe Coin has recently experienced a resurgence in investor interest, following major ecosystem upgrades and increased trading volume. With new DeFi integrations, Pepe Coin is expanding its utility beyond just being a meme coin. These advancements have led to heightened on-chain activity, bringing renewed confidence among holders. Additionally, a significant uptick in whale accumulation has fueled bullish momentum, with analysts predicting further price surges in the coming weeks. This steady growth highlights Pepe Coin’s ability to remain relevant in the ever-competitive meme coin space. Beyond technical upgrades, the Pepe community remains a driving force behind its success. Social media platforms are buzzing with discussions about Pepe’s future, with many expecting it to break past key resistance levels. As one of the most recognizable meme coins, its strong branding and continuous updates make it a contender for long-term growth. With renewed enthusiasm and strategic developments, Pepe Coin is proving its staying power in the meme coin sector. Bonk’s Ecosystem Expansion: Paving the Way for Growth Bonk has been making waves with its recent ecosystem expansions, solidifying its place as one of the top-performing meme coins. The project’s latest developments include increased integration with major DeFi protocols, allowing users to stake and earn rewards. This move has attracted a surge of new investors, contributing to Bonk’s growing market capitalization. Additionally, strategic partnerships with NFT projects have further bolstered Bonk’s appeal, making it more than just a meme coin. These innovations are positioning Bonk for sustained growth in the crypto market. Furthermore, Bonk’s trading volume has spiked significantly, reflecting heightened interest from both retail and institutional investors. Analysts believe that this increasing momentum could lead to a new price breakout in the coming weeks. With an expanding ecosystem and a dedicated community, Bonk continues to show strong bullish potential. As the meme coin trend gains traction, Bonk’s ability to evolve and adapt sets it apart from other contenders in the space. Final Thoughts: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out With meme coins surging in popularity, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC), Pepe, and Bonk are leading the charge. While Pepe and Bonk continue to expand their ecosystems and drive investor interest, Arctic Pablo Coin’s unique presale structure and deflationary tokenomics make it an unparalleled opportunity. Its aggressive token burn strategy and rapid presale progression add to its growing appeal. The 13th phase, ChillVille, offers investors a rare chance to enter at a low price of $0.00007 before the price surges further. With a staggering 11,285.71% potential ROI, Arctic Pablo Coin is shaping up to be one of the top new meme coins with 1000X potential. Don’t miss out—this meme coin presale won’t last forever!

41353015,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689638,1741477953,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41353015.jpeg,Trump transforms crypto from ‘oppressed industry’ to ‘centerpiece’ of US economic strategy,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-changes-crypto-from-oppressed-industry/,"According to Crypto.com, Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, President Donald Trump has embraced cryptocurrency as a core component of his economic strategy, representing a huge shift in U.S. blockchain policy. On March 7, Trump wooed the cryptocurrency industry’s elite at the White House, hosting a first-of-its-kind summit focused on his plans for a government-owned stockpile of digital assets. He welcomed a wide range of industry players to the event. The summit marked a “truly historic day at the White House,” Marszalek said in a March 8 X post . Trump’s crypto policies spark regulatory shifts and industry optimism Marszalek lauded Trump for reversing the policies (Operation Chokepoint 2.0) that he claimed resulted in crypto and tech companies being denied banking services during the Biden administration. Crypto firms may be on the verge of securing banking partners after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) softened its stance on banks engaging with crypto. The move came just hours after Trump promised to end a long-running crackdown that restricted the industry from financial services. During the summit, President Trump announced the establishment of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” a cache of Bitcoin acquired primarily through legal asset seizures. The move has helped “normalize” Bitcoin as an instrument in the overall U.S. financial and monetary system. A “Digital Asset Stockpile” was also established to process other cryptocurrencies acquired through similar means. The administration’s boldness has given new momentum to legislative attempts on Capitol Hill. Two pieces of legislation are literally connected: the Stablecoin Bill and the Market Structure Bill. All these bills provide recommendations on establishing holistic frameworks to regulate digital assets to achieve regulatory clarity that encourages innovation while protecting investors. Kris Marszalek, the CEO of Crypto.com, said the industry was optimistic that “thoughtful conversations” with the relevant regulators—the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)—would continue. Trump’s team lays the groundwork for U.S. Bitcoin integration David Sacks, the administration’s “crypto czar,” along with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, were praised for setting the country’s crypto policy. Marszalek’s remarks follow Trump’s signing of an executive order on March 7, outlining a plan to establish a Bitcoin reserve using cryptocurrency seized in government criminal cases rather than actively acquiring Bitcoin through market purchases. While no direct BTC acquisitions were announced, the order stated that the U.S. Treasury and Commerce secretaries could explore “budget-neutral strategies” to expand the reserve—provided these strategies do not impose additional costs on American taxpayers. Some analysts view the U.S. Bitcoin reserve plan as the first significant step toward Bitcoin’s integration into the global financial system. “The US has taken its first real step toward integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance, acknowledging its role as a foundational asset for a more stable and sound monetary system,” said Joe Burnett, head of market research at Unchained. Though Trump has expressed his commitment to advancing crypto innovation in the U.S., implementing regulatory frameworks takes time, and establishing the “right regulatory tone” will be essential for his administration, according to Anastasija Plotnikova, co-founder and CEO of Fideum, a regulatory and blockchain infrastructure firm focused on institutions.

While responding to the White House official X account promoting Bitcoin, he revealed this on his X account. The Samson Mow Prediction and Rationale According to Samson, Bitcoin will reach $1 million much faster than expected. In the past, Mow has popularized the idea that he projects the token’s $1 million milestone by 2031. However, he is changing his position now, as President Donald Trump’s executive orders are rapidly evolving the US crypto ecosystem. Speaking on the above, Mow pointed to increased government backing as a major factor. He stated that the conditions for a price surge are aligning with the White House’s current pro-crypto and Bitcoin stance. Meanwhile, an X user reacted to Mow’s comments that $1 million by 2031 is conservative. Still, Mow believes that the rate at which everything is happening is fast, which might bring BTC’s price closer to the mark soon. White House Influence on Bitcoin and Regulation It is worth mentioning that one major factor pushing the current Bitcoin optimism is the recent support from the White House. For context, at the first-ever White House Crypto Summit , President Donald Trump declared his commitment to making the U.S. a global leader in cryptocurrency. Once things are certain in the global cryptocurrency community, America will become more welcoming to crypto businesses and Web3 entities. This is unlike the previous administration, which was more restrictive in its approach to managing digital assets. During the Crypto Summit, industry leaders praised Trump for reversing regulatory crackdowns on crypto firms. The SEC has since closed several legal actions against major crypto firms, proof of its enforcement pivot. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This means the U.S. government will HODL its Bitcoin holdings instead of selling them. The order also allow the Treasury Department to explore ways to acquire more Bitcoin, which was considered a sign of the government’s long-term commitment to the asset. Current Bitcoin Outlook and Key Catalyst Since the beginning of the month, BTC’s price has hovered between $80,000 and $90,000, despite the increasing demand from institutional investors. With adoption, especially through spot Bitcoin ETFs, growing globally, more businesses and nations are warming up to BTC. This is why market experts like Samson Mow believe the U.S. government’s latest position could encourage other countries to follow the trend. If achieved, this could further accelerate Bitcoin’s growth. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price was changing hands for $85,093, down by 0.69% in 24 hours.

Remittix Blasts Past the Competition With Unique PayFi Offering,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/dogecoin-price-prediction-is-070-on-the-cards-for-doge-remittix-blasts-past-the-competition-with-unique-payfi-offering,"The cryptocurrency space has recently become interested in Dogecoin after whale addresses demonstrated increased attention toward the world’s most famous meme coin. People are discussing a potential price increase for DOGE but doubt rises because it struggles to maintain support levels. The market displays erratic behavior through both its positive and negative signals since positive signs disappear quickly. However, not everyone is betting on meme coins. A new challenger, offering a streamlined method of making everyday transactions, is stepping into the limelight. Remittix, a PayFi-focused project—poised to transform cross-border settlements—could capture the momentum if Dogecoin stalls short of its goals. Dogecoin’s Whale Moves and Exchange Withdrawals Recently, analysts noted that big investors purchased 150 million DOGE at the edge of a strong support level. Others have interpreted the same as confidence in the asset even though the price continues to oscillate in a confined price range. Dogecoin is oscillating around the $0.19 mark, noting a subtle dip in value but confirming a 50% spike in trading volume. Support around $0.185 has so far held, but DOGE must break out above $0.21 on the daily chart if it is to stand a chance of hitting $0.25. Technicals appear split, with the Relative Strength Index at the mid-30s, a sign that momentum is still lacking. Holders' withdrawal of $43 million worth of DOGE is also quizzing analysts since they choose to hold their coins outside exchange platforms instead of selling them. Multiple indicators present a mixture of positive indicators that suggest optimism control exists, yet achieving $0.70 dollar price level demands a complete return of bullish market conditions. DOGE/USDT Source: Tradingview Remittix Blasts Past the Competition With Unique PayFi Offering While Dogecoin’s fate hinges on investor mood, Remittix is catching eyes with its practical vision for crypto payments. Priced at $0.0694, Remittix has raised over $13.7 million in its presale and sold over 516 million tokens—a milestone that sets it apart from purely speculative projects. With its unique twist on PayFi, Remittix addresses common crypto-to-fiat conversion issues by developing efficient cross-border solutions for business and personal transactions. For example, a specialty coffee exporter who wants to receive digital payments from international distributors usually faces delays with traditional banking. The conventional payment methods function at high cost levels while maintaining slow bank transaction times. Through its real-time settlement provision, Remittix enables businesses to get their local currency even when multiple transactions are traditionally needed. Users support Remittix because they view it as a logical option compared to meme-generated market swings, which they believe real-world solutions will surpass momentarily. The interest levels among investors have surged because they pursue tokens that demonstrate practical use. Remittix enthusiasts believe its adoption rate will shape its price direction more than viral memes or single tweet adoption. The project stands out from its market rivals because small businesses that handle cross-border transactions provide everyday support. Real-World Utility or Meme Coin Hype: Which Comes Out on Top? Dogecoin’s community-driven approach has served it well, but reaching lofty targets like $0.70 may require more than whale buys. Traders want sustained upside volume, decisive breaches of key resistance, and a shift in the RSI that confirms bullish strength. If these conditions don’t align, DOGE may linger near $0.19, unable to capitalize on whale activity. In contrast, a PayFi-focused project can thrive even when memes lose steam. Remittix’s price gains and sizable presale reflect a push for seamless crypto payments, an industry gap that remains largely unfilled. Business owners and freelancers alike need efficient ways to settle funds, and Remittix offers that simplicity—an appealing factor for those seeking stability over hype. Curious about how a payment-centered token could reshape your crypto experience?Take a look at Remittix and discover why practical solutions might leave meme coins in the rearview mirror—even if Dogecoin manages a short-term bounce.

The crypto jungle is a wild ride, but guess what? The real winners are those who snag the next big thing before the hype train goes full speed. This week, you’ve got three heavy hitters: BTFD Coin, rallying an army of Bulls in its insane presale run; Snek, a slithery Cardano-based gem that’s shaking up the ecosystem; and SPX6900, a quirky yet promising contender with innovative tokenomics. But first, here’s the golden ticket: BTFD Coin’s Stage 14 presale is almost sold out, and every token you buy right now is DOUBLED thanks to the LAUNCH100 bonus code. That’s right—twice the gains just for moving fast. Over $6.27 million raised, 71 billion BTFD tokens sold, and only two stages left before this beast hits the open market. BTFD Coin – The Bulls Squad Leading the Meme Coin Charge In the meme coin universe, hype isn’t enough—you need a story, a squad, and a movement. That’s where BTFD Coin stomps in with the Bulls Squad , a powerhouse lineup of mascots who represent every type of investor. Whether you’re a cautious newcomer (Baby Bull), a seasoned crypto warrior (Raging Bull), a numbers-driven strategist (Nerdy Bull), or the ultimate community leader (Peoples Bull), there’s a bull with your name on it. Now, why does this matter? Because community-driven tokens with strong narratives perform best—think Dogecoin, but with an actual financial strategy. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme; it’s a mindset, an identity, and a movement for those who buy the dip and win the game. It’s built for market turbulence, giving traders a haven when volatility strikes. Right now, the crypto market is throwing curveballs, but BTFD investors? They’re charging through the chaos with laser focus. Analysts are already whispering about BTFD Coin skyrocketing to $0.0006 post-launch, and if this bull run gains traction, a moonshot to $0.006 is on the table. That’s a jaw-dropping 3,650% ROI for those smart enough to lock in now at $0.00016 per token. But time’s running out—Stage 14 is closing fast, and once the final two stages wrap up, there’s no rewinding the clock. More Than Just a Meme—It’s Utility Too BTFD Coin isn’t all hype—it’s got staking rewards with 90% APY , a P2E game that rewards players with real tokens, and a community-driven approach that keeps engagement high. But first things first—grab your BTFD tokens now before the LAUNCH100 bonus expires. Double your bag, double your future gains. Go to the Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet – Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter the Bonus Code – Locate the bonus code field, enter LAUNCH100 (in ALL CAPS), and apply it. Enter Purchase Details – Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy. Confirm and Buy – Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Snek – The Cardano Meme Coin That’s Slithering to the Top Not all meme coins live on Ethereum—some thrive on Cardano, and Snek is the king of this ecosystem. Inspired by the snake meme culture that took over Twitter (X), Snek is proving that ADA-based projects can bring massive gains. What makes it stand out? Scarcity. Snek isn’t an inflationary free-for-all like some meme coins. It’s carving a space where community-driven scarcity fuels demand. Plus, it benefits from Cardano’s low fees and fast transactions, making it an easy choice for investors tired of ETH gas wars. Snek’s early backers have already seen triple-digit gains, and with DeFi integrations coming soon, this slithery token might just bite its way into the top new meme coins to invest in this week. SPX6900 – Meme Culture Meets DeFi Innovation Combining token burns, deflationary mechanics, and community rewards, this coin is fusing meme culture with long-term value. Its name is a playful nod to the stock market, but under the hood, it’s bringing serious innovation. The project’s auto-burn mechanism reduces supply over time, meaning early investors might see their holdings gain value just from holding. With a dedicated dev team and a loyal community, SPX6900 is proving that meme coins can be more than just hype—they can be smart investments. Final Thoughts – The Window Is Closing Fast on the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week Meme coin seasons don’t last forever, but those who jump in at the right time come out on top. BTFD Coin is leading the charge, backed by its Bulls Squad, insane presale momentum, and double-token bonus with LAUNCH100. Snek is proving that Cardano meme coins have legs (or scales), and SPX6900 is pushing meme innovation to new heights.

Some early investors generated massive profits, but do these coins still have room to develop, or are they past their prime? With industry trends changing, meme coins continue to be popular, but can they be the best cryptos to buy, or should investors look elsewhere? Shiba Inu Price Could Rise With Shibarium Transactions Up Shiba Inu may see a price push-up as activity on Shibarium increases. The network processed 947 million transactions, and based on data from ShibariumScan, it is on pace to hit 1 billion. This is up from the 500 million milestone attained in November. There are also more wallets on Shibarium, up from 100 million in January to more than 124.5 million, indicating growing adoption. More users mean higher transaction volume, which benefits SHIB’s price. A portion of the network's BONE fees is generated to buy and burn SHIB, reducing its supply over time. Although Shibarium still trails behind more extensive layer-2 networks like Arbitrum and Base, its growing adoption makes Shiba Inu one of the best cryptos to buy. As Shibariumexpands, SHIB’s value could increase, further solidifying its position among the best cryptos to buy. Dogecoin Whales Make Big Moves Amid Market Fluctuations Dogecoin (DOGE) is attracting significant attention from large investors. Data from Coinglass , a leading crypto analytics firm, reveals that whales have accumulated 150 million DOGE within three days. This large-scale buying spree occurred while DOGE traded near a key support level of $0.185. The move suggests that big investors see the lower prices as an opportunity and expect a future price surge. DOGE is trading at $0.19, and its trading volume has increased by 50%, showing increased market interest. This increase in activity signals that many traders still view Dogecoin as the best crypto to buy now despite short-term price swings. If momentum continues, DOGE could remain among the best cryptos to buy for those betting on meme coin growth. Dogwifhat Surges 21% as Whale Investments Fuel Market Excitement Dogwifhat (WIF) is making waves in the crypto market, surging 21% in just 24 hours. This rally extends a week-long uptrend, pushing WIF’s total gains to over 30%. Despite a broader market downturn, the WIF price increase is happening, highlighting strong investor confidence. Market data shows a 21% increase in open interest, now valued at $252 million, while trading volume has skyrocketed by 188% to $1.44 billion. This surge in whale accumulation often leads to further price growth, making WIF one of the best cryptos to buy now. If the trend continues, WIF could remain among the best cryptos to buy now for investors looking to ride the meme coin wave. Remittix: Best Crypto to Buy for Huge Profit Potentials Remittix (RTX) is changing international payments by connecting cryptocurrencies and conventional fiat banking. This groundbreaking platform allows users to convert over 100 cryptocurrencies into FIAT currencies and transfer cash into any bank account anywhere. The recipients receive these payments within their FIAT currency without a hint that the payment was set up via cryptocurrency. Remittix (RTX) combines blockchain technology with local payment systems to create a safe and quick worldwide payment solution. This approach improves financial privacy while offering users greater control over their funds without needing needless oversight or third-party interference. Pepe Coin's Potential Surge Amid Growing Investor Interest Pepe Coin (PEPE) has drawn attention recently for its substantial market movements. These days, PEPE trades at approximately $0.000007 per token, with a market cap of more or less $3.01 billion. The 24-hour trading volume is $684.58 million, signaling increased investor activity. Predictions of prices for PEPE are bullish. Forecasts put PEPE for 0.000009 by 2030, an increase of over twenty percent. This optimistic outlook can make PEPE a contender among the best cryptos to buy now. The influx of trading volume and upbeat price forecasts highlight PEPE's rising prominence in the cryptocurrency market. PEPE is probably the best crypto to buy for investors searching for increased growth opportunities. BONK Drops Despite Hype Around ETF Approval BONK has struggled to maintain momentum, and its price is currently around $0.000013. This downturn comes despite growing optimism about the potential approval of a BONKETF. While many expected the ETF speculation to push BONK higher, the token has instead followed the broader meme coin market’s volatility, which some analysts link to recent economic policies, including President Trump’s tariffs. Even with this dip, experts remain hopeful. Analyst Eric Balchunas believes the BONK ETF approval is likely, and if it happens soon, BONK could climb to $0.000031 by May 2025. Join the Remittix Presale Today! Investors have noticed Remittix's potential through its successful presale, which has generated more than $13.6 million. The tokens cost $0.0694, and analysts anticipate significant gains when the platform launches.

Although certain tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain industry mainstays, new projects vie for investor attention with promises of exponential returns. Two such projects, Hedera (HBAR) and Remittix (RTX), have been gaining steam with their respective enterprise adoption and bullish price action, as well as their bid to take over the DeFi landscape with cross-border payments. In this piece, we consider which of the two projects is more likely to be 10x investment by the end of the cycle. Hedera: Taking Aim at a $10 Dream Hedera's recent breakout busted out of a falling wedge pattern established since mid-December, indicating a wider uptrend is in progress. Though a run to $10 is a far-off dream in the future, most analysts view the breakout to establish a near-term target of $0.36—a 50% potential increase from current levels. Technicals are favorable: The RSI re-set at 52 after testing overbought levels, revealing ongoing buyer demand, and the MACD line still slopes higher above its signal line. For the bulls, the large question mark is whether HBAR can overcome overhead resistance, beginning with the 50 Exponential Moving Average (50EMA). The 20EMA has witnessed a few bounce attempts, but the next significant push must clear that 50EMA barrier. If there is sustained buying pressure throughout the weekend, a reversal back toward $0.36 is achievable. Hedera/USDT Daily Chart Breaking above that would set the stage for more forceful returns in 2025, but the likelihood of reaching $10 within a cycle would depend on if and how HBAR is going to make deeper enterprise use cases and maintain hype longer-term. With big players such as IBM, Google, and Boeing becoming part of Hedera's governing council, the project gets legitimized. But to 10x an investment, HBAR must capture retail traders and maintain institutional interest. A steady mix of real partnerships and positive market sentiment might just be the key to making that large $10 vision a reality. Remittix: A DeFi Disruptor Targeting Cross-Border Payments As Hedera prepares itself for a possible 50% growth in the short term, Remittix (RTX) has already surpassed expectations with returns several times greater. The platform has sold more than 516 million tokens and raised more than $13.6 million from its presale price of $0.0734. Early investors are beaming with more than 1000% returns, and analysts forecast an additional 200% growth before the end of March. Remittix's value lies in its practical application in the real world: simplifying $190 trillion of cross-border payments a year. Using local payment networks and the blockchain, users can exchange more than 40 cryptos for fiat, transferring money to bank accounts worldwide for minimal fees. Locked liquidity and a long-term plan to give up contract ownership are meant to assure skittish investors that Remittix is not another fleeting pump. Its presale health solidifies the token's DeFi credentials, with the indication that if Remittix maintains momentum, then it has what it takes to leave other altcoins mired in incremental updates in the dust. Just as XRP in its early days solved a gargantuan financial problem with the potential for faster, cheaper solutions, so does Remittix. While a 10x or higher rise is never guaranteed, initiatives that solve real-world pain points do have a better chance of attracting long-term attention. Once Remittix unlocks its use to merchants, gig economy workers, and international payers, there is potential for a wild price appreciation that could surpass even the most optimistic Hedera projections. Which Is More Likely to 10x This Cycle? Hedera's corporate partners and bullish wedge breakout lend the token some legitimacy and upside. However, the token's road to a $10 price point—equivalent to roughly a 20x from current levels—needs a sustained backdrop of strong partners, good retail pickup, and a raging bull market. Plausible but, with the high market cap and proportionately modest price moves on a daily basis, a ten-fold return on investment may take time and impeccable market conditions. Remittix, on the other hand, tackles a genuine day-to-day problem: remittances. As a more recent entrant, the lower market cap leaves room for more volatile price action to occur, and the token has already paid early investors with over 1000% returns. If the project's payment model gains traction internationally, Remittix could have sustained demand, propelling the token beyond typical DeFi growth projections. While not without risk, its strategy marries crypto's speed with real-world usefulness—a formula that might just deliver the sought-after $1,000-to-$10,000 makeover for bold investors.

41354088,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=709129,1741480221,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Price Forecast: LTF Head And Shoulders Pattern Predicts Crash – Here’s The Target,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-forecast-ltf-head-and-shoulders-pattern-predicts-crash-heres-the-target/,"Tony Severino, a prominent crypto analyst, has shared a new Bitcoin price forecast, suggesting that the pioneer cryptocurrency is on the verge of another major correction. The analyst suggested that the formation of a Lower Time Frame (LTF) Head and Shoulders pattern on the Bitcoin price chart is a potential confirmation of a crash to mid-$80,000. Bitcoin Price Projected To Crash To $83,600 The market’s recent downturn has negatively impacted Bitcoin’s value, prompting less-than-favorable predictions from top analysts. Severino posted on X (formerly Twitter) on March 6 that Bitcoin could soon experience another major pullback to new lows. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides After Trump Signs Strategic Reserve Executive Order The analyst projected that Bitcoin could crash to $84,800 – $83,600. This bearish price outlook is supported by the recent formation of LTF Head and Shoulder pattern on the Bitcoin chart. A Head and Shoulder pattern is a technical analysis formation that usually indicates a potential reversal from bullish to bearish. It appears as three peaks on a price chart, with the middle peak, which is the head, being higher than the others (the shoulders). Notably, the Head and Shoulder pattern is considered one of the most recognizable patterns for projecting a downtrend in a cryptocurrency. In the case of Bitcoin, Severino’s chart illustrates a symmetrical triangle with an internal A-B-C-D-E wave-like structure. The black diagonal lines in the chart form the symmetrical triangle, which indicates lower highs and higher lows. Inside the triangle, red lines form the waves, suggesting that the Bitcoin price may be chopping sideways but with a bias towards completing the triangle. Due to the Head and Shoulder pattern formation, Bitcoin could see its price break down to the lower boundary of the triangle around the mid $80,000 region. This price crash would complete the D wave and possibly test the next critical support area. Once Bitcoin drops to this level, Severino predicts that it could bounce back to new highs. The chart shows that Bitcoin could rally toward the E wave in the triangle, which is positioned around the $90,000 price level. Furthermore, the analyst’s Bitcoin chart indicates another deeper pullback after this price rebound to $90,000. Toward the right side of the chart, an arrow points downwards, suggesting that after the final E wave rally, Bitcoin could drop down towards $83,600 to $80,200. Analyst Warns Of Bear Trap Before Bull Run Finale While many in the crypto market label this massive decline in the Bitcoin price as the beginning of the bear market, others believe that this price crash could be a mere bear trap. A market expert known as ’Crypto Caesar’ predicted that Bitcoin would be on the verge of its final bear trap before entering the last phase of this bull cycle. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Predicts Massive Price Explosion—Is $6.24 Far-Fetched? This implies that Bitcoin is likely to face another sharp decline, shaking out weak hands before surging to a new all-time high. The analyst’s chart predicts that it could top out above $110,000, signaling the end of the bull market.

Chainlink – Who Wins In The Mid-Term Crypto Gains Race?,https://bitzo.com/2025/03/ondo-vs-chainlink-who-wins-in-the-mid-term-crypto-gains-race,"The battle for mid-term crypto gains is heating up between Ondo and Chainlink . Both projects hold promising potential, but which one will come out on top? Dive into this analysis to discover which coin might be poised for impressive growth and become a standout performer in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Ondo’s Volatile Journey: Charting Recovery and Key Levels Over the past month, Ondo experienced a sharp decline of about 26%, contrasting with a robust gain of over 63% in the last six months. The coin moved within a range of roughly 75 cents to $1.37. This performance highlights quick downturns amid longer-term recovery, indicating the asset’s vulnerability to rapid shifts in market sentiment while still holding long-term growth potential. The coin currently trades between roughly $0.75 and $1.37, with key support around $0.51 and resistance near $1.74. Bears exert some pressure as short-term indicators lean slightly negative, despite some oscillator hints of stability. Traders might watch the support zone for signs of reversal while being cautious of resistance at $1.74 when planning entries or exits. Chainlink Shows Mixed Performance Amid Price Fluctuations Chainlink dropped about 18.66% over the last month while showing a strong rally with a 50.77% gain over the past six months. The price action reflects short-term weakness amid long-term upward movement. Past performance indicates volatility with a clear recovery path that bolsters confidence despite recent declines. The current trading range sits between $10.20 and $22.70 with immediate support at $5.58 and resistance near $30.59. Bears currently influence the market as suggested by slightly negative moving average recommendations, although the trend remains unclear. Trading ideas include watching for a breakout above $30.59 or bouncing off support to capture potential gains within these levels. Conclusion In the mid-term, ONDO and LINK both show strong potential for gains. ONDO 's innovative approach attracts attention with its unique offerings. LINK continues to prove its reliability with established utilities and partnerships. ONDO might appeal more to those looking for fresh opportunities, while LINK remains a solid choice for its proven track record. Investors might consider spreading their investments to balance the potential benefits of both. Both coins present promising prospects, but individual preferences and risk appetite will ultimately guide the decision. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The platform will now have a “Key Opinion Leader” tag to help users track and identify these influencers’ wallets. Arkham Intelligence compiled about 950 wallet addresses by March 8 Even before, Arkham provided information on key figures’ transactions, helping users identify market trends or possible price movements. Quite recently, Arkham tracked Ethereum’s founder Vitalik Buterin’s liquidation of about $2.5 million worth of meme coins sent to his wallet for the biotech charity Kanro and even identified Donald’s Trump virtual asset holdings as worth around $10 million in May last year. Now, the platform has added a new tag, “Key Opinion Leader” (KOL), for popular crypto influencers with over 100,000 X followers, which it believes will simplify users’ search and tracking process. By March 8, the platform had compiled over 950 addresses from over 1000 entries, including that of crypto entrepreneurs Justin Sun, Vitalik Buterin and even Donald Trump. Arkham lists a number of key crypto players and their holdings under the KOL tag So far, under the KOL compilation, Tron’s Founder, Justin Sun, leads the list with close to 4 million followers and three distinct wallets. Sun has over $590 million in digital assets in one of his wallets, with roughly $435 million in Tron. Following Sun on the list is Vitalik Buterin, who has roughly $5.7 million followers on X and roughly $523 million in Ethereum. After this, Sun pops up again on the list, with two of his wallets holding about $473 million and $44.20 million in crypto. Then Hong Qi Yu, the founder and CEO of Tokenize Xchange follows with over 723000 X followers and over $28.31 million in crypto holdings. Additionally, Arthur Hayes, the founder of Bitmex, is on the KOL list, with almost 640000 followers and about $18.32 million in digital assets.

With a record-breaking $1.60 million presale and $200K invested by whales in 24 hours, Web3Bay is more than a crypto project; it’s a movement. Traditional platforms are on notice as Web3Bay’s decentralized approach threatens to change the way we shop online. At its core, Web3Bay offers a radical but simple idea: decentralize e-commerce. By combining Amazon’s marketplace and Bitcoin’s decentralized principles, it promises lower fees, faster transactions, and more privacy. With consumer trust in traditional platforms waning, Web3Bay seems like the next logical step for online shopping. Legacy Giants Profited for Years—But at What Cost? For over two decades, Amazon and eBay have controlled online shopping, generating trillions in revenue while collecting transaction fees and personal data. This came at the cost of privacy, fair seller payments, and marketplace fairness. Sellers lose up to 15% of each sale, buyers face hidden fees, and users deal with confusing policies. History shows that older systems are vulnerable to disruption. Consider how: Uber changed the transportation industry with its decentralized driver network. Airbnb disrupted the hotel industry, offering cheaper options and new income for homeowners. Spotify redefined music distribution, leaving physical CDs behind. Each of these shifts democratized access. Now, Web3Bay is aiming to do the same for e-commerce with blockchain technology. Why Web3Bay’s Timing Couldn’t Be Better Timing is critical, and Web3Bay’s entry aligns with major global trends: ✅ E-commerce continues to grow, projected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030. ✅ Data privacy concerns are rising, with users pushing back against exploitation. ✅ Crypto adoption is expanding, with governments and institutions embracing it. With increasing transaction fees and growing centralization by major platforms, the demand for alternatives is clear. Web3Bay steps in with peer-to-peer transactions, community governance, and no middlemen. Why Investors Are Paying Attention Web3Bay’s presale price is $0.00524 per token. Upon launch, it’s expected to reach $0.1959—a potential 3,633% ROI for early buyers. Here’s what that means: 💵 A $1,000 investment today = 219,100 tokens 🚀 At launch: 219,100 × $0.1959 = $42,900 That’s a 42x return, surpassing Bitcoin’s early gains or Ethereum’s 2017 surge. If Web3Bay secures even a fraction of the trillion-dollar e-commerce market, returns could exceed projections. Speculative? Yes. But Bitcoin was doubted in 2013, and Amazon was dismissed as a niche bookstore. The outcome of those stories speaks for itself. Why Whales Are Making Big Moves Crypto whales—those influential investors who shape markets—aren’t here for small returns. Their $200K investment in just 24 hours isn’t random; it’s strategic. Whales accumulate before major price movements, securing early positions while the market lags behind. So, why Web3Bay? Beyond the presale hype, it’s about long-term potential: 🔥 Real utility: Web3Bay addresses key issues in online shopping, unlike meme coins. 🔑 Community-led governance: Token holders influence key decisions. 💸 Staking rewards: Passive income for holding tokens. 🔒 Privacy-focused: No data selling to corporations. Long-Term ROI: Unrealistic or Achievable? Let’s break down the numbers. If Web3Bay captures just 0.01% of the global e-commerce market, that’s $800 million in transactions. With growing token demand, staking incentives, and ecosystem expansion, prices could exceed the projected $0.1959 launch value. 📈 Conservative 2-year target: $0.50 per token = 109x ROI from presale. 🚀 Bullish 5-year outlook: $2 per token = 438x ROI ($1,000 turns into $438,000). Too ambitious? Maybe. Impossible? No. With whale investments and retail FOMO kicking in as mainstream attention grows, Web3Bay has room to scale. How Web3Bay Could Change Online Shopping Imagine using Web3Bay to buy digital art, tickets, or physical goods—without extra fees or data tracking. Transactions settle instantly. No middlemen. No surveillance. Just decentralized commerce. As adoption rises, so do new use cases: 💳 Merchant adoption—from small creators to large retailers. 🎟️ Event ticketing—reducing fraud and reselling. 🏠 Peer-to-peer services—challenging platforms like Airbnb and Fiverr. Web3Bay isn’t just joining the e-commerce sector—it’s bringing blockchain innovation to reshape it. Final Thoughts: Could Web3Bay Be the Amazon of Web3? E-commerce didn’t eliminate physical stores—it made shopping more convenient. Web3Bay aims to rebuild trust in online transactions. With a $1.60 million crypto presale , $200K in whale backing, and a decentralized marketplace that prioritizes users over corporations, this project is gaining attention. Is there risk? Yes. But in crypto, risk and reward go hand in hand. Right now, Web3Bay stands out as an opportunity—especially for those who recognize that early investments often bring the biggest returns. The real question: Can Web3Bay deliver? The whales think so. The investors rushing into the presale think so.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, IntoTheBlock says the numbers show that AI project Kaito ( KAITO ) – which had its highly anticipated token launch earlier this year – is primed for long-term growth despite users pulling profits from its initial airdrop. “KAITO was among the most anticipated token launches this year, but is the excitement holding up? Currently, about 41,800 addresses hold a balance, many established during the initial airdrop. While over 90,000 addresses were created in a single day, around 55% emptied out immediately, likely capturing airdrop profits. Even so, momentum remains solid: on average, 1,800 new addresses are added daily, and the adoption rate exceeds 30%. This steady influx of users suggests that KAITO’s long-term growth story is still unfolding.” Source: IntoTheBlock/X Kaito, an information finance (InfoFi) protocol, aims to solve the issue of fragmentation within the crypto space by using AI. Fragmentation happens within the crypto world when markets become increasingly divided by different blockchains, leading to separate sets of standards and a lack of interoperability. “By indexing thousands of sources – across social media, governance forums, research, news, podcasts, conference transcripts, and more – and combining this with proprietary search algorithms, semantic LLM (large language model) capabilities, and real-time analytics, Kaito Pro streamlines access to high-quality, actionable insights in the crypto space.” KAITO is trading for $1.64 at time of writing, a 1.7% increase during the last 24 hours.

To explain more simply, the miners connect the mining hardware at the pool’s server rather than creating your own. Moreover, the pool rewards are distributed among participants based on how much hash power each provides. Mining pools emerged as Bitcoin mining became more competitive and resource-intensive, making it difficult for smaller, solo miners to earn consistent rewards. Without considering the expense of energy and power supplies, the user would need considerable resources and capital to earn a consistent, lucrative reward. Quick Navigation Benefits of Joining a Mining Pool How Does Bitcoin Mining Work? How are Rewards Distributed in Bitcoin Mining Pools? Risks of Using Bitcoin Mining Pools Best Bitcoin Mining Pools Foundry USA AntPool ViaBTC Luxor Mining Pool F2Pool Benefits of Joining a Mining Pool Consistency: More frequent rewards compared to solo mining. Accessibility: You can participate without massive hardware or electricity investments. Assistance: Many pools offer less-experienced miners support, tools, and guidance. Mining pools also enhance network security by increasing the number of miners involved, maintaining decentralization, and preventing any one entity from dominating the blockchain. It’s a tough market out there for miners, given how fierce the competition is, which is why most would opt for pool mining due to steadier returns while still contributing to the network’s security and decentralization. But, like anything in life, there are a few pros and cons to each: Solo mining pros: Full control over any mined rewards. No fees to a pool operator. And cons: Irregular rewards; potentially very long gaps between successes. High cost for hardware and electricity. Pool mining pros: More consistent earnings due to collaborative efforts. Lower initial investment compared to solo mining. And cons: Pool fees reduce overall profit. Less autonomy since the pool operator often makes decisions. How Does Bitcoin Mining Work? Now that the basics have been explained, it’s time to dive a bit deeper into the specifics. To explain how Bitcoin mining works, let’s use setting up and joining a BTC mining pool as an example. Choosing a Bitcoin Miner Most Bitcoin miners use ASIC devices, like an Antminer S19 or S9, because traditional GPUs and CPUs are no longer profitable for BTC mining. The mining rig should meet current efficiency standards to stay competitive. Moving on, match your power supply unit (PSU) to the miner’s power draw. For instance, an Antminer S9 can consume approximately 1,375 watts, so a robust and reliable PSU is essential. Next, set up a stable, wired Ethernet connection (recommended) to minimize downtime and ensure your rig can communicate consistently with the pool’s servers. This is because your shares (i.e., your units of work to prove your contribution to solving the cryptographic puzzle) must be submitted as quickly as possible, and wireless connections may experience interruptions due to multiple elements (physical obstacles, high latency, inconsistent bandwidth due to network congestion, etc.). Miner Settings and Pool Navigation Naturally, you want to plug in the miner and the PSU and connect an Ethernet cable to your local network. The next step is to use a network scanner, like Angry IP Scanner, to find your miner on your local network. The tool will scan your network and show the IP addresses of all connected devices. Find the miner’s IP address and enter it into a web browser to open its control panel. Miners have default login details, often “root/root” username and password, but you may want to immediately change these credentials for security so no one else can access your miner. Selecting a Bitcoin Mining Pool New miners should research pools based on fees, payout schemes, security measures, and server geography. Some of the best Bitcoin mining pools include F2Pool, Foundry USA Pool, and Slush Pool. Once you’ve selected a pool, you must create your worker credentials, which are basically your username and password. Your username (should be) often a combination of your pool account name and an optional “worker” identifier (e.g., account_name.worker_name), but the password can be of any value (or the one suggested by the mining pool). Configuring the Miner Next, check the pool’s website and go to the dashboard to check the list of Stratum addresses. This is a URL protocol that your miner will use to submit work and receive tasks. While mining pools offer a general/default Stratum URL, ideally, you want to choose the closest server geographically due to lower latency and better efficiency. For example, in North America, it should be something like this: stratum+tcp://btc-na.f2pool.com:3333. In your rig’s control dashboard, go to miner configuration or settings and enter the Stratum address specific to your chosen mining pool, along with your pool username and password. After saving, your miner will begin directing its hashing power toward the pool. Linking a Bitcoin Wallet Connect your Bitcoin wallet address to the pool. This can be part of your account profile on the pool’s website. Some pools allow participants to set a minimum payout threshold, controlling how often their earnings are sent to their wallets. If you don’t have one already, check out our guide on some of the best Bitcoin wallets in 2025 , from hot to cold solutions. Starting the Mining Process After it is configured, your miner will send shares (the units of work) to the pool, which aggregates all participants’ hashing power to find valid blocks. In return, you receive a percentage of block rewards proportional to your contribution. The more you contribute, the more you are rewarded. You can monitor your miner’s performance either through its own interface or the pool’s website. How Are Rewards Distributed in Bitcoin Mining Pools? There are three types of payout models for rewards. Each approach involves specific trade-offs concerning fees, rewards, and risk: Pay-Per-Share (PPS): With PPS, you receive a fixed, predetermined payout for every share your mining hardware submits to the pool. The pool operator absorbs the risk of whether a block is actually found, offering you predictable and steady income. Full Pay-Per-Share (FPPS): FPPS builds on PPS by paying a fixed rate per share and including an estimated share of transaction fees in addition to the block reward. This method offers even more predictable earnings by smoothing out the variability of transaction fee income, but it can come with slightly higher fees since the pool operator is assuming more risk. Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS): This method pays out only when the pool finds a block, distributing rewards based on the proportion of the last N shares submitted by all miners. Your payout can fluctuate. If the pool is unlucky or you disconnect before a block is found, your earnings for that period may be low or zero. Over time, however, this method can yield higher rewards during lucky periods. How to Choose the Proper Payout Method Choosing a reward distribution model is as important as choosing the right pool. There are four main points to consider: risk tolerance, fees, mining goals, and dependency on operators, which can be summarized as follows: PPS and FPPS are good fits for those who prefer a steady income and avoid fluctuations tied to block discovery. However, PPS and FPPS pools tend to charge higher fees because they assume more risk but pay their participants regardless of block discovery. However, PPLNS pools offer lower fees but are much more volatile. They often have uneven payouts depending on how often the pool finds blocks. In other words, the more blocks that are found, the higher the yield. Generally speaking, there are two reasons why a miner would choose PPs or FPPS: either they have limited resources, or they want predictable, steady income. However, those with substantial hashing power and resources often gravitate toward PPLNS because of the bigger yields. This maximizes overall earnings in times of bullish market activity but accepts some short-term uncertainty, all in exchange for the biggest rewards. Risks of Using Bitcoin Mining Pools When using a BTC mining pool, there are three main risks miners should be aware of. Power concentration It’s no secret that large pools can dominate the share of the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate. Such a concentration of power defeats the purpose of decentralization, as a few entities wield increased influence over transaction validation and block production. Another risk to consider is chain and pool manipulation. Pools may commit certain unethical practices, like withholding valid blocks to gain an advantage or censoring specific transactions to compromise the network’s security and trustworthiness. Moreover, operators hold significant control over reward distribution, and those dishonest may manipulate payouts, delay rewards, or even vanish with participants’ funds (in what is known as an exit scam). Security concerns: When assessing any mining pool, it’s prudent to verify its track record of uptime, the security measures in place, such as advanced Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) protection, and its history of handling potential threats. In that sense, a secure and dependable pool protects your earnings and operational consistency. A pool experiencing repeated disruptions (DDoS attacks, most often) can lead to server downtime, impacting profits. For instance, in 2020, Poolin, one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools at the time, suffered a DDoS attack in which the pool’s servers were flooded with malicious traffic. This caused downtime and a loss of revenue for participating miners. Pool reputation In addition to the above, researching a pool’s reputation and transaction history is always a fundamental step before joining one. But even so, there’s no guarantee that a reputable mining pool won’t engage in questionable behavior. For instance, F2Pool, a leading miner in terms of network hashrate, drew criticism back in 2023 when it began filtering transactions linked to addresses sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). It was found that the pool excluded specific transactions from its blocks, imposing external compliance measures within what is intended to be a neutral, decentralized network. Needless to say, this action ran counter to Bitcoin’s principle of censorship resistance, sparking community backlash. F2Pool eventually halted its filtering patch, but the point remains the same.

Luxor’s 0.7% fee under FPPS compares favorably against other major pools, especially those with higher percentages for full pay-per-share payouts. Hashrate and Supported Equipment Luxor contributes an estimated 20 EH/s to the Bitcoin network, which puts it behind some larger competitors yet keeps it influential in North America. The pool works with leading ASIC miners: Bitmain Antminer (e.g., S19 Pro, S19 XP) WhatsMiner (e.g., M50 series) AvalonMiner devices GPU mining is also supported under the Catalyst feature for certain altcoins. The minimum Bitcoin payout is 0.004 BTC. Pros and Cons Pros explained: Competitive 0.7% FPPS fee Hourly payouts for stable earnings Catalyst service converts altcoin gains into Bitcoin Strong security (SOC 2 Type 2, 2FA) Developer-friendly API for advanced analytics Cons explained: Roughly 20 EH/s—smaller than major pools like Foundry USA or AntPool Higher payout threshold (0.004 BTC) can be less convenient for small-scale miners No merged mining support (cannot mine multiple coins simultaneously under a single algorithm) F2Pool F2Pool is among the market’s longest-running and most diverse cryptocurrency mining pools. Established in 2013, it supports over 40 digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum PoW (ETHW), Litecoin (LTC), and many more. Image via: F2Pool Alongside its broad coin coverage, F2Pool offers a range of payout structures (PPS+, FPPS, and PPLNS), daily automatic distributions, and strong security features to safeguard miners’ earnings. Key Features Multi-currency support : F2Pool accommodates more than 40 cryptocurrencies. It also supports different hardware for these altcoins. Advanced tools : F2Pool delivers in-depth statistics like real-time hashrate monitoring, revenue history, and profitability projections. It also supports cross-platform accessibility through web and mobile apps, making it straightforward for miners to track and manage their operations on the go. Security measures : Strong DDoS defenses and secure payout systems help minimize disruptions. The company’s reputation, built over nearly a decade, is a testament to its dependable infrastructure and prompt responses to potential threats. Fees and Payment Methods 2FPool offers three types of payment methods, depending on the user’s need: PPS+, FPPS, and PPLNS. F2Pool’s Bitcoin mining fees vary based on the payout model, generally ranging from 2% for PPLNS to 4% for FPPS. Although this may be slightly higher than smaller pools, many miners find the stability and reliability worthwhile. Again, it all depends on the user’s goals and needs. Bitcoin miners can expect a minimum payout of 0.005 BTC by default, which they can adjust in their account settings to suit their preferences. Hashrate and Supported Equipment F2Pool provides about 10% of the total Bitcoin network hashrate in 2025, translating into roughly 81.4 EH/s. This means the pool often finds blocks relatively quickly. Moreover, most modern ASIC devices, like the Antminer S19 series, are compatible, and F2Pool also accommodates GPU mining for certain altcoins. Pros and Cons Pros explained: A solid track record since 2013 A wide range of mineable cryptocurrencies Comprehensive mining statistics and real-time monitoring Robust security and DDoS protections Cons explained: Higher fees than some competing pools Has engaged in questionable practices that contradict Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, fueling concerns about Bitcoin mining centralization The post The 5 Best Bitcoin Mining Pools in 2025: Complete Guide appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Editorials|Guides|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Mining,EN,0,0,MINING|ALTCOIN|BCH|ETC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-03-09 01:45:14

Spotlighted here are three decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens showing growth potential. Each of these coins could offer significant opportunities. Read on to discover which cryptos might be poised for an upward trend. Injective (INJ) Shows Sustained Decline Amid Bearish Sentiment Injective recorded a drop of about 15.95% over the past week, with a monthly decline nearing 20%. The last six months have shown a significant decrease of 31.04%. This consistent downtrend reflects growing bearish sentiment among traders, highlighted by declining performance and diminished investor confidence. Each time period has revealed a steady retreat from previous highs, emphasizing the challenging environment for Injective in recent months. Currently, INJ trades within the range of approximately $9.87 and $18.68, facing resistance around $24.03 and another level near $32.83, while support is located near $6.43. Bears dominate the market, supported by the -2.40 Awesome Oscillator, -1.77 Momentum, and a 36.38 RSI. Without a clear trend, traders may consider short positions near resistance and look to enter buys at support for potential gains. Raydium Market Swing: Bearish Drop Amid 6-Month Recovery The coin fell sharply in the last month with a drop of about 62.63%. Over the previous six months, it had seen an increase of 34.81%, indicating significant volatility. Recent weekly changes have shown a decline of 19.45%, suggesting that bearish sentiment has taken hold. This downturn contrasts with earlier upward movements, which hinted at potential longer-term strength. Current price levels range from $0.59 to $5.79, with resistance identified at $9.13 and $14.33. Negative momentum indicators and an RSI close to 29 indicate bearish dominance for now, but oversold conditions could stimulate buying interest. Traders should watch for signs of stabilization before considering entry points near resistance levels. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price Performance: Volatility and Recovery in Focus Over the last month, the coin experienced a steep 35.83% decline, while the six-month window shows a strong recovery with a 59.19% gain. A weekly drop of 20.19% signals notable short-term volatility. Price action has swung widely, reflecting a mix of rapid contraction and subsequent rebound that has kept traders alert to shifting momentum. Recent performance demonstrates alternating phases of decline followed by robust recovery, offering clues to both short-term caution and long-term potential. Current prices range between $15.17 and $26.59, with the nearest support at $10.41 and resistance at $33.24. Technical indicators show subdued momentum with an RSI at 32.48 and weak oscillator values, suggesting that bears are currently in control without a clear trend. Trading within these bounds could involve waiting for a push near support before considering entries, while bears maintain pressure around the resistance level. Conclusion Diversifying a portfolio can help manage market volatility. Injective (INJ) brings innovative trading features. Raydium (RAY) offers liquidity and farming options. Hyperliquid (HYPE) provides fast and low-cost transactions. Together, these assets can offer a balanced approach. Adding them to a portfolio could potentially boost overall stability and returns.

41357564,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=689647,1741485485,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41357564.jpeg,Garantex admins face charges in the US for money laundering for hackers and terrorists,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/garantex-admins-face-charges-in-the-us/,"Two administrators of the Russia-based cryptocurrency exchange Garantex are facing criminal charges in the United States for allegedly helping hackers, ransomware groups, and terrorist organizations launder illicit funds. The U.S. Department of Justice named Lithuanian national and Russian resident Aleksej Besciokov, 46, and Russian citizen and United Arab Emirates resident Aleksandr “Mira” Serda, 40, in an indictment that also accuses them of violating U.S. sanctions. Prosecutors allege the two knowingly allowed Garantex to be used for laundering proceeds from cybercrime, terrorism, ransomware, and drug trafficking. Aleksej Besciokov’s description according to the US Secret Service. Source: US Secret Service website In the formal indictment , prosecutors say Garantex “received hundreds of millions in criminal proceeds” and processed at least 96 billion dollars in cryptocurrency transactions since 2019. According to the Department of Justice, Besciokov and Serda knew of these unlawful transactions and tried to hide the exchange’s role in such activities. They are accused of conspiring to launder money, and Besciokov also faces charges of violating U.S. sanctions and running an unlicensed money transmitting business. Both defendants face up to 20 years in prison for the money laundering conspiracy alone, while Besciokov could face an additional 20-year sentence for the sanctions-related charge and up to five years for operating an unlicensed business. Prosecutors say that Garantex disregarded inquiries from law enforcement agencies U.S. prosecutors claim that Besciokov personally authorized transactions linked to the Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking organization said to be backed by the North Korean government. These transactions went forward, prosecutors allege, despite clear signals that they derived from criminal operations. In addition, according to the Department of Justice, Russian authorities once requested information tied to a Garantex account belonging to Serda. Rather than provide correct details, the exchange submitted incomplete records and insisted the account “was not verified.” However, investigators claim Garantex had already associated Serda’s personal documentation with that account, suggesting that the exchange actively disregarded inquiries from law enforcement. Aleksandr Mira Serda’s description according to the US Secret Service. Source: US Secret Service website The Department of Justice says it does not know whether Serda has been apprehended in the United Arab Emirates. Both Besciokov and Serda could not be reached for comment, and it remains unclear if either is currently in custody. In the indictment, prosecutors contend that the pair worked to ensure that Garantex would remain accessible for illicit transactions even when authorities in Russia, its home jurisdiction, posed questions. The Department of Justice also describes how Garantex avoided U.S. sanctions and keep transactions hidden. The DOJ said, “Garantex moved its operational cryptocurrency wallets to different virtual currency addresses on a daily basis in order to make it difficult for U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges to identify and block transactions with Garantex accounts.” The US law enforcement has been watching Garantex for a long time U.S. law enforcement has been monitoring Garantex for some time. Back in 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the exchange, pointing to an internal analysis that tied more than 100 million dollars in Garantex transactions to criminal actors and dark web markets. Among those sums were close to six million dollars connected to the Conti ransomware gang, a Russia-based group, and roughly 2.6 million dollars linked to the Hydra marketplace. Hydra, also a Russia-focused darknet platform, was shuttered in a separate international operation. European authorities also penalized Garantex in 2024 over its ties to Russian banks that had already been sanctioned for their country’s invasion of Ukraine. Just before this incident, the U.S. Secret Service and other federal agencies seized the official Garantex websites . Anyone navigating to Garantex’s online pages now sees a banner bearing law enforcement logos and a notice that says, “The domain of Garantex has been seized by the United States Secret Service pursuant to a seizure warrant.” A message from law enforcement agencies on Garantex website As part of the latest enforcement action, U.S. authorities froze more than 26 million dollars in digital assets associated with Garantex’s money laundering. Department of Justice spokesperson Shannon Shevlin said that investigators seized 23,034,884.75 Tether (USDT) and 35.57 Bitcoin, worth around three million dollars at the time, on Binance. Meanwhile, Tether itself took steps against Garantex, apparently blocking the exchange’s wallets that held more than 28 million dollars in USDT. In response, Garantex suspended all activity on Thursday, telling users on Telegram that Tether had “entered the war against the Russian crypto market.” On its official Telegram channel , Garantex declared, “We are fighting and will not give up! Please note that all [Tether] in Russian wallets is currently under threat. As always, we are the first, but not the last.” After U.S. officials announced the new charges and the site seizures, Garantex used the same channel to warn users of scammers claiming to have launched a replacement service or offering to withdraw funds. The company’s statement urged caution, saying these purported services merely aim to obtain users’ personal data. Meanwhile, it remains uncertain whether either administrator will appear in a U.S. courtroom to answer for the allegations. Garantex’s Telegram posts suggest the exchange intends to find a workaround and found a possible solution for the blocked assets. The exchange invited users with positive balances to a personal meeting in the exchange’s Moscow office. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The second presale phase of MUTM sets its price at $0.015 while overall collecting over $2.4 million from more than 4,500 token holders. The analysts predict that MUTM will reach $2 value before the anticipated timeframe due to its distinctive operational features and rising investor demand. The structured pricing system of the presale period guarantees that investors who join early will benefit from substantial profit potential. Current participants who purchase tokens at this phase stand to gain a 33% return as the next phase will rise the price to $0.02. The $0.06 listing price will yield a 300% return to current investors while the structured pricing strategy ensures a 33% increase before the token reaches exchanges. After launch MUTM is forecasted to achieve a price of $1.50 which would deliver transformational financial returns to early investors. Mutuum Finance’s Unique Value Proposition Mutuum Finance stands apart from speculative tokens through its provision of genuine financial operational benefits. The decentralized system of Mutuum Finance enables users to generate passive income stream while preserving their liquidity. MtTokens act as user deposits within the project and generate accumulated interest through time that creates supplementary revenue. Users who deposit ETH receive mtETH tokens that increase in value because of accumulating interest payments. The tokens possess transfer abilities which enhances the usefulness of the ecosystem. The lending model of the platform bases its operations on overcollateralization which promotes financial security by minimizing risks. Users borrowing funds must put up assets worth more than the amount they need to receive loans while protecting lenders against default risks. Mutuum Finance integrates a peer-to-peer (P2P) lending feature that permits users to establish direct negotiations for their loan terms. Meme coins benefit the most from this approach because traditional lending pools normally do not accept them. Buy Pressure and Long-Term Growth Mutuum Finance stands out through its method of buying tokens from markets to distribute them to mtToken stakeholders. The platform directs part of its revenue to buy MUTM tokens from market supply to distribute them among mtToken stakers. The consistent purchasing activity from the platform leads to rising demand which supports MUTM price stability across the long term. The project implements an incentive structure through its $100,000 giveaway program and its combination with a mechanism that rewards early contributors to attract and maintain investor interest. The successful completion of the presale demonstrates that investors trust MUTM’s potential. The first presale stage reached capacity rapidly so the subsequent phase shows a similar pace of sale. The rising token price attracts investors who seek to purchase tokens before upcoming increments occur. The project shows strong sustainability by allocating its supply to liquidity mining functions and platform development and strategic partnership initiatives. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Out The DeFi project Mutuum Finance refuses to base its operations on hype instead it provides concrete value to users. Mutuum Finance establishes a sustainable system through algorithms that manage interest rates and its collateral protection mechanism alongside unique financial protocols which attract hesitant and profit-driven investors. The DeFi space will see a strengthened position from the platform due to its upcoming stablecoin implementation which will use user collateral as support. Safety remains at the forefront of their operations through their partnership with reliable auditing companies for smart contract assessment. The platform’s dedication to openness and reliability develops user confidence which allows participants to take part securely. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) functions as an entry point to sustainable wealth creation possibilities within the decentralized finance industry. Early investors have an unmatched opportunity because the presale continues to gain speed and expert analysts predict MUTM may reach $2 in value. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this transformative journey. Secure your MUTM tokens today and position yourself for exponential growth.

With the crypto climate becoming more uncertain with each passing day, the XRP token has been the only large-cap asset exhibiting some level of relative stability. While the altcoin has been moving mostly sideways in recent weeks, the current speculation is that the price of XRP could be on its way to a bullish breakout. The question is — how far can the third-largest cryptocurrency in its next leg up? Can XRP Reclaim $3 In Next Move? In a March 7 post on the social media platform X, popular crypto trader Ali Martinez put forward an interesting prognosis for the value of XRP over the next few days. Martinez revealed that the altcoin’s price appears to be ready for a significant 23% breakout to the upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reclaims $90K But This Indicator Signals Possible Consolidation Phase The reasoning behind this bullish prediction is the appearance of a symmetrical triangle pattern on a short-term timeframe of the XRP chart. The symmetrical triangle is a technical analysis pattern characterized by a diagonal falling upper trendline (connecting the swing highs) and a diagonally rising lower trendline (along the price troughs). Typically, symmetrical triangle formations are considered trend continuation patterns, implying that the asset’s price tends to continue in its initial trend direction before falling into the triangle pattern. While in the triangle pattern, the price moves — in a tapering fashion — towards the symmetrical triangle’s apex. The price would eventually breach the falling (upper) trendline for a bullish breakout or break below the rising (lower) trendline forming a breakdown. While a trend reversal (I.e. the asset’s price breaks opposite its initial trend direction) is possible, the price is more likely to continue in the original trend direction after breaking out or down the current layout. In the current XRP price setup, the altcoin looks likely to break out of the symmetrical triangle and continue its upward trend. However, it is important to wait for the close of at least two candlesticks above the upper trendline to confirm a bullish breakout. Going by this logic, Martinez expects the price of XRP to surge to above $3 (about 23% growth from the current point) over the coming days. This price target was calculated by adding the length of the widest point of the symmetrical triangle (or base) to the breakout point. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the XRP token is valued at $2.47, reflecting an over 5% price decline in the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the altcoin’s performance on the weekly timeframe remains strong — at about 15% in the past seven days.

Altcoin enthusiasts are eager to know if these two cryptos can revive the sluggish market. This article explores the possibility of XRP and ADA leading a resurgence and unlocking new opportunities for growth. XRP 6-Month Surge Meets Short-Term Price Tensions Last month showed nearly flat performance with a slight dip of 0.55% despite a strong 10.46% weekly gain. Over the past six months, XRP experienced a pronounced surge of 347.37%, indicating sustained upward momentum over a longer horizon. The mixed short-term movements contrast sharply with the explosive long-term gains, reflecting overall market volatility and changing sentiment. The current price sits between $1.60 and $2.88 with key support at $1.06 and resistance at $3.61. Bears are evident from moving averages and overall indicators, although the weekly rally hints at bullish attempts. Traders might consider buying near support levels, watching for a sustained move through resistance before targeting higher levels. Cardano Price Action: Strong Gains with Critical Price Levels Past one-week movements show a surge of 31.17%, and the past month marked a 13.10% rise, while the six-month increase of 144.54% points to notable upward pressure. Price behavior over these periods reflects energetic market participation and consistent performance improvements that caught traders’ attention. Current trading sees Cardano within a range of $0.444 to $0.889. Immediate resistance stands at $1.15 with further resistance at $1.59, while support is noted at $0.26. RSI near 50 suggests a balanced market. Bulls have pushed prices higher recently, yet a clear trend remains unconfirmed, leading traders to consider breakouts above resistance levels or entries near support for potential moves. Conclusion XRP is approaching a crucial zone that could boost its value. Cardano shows similarities to its strong cycle in 2018. Both XRP and ADA have the potential to drive a resurgence in the broader altcoin market. Their performance will be key in shaping altcoin trends in the near future. Investors will be closely watching these assets for further market movements. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The application for a Bitwise Dogecoin ETF by NYSE Arca demonstrates that institutional investors show increasing interest. The market is noting Remittix (RTX) which launched as a new payments token because it achieved a staggering 12,600% gain. Dogecoin: A Meme Coin Matures NYSE Arca’s plan to list and trade the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF may create a significant breakthrough for DOGE. This product shifts Dogecoin toward becoming a regulated investment option which will merge institutional traditional investment vehicles with DOGE's passionate community. The approval of a Dogecoin product by regulators will enable both institutional capital and mainstream adoption through ETFs. Whales along with exchanges performed swift transactions which resulted in a total movement of 1 billion DOGE tokens which converted into $197.6 million USD. Whale Alert discovered one exceptional transfer worth $148 million which involved 750 million DOGE at that time period. Dogecoin continues to receive constant attention from major investment players despite periodic large whale movements which sometimes generate crash or breakout predictions. The crypto expert Ali Martinez has warned that DOGE will move toward the $0.015 value if it drops below $0.19. Some analysts expect DOGE to approach $4 based on two conditions: When regulatory agencies approve Bitwise ETF products and when whales conduct more accumulation of tokens. Source: Ali Martinez on X The bullish predictions show Dogecoin is developing into a mature cryptocurrency rather than being limited to meme currency as its hype fades because it is moving toward formal financial applications. RTX’s 12,600% Gains and the Market’s Shift Toward Real Solutions The crypto market sees Dogecoin maintaining its top status while Remittix (RTX) silently builds recognition for itself. The performance of Remittix exceeded 12,600% because the company generated more than $13.7 million from token sales that distributed more 516 million tokens at a rate of $0.0734, this shows Remittix might eclipse Dogecoin's success. The failure of speculative digital assets created an opportunity for Remittix because it delivered real value to investors. Unlike Dogecoin’s comedic lineage, Remittix zeroes in on near-instant crypto-to-fiat payments. Reports call Remittix the next XRP because it connects digital asset technology to everyday business operations to offer fast and compliant cross-border transactions. The token's PayFi focus delivers satisfaction to investors who have lost money on nonfunctional cryptocurrency projects so its market value climbs sharply. The recent strain taught investors that tokens which provide practical utility tend to outlast speculative tokens despite critics who remain doubtful about high returns. Remittix gains momentum through its goal of connecting with the $190 trillion payment market which offers an extensive user base that far exceeds the reach of meme coin popularity. Could DOGE Hit $4 While RTX Keeps Rising? Dogecoin breaking through previous thresholds must succeed firstly by obtaining approval for the Bitwise ETF from the SEC and secondly by surpassing the $4 price mark. A single impact from retail enthusiasts may not secure success therefore broader market sentiments need to develop alongside retail popularity. The massive upward trajectory of Dogecoin depends on whales maintaining their interest and the wider public viewing DOGE as a useful form of currency. Source: santiment . DOGE’s current price is $0.195 The exponential growth of Remittix occurred without getting verification from major influencers. Its user base formed naturally along with its alliances from the post-meltdown conditions when investors sought usable tokens. The continued access to payment processor alliances by Remittix positions it to keep its rapid growth trajectory going through potential DOGE price rises. The altcoin's incredibly rapid market expansion by 12,600% shows a sustainable market shift toward utility. Evidence suggests this industry movement will remain a permanent change in the future. Conclusion: Two Tokens, Two Distinct Paths Dogecoin achieved mainstream acceptance after the NYSE Arca filed an application to list the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF. DOGE stands to rise beyond existing price expectations to reach the $4 mark following approval in the eyes of some analysts. Whale movements, ongoing hype and potential regulatory nods all feed the bullish scenario. Many cryptocurrency users now search for purposeful coins as the market clears trivial tokens which has allowed Remittix to surge 12,600% through its rapid and purposeful payment solution that defies its initial comedic reputation. Remittix appears likely to continue its success because the lesson of providing practical value remains evident if DOGE needs to resolve its ongoing struggle between maintaining its initial humorous identity and securing broader market adoption.

With XRP price at $2.35, bullish XRP price predictions and recent market headwinds to deal with, everyone is trying to determine who has more potential. Remittix (RTX), now priced at $0.0734 and having raised over $13.7 million with 516+ million tokens sold, seeks to capture the remittance market, a sector long dominated by XRP’s cross-border ambitions. XRP: Chasing $32 Despite Market Turbulence XRP at $2.35. Source: CoinGecko XRP is a good bet to rise in price and stands at a level of around $2.35 after declining by 7%. Experts analyzing the XRP price prediction are of the opinion that in case of a breakout above significant downtrend levels, the market has a potential to rise up to $6.10 in late August and up to $32 . The XRP Ledger is being developed as per regulations in a bid to bring in large investors and members of its community are optimistic with predictions. Still, skeptics note that recurring setbacks, both regulatory and technical, could hinder XRP’s climb. Whether or not it achieves these lofty targets, the token’s track record of historic rallies suggests no shortage of intrigue in the months ahead. Where Does This Leave Remittix (RTX)? Traders are looking at XRP price prediction and another crypto front runner, Remittix (RTX), is in contention for worldwide payments as well. RTX is currently at a value of $0.0734 and has already raised over $13.7 million by selling over 516 million tokens. Observers compare its mission to XRP’s original goal of revolutionizing global remittances but argue Remittix is more direct in design. Instead of requiring advanced blockchain steps, the PayFi model automatically converts digital assets into local fiat, delivering funds into recipients’ bank accounts often in under 24 hours. Remittix (RTX) provides remote Indonesian workers with fast and inexpensive access to European currencies when billing their clients in real time. Implementation of streamlined features at RTX seems poised to attract global families, freelancers and small businesses while suggesting the project could match, if not exceed, past success levels that elevated XRP to top standing. Security enhances the Remittix service by enabling token locking for three years and auditing contracts to protect users from possible scams or devastating rug pulls. Altcoin enthusiasts following the XRP Price Prediction will discover Remittix as a functional investment solution that delivers strong future gains. Why Analysts Eye Remittix Remittix (RTX) has fewer regulations to comply with and is more concerned with assisting users in their day-to-day lives. This easy pattern of operation may gain more users in the future if a fresh U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve prompts firms to make use of cross-border finance. Currently, firms that are involved with XRP pricing are more concerned with making large profits, whereas Remittixis more concerned with day-to-day uses that may be superior to dealing with token inflation or intricate DeFi schemes. Conclusion: Could Remittix Outrun XRP? While the XRP Price Prediction of hitting $32 appears bold, especially given current market headwinds, the token’s track record of meteoric rallies makes the scenario at least plausible. Still, even a breakout for XRP may not overshadow the quietly monumental strides Remittix (RTX) is making in remittance markets. Raising over $13.7 million and a user-centric roadmap, RTX could become the dark-horse winner in cross-border payments. Whether XRP’s projected climb or Remittix, real-world niche proves more compelling remains to be seen, but both are poised for major activity if altcoin enthusiasm reignites this year.

Gemini cofounder Cameron Winklevoss has waded in to defend Sacks, noting that the crypto czar is losing a fortune in gains by preventing a conflict of interest. Gemini Founder Says Sacks Could Lose Up To $1 Billion In Crypto Gains Amid swirling speculations of unjust enrichment, Sacks confirmed the sale of all his cryptocurrency holdings to avoid a conflict of interest. Gemini Founder Cameron Winklevoss remarked that Sacks’ decision to sell off all cryptocurrencies would cost him gains running into a billion dollars. “David Sacks is going to easily lose out on $1 billion in crypto gains over the next 4 years,” said Winklevoss. “He sold all of his crypto holdings (including $85 million of his personal holdings) prior to becoming AI and crypto czar.” Sacks has previously confirmed the sale of his digital asset holdings while denying Multicoin exposure after divesting his stake. According to Sacks, he cumulatively sold $200 million worth of cryptocurrencies while disposing of $85 million worth of personal assets. He confirmed that he liquidated his holdings in crypto funds, including Bitwise and Blockchain Capital, before assuming office. Cameron says Sacks is at the helm of a policy shift for cryptocurrencies in the US but will not reap any benefits from the windfall of changes. “He is doing tremendous work and will not be sharing in any of the economic upsides to avoid even the slightest appearance of a conflict,” said the Gemini cofounder. Sacks Leads The Charge For New Crypto Policy Without Pecuniary Benefits David Sacks has hit the ground running since his appointment as crypto and AI czar, playing a key role in setting up the White House Crypto Summit . His efforts led to the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the US Digital Asset Stockpile. Sacks disclosed that the US has lost over $17 billion from the previous sale of confiscated Bitcoins . The concerted efforts of Sacks are expected to trigger new institutional interest in the ecosystem, sending prices to new all-time highs by the end of Trump’s first tenure.

Two names cropping up lately are Shiba Inu (SHIB), the meme coin famous for its staggering community-driven rallies and Remittix (RTX) , a DeFi newcomer focused on solving real-world remittance problems. Below, we examine each token’s recent developments and explore which might offer more substantial growth potential by 2025. Shiba Inu: Surging Burn Rate But Are Gains Guaranteed? Shiba Inu recently made headlines when its burn rate increased by over 3200%, removing around 30 million coins from the token's circulating supply in less than 24 hours. The latest statistics place Shiba Inu's supply at around 584.34 trillion coins , with a whopping 410.49 trillion coins burned from the start. Such burn activities bring optimism that supply capping will help drive prices up if demand remains strong. Fans also note that some 76 million tokens have been burned to date this March, stoking hopes for more supply reductions. The logic goes as follows: fewer tokens circulating can potentially result in price gains when a bull market sentiment resumes. Skeptics, on the other hand, reply that ongoing burn operations by themselves may not prove sufficient to drive a sustained price move upward, especially if general market sentiment turns ugly or community excitement wanes. Today, Shiba Inu is 60% off its December 2024 highs and the meme coin market in general has significantly cooled down. Although Shiba Inu's core base continues to be active, real-world use cases continue to lag more functional crypto projects. For investors, the question becomes whether ongoing burns, exchange listings and sporadic market hype can actually take SHIB into a game-altering streak or if it's still bound for meme coin cycles. Remittix: The Cross-Border Payment Disruptor Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) is emerging as a major threat with a record-breaking presale that sold more than 516 million tokens and raised $13.7 million so far. With a price of $0.0734, early users are reported to have made 1000% returns, even amidst the general bear trend. Experts forecast additional rallies up to 200% in the short term as the project's core mission picks up steam among an increasing user base. What distinguishes Remittix from others is that it's everything about practical, real-world financial use cases. Rather than hype speculation and chasing memes, RTX is trying to tackle the $190 trillion cross-border remittance market. Bank transfers are costly and slow. Leveraging local payment rails and blockchain, Remittix is trying to provide almost instant fiat settlements from more than 40 supported cryptocurrencies. The frictionless model is finding favor with freelancers who are paid by overseas clients, migrant workers who send money back home, etc. Businesses can integrate Remittix's pay API, allowing for several tokens and automatic fiat conversion. The security of the platform's architecture is its defining feature: transactions are recorded on an open ledger, which acts as a disincentive against fraud. Locked liquidity and plans to relinquish contract ownership once presale complete further enhance risk-averse investor confidence. On this foundation, some experts believe that Remittixhas what it takes to soar high in 2025, surpassing many well-known altcoins lacking a compelling real-world application. Which Token Will Thrive in 2025? Between Remittix and Shiba Inu, both tokens take a different approach. Shiba Inu's success is based on continuous burn mechanics, community hype and the possibility of a renewed meme coin market. This can result in short-term highs, but it also introduces volatility. Without greater utility or adoption beyond speculation, long-term growth may be challenging even with the burn rate rising. Remittix's strategy, however, is based on providing real-world service in international finance. Its simplicity, open ledger and promise of faster remittance could attract users who prefer usability over memes. If Remittix continues to get more merchants and everyday users onboarded, demand for the token could rise naturally. Paired with a locked liquidity model and an investor-friendly presale, Remittix has a feel of stability that most hype coins do not. Ultimately, which one is the better purchase in 2025 comes down to personal risk tolerance and long-term aspirations.

The sluggish Dogecoin performance according to recent news reports indicates an upcoming opportunity for an underdog token that could rise by 5880% percent. Let us explore the reasons behind analysts' predictions that this ERC20 coin will dominate the crypto world in 2025. Dogecoin Price Predictions For 2025 And What This Means For PayFi Coins Today Dogecoin faces challenges as the internet creation based on a playful meme now trades at around $0.195 USD . The current price of Dogecoin fails to overcome bearish market trends according to real-time trading data. Dogecoin managed only a 19% increase during the last year even though its trading volume dropped by 30% within the previous 24 hours. Traders show little interest in Dogecoin trading because they remain cautious after the coin experienced significant price fluctuations earlier this year. Numerous Dogecoin Price Prediction models indicate that DOGE will likely maintain its current support levels unless the cryptocurrency experiences either renewed mainstream adoption or a breakthrough partnership. The whales purchased 530 million DOGE during a market downturn according to analysts who have interpreted this move as a sign of either confidence or desperation. The market trend shows Dogecoin crossed its $0.20 psychological threshold before shedding 16% of its value during these days. The ecosystem developments for Dogecoin create both positive and negative impressions among its fan base. The market capitalization of Dogecoin stands at $28.64 billion which makes it th e largest meme coin based on its financial value . The utility of Dogecoin however stands far behind Ethereum and Solana since it lacks both a strong developer community and decentralized applications to support its growth. Analysts at Coincodex projec t a possible climb to $0.65 in April and $1.07 by year-end if adoption spikes and influencers like Elon Musk keep the hype alive. However, the flip side remains a possibility: a failure to stay relevant could see DOGE slump to $0.162, a sobering Dogecoin price prediction for holders causing them to seek out alternatives like Remittix to hedge against portfolio dips. How Remittix Is Stealing The Show From Top Altcoins In 2025 The payment solution token Remittix (RTX) has generated considerable market interest after a remarkable 362% boost during its pre-sale period. The practical value of Remittix differentiates it from Dogecoin because this token promises to transform worldwide currency transfers. The combination of Remittix's PayFi technology with its extensive global remittance solution gives it advantages beyond what Dogecoin can deliver. The new trend among investors involves searching for assets which combine robust profitability with functional solutions dedicated to solving actual world issues. The advanced capabilities of Remittix enable users to make seamless crypto-to-fiat deals and this essential feature will gain importance as digital payment systems continue their worldwide adoption. DOGE maintains its position as a historical cryptocurrency leader yet current Dogecoin price predictions indicate a diminished potential in present market conditions compared to Remittix. Analysts Say Remittix Deserves to Be In Every Portfolio Right Now! When comparing Dogecoin to Remittix, the difference is striking. Dogecoin’s price predictions rely on short-lived factors such as Elon Musk’s tweets or FOMO-driven surges, making it highly susceptible to sharp corrections like its 45% drop in February. Remittix on the other hand thrives on innovation, weaving utility with a narrative of 5880% returns that outshines even the rosiest $4 DOGE forecasts from analysts.

41358630,https://coingape.com/?p=243034,1741487445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Crypto Market Awaits US CPI; What’s Next For Bitcoin Price?,https://coingape.com/crypto-market-awaits-us-cpi-what-next-for-bitcoin-price/,"The crypto market is expected to experience high volatility as the crucial US CPI and PPI data are scheduled for this week. If the inflation rates come in higher than expected, it may trigger a sharp downturn in the crypto market, potentially sending Bitcoin’s price to significant lows. Notably, the timing of these reports is crucial, as they precede the Federal Reserve’s meeting on March 18-19, influencing the central bank’s decision on interest rates. Let’s examine how the upcoming reports will shape the Fed’s decision and the potential fallout for the crypto market. Crypto Market Braces for Impact: US CPI Report Looms Significantly, the US CPI and PPI reports are slated for release this week, with the CPI report arriving on March 12 and the PPI report following on March 13. This has sparked anxiety among crypto traders and enthusiasts as these macroeconomic indicators could possibly evoke high market volatility. According to a Reuters poll, the US CPI for February is expected to have climbed 0.3%. Wall Street expects that the CPI data will come at 2.9%. If the data showcases a surge in the inflation rate, a crypto market downfall could follow. Bryant VanCronkhite, the senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments, stated, A hot CPI print will likely scare the market. The market still wants the Fed to come to the rescue… Until inflation and inflation expectations come down, the Fed is handcuffed. How Will CPI & PPI Data Impact Fed Rate Cut? Interestingly, the Federal Reserve’s meeting comes following the US CPI and PPI data release. These reports could have a significant impact on the central bank’s decision on the interest rate as well as the crypto market. The Fed is likely to maintain its benchmark interest rate at 4.25%-4.5% during the upcoming meeting, according to CME FedWatchtool Data . But, market expectations suggest further easing is on the horizon, with around 70 basis points of cuts anticipated by December, as indicated by Fed funds futures data from LSEG. If the PPI and CPI reports reveal a hot inflation rate, the Fed may opt to keep interest rates unchanged or even consider a hike. Recently, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has expressed a hawkish stance on interest rate cuts. Powell stated, Our policy stance is now less restrictive than it had been, and the economy remains strong. We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. Will Bitcoin Price Explode or Correct? In February, following the US CPI data release, the crypto market experienced a severe selloff. This led to the market’s massive fall of 3.3% to $3.1 trillion. As the CPI data marked a higher-than-expected inflation rate, Bitcoin plummeted to $94,000, down 3%. Considering this, the crypto market is expected to face another downturn next week. In addition, Bitcoin ETFs marked significant outflows, recording a total of $409 million. 21Shares’ ARKB experienced the largest outflow of $160 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $154.9 million outflows. However, analyst Crypto Caesar identifies the bearish sentiment as the last bear trap before entering the bull market. Source: Crypto Caesar, X Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez revealed that 63.13% of traders on Binance Futures have opened long positions on Bitcoin. This implies that the traders are optimistic about the Bitcoin price’s bullish ascendance in the future.

Numerous investors consider RTX to be one of the top cryptocurrencies for purchase. The market price of RTX currently appears appealing and its future potential extends past basic financial gains. The mission of Remittix creates promising solutions for actual money transfer challenges. Floki Inu Price Prediction and Future Prospects The Floki inu price prediction draws strong interest among experts. When FLOKI initially gained value it triggered major market enthusiasm. Current market indicators show the coin could experience limited expansion in its value. FLOKI's value declined by 5.5% during the last 24 hours to trade at $0.00006916. The current market situation indicates that FLOKI should increase at a steady pace according to expert analysis. The Floki Inu Price Prediction follows with caution since many investors remain skeptical about potential improvement in the value of FLOKI. Daily checks of the Floki Inu Price Prediction indicate FLOKI will experience gradual growth until it reaches an estimated value of $0.000246 on June 6. Shiba Inu: A Token with Lessons to Learn Shiba Inu experienced dramatic price fluctuations in the past although its current market movements remain steady. The leading memecoin experienced a 5% price decline in the last day to trade at $0.00001282. Market supply along with technical problems prevent SHIB from reaching its expected market value according to investors. The SHIB price followed closely by its observers indicates that network performance changes could drive its market value upward. Many market participants question whether an alternative token can surpass SHIB to become one of the top-performing assets. The loyal fanbase of SHIB continues to exist yet its current market performance opens doors for alternative cryptocurrencies. The market analysts predict Shiba Inu will decrease by -1.72% to reach $0.00001265 by April 7. Remittix: A New DeFi Project with Real-World Solutions Remittix, a rising star among new DeFi projects, offers a clear fix for international money transfers. Worldwide money transfers operate over several days at high cost. Within Remittix the PayFi system functions to get rid of standard payment systems for faster fund transfers. Among the world's total population there are a large number of individuals without bank accounts. The total number of people disconnected from banking services exceeds 1.4 billion. The Remittix platform allows crypto holders to transfer their assets to wallets from where they can distribute cash through local services to meet their everyday needs. Remittix successfully sold more than 517 million tokens in its ICO period. The high levels of token sales demonstrate early support towards Remittix. Currently the Remittix DeFi coin holds $0.0734 as its market price. Remittix ranks as one of the best cryptocurrencies for buying because its value fits within the budget of those looking to use it for money transfer needs. The market expects Remittix to deliver profit returns that range from 10x to 50x during propitious market conditions. The token demonstrates superiority over speculative tokens since it fulfills its intended purpose. The skeptical investor interested in crypto adoption can now view Remittix as a banking solution for digital transfers that uses blockchain systems. The Floki Inu price predictions suggest that Remittix offers superior value than other tokens according to market trend followers. This system operates as a daily practical solution for users. The international money transfer market has found a suitable solution in Remittix as the platform serves expanding requirements for fast and budget-friendly solutions.

Celestia (TIA): A Modular Blockchain Revolution Celestia (TIA) is a pioneering modular blockchain designed to enhance scalability and flexibility in the crypto ecosystem. Unlike traditional monolithic blockchains, Celestia separates execution from consensus, allowing developers to deploy customizable, independent rollups while benefiting from Celestia’s secure data availability layer. This innovative approach reduces congestion, lowers fees, and improves interoperability across blockchain networks. With a strong focus on decentralization and developer empowerment, Celestia is gaining traction as a next-generation blockchain solution. As adoption grows, TIA serves as the network’s native token, used for staking, governance, and securing the data availability layer that powers modular blockchain applications. Terra Classic (LUNC): A Decentralized Comeback Terra Classic (LUNC) is the original blockchain of the Terra ecosystem, known for its algorithmic stablecoin, UST, before its infamous collapse in 2022. Following the crash, the network was rebranded as Terra Classic, with LUNC as its native token. The community has since taken charge, implementing governance proposals, reducing supply through burns, and working toward ecosystem revival. Despite volatility, LUNC remains a significant player in the crypto market, driven by strong community support and ongoing development efforts. With initiatives aimed at increasing utility, Terra Classic continues to evolve, seeking to reclaim its place in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.

However, altcoin investors say RCO Finance’s AI trading platform holds greater profit potential. RCO Finance stands out for providing AI-driven tools and strategies that help traders amplify returns across diverse markets. Already over $12 million worth of tokens have been acquired from RCO Finance’s presale. Read on to see why experts say RCO Finance will become one of the top altcoins to hold. Solana Records 5% Increase Over the Past Week Solana has stunned many investors with this recent price recovery. The crypto market tanked at the end of January. Altcoins like Solana fell sharply, wiping off gains for many investors. Some experts predicted a continuation of the Solana price decline. However, Solana seems to be recovering from its recent drop. Solana now trades at $144.51 following its 5.9% increase over the past week. Following its price reversal, experts are readjusting their Solana predictions. With renewed optimism surrounding the Solana ETF filing, some analysts forecast Solana could return to $160 by April. However, lingering regulatory uncertainty has left some investors seeking alternative opportunities. This has drawn attention to RCO Finance, an AI-powered altcoin offering exposure to over 12,500 finance markets. RCO Finance: Unlock a New Era of Investment Precision and Higher Returns Come and unlock a new era of investment clarity with RCO Finance , an AI-powered trading network that solves common investor problems through the use of technology. RCO Finance is leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to transform complex market data into straightforward, strategic actions through intelligent automation. The platform also stands out for creating investment solutions that are accessible to both new and expert traders. RCO Finance starts with a broad range of investment options. It allows traders to access an exclusive suite of over 120,000 financial instruments across 12,500 categories. Traders can choose from equities and bonds to ETFs, digital coins, precious metals like copper, and even tokenized real estate. As an advantage, traders can build portfolios that contain the right mix of stable and risky assets. Additionally, they can utilize RCO Finance’s advanced 1000x multiplier to significantly boost their market exposure and capture high-return opportunities across diverse sectors. Beyond the flexibility of having over 120,000 assets at your disposal, RCO Finance also supercharges your investment experience with access to Robo Advisor. This trading bot works as your personalized portfolio manager. It does everything from helping you spot investment opportunities to also closing trades on your behalf using automatic portfolio rebalancing. Robo Advisor is always one step ahead of the market as the trading bot relies on reality market data from trusted sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. Using this information, Robo Advisor searches your preferred markets for investing opportunities. The trading bot also provides institutional-grade trading strategies that will help investors maximize gains. These strategies are designed according to your risk tolerance and investing goals. Another exciting feature of Robo Advisor is automatic portfolio rebalancing. Robo Advisor continuously fine-tunes your asset mix helping your portfolio adapt to shifts in the market. For example, global events can stir market volatility similar to how Donald Trump’s promise of tariffs in early February triggered a price crash. In volatile times like this, Robo Advisor swiftly reallocates your funds from riskier cryptocurrencies to more stable options such as premier blue-chip stocks and government securities. This adaptive approach ensures that you stay profitable even during sudden market changes. In addition to AI-powered trading features, RCO Finance users also enjoy access to yield-earning mechanisms that help amplify returns. The network provides a robust staking program that offers up to 86% ROI. In return, staked tokens will contribute to the liquidity of RCO Finance’s ecosystem. The network also rewards token holders with trading fee discounts that help to boost their net gains. RCO Finance also leverages robust safeguards to keep all members of its community safe. The platform uses SolidProof-verified smart contracts to ensure your data and assets remain secure without cumbersome identity checks. Beta Phase Update Creates Buzz Around RCO Finance The beta environment of RCO Finance’s ecosystem is now live, granting early users exclusive access to breakthrough features as the platform moves toward a full-scale alpha launch. Top Altcoins to Hold: RCO Finance Vs Solana Unlike Solana, RCO Finance has tangible use cases in the finance sector, making it one of the most in-demand tokens today. Already, over 10,000 users have joined the RCO Finance ecosystem. Its presale revenue has also exceeded $12 million. One RCOF token is now trading at $0.100 in stage 5 of its presale. By stage 6, RCOF’s value will grow to $0.130. It will also get listed when it reaches the $0.4-$0.6 range. Furthermore, there are predictions that RCOF will record a 12,000x increase. This could propel a $1,000 investment today to over $100,000 by the start of next year. With its AI-powered automation, expansive asset selection, and staking rewards, RCO Finance is positioning itself as a leader in next-gen trading.

This downtrend has seen the Relatice Strength Index (RSI) indicator trending downwards very massively, with the 1-day RSI particularly slipping into oversold territory. However, an interesting technical outlook suggests that the Dogecoin price might reverse to the upside very soon to reach an ambitious $0.90 price target. Dogecoin Trading Near Channel Bottom As RSI Signals Weakness A recent analysis from a TradingView analyst points to a possible buying opportunity as the 1-day RSI slips into oversold territory. Notably, this possible buying opportunity, despite the ongoing decline, is based on the current setup with the RSI and chart pattern, which is reminiscent of past price bottoms for Dogecoin. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted The Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.2, Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast Technical analysis shows that Dogecoin has been moving within a Channel Up pattern for the past year. This pattern has been characterized by a repeated bounce between resistance and support levels. Notably, the current price action shows Dogecoin near the lower boundary of this channel, where past bounces have triggered recoveries. However, the current trading at the lower boundary is more interesting because of its confluence with the 1-day RSI, which has slipped into oversold territory. This phenomenon mirrors conditions from August 2024, just before Dogecoin went on a remarkable rally between September and December 2024. Furthermore, the bearish wave is under the 1-day MA200 with the 1-day RSI oversold, just like the August 5, 2024 bottom. 1-Day MA200 And Fibonacci Extension Point To $0.90 Target Based on historical trends, the current price setup suggests that a rally could be on the horizon over the next few weeks. The last time this asset exhibited the same market conditions (trading near the lower boundary of its Channel Up pattern with an oversold 1-day RSI) it experienced a staggering 480% surge, eventually reaching a multi-year peak of $0.475. Related Reading: Dogecoin $10 Price Target Back In Play? Here’s What The Charts Say Notably, that price peak aligned almost perfectly with the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level when projected from the August 2024 bottom. If a similar scenario unfolds, history could repeat itself with another parabolic rally in the coming months. In this case, the analyst has set $0.90 as a potential target, derived once again from the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, and this time projected from the March low around $0.18. Beyond price mirroring on the Dogecoin price chart, sentiment surrounding the market is a key factor. Despite the technical target of $0.90 based on the 1.618 Fibonacci extension, achieving this level seems increasingly challenging under current market conditions, especially with bearish pressure mounting on Bitcoin. Dogecoin’s support between $0.19 and $0.2 is under pressure, and failure to hold this level could trigger a deeper retracement toward $0.16 or even $0.14. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.1972, down by 1.47% in the past 24 hours.

It’s a question that keeps people on edge, especially when hearing stories of early adopters turning small investments into life-changing money. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have made their mark, new contenders like Qubetics are proving that massive opportunities still exist. With Ethereum’s continuous evolution, Filecoin’s dominance in decentralized storage, and Qubetics’ revolutionary web3 aggregation model, the search for the best crypto to get rich is far from over. Among these top contenders, Qubetics is making headlines with its remarkable presale progress. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized applications, and Filecoin continues to dominate the decentralized storage industry. For anyone considering crypto as a path to financial growth, these projects are worth a deep dive. Qubetics: The Next Big Thing in Web3 Aggregation Qubetics is making serious waves in the crypto world, and for good reason. It’s designed to bring together all the decentralized applications, protocols, and services in one place, making web3 more accessible to the average user. Instead of navigating multiple platforms, Qubetics creates a seamless experience, bridging the gap between traditional users and blockchain technology. One of the most groundbreaking innovations from Qubetics is QubeQode IDE. This integrated development environment is set to revolutionize how blockchain applications are built. Think of it as the “Visual Studio” of the decentralized world—an all-in-one tool that makes smart contract and dApp development easier, faster, and more efficient. For businesses, this means launching blockchain applications without the usual headaches. A startup building a DeFi platform can use QubeQode IDE to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts in record time. A freelance developer looking to break into web3 can use it to create and launch their first dApp without spending months learning complex coding languages. Even non-tech-savvy users will find value in the simplicity QubeQode IDE offers. The excitement around Qubetics is translating into serious numbers. the Qubetics presale has already raised over $14.7 million, with more than 22,500+ holders securing over 497 million $TICS tokens. Currently priced at $0.0976, early backers are locking in their positions before the price jumps further. The numbers get even crazier when looking at the potential ROI of one of the best crypto to get rich . If $TICS reaches $0.25 by the end of the presale, that’s already a 156% return. If it climbs to $1 after launch, a $2,000 investment today could be worth over $20,480. At $5, that same $2,000 could balloon to over $102,400, and if it hits $10, it turns into a staggering $204,800. With analysts predicting strong post-launch growth, the urgency to buy before the presale ends is real. Ethereum: The Undisputed King of Smart Contracts Ethereum is the OG when it comes to smart contract platforms. Since launching in 2015, it has set the standard for decentralized applications (dApps), fueling everything from DeFi protocols to NFT marketplaces. Its biggest strength? Adaptability. Ethereum continues to evolve, recently transitioning to a proof-of-stake model to improve scalability and reduce energy consumption. For those who jumped in early, the returns have been legendary. In 2016. Even after market corrections, Ethereum remains one of the most trusted cryptocurrencies for long-term backers. Institutions, retail buyers, and developers continue to bet big on Ethereum, and with upcoming upgrades promising faster transactions and lower fees, it’s clear why ETH continues to hold strong as one of the best crypto to get rich. Filecoin: The Future of Decentralized Storage Data is the new gold, and Filecoin is leading the charge in decentralized storage. Unlike traditional cloud providers like Amazon Web Services or Google Drive, Filecoin uses blockchain technology to create a more secure, cost-efficient, and censorship-resistant storage network. By allowing users to rent out their unused storage space, Filecoin has built a decentralized marketplace that ensures data is stored safely across a distributed network. This innovation has positioned Filecoin as a go-to solution for enterprises, content creators, and businesses needing long-term, reliable storage. With web3 expanding, demand for decentralized storage is only going up, making Filecoin a strong contender in the crypto market. Final Thoughts Crypto isn’t just about buying and holding anymore—it’s about understanding where the next wave of growth is coming from. Ethereum remains a powerhouse for dApp development, Filecoin is essential for decentralized data storage, and Qubetics is positioning itself as the web3 aggregator that connects it all. For those looking for the best crypto to get rich, Qubetics’ crypto presale is one of the biggest opportunities right now. But whether it’s Qubetics, Ethereum, or Filecoin, one thing’s for sure—crypto continues to redefine what’s possible in the world of alternative investments. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics different from other blockchain projects? Qubetics is the world’s first web3 aggregator, designed to simplify and unify decentralized applications, making web3 more accessible for both developers and users. How does Ethereum continue to be relevant in crypto? Ethereum remains the leading platform for smart contracts and dApps, consistently evolving with upgrades to enhance scalability, security, and user experience Why is Filecoin considered an important crypto project?

With LINK’s supporters quietly accumulating this inexpensive asset, it would appear that something is brewing beneath the surface of crypto market movements. Is this under-the-radar token going to be the next big opportunity? XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The XYZVerse buzz is real. It is the first-ever all-sports meme token, and it has already struck a nerve with both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a powerful crossover that’s gaining serious traction. More Than Just a Meme Coin While meme coins without substance tend to follow trends, XYZVerse wants to set a new one. It’s merging the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving at high speed, with early adopters securing tokens at a fraction of their projected value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is soaring. The price has already surged from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already reached. With a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people taking notice—especially early investors who have locked in a steep discount. Last Chance to Join Before the Presale Ends $XYZ is very bullish It is already listed on CoinMarketCap . The community shows a strongly bullish sentiment on this coin since 95% of community members expect $XYZ to rise. XYZVerse has also caught the attention of leading crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster recently tweeted his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity,” and he has close to 800,000 followers. But XYZVerse isn’t just about hype—it features a well-structured tokenomics model designed for long-term sustainability. A solid 15% of liquidity is allocated to ensure a strong market foundation. The next 10% of the total supply is reserved for community rewards through airdrops and bonuses while 17.13% goes to deflationary burns, reducing supply and increasing demand for the $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans The first thing that distinguishes the XYZVerse is its involvement with the community. Recently the team introduced the Ambassador Program, where users could earn free tokens by showing support for the project. And that’s just the beginning—talks are already underway with major sports celebrities to boost visibility. By bridging traditional sports fans with the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something unique—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? A rapidly multiplying presale, a large following, and a focused roadmap featuring all the right moves make XYZVerse a token to watch. The future of the crypto market is always uncertain, but many investors consider this an opportunity to get in at the floor price of what could be something huge. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Chainlink is a network that enables smart contracts to interact with real-world data. Smart contracts are digital agreements that run on blockchains, but they typically can’t access external information on their own. Chainlink solves this problem by using specialized oracles that bring real-world data—such as prices, weather updates, and event outcomes—into these contracts. The LINK token is the currency that powers this ecosystem, rewarding data providers and ensuring security. At a time when connecting blockchain to real-life usages is a whole new competition Chainlink is outshining others. Its tech enables smart contracts to access and interact outside the blockchain. LINK has a way clearer direction than most other cryptos. It fuels a mechanism that connects blockchains and real-world data. Chainlink’s potential has only increased as people turn to decentralized finance and practical blockchain applications. Real utility matters in the current market, and LINK appears poised to tap into that.” Conclusion As LINK gains momentum in 2025, investors are quietly accumulating XYZVerse (XYZ)—a meme coin that unites sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem blending meme culture with sports enthusiasm.

The recent launch of the Stargate project in the US is a high proof of that. While Trump’s presidency is still in its early stages, we can already see the emergence of a trend towards tech-centricity, as he plans to pour $500 billion worth of investments into AI infrastructure. At the same time, this technological boom is set to reshape another industry – crypto. AI (artificial intelligence) has already been introduced into crypto in the form of AI agents, trading bots, automated risk analysis and more. The question isn’t whether AI will change crypto – it’s doing it even now. The real question is – w hat does this mean for crypto and blockchain in the long run? Will AI’s involvement strengthen this space or undermine the decentralized principles the crypto community holds dear? Here is my take on this. AI and crypto today – The shift has begun The way things are now, I’d say that AI’s presence in crypto hasn’t progressed far – i t’s still in the ‘infancy’ stage, so to speak. But this state of things won’t last – progress is happening at a rapid pace. This industry is moving beyond simple trading bots. Artificial intelligence is now being used to drive market-making strategies and risk assessment. We are even seeing cases of decentralized venture funding powered by AI. Projects like Moby AI, Griffain AI and HeyAnonAI are becoming more prolific – a nd while these are just early iterations of AI-based financial intelligence in crypto, they are already outperforming human traders in speed and efficiency. As AI models continue to grow in complexity and gain greater autonomy, I believe that soon they will no longer just follow market trends – they will shape them. What’s next on the horizon The next few years will redefine what it means to participate in crypto, and AI is going to be at the center of this transformation, bringing changes in all sectors. Autonomous AI trading agents are already optimizing market strategies in real-time with a level of speed and precision that far exceeds human capabilities. The more these bots advance, the greater competitive edge investors and traders will get from using them. In the field of DeFi compliance, AI-powered tools will become essential for maintaining security. Fraud and illicit transactions are always a point of concern, but AI-driven monitoring systems can analyze activities in blockchain networks and detect suspicious patterns in real time. This will allow them to flag potential risks before they escalate, making this space safer. At the same time, AI-integrated DeFi services will help streamline lending and borrowing by removing human intermediaries. AI models can be leveraged to automatically match borrowers and lenders and adjust interest rates dynamically as market conditions change. And all of that can be done without the need for human participation. I can also see on-chain AI agents playing a prominent part in governance. They can provide real-time market insights, manage portfolios and even contribute to DAO decision-making by enabling more data-driven governance choices. Beyond financial applications, AI could also solve long-standing blockchain inefficiencies. For example, one major issue with PoW (proof-of-work) networks is high energy use. AI can address this by analyzing and predicting network demand, dynamically adjusting energy consumption to reduce waste and optimize performance. Moreover, AI can facilitate ‘sharding,’ where blockchain data is divided across multiple nodes, allowing parallel processing and faster transaction times. This can help effectively scale blockchain networks, which is a critical step if cryptocurrencies are to see broader adoption. While AI today is still only a support tool, incapable of truly making effective decisions in place of humans, it will not always be so. To my mind, AI has all the chances of evolving into a dominant force that will actively shape the future of DeFi. The risks – C an AI undermine decentralization While AI promises a great upturn in efficiency, it is admittedly not without risks. And one of the biggest threats that I can foresee now is AI-driven market manipulation. Imagine a scenario where AI-powered trading firms control DeFi, making it that much harder for retail investors to compete. This is already something that we’re seeing in TradFi (traditional finance), as high-frequency trading firms use AI to exploit market inefficiencies. The same could happen in DeFi, resulting in an arms race between AI bots, while human traders remain outmatched and essentially get left behind. That said, DeFi has a bit of an advantage in this regard. Its high spreads and transaction fees act as a natural barrier against immediate AI domination. Since trading bots in DeFi must deal with significant costs, it creates a chicken-and-egg situation. As long as fees and spreads remain high, AI-driven trading won’t scale easily. And on the other hand, without a large trading volume, those costs will stay high. This may actually prevent AI-driven market manipulation, since everyone in DeFi has to operate on equal terms. Beyond that, there’s also the issue of AI-generated smart contracts to consider. AI can write entire contracts, but what happens if those contracts contain hidden vulnerabilities? Hackers could exploit AI-generated code, using adversarial inputs to bypass security audits. A single compromised AI-generated contract could mean millions of dollars’ worth of losses in crypto assets. This is a threat that DeFi developers will have to take very seriously – y ou absolutely should not rely on AI to write the code for you. The future of AI and crypto The AI race is not just a competition for dominance between nations – the real battle is between open-source and closed-source AI. The introduction of DeepSeek R1 has already become the basis for a major shift in this regard. It broke traditional assumptions about AI development, proving that billion-dollar budgets of BigTech companies aren’t always necessary for groundbreaking innovation to take place. AI development is no longer centralized, and I think that open-source models could align well with crypto’s values, as opposed to a more centralized approach. The idea that AI will take over the crypto sector is no longer a matter for debate. The only question now is how fast it will happen.

41366512,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=709209,1741496405,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Ethereum Breaks Out Of Descending Triangle Pattern – Fakeout Or Recovery Rally?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-breaks-out-of-descending-triangle-pattern-fakeout-or-recovery-rally/,"Ethereum (ETH) has been struggling around the $2,200 level, with bulls unable to reclaim higher prices despite multiple attempts. The market sentiment remains bearish, as ETH continues to face selling pressure even after Thursday’s announcement of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which many had expected to boost overall confidence in the crypto sector. Related Reading: 330,000 Ethereum Withdrawn From Exchanges In 72 Hours – Supply Squeeze Incoming? As ETH hovers near critical demand levels, analysts believe that the next week will be crucial in determining its short-term direction. If bulls can defend key support zones, Ethereum may have a chance to regain momentum. However, failure to hold these levels could lead to further downside pressure. Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting that Ethereum is breaking out of a pattern that often signals a potential breakout. If ETH follows this setup, it could push into higher resistance zones and reclaim key price levels above $2,500. However, confirmation of this breakout is needed, as market volatility remains high. Ethereum Bulls Hope For A Recovery Ethereum has suffered a steep decline, losing over 50% of its value since late December, triggering fear and panic selling across the market. Once a leader in previous bull cycles, ETH is now struggling to regain momentum, leading many analysts to question whether the long-awaited altseason will happen this year. With Ethereum and most altcoins unable to reclaim bullish structures, the market remains under bearish control, keeping investors cautious. Despite the negative sentiment, there is still hope for a recovery as Ethereum approaches key technical levels that could determine its next move. Runefelt’s remarks reveal that ETH is breaking above a descending triangle pattern, a setup that often signals a trend reversal. However, confirmation is crucial, as many past breakouts have turned into fakeouts, trapping traders in further downside moves. For Ethereum to solidify a bullish breakout, it must push above and close above $2,300. This level is a key resistance zone, and flipping it into support would indicate renewed buying strength, potentially opening the door for a push toward $2,500 and higher price targets. Related Reading: Solana Consolidates In A Wide Range – Big Move On The Horizon? Until this confirmation happens, Ethereum remains at risk of further declines if sellers regain control. Traders and investors are closely watching whether ETH can maintain its breakout attempt or if it will face another rejection, extending its bearish trend into the coming weeks. ETH Key Levels To Watch Ethereum is currently trading above the $2,000 support level, a crucial last line of defense for bulls hoping to see strong performance this year. Holding this level is essential, as a breakdown below $2,000 could trigger further downside, reinforcing bearish sentiment in the market. Despite this, bulls have struggled to reclaim higher prices, leaving investors frustrated with ETH’s lack of momentum. Recent price action has been choppy and indecisive, with each attempt at a breakout quickly met with selling pressure. This has kept ETH stuck in a tight range, preventing a clear shift in market sentiment. Related Reading: Litecoin Holds Bullish Outlook As the MVRV Ratio Signals Strength – Analyst However, a decisive reclaim of $2,300 could mark a turning point. If ETH pushes above and holds this level, it would likely open the door for a move toward $2,500, strengthening the case for a recovery rally. Until then, traders remain cautious, as Ethereum’s struggle to gain traction continues to weigh on the broader altcoin market.

Explore These 4 Best Crypto Coins You Can’t-Miss Out In March,https://thecoinrise.com/bull-run-ahead-explore-these-4-best-crypto-coins-you-cant-miss-out-in-march/,"As we approach the next crypto bull run, forward-looking investors are zeroing in on the best crypto coins to buy now to capitalize on potential price surges. Timely investment in promising ventures could transform modest investments into substantial wealth. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to make news, savvy investors are turning their focus to new projects with solid use cases and impressive presale results. Notably, Web3Bay is gaining traction with its fresh take on decentralizing e-commerce and strong presale dynamics. Here are four high-potential cryptocurrencies poised for significant growth as we head into the next bull cycle. 1. Web3Bay ($3BAY): Pioneering Decentralization in E-Commerce Amid a plethora of speculative tokens, Web3Bay stands out by aiming to decentralize the e-commerce sector. Its peer-to-peer marketplace model removes intermediaries, significantly cuts transaction costs, and places privacy back into the hands of users. With the global e-commerce market expected to exceed $8 trillion by 2030, Web3Bay’s solution is timely. Why Web3Bay is the Best Crypto to Buy Now: Over $1.60 million garnered in its presale with 400 million tokens sold. Current presale price: $0.00524 (Stage 5), projected to jump to $0.1959 at launch. Potential ROI: Early backers could see gains exceeding 3,633% upon token release. Platform perks: Discounts on transactions, staking rewards, and user-led governance. Web3Bay’s strong presale figures indicate high investor confidence, and with initial stages already sold out, it’s drawing interest from both individual and institutional investors. Its practical application and promising growth outlook make it a standout choice for 2025. 2. Kaspa (KAS): Leading Innovation in Scalable Proof-of-Work Despite many blockchains adopting proof-of-stake, Kaspa demonstrates that proof-of-work (PoW) remains viable for the future of crypto. Employing BlockDAG architecture, Kaspa enables almost instantaneous transaction confirmations while maintaining robust security. What Distinguishes Kaspa: Cutting-edge technology: Processes transactions faster than traditional PoW networks. Solid community support: Attracting interest from both individual and institutional investors. Price forecasts: Analysts predict potential price ranges from $774 to $5,156 as adoption grows. For those looking for a scalable PoW option with enduring potential, Kaspa warrants consideration. 3. Arbitrum (ARB): Pioneering Layer-2 Enhancements for Ethereum Ethereum’s well-known scalability issues have hindered its broader acceptance. Arbitrum steps in as a Layer-2 enhancement that boosts Ethereum’s transaction capacity and reduces costs. With DeFi and NFTs expanding, the significance of Arbitrum in the ecosystem cannot be overlooked. Why Arbitrum Stands Out as One of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy This Week: Robust developer ecosystem: Increasing support for numerous DeFi protocols and dApps. Growing user adoption: Users are shifting to this quicker alternative as Ethereum’s gas fees rise. Price predictions: Experts believe ARB could hit between $3 and $5 with ongoing Ethereum updates. As Ethereum continues to evolve, Arbitrum’s role as a Layer-2 solution is well-placed for significant growth in the next bull run. 4. Injective Protocol (INJ): Transforming DeFi with Ultra-Fast Trading Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the way we engage with financial services, and Injective Protocol is at the forefront with its innovative approach. It offers zero-gas fee derivatives trading and ultra-fast transactions, attracting both casual and professional traders. Top Reasons to Keep an Eye on Injective Protocol: Growing network: Adding new projects and liquidity providers regularly. Projected price increase: Analysts see potential for prices to reach $75 to $80 by Q2 2025. Advanced, fast infrastructure: Drawing users looking for quicker, more cost-effective DeFi options. For those interested in the dynamic DeFi sector, INJ offers both groundbreaking solutions and promising price prospects. Deciding Your Crypto Investments: Key Picks for the Bull Run While each of the four projects has impressive potential, Web3Bay stands out with its robust presale figures, clear market role, and e-commerce innovation, predicting a 3,633% ROI at launch that’s drawing significant investor interest. With batches selling rapidly, early involvement could be extremely rewarding. However, diversification is a wise approach. Blending Web3Bay’s growth prospects with Kaspa’s stability, Arbitrum’s scaling solutions, and Injective Protocol’s DeFi advances could create a well-rounded investment strategy for the upcoming bull run. If you’re scouting for the best crypto coins to buy now, these four projects should be top contenders on your list—and in your portfolio—before their prices climb. The post Bull Run Ahead!

Every investor dreams of catching that golden ticket before the market rockets sky-high. Meme coins have solidified themselves as a powerful asset class, proving time and again that they can deliver insane gains when the hype aligns with utility. If you’ve been searching for the best new meme coins to invest in for short term, your search ends here. The BTFD Coin (BTFD) presale is shaking things up, offering an unprecedented 100% bonus for all investors using the LAUNCH100 code. Meanwhile, community-driven projects like Pudgy Penguins and Floki Inu continue to hold their ground as top-tier meme coins. But with BTFD’s Bulls Squad, staking rewards, and Play2Earn game now live, the real action is happening at the BTFD presale. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad is Rallying – 100% Bonus Awaits The BTFD Coin presale is in full swing, and this is your chance to secure an early position before the price skyrockets. The project has already raised over $6.27 million and sold more than 71 billion BTFD coins to an ever-growing community of over 11,300 holders. Investors can currently buy BTFD for just $0.00016 per token, and with the presale price expected to hit $0.0006, that’s a 275% ROI without the bonus and a staggering 550% ROI if you use the 100% bonus code LAUNCH100. But the biggest buzz? The Bulls Squad. This powerhouse community is what makes BTFD stand out. Each member plays a critical role in ensuring that the movement thrives. From Baby Bull, the community’s heart and hype generator, to Raging Bull, the creative force driving BTFD’s marketing, the Bulls Squad is more than just a meme—it’s a movement. Nerdy Bull ensures the tech infrastructure runs smoothly, while Peoples Bull keeps the BTFD community engaged and growing. With these bulls leading the charge, it’s no wonder this best new meme coin to invest in for short term is smashing expectations. And now, BTFD has thrown a game-changing announcement into the mix: Stage 13 tokens have been burned! That’s right, all unsold tokens from the previous stage have been permanently removed from circulation, tightening the supply and increasing demand. To celebrate, BTFD is handing out a 100% bonus to every investor who uses the LAUNCH100 code. This means if you buy $2,450 worth of BTFD at $0.00016 per coin, you’ll receive 30,625,000 tokens. But with the 100% bonus applied, that jumps to 61,250,000 tokens—doubling your holdings instantly. When the presale ends and the price hits $0.0006, your initial $2,450 investment would be worth a massive $36,750. Staking Rewards and Play2Earn Game – The Passive Income Powerhouse BTFD isn’t just about making fast profits—it’s about long-term wealth generation. With a massive 90% APY staking reward, holders can earn passive income while waiting for the bull market to explode. The newly launched BTFD Play2Earn game adds even more utility, allowing players to rack up rewards just by playing. The full version is now live, making it one of the hottest interactive crypto experiences in the market. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus: Visit the BTFD Presale Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code Enter your purchase amount Confirm and buy Referral Program: Earn Even More BTFD Tokens! BTFD’s exclusive referral program rewards users with 10% of the raise amount when their referral code is used. The top 20 referrers will receive their rewards in BTFD tokens at the end of the month. This competition resets monthly, giving everyone a fair shot at stacking up even more tokens. Pudgy Penguins: The Power of Digital Collectibles Pudgy Penguins has become a cultural icon in the NFT and meme coin space, proving that community-driven projects can carve out their own niche. The project is centered around NFTs and brand partnerships, which have attracted thousands of collectors. Pudgy Penguins offers unique collectibles and access to exclusive events, making it a go-to for those who want to own a piece of the growing NFT economy. While it has earned a strong reputation, it lacks the high-reward staking mechanisms and presale advantages currently seen in BTFD Coin. Floki Inu: A Meme Coin That Built a Real Ecosystem Floki Inu has evolved from a meme into an ecosystem of DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. With its Valhalla metaverse and upcoming financial products, it has shown resilience in the crypto space. The community behind Floki has made it a staple in meme coin portfolios, though it doesn’t offer the same high APY staking rewards and presale-exclusive bonuses that BTFD Coin currently does. The Future is Now: Join the BTFD Bulls Before the Presale Ends In the fast-moving world of meme coins, those who act first reap the biggest rewards. The best new meme coins to invest in for short term are the ones that offer early-stage advantages, and BTFD Coin is leading the pack with its Bulls Squad, staking rewards, and Play2Earn game.

A strategic Bitcoin reserve was announced in the U.S., whilst a crypto stockpile and summit followed. Simultaneously, despite the optimistic developments, BTC and major-league altcoins continued encountering market volatility. Mentioned below are some of the most buzzworthy market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. Crypto Market This Week Sees US Bitcoin Reserve & Crypto Stockpile U.S. President Donald Trump announced a strategic Bitcoin reserve for America this week. This reserve is expected to encompass roughly 200,000 Bitcoins, which are currently held by the government through the cessation of funds involved in criminal and illicit activities. Intriguingly, Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick have been appointed officials who will focus on potential resources to help the reserve acquire more BTC ahead. Trump revealed that these BTC coins are also not to be sold ahead, offering the reserve more value. Further, the nation expects to see a ‘crypto stockpile’ comprised of assets like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP ahead, per Trump’s announcement. The main difference between the two sagas is that while the government will put efforts into acquiring more BTC, no active efforts for upsizing the crypto stockpile are to be made. Altogether, these were the major pro-crypto advancements in the U.S. this week. Crypto Summit: What’s The Scoop? Simultaneously, the cryptocurrency market saw a White House crypto summit this week, which was hosted by President Donald Trump and Crypto Czar David Sacks. Notably, Trump showcased strong efforts to end “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” which has been putting regulatory pressure on banks, leading them to close accounts of crypto businesses. Further, the 47th U.S. President continued reflecting strong support for cryptocurrencies, hinting that the government’s stance is primed to be more favorable for digital assets ahead. Overall, the Bitcoin reserve announcement, crypto summit, and a crypto stockpile launch ahead have sparked noteworthy market optimism. Bitcoin & Altcoins Still Volatile However, despite the broader developments this week, BTC and major league altcoins face crypto market turbulence. BTC price closed the week near $86K after riding a rollercoaster in the past seven days. ETH price lost nearly 2% and closed the week near $2,200.

The post features an Elon Musk’s Grok simulating President Donald Trump to propose a deal with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse . The hypothetical negotiation envisions the U.S. government integrating XRP into its financial system, including its adoption as part of the U.S. digital asset reserve. The AI-generated dialogue begins with the claim that an executive order signed on March 7, 2025, would bring XRP into the Treasury’s stewardship. The scenario suggests that this move would help position the U.S. as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, it addresses the ongoing legal dispute between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), proposing a resolution in exchange for a significant transfer of XRP from Ripple’s escrow holdings to the U.S. government. I asked Grok AI to pretend it was @realDonaldTrump the ultimate dealmaker. Make a deal with @bgarlinghouse pic.twitter.com/ag7XVmz1HF — Digital Asset Investor (@digitalassetbuy) March 7, 2025 Proposed Exchange of XRP for Legal Resolution In the AI-simulated negotiation, Ripple is presented with an offer to transfer 10 to 20 billion XRP from its escrow directly to the U.S. Treasury. This is framed as a strategic reserve acquisition that would not require taxpayer funds or market purchases. In return, the SEC case against Ripple would be dropped, providing the company with legal clarity and allowing XRP to operate without regulatory uncertainty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 “You save millions in legal fees, and XRP gets the green light to soar—legitimized by the U.S. government holding it,” the AI-generated Trump states. The argument suggests that government-backed ownership of XRP would boost its credibility and adoption. Vision for XRP in Government Transactions Beyond regulatory resolution, the AI-generated proposal outlines a broader vision for XRP’s role in government transactions. The Treasury would use XRP for payments amounting to $10–$15 billion annually, including cross-border transactions. The hypothetical scenario also suggests that U.S. citizens could be allowed to pay taxes using XRP, which, according to the post, would significantly drive adoption. Escrow Management and Market Impact The AI-driven discussion also addresses Ripple’s escrow, proposing that the XRP acquired by the U.S. government be held in a special escrow account for at least three years. The reasoning presented is that this would maintain market stability while allowing for potential value appreciation. The AI-generated dialogue speculates on XRP’s future price growth, suggesting that it could increase fivefold or more, benefiting the American public. Additionally, the post raises the possibility of linking XRP to gold reserves. It mentions that “Fort Knox is still full,” proposing a scenario where XRP could become part of a gold-backed digital financial system. Reactions and Broader Implications Although entirely speculative, the AI-generated negotiation has sparked discussion among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. The idea of XRP being formally adopted by the U.S. government and used for official transactions aligns with long-standing hopes within the XRP community for greater institutional recognition and regulatory clarity. The post highlights key concerns in the cryptocurrency industry, including the role of digital assets in government finance, the potential for blockchain-based payment solutions, and the importance of regulatory certainty. While such a deal remains fictional, it underscores ongoing debates about the future of XRP and its potential role in mainstream financial systems.

41367865,https://invezz.com/?p=2605452,1741499100,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Ripple (XRP) price expected to hit $3 in coming days but traders look toward this XRP rival for greater gains,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/09/ripple-xrp-price-expected-to-hit-3-in-coming-days-but-traders-look-toward-this-xrp-rival-for-greater-gains/,"XRP from Ripple experienced a 7% value increase in the last 24 hours, which created new positive market feelings because experts predict it will reach $3.40. Technological indicators show a crucial market inflection point because the token’s 4-hour resistance barrier has failed and the appearance of a Golden Cross pattern on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates increasing price speed. Dark Defender and other market experts insist XRP needs to sustain above $2.22 to verify its path toward $5.85. Despite rising market confidence, there exists now a developing trader movement toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which successfully collected $2.5 million during its presale operation. Investors chase exponential returns after MUTM reached 75% filling in its Phase 2 sale, while prices will increase by 33% during the upcoming stage under its structured growth model, which resembles early Ethereum. XRP’s technical crossroads The large-scale price increase of XRP depends on its ability to move past the $3.40 resistance barrier which was last observed during XRP’s 2021 bull market phase. Analysts have identified XRP tokens forming a consolidation structure which receives support at $2.57 and provides resistance at $2.70. If prices overcome the resistance range decisively, they might reach $3.05 which matches Fibonacci retracement levels. The cryptocurrency expert CasiTrades believes XRP’s strong performance above $2.70 can initiate a successive momentum that will drive the token to test $3.40 during the subsequent weeks. Mutuum Finance presale provides investors with significantly stronger returns since entering at $0.015 today, enabling a 400 percent profit when the token lists on exchanges at $0.06. Mutuum Finance’s presale momentum The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues through its second phase with tokens selling for $0.015 as the presale progresses toward reaching its next price barrier at $0.02. About 4,600 participants join the project due to its special lending structure and buy force mechanisms that drive investment into the project. MUTM stands apart from other speculative tokens since it allows users to deposit ETH and DAI assets to generate interest-bearing mtTokens that gradually increase in value while remaining usable on multiple DeFi platforms. MUTM token demand remains stable because 20% of platform transaction fees are used to buy tokens available on the market to boost token scarcity, which rewards staking participants. Users show strong interest in the presale process, which demonstrates its intrinsic value. The early purchasers from Phase 1 obtained MUTM at $0.012 during Phase 1, which led to immediate 25% profit when Phase 2 started. Analysts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve $4.50 each after its launch based on its limited supply and revenue-sharing arrangements, while the ongoing stage has already reached 75% usage. The substantial proportion of escape targets exceeds XRP’s upcoming goal,s thereby driving traders to move their funds before Mutuum’s exchange entry. Sustainable growth vs speculative peaks Mutuum Finance selects stability as its main priority by implementing overcollateralized loans that adapt interest rates based on market conditions. Markets must contribute assets that exceed the value of their loans by 140% to reduce the chance of non-payment along with maintaining lending liquidity. The protocol implements financial principles operational in traditional marketplaces and lets institutions access earning opportunities by bypassing intermediaries during market bearishness. Future users of MUTM can use P2P lending to design personalized terms for meme coin transactions while conventional DeFi platforms lack this feature. Presale participants get motivated to join early because the project offers a $100,000 giveaway that supports the project’s high level of appeal. Ten investors obtain $10,000 in MUTM tokens from the strategic distribution to foster community growth until the platform launches. The planned in-house stablecoin and partnership audits make Mutuum Finance appear as a sustained market player beyond speculative market patterns. XRP’s journey to reach $3 value appears achievable yet its price expansion depends on wider market movement along with regulatory definitions. Through token burn mechanisms and stake rewards together with the natural demand of the platform Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its trajectory. Phase 2’s $0.015 window closes imminently—and with the next price hike just days away, hesitation now could forfeit life-changing gains later. As the crypto market braces for another rally, smart money is hedging bets on projects with tangible use cases. Mutuum Finance’s presale offers a rare convergence of low entry points and mathematically defined returns, making it the unambiguous choice for investors prioritizing growth over legacy momentum.

Bitcoin price was trading at $86,000 on Sunday, while the total market cap of all coins retreated to $2.83 trillion. This article explores the top crypto price predictions, including the likes of Notcoin (NOT), Quant (QNT), and DigiByte (DGB). Quant price prediction QNT price chart by TradingView Quant token has been in a strong downward trend in the past few months. It dropped from a high of $171.5 in December last year to $83 today. This decline happened even a the balances on exchanges continued falling, a sign that investors are not selling. Quant also made a major breakthrough after Oracle used its technology to launch a blockchain project using its technology. Demand for Quant’s technology will likely keep rising as more companies embrace the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization trend. Quant token has now dropped below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The two lines are about to form a death cross, which happens when the two lines cross each other. A death cross is one of the riskiest patterns in the market. Therefore, the coin may continue falling as sellers target the next key support at $72.8, its lowest swing on February 3. A break below that level will invalidate the double-bottom pattern and lead to more downside. DigiByte price forecast DGB chart by TradingView DigiByte token price bottomed at $0.0070 in February, and has bounced back to $0.011. It is a proof-of-work network that is often seen as a better alternative to Bitcoin and Litecoin. It is a Made in the USA coin that has faster speeds and has smart contract features. The coin bottomed at $0.0070, and has moved above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have pointed upwards. The coin has moved above the falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal sign. DigiByte is approaching the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level, while other oscillators have continued rising. Therefore, the DGB token will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $0.01560, up by over 43% above the current level. Notcoin (NOT) NOT chart by TradingView The Notcoin price has crashed as demand for tap-to-earn tokens failed. NOT has dropped to a low of $0.002070, its lowest level since May last year. It has plunged by over 94% from its highest level in 2024. Notcoin’s crash has coincided with that of other tap-to-earn tokens like Hamster Kombat, Tapswap, and Catizen. All these tokens, including Toncoin, have all plunged in the past few months. The Notcoin price has moved below the 50-day moving average, and the crucial support level at $0.002165. It also fell below the important support level at $0.005520, the lowest swing on November 4. Therefore, the Notcoin price will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support level at $0.0015.

Larger investors are stepping in, recognizing a promising early-stage opportunity with significant upside. As tokens sell out quickly, early participants are taking advantage of the current price before it rises in the upcoming stage. Mutuum Finance stands out by providing a structured lending mechanism that enables users to earn passive income through decentralized borrowing and lending. With the token price incrementally climbing with each phase, interest grows among those seeking to secure their holdings ahead of more expensive future rounds. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance ’s presale spans 11 phases in total. Since Phase 2 is now nearly sold out, investors are hurrying to acquire tokens at the current rate before Phase 3 initiates a price increase. Over 4,500 holders have already joined, drawn by the project’s growth potential and determined to act before higher price tiers come into effect. Institutional-scale investors, often referred to as whales, appreciate tokens grounded in genuine utility rather than short-term speculation. That’s precisely why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing strong inflows. As each phase sells out, the sense of urgency intensifies, fostering more interest among those aiming to secure a lower entry point before the token’s launch price of $0.06. Large-scale investors are backing Mutuum Finance due to its robust financial model intended to drive ongoing demand for the token. Instead of depending on market euphoria, MUTM is tied to a functioning lending environment, giving it fundamental support. An added factor is Mutuum’s buy-and-distribute protocol, which allocates a portion of platform proceeds to purchasing MUTM from the open market. These acquired tokens then go to mtToken stakers, generating continuous buy pressure and benefiting long-term participants. This approach dovetails with institutional strategies that emphasize value over fleeting price fluctuations. mtTokens and the Lending Protocol The mtToken system represents user deposits within Mutuum’s liquidity pools. If a lender supplies ETH, they get mtETH; if they deposit DAI, they receive mtDAI. These tokens track both the initial deposit and the yield earned, providing a transparent, adaptable way to engage with the platform while retaining control of one’s assets. Mutuum Finance’s lending model is broken down into two segments. Under Peer-to-Contract (P2C), participants deposit crypto into liquidity pools, earning returns as borrowers utilize these assets based on an interest rate aligned with supply and demand. With Peer-to-Peer (P2P), users directly agree on loan terms, covering assets often excluded from standard lending pools—meme tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), or other unconventional coins. Another essential element is the protocol’s overcollateralized stablecoin, enabling token holders to borrow funds without turning to centralized reserves. Every stablecoin minted is fully covered by on-chain collateral, making it reliable and stable for use in DeFi. $100,000 Giveaway and Surging Investor Confidence Mutuum Finance is also running a $100,000 giveaway for presale participants to celebrate its growing momentum. This campaign aims to encourage user engagement by rewarding token purchasers, with information about eligibility and guidelines on the official website. As the presale advances, interest from whale investors signals confidence in MUTM’s ability to offer long-term value. With Phase 2 nearly finished, investors purchasing at $0.015 could see an instant 300% increase at launch, and projections indicate further expansion beyond the initial listing. Mutuum Finance underpins its growth with genuine market demand, sidestepping hype-based market cycles. Given Phase 2’s impending conclusion, prompt action might be necessary before Phase 3 raises the price. Early buyers place themselves at a lower entry price, making room for substantial growth once the token becomes available on broader markets.

In a recent post, he highlighted that he had predicted a structure before the U.S. presidential executive order on digital assets . He suggests that the U.S. government may acquire the remaining XRP escrow through Treasury Bills (T-Bills). Egrag Crypto’s statement underscores his belief that strategic digital assets will help the nation’s financial policies. He links this to the recent development involving Ondo Finance, which has integrated tokenized U.S. Treasuries into the XRP Ledger (XRPL). According to the analyst, this move is not merely an experiment but a sign of a broader transformation in the financial landscape. I was right about having two tier digital reserves in the below article before the presidential Exective order announcement. Now wait until, US Goverment buys #XRP remaining escrow account via T-Bills. Ondo Finance, a tokenised real-world asset (RWA) issuer, is adding… https://t.co/8u2r9kVPro — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 7, 2025 The Two-Tier Reserve System and U.S. Crypto Strategy Previously, Egrag Crypto detailed a framework for how digital assets would be categorized in the U.S. financial system. He divided these assets into two primary tiers: Primary Strategic Reserve – Utility-Based Assets: This category includes digital assets with real-world use cases and institutional adoption. He specifically mentioned XRP as a key player, describing it as the foundation for the “Internet of Value” due to its capabilities in instant global transfers. He also included Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) in this tier, citing their roles in smart contracts and scalability. Secondary Strategic Reserve – Digital Property: Bitcoin (BTC) and similar assets fall under this classification. According to Egrag Crypto, the U.S. government recognizes BTC’s value but will not rely on it as the core of the financial system. Instead, it will be an underlying asset for derivatives and other financial instruments. Egrag Crypto claims that the U.S. already holds a significant amount of Bitcoin and suggests that authorities have access to Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet. He believes Bitcoin maximalists must acknowledge that BTC alone will not shape the digital financial system. The Role of XRP and the U.S. Government’s Possible Move Egrag Crypto suggests that the U.S. government could acquire XRP’s remaining escrow through T-Bills. This assertion follows recent developments within the XRPL ecosystem, such as Ondo Finance’s decision to bring tokenized U.S. Treasuries onto the ledger . While the move by Ondo Finance is officially framed as an expansion of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), Egrag Crypto interprets it as a strategic step towards broader adoption and potential government involvement. His statement implies that XRP’s liquidity and functionality could be central to a restructured financial system, aligning with prior claims that utility-based assets will be prioritized over speculative ones. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Trump’s Strategy and the Shift in Crypto Policy Egrag Crypto also connects his predictions to former President Donald Trump’s approach to digital assets. In a previous article, he described Trump’s method as a “Reallocation of Pain,” a strategy designed to reshape market perceptions. He argued that Trump intentionally mentioned XRP, SOL, and ADA before acknowledging BTC and ETH to challenge Bitcoin maximalists. He further suggested that Ethereum (ETH) might face regulatory scrutiny due to past controversies, particularly allegations surrounding preferential treatment from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He hinted that the Trump administration could take a firm stance on Ethereum’s regulatory history. Egrag Crypto’s latest claims reinforce his long-standing argument that XRP and other utility-driven assets will become integral to the U.S. financial infrastructure. His speculation that the U.S. government might acquire XRP’s remaining escrow aligns with his broader thesis on a two-tier reserve system. While no official confirmation supports his claim, integrating tokenized U.S. Treasuries onto the XRPL adds weight to discussions surrounding XRP’s evolving role in finance.

While Bitcoin secures its future with government backing and Ethereum experiences an explosion in trading volume, BitLemons ($BLEM) is quietly setting up for what could be one of the most lucrative plays in crypto right now. Forget speculative tokens with no real use case. BitLemons is already generating revenue, running a fully operational casino, and rewarding investors through its innovative tokenomics. With presale stages selling out fast and big partnerships rumored to be on the horizon, the window to get in at the ground floor is closing rapidly. Could BitLemons ($BLEM) Be the Best Kept Secret in Crypto? BitLemons is a thriving ecosystem that’s already making money. The platform is redefining GambleFi with over 8,000 casino games from top providers like Evolution and Pragmatic, running 24/7. More than that, BitLemons has now launched its own branded games, including $BLEM Keno, Crash, and Wheel of BitLemons, which generate even higher margins by eliminating third-party fees. Investors are already taking notice. Stage 1 of the presale sold out in just 16 days. Now, Stage 2 is already 82% complete at $0.02 per token, and once it sells out, Stage 3 will push prices up to $0.03. The rumored listing price sits between $0.17 and $0.18, meaning those who enter now could be looking at massive gains. Unlike projects that rely on hype alone, BitLemons is backed by real revenue. 30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) goes straight back into the token. Half of that is used for buybacks and burns, creating a deflationary supply, while the other half is distributed as staking rewards. The result? A token that isn’t just rising in value but actually pays its holders. And the best part? Industry insiders suggest major influencer and celebrity partnerships are coming soon. If a top-tier athlete or A-list influencer backs BitLemons, demand could explode overnight. Can BTC’s Government Approval Push It to New Heights? Bitcoin has long been called digital gold, but now it’s being treated like it. The U.S. government has officially established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, signaling a massive shift in institutional perception. This move could cement Bitcoin’s place as a global asset, driving long-term adoption among hedge funds, banks, and even nations. While volatility remains a part of Bitcoin’s DNA, the bigger picture is clear. With institutional interest at an all-time high, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory looks stronger than ever. Why Is ETH Suddenly the Center of Attention? Ethereum has been dominating headlines, and for good reason. Its daily spot trading volume recently hit an all-time high of $38 billion, proving that investors aren’t just holding—they’re actively trading. Adding to the excitement, Eric Trump has publicly endorsed Ethereum, attracting fresh mainstream interest. While ETH has seen price fluctuations, its support near $2,000 remains strong, and analysts are watching for a potential breakout past $2,300. Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts means that even in volatile conditions, it remains one of the most important assets in crypto. Will BLEM Become Crypto’s Biggest Success Story? Bitcoin is securing its place as a financial powerhouse. Ethereum is proving its role as the backbone of decentralized finance. But BitLemons is carving out something entirely new—a self-sustaining revenue model where investors don’t just speculate, they profit. With an active casino, a rapidly growing user base, and presale tokens disappearing fast, the clock is ticking for those looking to get in early. The next price increase is just days away, and once partnerships start rolling out, demand could skyrocket. Crypto’s biggest winners are those who get in before the rest of the world catches on. The only question is: Are you ready to claim your share of the next big thing? Discover the Exciting Opportunities of BitLemons ($BLEM) Presale Today!

SEC Lawsuit Update March 9th,https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-v-sec-lawsuit-update-march-9th/,"TL;DR Ripple’s lawsuit with the SEC remains ongoing, with speculation that the company might be waiting for Paul Atkins to take over as Chairman of the agency to potentially drop or reduce the $125 million penalty. Prior to the SEC’s appeal, the firm was ready to pay the fine. Is Ripple Waiting for This? The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has drastically changed its approach toward the cryptocurrency industry since the departure of its former Chairman, Gary Gensler. Recall that it dismissed or paused numerous lawsuits against crypto entities, including Binance, Coinbase , Kraken, Uniswap , and more. However, its most notorious case against Ripple remains ongoing. Recently, the attorney Fred Rispoli said he has a new theory on the legal battle. He sees “no reason why the current 2-1 pro-crypto Commission wouldn’t drop the appeal and keep the $125M judgment in place.” The multi-million penalty refers to Judge Torres’ decision from last summer. Back then , she ordered Ripple to pay the amount for violating certain rules. The company’s execs were ready to settle the bill, but the regulator filed a last-minute appeal, thus prolonging the lawsuit indefinitely. Its reaction was rather expected since the fine represents just a fraction of the $2 billion the SEC initially asked for. Rispoli assumed that Ripple’s team might be waiting for Paul Atkins to step in and drop or reduce the figure. Atkins, nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as Chairman of the SEC, has yet to take the helm and should first receive the Senate’s confirmation. Currently, the agency is spearheaded by Mark Uyeda, who has previously shown support for the cryptocurrency sector. Over the past few days, there has been increased speculation that instead of paying the $125 million penalty, Ripple might send the equivalent amount in XRP to the strategic crypto reserve that Trump recently announced. Rispoli gave his two cents on the matter, saying : “It’s possible, but the way we have been moving incrementally, I doubt this is a likely scenario.” Other Opinions Earlier this month, American attorney James Murphy suggested that the case could still be unsolved because the firm might be “trying hard to get the SEC to agree to vacate some or all of Judge Torres’ decisions.” He sees the $125 million penalty as “great” for XRP holders but maintained that the findings that Ripple has breached some laws “is not so great” for the company’s reputation. Meanwhile, the former White House official Anthony Scaramucci believes that the lawsuit is over. In a recent interview, he placed the Ripple case among those the SEC has dropped as of late . The host of the conversation , Scott Melker (known as The Wolf of All Streets), agreed with this assumption. The post Ripple v.

Ali Martinez recently posted that PEPE is going to see a massive rebound after its bullish movement. However, it seems that most investors have discovered a new PEPE competitor who can turn $100 into $10,000. DuragDoge ($DURAG) is the bullish meme coin that turns the script in space with its revolutionary tokenomics and street life concept. Even in presale, DuragDoge receives investors’ vote as one of the best crypto coins to buy now with its relatable and nonconformist ecosystem. Here’s why DuragDoge could be the next Pepe. Pepe (PEPE): Analyst Shares Insight On Its Future Trajectory Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared that Pepe is moving higher than the lower boundary line of its parallel channel. Pepe could rebound to $0.000016, reflecting its bullish strength and appeal to savvy investors, Ali clarified. However, a whale sold over 175 billion PEPE tokens, which put pressure on Pepe’s price action. PEPE costs approximately $0.000078, which has decreased by over 17.8% in the last seven days due to the general fall in the market. Nevertheless, Pepe’s trading volume has risen to over $800 million following increased trading. Even though the majority of investors expect Pepe to recover, $DURAG is the next crypto to 100x this year. DuragDoge ($DURAG): Merging The Popularity Of Meme Culture With Street Hustle DuragDoge is a trailblazer project that has a unique story and new method of making wealth. The project offers a real picture of a pup that developed on the streets with nothing but determination and street smarts, showing it could be a solid Pepe challenger. DuragDoge positions itself as one of the best crypto coins to buy now not only because of its cute mascot but because it has a theme all cryptocurrency traders can relate to: hustle and hard work. Experts are positive that DuragDoge can outpace Pepe this year as the upcoming crypto to 100x given that it features staking, special tokenomics, and deflationary setup. The groundbreaking tokenomics on the project uses all $DURAG tokens on the platform, thus providing a secure, transparent, and organized environment. With DuragDoge, 62% $DURAG tokens are dedicated to its ICO, giving you an opportunity to purchase one of the market’s new ICO crypto coins. DuragDoge gives a burn process to maintain its worth. The frequent token burning reduces the circulating supply of $DURAG tokens. When this burn process is triggered, the value of $DURAG increases, thus making it equal to giant players like Pepe. DuragDoge ($DURAG): Traders Can Experience Passive Income Potential The $DURAG presale is ongoing, and every token is $0.0009. This low price makes DuragDoge even more attractive to leading Pepe investors. As a $DURAG holder, you will be able to enjoy special privileges such as staking and even make $100 become $10,000 when the project goes live. Additionally, the DurgaDoge project offers incredible features like staking rewards, burn mechanism, and fast-growing presale. For those who would want to maximize their returns, they can utilize passive income opportunities through DuragDoge’s staking system. Once you stake your $DURAG tokens for a period of time, you will be rewarded with up to 20% APY. Conclusion $DURAG enters into the list of new ICO crypto coins, which can beat the market trend and offer gigantic returns. With all these investors switching their attention away from Pepe to DuragDoge, investors say early adopters of its presale will reap a 100x ROI.

Transaction revenues are expected to decline following BTC price trends, while subscription revenues are projected to grow steadily. Competition from crypto ETFs is not seen as a significant threat. Current valuation suggests a 36% upside by 2028, but I recommend waiting for a price pullback to $220-240 before buying. This is my first cover of Coinbase (COIN). In the article, I will describe Coinbase's business areas and my opinion on how they will affect the company's future. I will try to provide a valuation based on the current state. Introduction Coinbase is a financial services company that does business in everything related to cryptocurrencies. It offers users crypto trading, allows them to stake their crypto and earn a stable income from it, and offers crypto wallets and crypto payment services. Coinbase separates its business into two categories: transactions and subscriptions & services. I want to dig deeper into both and try to extrapolate current results into the future. Transactions Q4 was a perfect quarter for Coinbase as transaction revenues reached $2,197 million. This was due to BTC price appreciation, the election of Donald Trump, and overall optimism around cryptocurrencies. I believe revenues from transactions will go down from here, similar to what happened in 2021 when revenues reached $7,354 million before retreating to $3,148 million in 2022. 2021 was similar to 2024, a year when BTC's price increased exponentially. In the next few years, when BTC price stagnated, it was also Coinbase's revenues that stagnated. In my opinion, this story is bound to repeat, so I will do my projections accordingly in the valuation section. Subscription & Services Subscriptions and services revenue, as this part of Coinbase's business, is becoming increasingly important with high growth and, even more importantly, consistency of revenues. As we can see from the picture below (Picture 1), in the last four years, this sector grew with a CAGR of 167%. The most important parts are stablecoin revenue and blockchain rewards, so I will concentrate on those and try to estimate how they will perform in the future. I believe that, due to the consistency of revenues, this part will, in the long term, be more essential than transaction revenue. Picture 1 (Coinbase) USDC revenues USDC is a stablecoin pegged to USD in a 1:1 ratio, created by Circle and Coinbase in 2018. Revenues from this stablecoin are primarily derived from interest income from USDC holdings. As USDC gains popularity and its market cap increases, so do Coinbase's revenues. I will not go into more detail here because I liked Mike Fay's article and his thoughts on USDC and Base, so I'd advise you to go read that article if you are unfamiliar with the topic. Blockchain rewards revenue - Staking Coinbase is offering cryptocurrency staking (which is the main part of the revenues marked as ''blockchain rewards revenue'') which is a stable and predictable revenue source for Coinbase and the crypto investor. Before we go further, let me explain what staking is for those unfamiliar with the matter. Staking is a term used when a cryptocurrency owner participates in a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network by locking up his cryptocurrency. This is used to secure and validate transactions. Coinbase allows the user to stake his crypto in exchange for a fee-currently 15-25% of the staking reward. Below is a list of crypto that can be staked, and we can see that the ''interest rate'' is quite significant (Picture 2). Picture 2 (Coinbase) This part of the business is quite stable, as long-term crypto investors like to stake their currency for longer periods, earning them and Coinbase steady revenues. And just to be clear, this is in addition to any price appreciation of the cryptocurrency. Note that in time, staking rewards decline, as more people stake their cryptocurrency, the reward per stake decreases. For example, below is a chart representing Ethereum's staking rate in percentages - Y axis. (Chart 1). Chart 1 (CompasFT.com) I believe that since staking rewards are a part of investors owning crypto for the long term, it will be a business that will be consistently profitable, provide reliable revenues, and will slowly grow over time. This will be very beneficial for Coinbase as it makes them, as Warren Buffett would say, a tollbooth business. Competition with ETFs In January 2024, there was the first BTC ETF made available for US investors. After that, more BTC ETFs got approved, and in July, we got Ethereum spot ETF. Naturally, there is a worry that ETFs tracking crypto will take away customers from Coinbase. I do not believe this will be the case. Let me give a comparison between ETFs and buying spot crypto on Coinbase so that we may better understand it. The obvious one is that investors will directly own crypto should they buy it on Coinbase. That has several benefits, and in my opinion, the most important one is the availability of staking. As I explained before, in addition to underlying crypto price appreciation, one will also earn revenue from ''interest.'' On the other hand, investors that bought Bitcoin ETF cannot stake cryptocurrency and have to pay management fees , which range from 0.12% up to 1%. I believe that the possibility of staking is the main reason investors would prefer Coinbase compared to ETFs. Upcoming market catalysts In my opinion, resurging inflation is the most important catalyst for crypto investing. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies act as a hedge against inflation. We have seen in the last few months that the inflation rate rose from 2.4% in September to 3% in January, and due to Trump's tariffs, it is only logical to assume that it will continue to increase. That will be quite beneficial for crypto. One could argue that Trump's creation of the crypto reserve is another positive catalyst. But I do not believe it will be that important. First US doesn't have the money to buy additional crypto, in 2024 US deficit amounted to $1.8 trillion, which represented 6.4% of GDP. I believe this makes US crypto investments unlikely. The second would be the crypto that the government will keep after seizing it in criminal or civil cases. David Sachs, a crypto and AI tzar selected by Trump, said that the US currently has about 200,000 BTCs, which is worth $16.2 billion at the current price of $81,000 per BTC. This only amounts to 0.00056% of the US GDP. I believe it will not create a meaningful difference for the crypto market. Valuation Coinbase stated in the Q4 earnings release that they generated $750M in transaction revenues through February 11th. That would mean around $1,500M of transaction revenues in Q1. That would be a slight decrease from Q4 (Table 1), and if we believe the story from 2021 is to repeat, this trend will continue and transaction revenues will continue to go down. A reasonable assumption would be that the revenues from transactions for the rest of the year 2025 would be somewhere in between Q1-Q3 2024 and Q4 2024. I will use a conservative figure of $900 million for the rest of 2025 (without Q1). That would mean that in 2025, Coinbase would make $4,200 million in 2025. I will be conservative and will estimate that transaction revenues will fall to $4,000 in 2026 and not grow thereafter. Table 1 (Coinbase) Next, we have to do estimates for subscriptions and services. Coinbase estimates that in Q1 they will generate between $685 million and $765 million in revenues. Since so far, they usually beat their forecasts, I will use $765 million as my estimate. That would mean about 50% YoY growth from Q1, 2024. I believe this trend of growth will continue independently of BTC price, due to the facts stated in the introduction chapter. I will use a conservative 25% YoY growth for 2025 and 15% thereafter. Below is a table estimating transaction and subscription revenues (Table 2). Table 2 (Author's Work) Now we have to figure out the expenses. The company estimates that transaction expenses will be in the mid to high teens as a percentage of transaction revenues. From Q1 to Q4, they were between 14 and 15%; I will use 16% as a conservative estimate for Q1 and thereafter. The company expects other Q1 operating expenses (this includes technology & development, general & administrative, and sales & marketing) to be between $985 and $1,175 million. Since in Q4, they were on the high end of the guidance, I will use $1,175 million in my estimates. This would represent 52% of the total revenues. In Q4, this was 42% of the total revenues. I estimate that operating expenses will stay at 52% of the revenues for the rest of 2025 and then slowly fall to 40% as the company grows and becomes more efficient. I put all of my estimates into a table and tried to calculate the upside (Tables 3 & 4). Table 3 (Author's Work) Table 4 (Author's work) If my estimates are correct, there is a 58% upside by 2028. Note that I used conservative estimates for the future services & subscription revenues, and the true upside is probably a bit higher than I calculated - probably in the 70-80% range. Risks I believe the highest risk for Coinbase would be additional crypto regulation. Since Coinbase does most of its business in the US, and with Trump being pro-crypto, this risk is minimal. Second is the competition. Players like Robinhood (HOOD) added the possibility to trade crypto. But I believe that with all the other services that Coinbase offers, a true crypto investor will choose Coinbase over the competition. One could argue the real danger for Coinbase is that Robinhood will take investors who mostly invest in stocks but also want some crypto exposure. Yet, I believe even these investors might choose Coinbase if they want to stake their coins. Note that Coinbase offers higher staking returns compared to Robinhood. In the end, I do not believe there is much danger for Coinbase from the competition. Competition from decentralized exchanges Decentralized exchanges operate by users trading directly with each other, essentially cutting out the middleman, like Coinbase. They are not regulated and offer safety from potential government seizures. However, as a downside, they are more complicated to use and provide less liquidity for trading. Thus, they are more suitable for crypto holders than for crypto traders, especially institutional traders. Most users went to decentralized exchanges to avoid possible government regulation. However, with the SEC dropping lawsuits against Coinbase and Robinhood, the necessity to avoid government regulation and going to decentralized exchanges is now much lower. Still, even before the drop of lawsuits Coinbase's blockchain rewards revenues, which are mostly from the crypto holders staking their crypto, were consistently increasing as can be seen in Picture 1. Note that one can also stake their crypto on a decentralized exchange. According to the facts stated above, I do not believe decentralized exchanges pose a risk to Coinbase, especially now with crypto-friendly government. Plan Due to my estimates in the valuation chapter, I believe the current price warrants a buy. Additionally, there are possible catalysts for crypto like inflation, and a crypto-friendly US government, which might increase crypto adoption.

Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) recently highlighted a symmetrical triangle formation on the digital asset’s chart, stating that a breakout could lead to a significant 23% price increase. Given XRP’s current price of $2.33, this projection sets a potential target of approximately $2.86, smashing through notable resistance levels. A symmetrical triangle is typically a continuation pattern, and with XRP maintaining higher lows, the market appears primed for a bullish move. Traders closely watch key levels, anticipating a breakout that could drive XRP’s next rally. $XRP is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle. A breakout could spark a 23% price move! pic.twitter.com/XjxwrMS7rk — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Strong Market Indicators Suggest Upward Momentum Several technical indicators and market signals support the expectation of an upward breakout. Martinez recently discussed a head-and-shoulders pattern forming on XRP’s chart, which could indicate a shift in momentum favoring buyers. Additionally, institutional demand and increasing whale accumulation suggest that larger players are positioning themselves for a price surge. Martinez also noted that XRP looks set for a rebound after the TD Sequential Indicator flashed a buy signal . This analysis reinforces the idea that the digital asset’s bullish structure remains intact, with buyers ready to push the asset higher once resistance is breached. Symmetrical triangle patterns are powerful indicators that often trigger notable price rallies, and the additional bullish indicators could help the asset outperform expectations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Growing Optimism and Potential Price Movement Beyond technical indicators, fundamental factors are also fueling optimism. XRP has been flashing bullish signals, including rising trading volume and renewed market interest. A recent report showed a notable surge in trading volume, as the XRP ecosystem saw $5.37 billion transferred in under 24 hours. Despite the broader bearish trend, the XRP ecosystem is experiencing a notable increase in attention and activity and additional factors like the recent inclusion in the newly announced U.S. crypto reserve could help the asset regain its footing and begin a price surge. While short-term volatility is always a factor, market conditions favor an upward breakout rather than a downward move. A decisive break above resistance could trigger further buying pressure, supporting the 23% price increase projection outlined by Martinez. With bullish technical indicators, strong support levels, and growing institutional interest, the asset appears well-positioned for an upward move toward $2.86.

Bearish Pattern Spotted,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/render-price-poised-for-30-drop-bearish-pattern-spotted/,"The post RENDER Price Poised for 30% Drop? Bearish Pattern Spotted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Render (RENDER), one of the top-tier crypto AI projects, is poised for a price decline due to the formation of bearish price action on the four-hour time frame. Bearish Market Sentiment As of today, March 9, 2025, the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment appears bearish. Leading assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP have experienced notable price declines, influencing the broader market and contributing to a major downturn across the sector. RENDER is currently trading near $3.45 and has registered a price drop of over 3.55% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume declined by 55%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors as the price reached a crucial level. RENDER Price Action and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, RENDER has formed a bearish head and shoulders pattern on the four-hour time frame and is on the verge of a neckline breakdown at $3.40. Based on recent price momentum and historical patterns, if the asset breaches the neckline and closes a daily candle below $3.35, there is a strong possibility of a 30% decline, potentially reaching the $2.22 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View Besides this bearish price action, RENDER’s Exponential Moving Average (EMA) indicates that the asset is still in a downtrend, which may be contributing to the lack of participation from traders and investors. Traders Over-Leveraged Positions Traders are currently over-leveraged at $3.39 on the lower side and $3.60 on the upper side, having built $382K worth of long positions and $800K worth of short positions in the past 24 hours, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . When combining these metrics with technical analysis, it appears that bears are in control and could soon push RENDER below the neckline, potentially triggering further decline.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-09 06:56:51

The popular cryptocurrency, which has been a hot topic due to its unique mining model and closed mainnet, is now gaining an unprecedented following on the X social media platform . The cryptocurrency is also rivaling top meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) , quickly approaching the size of the meme coin’s loyal fanbase. PI Network Closes In On Dogecoin With 4 Million Followers On X Pi Network has achieved an incredible milestone by reaching 4 million followers on X, signaling a significant step forward in its rapid rise within the crypto market. This rapid growth and adoption positions the cryptocurrency on the verge of matching or even surpassing the social media presence of Dogecoin which has 4.3 million followers on X. Since its inception in 2019, Pi Network has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts, offering user-friendly and mobile-based mining services. This mining activity clearly contrasts with traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which require high-powered hardware for mining . To commemorate its massive growth, the team behind Pi Network took to X on March 5 to announce its milestone of reaching 4 million followers on X. They congratulated community members and PI enthusiasts who helped support the cryptocurrency in hitting this goal. In addition to its growing adoption on X, Pi Network has become one of the trendiest cryptocurrencies in the market. While other top digital assets struggle with the broader market volatility and experience price declines, the value of PI is surging at an unexpected rate. CoinGecko has ranked PI Network as the number one trendy cryptocurrency in its top 20 list. The popular cryptocurrency has surpassed top dogs like Dogecoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana, XRP, Bitcoin, and other major digital currencies. CoinMarketCap also ranks Pi Network as the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, just two positions from Dogecoin’s 9th . This rapid growth to the 11th position underscores PI’s impressive growth in just a few weeks. Community Advocates For Binance Listing For PI Rumors of a potential PI Network listing on Binance , the largest crypto exchange, have been spreading across the crypto market. This speculation grows as the crypto community pushes for this integration on Binance. The PI blockchain on X made a bold request on February 5, demanding Binance to officially list the Pi Network and make it available for trade on its exchange. Calling on all PI supporters and community members, the PI blockchain urged investors and holders to continually advocate for the listing and ensure their voices are heard. Interestingly, an X user named ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ reported that 86% of Binance community members had voted in favor of listing the Pi Network. Despite these results and the ongoing pressure from the PI community, Binance has yet to make an official statement.

Hoskinson took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his views: “I appreciate everyone’s passions and feelings about whether or not I should attend or be invited to certain US government events. Bashing government officials via X solves nothing or changes hearts and minds.” He urged the Cardano community to focus on the development of the ecosystem rather than focusing on government involvement. The summit, which brought together crypto industry figures and US government representatives, aimed to discuss regulatory frameworks and the future of digital assets. However, Hoskinson’s absence sparked controversy within the crypto community, with many questioning why the Cardano founder was not invited.

He announced that he plans to return to Japan, a country deeply connected to Cardano’s origins, and continue to engage with the global community to listen, learn, and contribute to the advancement of the ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

The token has been trading below a critical level, reflecting ongoing volatility. SHIB dropped from its December peak of $0.0000329 and remains in a downward trend. Analysts predict a possible rebound, but market conditions suggest uncertainty about its next direction. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: What’s Next for SHIB in the Market? Shiba Inu price dropped sharply as the broader meme coin market faced losses. After a strong start to March, assets like Dogecoin and SHIB saw a downturn. This decline pushed Shiba Inu lower in market rankings, reflecting the overall weakness in the crypto sector. Meme coins, including Dogecoin, WIF, PENGU, BONK, and PEPE, have recorded notable price decreases. The trend follows the broader market correction affecting digital assets. Shiba Inu’s price movement has been in line with this sentiment, signaling uncertainty among traders. Despite the slump, three potential catalysts could boost SHIB’s price. The most significant factor is its rising burn rate. On March 8, the daily burn rate surged by 3,250% to 29 million tokens. Since its inception, over 410 trillion SHIB tokens have been removed from circulation, reducing supply to 584 trillion. Analyst Predicts Shiba Inu Breakout With 422% Surge Crypto analyst reports indicate that the SHIB price may have broken out of a Falling Wedge pattern. The breakout suggests a potential price surge, with projections hinting at a significant increase. Analysts highlight that if momentum sustains, the asset could experience a rise exceeding 422%, targeting $0.00008841. Market sentiment around Shiba Inu remains strong, with traders monitoring technical signals. The meme-based asset has drawn attention amid discussions about its bullish trajectory. SHIB Price Dips; Key Levels To Watch As of 9th March, the SHIB price is trading at $0.00001254, reflecting a 0.40% decline over the past 24- hours. The price remains within a narrow range as bearish sentiment persists. Key support is holding near $0.00001, while resistance sits around $0.000015. SHIB has struggled to break past these levels, signaling weakened momentum. The MACD indicator shows a negative trend, with the MACD line hovering below the signal line. The histogram reveals growing red bars, indicating selling pressure. If the MACD line fails to cross above the signal line, downward movement may continue. The RSI stands at 33, moving closer to the oversold zone. This suggests weak buying momentum. Shiba Inu price prediction remains confined to a tight price channel, failing to establish a strong upward trend. The recent drop signals continued weakness, with buyers hesitant to step in. A breakout above $0.000015 may shift momentum toward bullish territory, while a fall below $0.00001 could extend losses. A sustained move above $0.000015 could open doors for bullish to target $0.000018 and $0.00002 resistance levels. Source: TradingView To sum up, the Shiba Inu price remains under pressure, struggling to hold key support. Analysts observe mixed signals, with traders closely watching technical indicators. The market’s next move will determine if SHIB rebounds or continues its decline.

According to Mow, Bitcoin’s value could rise to the million mark by 2031. Speaking on X, he explained that the token could quickly surge, especially now that the White House is backing it. He even cited one of the White House X posts promoting the token: “America will be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. The Golden Age of America has BEGUN!” Mow expects Bitcoin to reach $1 million by 2031 with the White House’s support In another X post, Mow insisted that Bitcoin’s uptick in performance happened faster than everyone thought it would, predicting that the same will continue in the coming years. With the White House’s current support for the token, Mow expects that Bitcoin could see an easy and fast run to $1 million. He even agreed with another X user who said his prediction of $1 million by 2031 is conservative. On Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order authorizing the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve — and a separate US stockpile of other digital assets. He has maintained that they remain focused on obtaining Bitcoin without drawing on taxpayers and even asked the US Treasury to identify budget-neutral approaches. For now, the government is counting on previously seized assets, roughly 200,000 BTC, to contribute to the reserve. The White House’s current stance is that it will not sell its BTC holdings and will establish the USA as the global Bitcoin superpower. Donald Trump told some of the leading cryptocurrency players on Friday that he is keeping his promises and will continue giving the industry what it wants. “I promised to make America the bitcoin superpower of the world and the crypto capital of the planet, and we’re taking historic action to deliver on that promise,” he said at the end of a crypto summit at the White House. Coinbase Global CEO Brian Armstrong, who was among the attendees, said, “President Trump really breathed life back into this industry,” citing a decision by his cryptocurrency exchange to hire 1,000 people in the US as a result of the increased regulatory clarity provided by the new administration Mow thinks other nations are hoarding Bitcoin in secret Still, some analysts are criticizing the Trump administration for the decision to concentrate on seized assets instead of purchasing more Bitcoin. Charles Edwards, the founder of the Capriole Fund, a hedge fund specializing in Bitcoin and other digital assets, even said that because no Bitcoin was being actively purchased, the strategic reserve was merely a “fancy title” for assets that already existed within the government’s command. One X user even queried Mow if he believes other nations are secretly purchasing Bitcoin, to which he replied , “Yes,” potentially indicating that the United States was a bit late to the Bitcoin party. Assuming that the claims made about other countries hoarding assets are factual, and with the government making no plans to initiate that kind of purchasing, the US’s transformation into a Bitcoin superpower is improbable at best. This week’s reserve announcement and crypto summit followed a period of intense turbulence in the digital asset market. Bitcoin has been experiencing its most severe correction since the 2022 meltdown. BTC dipped from above $90,000 in the hour after Thursday’s presidential action before regaining much of that ground. The leading crypto is down 4% since the order was announced and 20% from its all-time high above $109,000 on the day of Trump’s inauguration in January. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This price decline comes amidst the otherwise bullish news of Donald Trump signing an executive order for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR). The lack of bullish momentum despite this has brought into play the possibility of an extended bearish move from here. A well-known crypto analyst, Doctor Profit, has raised alarms about an impending major correction in Bitcoin’s price. In a detailed post on social media platform X, he outlined his reasons for this shift, arguing that the current market conditions signal the start of the first large Bitcoin correction of this cycle. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A Misinterpreted Narrative? Popular crypto analyst Doctor Profit revealed that he is selling a significant portion of his holdings and entering short positions. Notably, the analyst pointed to the recent news surrounding the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as a key factor that led him to reevaluate his bullish stance. He emphasized that while retail investors see this as a game-changing development, large players and whale investors have already priced in the impact. Related Reading: Legendary Analyst Peter Brandt Lists 6 Reasons Bitcoin Has Flipped Bullish Many crypto investors expected an accumulation of Bitcoin by the US government in order to strengthen the reserve. However, instead of the expected ensuing buying pressure on Bitcoin, the executive order focused on Bitcoin confiscated from previous seizures, which left bullish investors underwhelmed. According to Doctor Profit, the decision to sign off on this policy earlier than anticipated signaled a shift in market dynamics. His expectation was that this move would materialize months later, allowing Bitcoin’s price to sustain upward momentum before the first significant correction. Instead, he now sees this as the primer for a long-term decline. Is This The Beginning Of Bitcoin’s First Big Correction? Price Levels To Warch Doctor Profit firmly believes that Bitcoin has yet to experience a proper correction in this cycle, noting bull market trends where the asset has seen at least one 40-50% drop before reaching new all-time highs. He sees the recent developments as the final push before a 40% to 50% decline. As such, the analyst noted that this is the ideal window for distributing sell orders and entering short positions. Related Reading: Inverse Head And Shoulders Breakout Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Headed To $300,000 His outlook suggests a retracement to as low as $50,000–$60,000 before Bitcoin resumes its long-term bullish trajectory. Breaking down his trading strategy, he disclosed that he has already sold 50% of his Bitcoin holdings, which he accumulated at $16,000. He has placed short orders within the $90,000–$102,000 range, with target profits set at $74,000 for the first take-profit level, followed by a complete exit in the $50,000–$60,000 region and a full buyback to double holdings. Despite his short-term bearish outlook, the analyst maintains that Bitcoin will eventually rally to new highs in the $120,000–$130,000 range. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $86,530.

Here’s What’s Happening,https://timestabloid.com/240-million-xrp-abruptly-moved-heres-whats-happening/,"Whale Alert, a prominent whale tracking platform on X, recently reported major transactions totaling 240 million XRP across March 6 and 7. The largest, involving 150 million XRP worth approximately $380 million, moved between unknown wallets and occurred on March 7. This followed two substantial transfers on March 6, with a transfer of 60 million XRP ($156 million) and another transfer of 30 million XRP ($78 million). The latter originated from the recently hacked Bybit exchange. These movements have led to speculation regarding their potential impact on XRP’s market trajectory. Increased Trading Volume and Market Implications Whale transactions of this magnitude often coincide with increased market volatility and heightened investor interest. According to reports, XRP has experienced a significant surge in trading activity, with billions of tokens changing hands in a short period. A prominent crypto figure recently drew attention to $5.37 billion traded in the XRP ecosystem within 24 hours, reflecting a sharp rise in market engagement. Such movements can precede major price fluctuations, whether bullish or bearish. Uncertainty Surrounding Whale Intentions While large transfers can signal confidence from institutional investors or whales accumulating assets, they may also indicate upcoming sell-offs. The uncertainty surrounding the origin and purpose of these transfers has led to speculation about potential strategic positioning. The nature of these transactions, particularly those involving exchanges like Bybit, raises the possibility of liquidity adjustments or preparation for market-making activities. An expert partly attributed XRP’s recent downturn to similar activities, and a continuation could push the asset’s price further down. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Market Trends and Outcomes XRP is trading at $2.35, after a 5.29% drop from yesterday. A crypto expert recently drew attention to over 1 billion XRP traded within 24 hours, which coincides with market turbulence. Such movements often precede critical market events due to institutional accumulation or impending regulatory developments. The sustained high-volume activity in the XRP market suggests that traders should remain vigilant. While the implications of these transactions remain uncertain, historical patterns indicate that whale movements often precede substantial price shifts. Although the asset is struggling, the increased attention could help reverse this bearish trend and help XRP’s recovery. XRP is also in a unique position as the interests of the U.S. government and the XRP army are aligned for the first time . This could help its price rise significantly.

Here’s the Impact On Price,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-whale-activity-consistently-rising-heres-the-impact-on-price/,"Whale activity on the XRP network rose significantly over the past three weeks. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) recently highlighted this trend, emphasizing the increasing number of whale transactions exceeding $1 million. The chart Martinez shared reflects this growing interest, with spikes in whale activity corresponding to XRP’s price fluctuations. Whale activity on the $XRP network has been consistently rising over the past three weeks! pic.twitter.com/Nwljn77hhB — Ali (@ali_charts) March 7, 2025 Recent data further supports this observation. Over $5.37 billion worth of XRP was transacted in just 24 hours, a development that drew attention across the market. These transactions indicate a heightened level of interest among institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals. Whales React to XRP Market Movements Despite increased whale transactions, XRP’s price has shown volatility. As seen in Martinez’s post, there have been sharp fluctuations, with whale activity surging at key moments. The most notable surge came following Donald Trump’s announcement of the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. The asset saw a sharp increase in price and whale activity, before a swift downturn less than 24 hours after. This activity suggests massive whales took profits during the rapid increase. This may have contributed to the digital asset’s decline. However, some market experts believe the asset’s price was pushed down because of Bitcoin’s underperformance and manipulation by crypto exchanges. Implications for XRP’s Future Price Action Although it has dipped slightly, the trend of whales moving large amounts of XRP has been consistent. A few days ago, a report highlighted over 1 billion XRP transferred in a single day , further backing the ongoing activity among major holders. Whale movements are often considered an indicator of potential price shifts. Large holders accumulating XRP could signal a bullish trend, while distributions might suggest an impending correction. Martinez’s data does not confirm a clear direction but suggests that significant players in the market are making strategic moves. The surge in whale transactions on the XRP network underscores the growing interest among major investors, and the activity raises speculation about whether the whales can see a big price rally forming. XRP is trading at $2.33 after a drop of over 5% from yesterday. Although the market has not fully recovered, the sustained movement of large amounts of XRP suggests that significant market players are positioning themselves for something big.

Analyst Benjamin Cowen tells his 987,300 followers on the social media platform X that he sees Bitcoin sparking a “counter-trend” rally in the coming months. But Cowen highlights that he’s closely watching a key price level for BTC during this correction to determine whether its bull run is over. “Basically a big drop in Q1 2025, a counter-trend rally by BTC/USD in Q2/Q3 where most ALT/BTC pairs bleed, and then a drop in Q4 2025, leading to a 2026 recession. The unclear part is if there is a countertrend rally in Q2/Q3, can BTC achieve a new high? My guess is if BTC goes If BTC stays >$70,000, then a future rally could still resolve to a higher high.” A lower high would suggest that the Bitcoin bull market is over as BTC bulls fail to muster enough buying pressure to send the crypto king above its all-time high of $108,000. Meanwhile, a higher high would indicate that BTC will surge well above $108,000, keeping the bull market intact. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $86,380. Days before Bitcoin’s January 2025 top, Cowen predicted that BTC’s rally above $100,000 would hit a brick wall on Trump’s inauguration day. His prediction is based on the idea that Bitcoin’s price action will mirror the performance of the Nasdaq exchange-traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ, which hit a local top 13 months after launching. At the time, Cowen said that January 20th would mark the 13th month since the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs.

The potential move comes amid growing global interest in Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Coinbase CEO and Trump transition team advisor Brian Armstrong noted during a discussion ahead of a major summit that some Gulf countries are already considering BTC purchasing strategies. Additionally, there are indications that the Chinese government is exploring similar measures if the U.S. decides to implement a Bitcoin reserve plan.

Once a dominant hub for Bitcoin mining, China has the infrastructure to rapidly resume mining operations by leveraging its hydroelectric resources. Some experts point out that BTC mining has previously been used as a tool by countries like Iran to evade economic sanctions. This raises questions about whether countries might want to accumulate Bitcoin as a hedge against economic instability or to gain strategic advantages in the global financial arena. *This is not investment advice.

Don’t wait to buy $XRP!” This statement emphasizes the importance of long-term holding rather than attempting to time the market. Amonyx’s endorsement reflects growing optimism surrounding the asset, particularly in recent developments. Buy #XRP and wait! Don’t wait to buy $XRP ! — Amonyx (@amonbuy) March 8, 2025 SEC New Pro-crypto Stance In February 2025, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale’s application to convert its XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This move shocked the crypto world but was the start of the regulator’s shifting stance. The SEC acknowledged multiple ETF filings for different digital assets and followed these moves by dismissing its lawsuit against Coinbase . The dismissal confirmed the speculation that the SEC was taking a new approach to crypto regulation, and the regulator has dismissed multiple crypto-related lawsuits and investigations since then. These developments have led many experts to predict the dismissal of the Ripple lawsuit, which would free the digital asset up for large-scale institutional adoption and partnerships. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Trump Administration Announces Crypto Strategic Reserve In early March 2025, Donald Trump announced the establishment of a strategic crypto reserve . The reserve includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and XRP. After the announcement, the asset experienced a notable price surge, but a bearish trend in the broader market pulled it down. With XRP currently trading at a lower price, Amonyx is advising investors to accumulate and hold tokens, as buying at low prices could be a life-changing decision if XRP can match the expectations of analysts and experts. Ripple Expands Global Adoption of On-Demand Liquidity Ripple continues to expand the adoption of its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) network. ODL enables financial institutions to facilitate cross-border transactions without requiring pre-funded accounts. Ripple recently established a notable partnership with BDACS Korea , expanding its services into the South Korean market. As Ripple grows, XRP could see increased adoption as Ripple’s technology solutions become more widespread. Amonyx’s investment perspective aligns with the recent market developments supporting XRP and has reinforced the bullish expectations of many in the community. The asset seems to be on the verge of something big, and the best investment strategy is to buy XRP and wait.

However, while Dogecoin slowly gains traction, another rising star is emerging, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), priced at just $0.015 in phase 2 of its presale, is showing the kind of explosive potential that could see it reach $1 even faster. The presale funding has surpassed $2.4 million while the number of holders has risen to 4500. Investors now hold the chance to purchase MUTM tokens for $0.015 since the subsequent price increase wave will boost their value to $0.02. Investors who purchase Phase 2 will obtain 300% ROI because the launch price sets MUTM at $0.06. The project could achieve an expected price of $3 a 200x after the launch. Dogecoin’s Path to $1: Slow and Steady or Stuck in Limbo? Dogecoin, currently at $0.2 has been a fan favorite in the crypto world, driven by its strong community, celebrity endorsements, and historical price surges. While the meme coin has proven its staying power, breaking past $1 remains a challenge due to its massive supply and market volatility. Despite periodic rallies, Dogecoin often struggles to sustain long-term momentum, making its climb toward the $1 mark a slow and uncertain journey. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Revolutionizing DeFi Investment The MUTM token demand from investors keeps increasing at an accelerated pace sending investor interest toward Mutuum Finance through the roof. Phase 2 of the presale offers MUTM tokens at $0.015 and predicts they will reach $0.02 before the near-term conclusion. More than 4,500 investors already contributed $2.4 million to the market making the current moment advantageous for additional participants. The estimated launch price of $0.06 offers early investors potential gains of 300%, while analysts speculate that the token could surpass $3, with even greater long-term potential. Mutuum Finance provides a modern decentralized lending system which enables users to maintain complete authority over their possessions. Under the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model smart contracts eliminate manual lending operations to achieve optimum interest rates for peak capital utilization. Users who stake USDT can obtain financed assets through ETH and additional assets they choose to collateralize. Users in the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model obtain complete control to define loan terms together with interest rates and collateral conditions. Through its ETH-backed loans system Mutuum Finance offers secure and customizable lending solutions which increase global accessibility for decentralized lending services. Security takes precedence at Mutuum Finance because the platform subjects its smart contracts to third-party examination for reliability and integrity. The act of staking MUTM tokens allows investors to receive passive income and develop long-term ownership of tokens while maintaining capital liquidity. Mutuum Finance is planning network expansion into multiple blockchain systems to become the leading force in the decentralized finance market. Exclusive Rewards & Community Growth As part of its successful performance Mutuum Finance distributes $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens which grants ten participants with $10,000 each. The referral system boosts the community development because it gives users monetary rewards for each successful investor they refer thus fostering ecosystem expansion. Dogecoin is probably going to hit $1, but the sluggish rise makes way for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM has already raised more than $2.5 million from 4,500 investors and should hit $0.02 sooner rather than later. As it will launch at $0.06, the initial investors will realize a 300% return, and projections look at a probable increase to $3, a 200-fold rise.

Qubetics Could Be Your Next Best Performing Crypto Investment!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-solana-at-0-22-qubetics-could-be-your-next-best-performing-crypto-investment/,"Was missing out on Solana’s ICO one of the biggest regrets for crypto investors? Looking back, it certainly feels that way. Solana’s ICO took place on March 24, 2020, offering tokens at just $0.22 each. At the time, many overlooked the project, failing to recognize its potential. However, those who participated saw their investment multiply as Solana surged to all-time highs above $250 in 2021. The blockchain’s high throughput and low fees made it one of the best performing crypto assets in history. For those who missed Solana’s launch, the opportunity to invest early in another high-potential blockchain project still exists. Enter Qubetics —a blockchain that aims to solve the interoperability issues that have long plagued decentralized networks. As the crypto industry matures, seamless integration between different blockchains is becoming a necessity, and Qubetics is at the forefront of this revolution. Qubetics: The Redemption Opportunity Through Interoperability The cryptocurrency industry has always struggled with interoperability—the ability of different blockchains to communicate and share data effortlessly. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana operate independently, making cross-chain transfers complex and expensive. Qubetics introduces a Layer 1 Web3 aggregated blockchain that aims to unify these disparate networks, offering a frictionless experience for developers and users alike. Qubetics employs a unique multi-chain architecture, this approach allows seamless cross-chain interactions without requiring third-party bridges, which are often vulnerable to exploits. By removing these barriers, Qubetics enhances security, efficiency, and usability across multiple blockchains, making it an essential infrastructure for the next phase of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 applications. This focus on interoperability is a direct response to the challenges faced by earlier blockchain projects. Many DeFi users struggle with high gas fees and complex token swaps between blockchains. Qubetics simplifies this process, ensuring that assets move securely and instantly across networks. With such advancements, the project is gaining significant traction in the crypto community. The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in its 24th stage, with each $TICS token priced at $0.0976. So far, over 497 million tokens have been sold, raising more than $14.7 million, with a growing community of 22,500+ token holders. Investors are highly optimistic about Qubetics’ potential, as projected post-sale prices indicate significant growth opportunities. With an expected price of $0.25 at the end of the presale, investors could see a 156% ROI, while a rise to $1 post-presale would yield a 924% ROI. Further growth projections suggest that reaching $5 post-presale could result in a 5,018% ROI, while a surge to $10 post-mainnet launch would mean a 10,137% ROI, and a potential $15 valuation post-mainnet launch could generate an impressive 15,256% ROI. With these projections, early investors in Qubetics could witness returns comparable to those who participated in Solana’s ICO. Solana’s ICO: A Look Back at a Legendary Crypto Offering Solana’s initial coin offering (ICO) was one of the most successful early-stage blockchain fundraises. Held on March 24, 2020, the ICO raised $1.76 million by selling 8 million SOL tokens at $0.22 each—just 1.6% of its total supply. At the time, investors were skeptical, questioning whether Solana could compete with Ethereum and other established blockchains. However, Solana quickly proved its worth. Its high-speed transactions (capable of processing 65,000 TPS) and low fees (fractions of a cent per transaction) made it a preferred network for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming applications. Within two years, SOL skyrocketed to an all-time high of $259, rewarding early investors with gains exceeding 117,000%. Those who missed the ICO were left watching as Solana became one of the best performing crypto projects in recent history. Despite occasional network congestion and security concerns, Solana has remained a key player in the blockchain sector. Its continued developer activity, growing ecosystem, and institutional adoption suggest that its impact on the crypto world is far from over. Conclusion The cryptocurrency market has repeatedly shown that early-stage investments in promising blockchain projects can yield extraordinary returns. Solana’s ICO was a prime example of this, transforming a modest investment into life-changing wealth. However, opportunities in crypto are never truly gone—they simply shift to new projects solving emerging challenges. Qubetics is one such project, addressing the interoperability problem that has long hindered blockchain’s mainstream adoption. For those who regret missing out on Solana, Qubetics provides a second chance to invest early in a best performing crypto project with long-term potential. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, projects solving fundamental inefficiencies—like Qubetics—will shape the industry’s future.

It will increase Bitcoin’s legitimacy and remove fears of government retaliation. Trump, on March 6, signed an order to put into motion the formation of a Bitcoin reserve consisting of assets forfeited in civil and criminal cases. This alone would amount to around 200,000 $BTC currently valued at around $17.9B. Not a single cent of taxpayers money would be expended for this purpose. The U.S. just established a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve calling it a “digital Fort Knox for digital gold.” – Ryan Rasmussen Rasmussen believes that this could lead to a global race of accumulating Bitcoin and similar digital assets. If the US accumulates Bitcoin, other countries cannot really afford to be at ‘zero.’ Simply put, this reserve will pressurize other nations and can lead to a global domino effect. Countries like El Salvador and Abu Dhabi have already been buying $BTC left, right, and center. Here’s a table showing current $BTC holdings of various nations: Countries $BTC Held Value United States 198,109 $19,756M China 190,000 $18,947M United Kingdom 61,245 $6,107M Ukraine 46,351 $4,622M Bhutan 11,791 $1,175M Effects of a Bitcoin Reserve Besides a global race, a government-recognized Bitcoin reserve will leave wealth managers in an inexcusable state. So far, fund houses, financial institutions, and other institutional wealth managers have stayed away from these digital assets due to regulatory challenges. However, now that the US government has emerged as a strong brand ambassador, it will only encourage large institutional investing in contemporary digital assets. The reserve also removes market fears of unstable Bitcoin prices due to government regulations. Rasmussen believes that the US will go on accumulating Bitcoin over the years, which would only increase its adoption on a global level. As countries rush to hold Bitcoin, this is your chance to become a crypto investor. After all, what could be a better catalyst for the crypto markets than government support itself? If you’re looking to make the most of this upcoming bull run, here are the best cryptos to invest in right now . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy Now for Massive Gains A slew of positive policy changes means Bitcoin is poised for massive growth in the coming months and years. This is where investing in a unique meme coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) could come in extremely handy. As the first-ever crypto to offer free $BTC as rewards to token holders, BTC Bull Token is primed to be one of the next cryptos to explode . It’s worth noting that investors started flocking in to buy $BTCBULL right from day one. Its presale raised a whopping $1M in less than a week from launch. The total presale funding currently sits at $3.4M, and you can get each token for just $0.0024. The project’s positive momentum is expected to continue post launch, too. That’s because the developers have kept around 40% of the total token supply for PR and marketing purposes. This, combined with Bitcoin’s growth, will ensure the price of $BTCBULL keeps rising. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Crypto of the Best Crypto Wallet The last few months have seen an increasing number of investors step foot in the crypto market. And this influx isn’t going to stop anytime soon thanks to increasing crypto adoption worldwide. This is why privacy-first projects like Best Wallet , which offer a seamless and hassle-free way of storing and managing cryptocurrencies, are extremely noteworthy. As one of the best crypto wallets , Best Wallet provides access to over 60 cryptocurrency chains, negating the need to look anywhere else. It also comes with state-of-the-art security settings, like a self-custody ecosystem, 2FA, and insurance for your crypto. Best Wallet’s roadmap suggests it’s going to capture over 40% of the non-custodial crypto wallet industry by 2026. If you wish to ride its success story, consider investing in Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . $BEST is the native token of Best Wallet, which is why holding it comes with a few special perks. These include lower transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and the earliest access to the best crypto presales . The project has been a tremendous success, to say the least, seeing as its presale has amassed nearly $11M. 1 $BEST is currently available for only $0.024275, but hurry up because prices increase in the next few hours. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Crypto Offering Crypto Trading Calls MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a revolutionary AI crypto project considering it has the potential to forever change the way people invest in cryptocurrencies. An autonomous AI agent, $MIND talks to crypto influencers and communities online, soaks in their opinions and biases towards different tokens and the larger market, and finally uses cutting-edge hive-mind analysis to identify the best cryptos to buy . Additionally, since $MIND is self-evolving, it will eventually reach a point where it’ll be able to create its own tokens. What’s more, it would also be able to sway market sentiments in favor of the cryptos it has picked. All in all, $MIND holders will get a lot of benefits other than an appreciation in the token’s price itself. The MIND of Pepe presale is up and running, with over $7M in funding at the time of writing. You can get each token for just $0.0034816 – here’s how to buy $MIND . 4. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – High-Potential PolitiFi Meme Coin Currently on Discount Although OFFICIAL TRUMP, Donald Trump’s very own meme coin, has borne the brunt of all the recent tariff announcements, it’s still a crypto worth watching . After all, the pro-crypto president was one of the biggest reasons behind the crypto market’s resurgence. He’s also why we’re seeing different economies, including the US, churn out one crypto-friendly regulation after another. Once Trump’s tariff war subsides and the crypto market settles down, we can expect $TRUMP to regain investor interest and hype and break out of its current downward/sideways movement. Even if $TRUMP manages to climb halfway towards its all-time highs from where it is at currently, that would still be a nearly 400x gain for those who invest in it now. It’s currently trading for a low price of just $11.91 . Final Verdict – DYOR Although the above-mentioned cryptos definitely carry serious potential, they’re not without their risks. For instance, they can be highly volatile, meaning you must have the stomach to HODL. Also, you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. It’s also worth noting that your confidence in your holdings is directly proportional to the amount of data you’ve collected before buying them. That’s why we recommend you do your own research (try to be as thorough as possible) before investing.

Jones has recently backed the claim that XRP is on track to become the world’s reserve currency. In a post on X, Jones responded affirmatively to a statement suggesting XRP’s future role as the global reserve currency, saying, “Yes, yes it will.” Yes, yes it will. https://t.co/Tz6ekQcEzH — Linda P. Jones (@LindaPJones) March 8, 2025 This endorsement from a seasoned financial expert has reignited discussions about Ripple’s long-term vision for XRP. Jones’ post referenced an excerpt from a Ripple Insights article highlighting the company’s commitment to making XRP the world’s reserve digital currency. The statement emphasized Ripple’s ongoing efforts to improve the performance, stability, and quality of its open-source codebase. She highlighted a section that read, “We remain more committed than ever to the simple goal of making XRP the world’s reserve digital currency.” Ripple’s Vision for a Global Reserve Currency Ripple has long maintained a vision for XRP as a global reserve asset, and newly surfaced documents further support this agenda. Reports indicate that plans to position XRP as a central financial instrument have been in motion for years. A popular crypto influencer recently drew attention to the same statement from Ripple, showing the company’s commitment to integrating XRP into the global financial system. A key part of Ripple’s mission is to enhance cross-border payments and provide liquidity solutions for financial institutions. The company has consistently worked toward regulatory clarity and adoption among central banks and major financial entities. Experts argue that if successful, this could position XRP as a viable alternative to traditional reserve assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Can XRP Achieve Ripple’s Goal? Industry analysts continue to debate the feasibility of XRP achieving reserve currency status. Some experts assert that XRP is on track to become a global reserve asset because of its technological advantages, speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Others highlight the ongoing regulatory challenges Ripple faces, particularly in the U.S. Despite these challenges, supporters argue that Ripple’s vision remains intact. Recent developments also suggest that the company’s legal troubles will end soon. The SEC has dismissed many crypto-related lawsuits and investigations, leading many to believe it will soon dismiss the Ripple lawsuit. Additionally, an intriguing analysis by a crypto expert recently showed that the interests of the U.S. government and the XRP army are currently aligned . This could lead to the end of the lawsuit, pave the way for massive growth, and give XRP the chance to become the global reserve currency.

Speaking on the All In Podcast, Sacks was asked about a proposal from host Jason Calacanis, who suggested a 0.01% tax on all crypto transactions. If implemented, this would be applied directly in the asset being transferred, whether it was Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrency. Against Micro Tax Proposal Sacks was quick to reject the idea, arguing that taxes often start small but inevitably expand. “That’s always how taxes start. They are described as being very modest,” he said. Drawing a historical parallel, Sacks pointed out that when the U.S. introduced the income tax, it initially applied to only a small number of Americans, but it gradually evolved into a much broader system affecting the middle class. “I don’t particularly like the idea of new taxes, even if it is promised that they won’t affect people very much. That sounds burdensome to me,” he added. Crypto investors and industry advocates were also quick to criticize the proposal, especially given that the tax would apply even to wallet-to-wallet transfers made by the same person. Trump’s Overhaul Plans Gain Momentum The recent White House Crypto Summit did not include any mention of such transaction taxes, reinforcing the Trump administration’s broader stance on reducing tax burdens. Instead, Trump has signaled support for sweeping tax reforms, which could reshape how the U.S. government collects revenue. One of the most radical proposals under discussion is eliminating federal income tax altogether and replacing it with tariffs on imported goods . Trump has previously noted that the U.S. government was primarily funded through tariffs in the 19th century, a period he argues was marked by economic prosperity. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed this sentiment, proposing a complete restructuring of tax collection that would replace the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with an “External Revenue Service.” According to research from accounting automation firm Dancing Numbers, replacing income tax with tariffs could save each American taxpayer at least $134,809 over their lifetime, with potential savings reaching $325,561 if state income taxes are also repealed.

Table of Contents “The next Bitcoin” Second attempt On the run? New opportunity For eight years, the world has speculated about the fate of Ruja Ignatova: the so-called “Cryptoqueen” who vanished with billions after pitching OneCoin , a classic Ponzi scheme, leaving behind a trail of lies, lawsuits, and a mystery that refuses to die. Crypto.news spoke with those who have dug deep into her story to get their take on where she might be now. Shortly on her background as context: born in May 1980 in Bulgaria, Ruja Ignatova moved to Germany with her family at the age of ten, settling in Schramberg, Baden-Württemberg. She pursued higher education with distinction, earning a doctorate in private international law from the University of Konstanz in 2005. She even had a brief academic stint at the University of Oxford. Before rising to infamy as the “Cryptoqueen,” Ignatova worked at McKinsey & Company as a consultant. However, her business ventures soon took a questionable turn. In 2012, she and her father, Plamen Ignatov, were convicted of fraud in Germany related to the acquisition and subsequent bankruptcy of a firm. “The next Bitcoin” It may not be widely known, but OneCoin wasn’t Ignatova’s first venture into crypto. In 2013, she was involved in a multi-level marketing scam called BigCoin. Reports indicate that BigCoin was launched by John Ng and based in Hong Kong, with the project marketed using the usual MLM cryptocurrency pitch: “We’re gonna be the next Bitcoin.” It’s not clear when, but at some point, the project was joined by Ronnie Skold, Sebastian Greenwood, Nigel Allen, and Ruja Ignatova herself. Long story short, BigCoin didn’t make it, as it turned out to be an ordinary Ponzi scheme, operating without a blockchain at all. By 2014, Ignatova left BigCoin to co-found a new venture with Sebastian Greenwood, better known to the world as OneCoin. Second attempt While Ruja Ignatova was the mastermind behind the project, Sebastian Greenwood was a key figure in the operations of OneCoin. Unlike Ignatova, though, Greenwood was arrested in 2018 and sentenced to 20 years in prison. The two branded OneCoin as a revolutionary cryptocurrency poised to kill Bitcoin. Through high-profile events and persuasive marketing, they convinced thousands — if not millions — to invest, raising an estimated $4 billion globally. And still, like BigCoin, OneCoin also wasn’t operating on any blockchain, which led to the project’s crash three years after the launch.

In October 2017, she boarded a flight from Bulgaria, Greece and… disappeared. Without a trace. Over the years, theories about her fate have ranged from surgical alterations to mafia assassinations. Some reports even suggested that she was murdered on a yacht in the Ionian Sea on the orders of a Bulgarian crime figure, with her body allegedly dismembered and discarded. There’re also rumors that Ignatova might actually be on the run, hiding in South Africa, Dubai, or even in Russia . German documentary filmmaker Johan von Mirbach, who directed the 2022 investigative documentary “ The Cryptoqueen – The Great OneCoin Fraud ” doesn’t buy theories about Ignatova’s death. In an interview with crypto.news, Mirbach said he doesn’t believe in theories about her death, as there are too many “failed efforts to lay false tracks about her whereabouts.” “I have talked to security sources from South Africa and Germany. There are investigations going on about where she could hide in South Africa. But nobody can tell where she really is. She could be in South Africa, in Dubai or — as you claim — in Russia or elsewhere. I’m convinced though that she is still alive as there are so many failed efforts to lay false tracks about her whereabouts.” Johan von Mirbach In June 2022, the FBI placed Ignatova on its ten most wanted fugitives list, initially offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest. By June 2024, that bounty had grown to $5 million. While Ignatova’s whereabouts aren’t clear, legal proceedings surrounding her name continue up to these days. New opportunity For instance, in August 2024, London’s High Court issued a worldwide freeze order on assets linked to Ignatova and her associates following revelations that OneCoin promoters had invested in luxury properties in the United Arab Emirates, including a $2.7 million penthouse in Dubai. By late 2024, investigators had focused their search on Cape Town, South Africa, with speculation that she was living in an exclusive enclave under a false identity. However, new reports in November 2024 suggested that Ignatova may instead be hiding in Russia. According to journalist Yordan Tsalov, who specializes in Kremlin affairs and has worked with Bellingcat, a Netherlands-based investigative journalism group, Ignatova has ties to individuals connected to the Russian government. Tsalov says these links were confirmed by Ignatova’s former security adviser, Frank Schneider, a former Swiss intelligence officer who was hired by OneCoin and later interviewed by Tsalov for a BBC series. Commenting on the scale of the OneCoin scam, Mirbach says the crypto industry is an “incredible space” not only for new businesses but also for criminals who could gain “much more than with simple analogue frauds.” “They can just scale their scam to another level. The same mechanism that promotes and boosts online/digital business boots online fraud. Mobsters will also always go into news unexplored and unregulated markets and follow what is coming up.” Johan von Mirbach Now, Mirbach says he’s just waiting for the “first AI-driven fraud that is coming up with this new opportunity.” Read more: Chinese authorities arrest around 100 people, recover $267mfrom OneCoin pyramid scheme",Feature|Exclusive|Crypto Scam|OneCoin|Ponzi Scheme,EN,0,0,BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-09 09:00:00

Bitcoin (BTC) has been dancing around $86,000, representing a mere 0.4% decline on a daily scale . The Calm Before the Storm? The past several days have been quite turbulent for the primary cryptocurrency, whose valuation has been trading in the wide range between $78,000 and $95,000. Some developments that have potentially affected its performance were the escalating trade war launched by US President Donald Trump and the major announcement concerning establishing a strategic BTC reserve in America. On March 7, the Republican hosted a historic crypto summit at the White House, which was attended by well-known crypto executives and relevant members of his administration. During the event, Trump doubled down on his promise to establish such a reserve and assured that the US would follow a “never sell your BTC” plan. Multiple industry participants previously predicted that the gathering would trigger huge volatility for the leading digital asset. However, this was not the case , and in fact, BTC tumbled below $85,500 before rebounding to around $86,000. It is worth noting that some market observers assumed that the event could lead to a “sell the news” scenario. In addition, Trump’s executive order didn’t introduce anything new for investors and offers minimal practical benefits for BTC and the other coins included in the Digital Asset Stockpile, as the US government will not invest money to purchase them. In the following 24 hours, BTC fluctuated between $85,700 and $86,500, eventually consolidating at the current $86,000. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko We have yet to see whether the start of the business week will offer a new doze of turbulence or the price will remain relatively stable. One element that may propel enhanced volatility is the upcoming release of the US CPI data scheduled for March 12. The report is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve which takes the inflation figures into consideration to determine whether to raise, cut, or keep the interest rates unchanged. Historically, these efforts have been followed by increased volatility for BTC. Meanwhile, the asset’s market capitalization stands at around $1.7 trillion, whereas its dominance against the altcoins is the same as on March 7 – approximately 58.2%. How are the Alts Doing? There is nothing dramatic with the leading alternative coins , too . Those recording minor gains in the past 24 hours include Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Uniswap (UNI). Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Tron (TRX), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are on the opposite corner, with their prices slightly retreating for that timeframe. The biggest loser from the top 100 club is Pi Network (PI), whose valuation has tumbled by 12%. Currently, it trades at approximately $1.57, far from the all-time high of almost $3 registered at the end of February. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands at roughly $2.92 trillion, representing a 1.8% decrease for the day .

Sui Shows Mixed Signals, While ADA’s Price Dip—Buy Smartly!",https://thecoinrise.com/blockdags-400-bonus-propels-its-presale-to-201m-sui-shows-mixed-signals-while-adas-price-dip-buy-smartly/,"Is the next significant crypto opportunity right before our eyes? The current buzz around Cardano’s price dip, along with Sui’s ambiguous market signals, are guiding people towards discovering the next big layer 1 crypto. Cardano’s recent Plomin hard fork, which introduces decentralized community governance, has enhanced its appeal. However, Sui’s head-and-shoulder pattern indicates possible downward trends despite a recent 6% increase. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) is drawing attention with its presale progress and a valuable chance for early participants. The ‘BDAG800’ code provides an impressive 400% bonus on BDAG coin purchases, effectively multiplying each dollar by five. With BlockDAG set to be listed on 10 major CEXs soon, seizing this opportunity could significantly enhance your holdings. Act now or risk missing out. BlockDAG Presale: 400% Boost Available for Early Participants BlockDAG is establishing itself as a prominent layer 1 crypto network, with its presale currently in its 27th batch and having gathered over $201 million, with more than 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold. The batch price is at $0.0248, making it an attractive entry point for those eager to join before BlockDAG debuts on major CEXs soon. A key attraction is the ‘BDAG800’ code, which grants a remarkable 400% bonus on purchases. This offer isn’t just a deal—it’s an opportunity to significantly increase your BDAG holdings, positioning you for considerable potential rewards as BlockDAG heads towards its mainnet launch. The ongoing momentum of the presale marks this as a crucial time to engage, especially with the bonus offer possibly ending soon. With its emphasis on rapid transaction speeds, scalability, and security, BlockDAG is distinguishing itself as a leading layer 1 crypto contender. The blend of cutting-edge technology, strategic CEX listings, and the time-limited 400% bonus presents a compelling case for those aiming to maximize their gains before BDAG becomes broadly accessible. Cardano’s Price Drop: A Chance to Get Involved? Cardano’s recent drop to $0.63 has sparked interest, especially with ongoing advancements. The network’s Plomin hard fork has introduced decentralized community governance, a first in the industry that underlines its commitment to full decentralization. The SEC’s recent recognition of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF application also suggests potential for broader acceptance, presenting Cardano as a noteworthy option amid market fluctuations. On-chain data shows a significant uptick in confidence, with over 1.41 billion ADA acquired by major holders since November 2023. While the drop in Cardano’s price might suggest uncertainty to some, its solid fundamentals, increasing institutional attention, and strong community support could make this a good time to get involved. As competitors like Solana and Sui become more prominent, maintaining momentum is crucial for Cardano to remain a top contender in the layer 1 crypto arena. Uncertain Trends in Sui’s Market: What Lies Ahead? The outlook for Sui’s market is uncertain as it faces a significant technical pattern that could suggest a downturn. Despite this, Sui has shown resilience with a 6% increase in the past day, trading at $3.01. This recent spike, along with a nearly 20% increase in trading volume, points to potential volatility and significant price shifts soon. A critical support level at $2.77 is pivotal for Sui’s future. Falling below this could lead to increased selling, potentially pushing prices down to $2.50 or even $2.30. However, if support holds, there could be a rebound to between $3.20 and $3.50. With these mixed signals, Sui remains a key layer 1 crypto to watch closely. A Strategic Overview Cardano’s price dip could be seen as an opportunity due to its recent enhancements and SEC ETF acknowledgment, which solidify its base. On the other hand, Sui faces a complex market with potential for both decline and rebound, depending on key support levels. Amid these dynamics, BlockDAG’s crypto presale offers a standout option. For those quick to act, using the ‘BDAG800’ code in BlockDAG’s presale grants a 400% bonus on purchases, effectively multiplying every dollar by five. This makes BlockDAG a prominent player among layer 1 cryptos, especially as it approaches listings on 10 major CEXs. If maximizing your potential is the goal, this limited-time offer may be the way to go before it ends.

While Aptos works to bounce back from a sharp fall and Pepe Coin looks for steady ground, BlockDAG (BDAG) is garnering support from high-profile sources, leading its sector. Unlike other blockchain initiatives facing challenges in securing exchange spots, BlockDAG is receiving proposals from notable entities, demonstrating robust confidence in its potential. The project continues to engage in pivotal funding discussions, alongside a record-setting presale, maintaining its strong trajectory. With partnerships and funding increasingly influencing the market, BlockDAG’s growing ecosystem differentiates it from other cryptos focused on quick wins. BlockDAG Captures Major Support as Funding Discussions Progress BlockDAG is catching the eye of venture capitals and significant financial entities, marking an essential growth stage. The team has confirmed ongoing negotiations with leading financiers, with an expected announcement of a substantial VC deal within the month. This support could enhance BlockDAG’s financial health and development prospects, reinforcing its market position. Unlike many blockchain ventures struggling with listings and partnerships, BlockDAG finds itself in a favorable spot where exchanges and business allies are approaching it. This shift emphasizes increasing trust in BlockDAG’s potential and its capacity to offer genuine value. Moreover, the project’s crypto presale achievements underscore this confidence. To date, BlockDAG has accumulated $201 million, with over 18.7 billion coins sold in Batch 27 at $0.0248 each. Notably, early participants have enjoyed a 2,340% ROI since the first batch, boosting its attractiveness to a broad audience. As the ecosystem expands, securing prominent funding and exchange partnerships will be crucial for BlockDAG’s sustained success. The coming weeks could mark a pivotal phase as the project gears up for significant updates that could further elevate its demand and market presence. Pepe Coin Gears Up for Recovery as Market Stabilizes Pepe Coin (PEPE) is bouncing back from a 40% drop over the last month, now finding its footing at a key support level. This newfound stability is sparking talks of a possible rise. Technical charts show that breaking past the $0.11 resistance could pave the way to $0.21, eventually aiming for $0.41. Additionally, the end of the accumulation phase might set the stage for a notable upward move, depending heavily on the broader market trends. The future movements of giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum are crucial in determining PEPE’s path forward. Aptos Aims for Turnaround Amidst Market Challenges Despite a recent 29% fall this past month, Aptos (APT) is showing signs of recovery, now trading at $5.35, with peaks of $5.83 and dips to $5.09. It holds a market cap of $3.39 billion with a trading volume of $518.18 million over 24 hours. The weekly chart reveals a bullish engulfing pattern, suggesting strong buying activity and a potential uptick after a period of price consolidation. This trend might help Aptos challenge previous resistance levels, possibly revisiting its peak price of $20. Aptos is designed for rapid and secure blockchain dealings, positioning itself as a notable player in the smart contract space. While promising, its future relies on enhancing scalability and drawing developers to its platform. Despite optimistic signals, the market’s unpredictable nature still looms large. The Bottom Line While other projects like Aptos and Pepe Coin struggle to find their footing amidst market ups and downs, BlockDAG forges ahead with more consistency, driven by significant backing and a widening circle of support. Its draw of high-level funding and exchange collaborations signals a trust level rare in more speculative ventures. BlockDAG stands out with strategic development and ongoing growth, underpinning its prospects for sustained impact. With major updates on the horizon, its path is one to keep an eye on in a field swayed by both cyclical market forces and the confidence of backers.

XRP’s short-term outlook is murky, with numbers indicating heavyweights raking in millions in profit even as sentiment turns bullish on a possible U.S. crypto reserve. Meanwhile, Remittix has been making headlines by burning through its presale and offering a revolutionary solution to cross-border payments. Here, we unpack XRP’s wild price action and discover why Remittix could be the hedge investors require in a capricious market. XRP: Gains Despite Profit-Taking XRP gained on Thursday, despite profit-taking of almost $2 billion this week. Many of these sellings were from coins that had been stationary for 90–180 days, which shows that medium-term holders are selling during the token’s rally. Whales holding 10–100 million XRP have dumped 260 million tokens in the last 24 hours, which shows the extent of recent distribution. In spite of the selling, XRP eked out a 4% gain on Thursday despite still-positive sentiment surrounding XRP is possible inclusion in a purported U.S. strategic crypto reserve. Some have speculated that such a development would mark the end to Ripple’s years-long legal battle with the SEC, opening the door to possible XRP ETF approvals from large asset managers such as Bitwise, Grayscale and 21 Shares. XRP/USDT Daily Chart Technically, XRP finds it hard to maintain its upward momentum. The token busted above the higher line of a descending channel, with its target being resistance around $2.72 further supported by the 50-day Simple Moving Average. Liquidations in futures totaled over $13 million during the last day, split between $7.50 million of longs and $5.83 million of shorts. Assuming XRP manages to hold support in the channel, some experts feel that it could be targeting the $2.95 zone. Otherwise, the risk of sub-$1 levels looms if whales continue to dump their bags. Remittix: The Cross-Border Payment Platform Making Waves As XRP fends off profit-takers, Remittix (RTX) has been making waves as it targets a $190 trillion remittance market bogged down by wires and fees. Its presale has broken records, amassing $13.7 million via the sale of more than 516 million tokens. Its initial investors who bought RTX at $0.0734 have reportedly garnered 1000%-plus returns in spite of a general market downturn. Remittix’s platform is built on frictionless crypto-to-fiat exchange enabling users to pay any bank account in the world in hours, not days. The platform already supports more than 40 cryptocurrencies and is gaining traction with freelancers, migrant workers and businesses looking for cheaper alternatives to mainstream finance. Remittix leverages local payment networks and blockchain to lower remittance fees and settlement times. Openness and security are the cornerstones of the system’s credibility. Every transaction is recorded in an open ledger to restrict fraud and manipulation. Moreover, Remittix’s pay API also enables merchants to receive different digital assets with fiat settlement, increasing its user base. Analysts speculate continued presale momentum can propel Remittix another 200% this month, further solidifying its position as one of DeFi’s most promising players for high returns. Where Is the Market Headed Next? XRP’s near-term future would depend on managing whale-driven profit-taking and optimism uptick around the potential U.S. crypto reserve. Definitive resolution of Ripple’s legal woes could reignite institutional and retail interest, with some participants targeting a zone around $2.95 in the event of channel support. Caution must still be taken, however, as failure beneath key support levels would push the token beneath $1, particularly if whales persist in selling. Amid this environment of ambivalent sentiment, Remittix is differentiated in providing concrete utility: quick, cheap cross-border transactions that legacy institutions cannot compete with. The strength of its presale figures underscores the extent to which investors are hungry for more than speculation. By having locked liquidity and a long-term intent to renounce contract ownership, Remittix demonstrates a commitment to longevity qualities that are increasingly valued in a market characterized by rapid changes in narrative.

After investing early, he watched Solana skyrocket to $295 and Cardano surge to $3.10, securing enough profits to quit his job for good. His story is proof that the right crypto investments can be truly life-changing. Now, in 2025, he’s back with another bold prediction, revealing that Mutuum Finance is what he’s betting on next. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has drawn considerable attention from investors as its presale continues to see active growth resulting in $2.5 million fund raises and attaining more than 4600 positions. Phase 2 of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tokens at $0.015 price yet investors continue to purchase due to upcoming token price appreciation expectations. A majority of more than 75 percent in this phase sold out to investors. The initial token participants can obtain as much as 300% profit while the estimated launch value starts at $0.06 and may rise further when the tokens appear on major exchanges. Solana & Cardano: life-changing gains for early investors Both Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) have demonstrated how early cryptocurrency investments enable life-changing profits to their holders. The platform Solana has experienced a remarkable increase to $295 while rewarding earlier participants who invested in the project. Beginning in 2012, Cardano reached $3.10 because of its research-based design and scalability features while securing significant profit for long-term investors. The original underdog status of these cryptocurrency projects transformed into market leader status while enabling life-enhancing changes for investors. An ex-teacher who garnered profits from SOL and ADA investments in 2025 chose to place his bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) while its price remained at $0.015. Mutuum Finance The second phase of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has brought more than 4,600 participating wallets that have contributed $2.5 million to the project. The increasing demand will increase token value until its launch at $0.06, while providing early investors with double return profits. Analysts believe MUTM will reach $1 after its presale period ends, which would place it as one of the leading DeFi investment opportunities before major exchange listing events take place. Mutuum Finance executes long-term expansion through prediction-enabled smart contracts that enhance decentralized lending operations speed. Users can generate passive income through staking functions on this platform, above which they will experience straightforward inter-blockchain network transactions. Stablecoins with full collateral backing and a USD peg function as a basis for secure and stable operations in the DeFi framework. Mutuum Finance promotes community expansion while delivering innovative benefits to its members. As part of its growth celebration, Mutuum Finance is distributing $100,000 through a contest that’s awarding $10,000 to each of its ten winners. The platform extends its community growth through a referral program that compensates users based on the investors they introduce. The dual lending system Mutuum Finance transforms decentralized lending by operating under dual functionality which merges Peer-to-Contract (P2C) with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending capabilities. Smart contracts in the P2C model run automated lending pools which lead to peak capital efficiency. Users who adopt the P2P model can create clear loan contracts without involving any middlemen in their negotiations. Mutuum Finance links P2C and P2P lending models to create a top-performing decentralized lending platform that provides better financial returns and easy access and enhanced security. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become popular in the market by attracting 4,600 early investors who used $2.5 million to purchase tokens priced at $0.015. Early token purchasers can expect a 300% profit by investing at $0.015 because the value will rise to $0.06 until launch. The market predicts additional growth that will follow major exchange listings. The available opening will quickly vanish. The opportunity calls for immediate purchase before pricing becomes too high. Reach Phase 2 position before the upcoming price elevation occurs.

Since March 1, the Central American nation has added 13 BTC to its treasury, bringing its total holdings to over 6,105 BTC, valued at more than $527 million at current market prices. Daily Bitcoin Purchases Persist While El Salvador has maintained a steady pace of purchasing 1 BTC per day, on March 3, the government accelerated its accumulation, buying 5 BTC in a single day—a move that signals its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, even in the face of external pressures. The IMF has been vocal about its concerns regarding El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy, particularly after the country secured a $1.4 billion loan deal in December 2024. As part of the agreement, the Salvadoran government had repealed its Bitcoin legal tender law in January 2025, seemingly scaling back its official involvement with BTC. However, despite this legislative change, El Salvador never actually stopped buying Bitcoin—demonstrating a clear divide between policy adjustments and real-world action. El Salvador Stands Firm Against IMF Criticism The IMF recently renewed its demands on March 3, urging El Salvador to cease Bitcoin purchases and explicitly barring the country from issuing debt or tokenized securities linked to BTC. But President Nayib Bukele wasted no time in dismissing the request, labeling it as nothing more than “whining.” “If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future,” Bukele boldly stated in response to the IMF’s renewed push. His defiant stance underscores El Salvador’s long-term vision for Bitcoin adoption —one that appears immune to global financial institutions’ criticisms. Bukele’s Bitcoin-first approach has already started attracting major crypto firms to El Salvador. Earlier this year, Bitfinex Derivatives announced its relocation from Seychelles to El Salvador on January 7. Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, followed suit, announcing on January 13 that it would move its headquarters to the country.

XRP briefly broke above the red trendline to reach a local high around $3. However, the bullish momentum quickly faded, leading to a sharp sell-off. With this rejection, analysts are now questioning whether the recovery phase is over or if another correction is imminent. Price action is pointing to a potential (A)-(B)-(C) correction pattern, which signals a decision point for XRP’s next trend. According to the analyst firm, a sustainable break above $3.06 is crucial for a continued bullish structure. MakroVision has identified the critical price levels as follows: $2.19 – $2.23: XRP must maintain this range to maintain bullish momentum. $2.03: A retest of this level would lean towards a bearish scenario. $1.40 – $1.55: If the corrective structure continues and XRP breaks below $2, the next golden pocket support area could be tested. $2.65: A recovery above this resistance level is needed to regain bullish momentum. XRP technical analysis chart shared by MakroVision. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $2.32.

Meanwhile, a coin that focuses on innovative real-world assets is predicted to rocket by 14,786%; this coin is Rexas Finance (RXS). SHIB's $0.0001 Dream: Can It Recover, or Is the Hype Fading? In 2021, Shiba Inu established itself as the leading symbol of the meme coin revolution. Its present condition demonstrates an industry-wide pattern of market instability. Experts predict SHIB needs a substantial amount of time to eliminate a zero from its price before reaching $0.0001. Investors remain uncertain about the future direction of this popular meme coin because the token has failed to recover its previous peak value. The public opinion about SHIB remains divided. Some investors predict that SHIB could experience a bull market in the future because of increased market participation and general market gains. Multiple experts agree that achieving substantial price growth for SHIB will require a prolonged and unpredictable journey. RXS Nears 90% Presale Completion! 14,786% Growth Potential Sets It Apart from Shiba Inu! Rexas Finance (RXS) is a token that has shown unprecedented growth in market momentum during this recent period. The RXS presale attracted overwhelming excitement, leading to successful fundraising of $46 million, reaching 90.23% of its target, and selling more than 451 million tokens. The upcoming presale stage has investors intensely observing RXS's price movement since the token is all set for its official launch at $0.25 listing date on June 19, 2025. The investment community has shown strong interest in RXS because it focuses on real-world assets (RWA) as its core strategy. The innovative token design improves its functionality while creating a new standard for investment participation. The increasing popularity of RXS has analysts predicting a 14,786% potential rise in value, while projections indicate massive market growth for the coin. The upcoming market launch of Rexas Finance has created widespread enthusiasm about the RXS token. RXS stands apart from Shiba Inu because it maintains strong market momentum despite Shiba Inu struggling to sustain its previous price peaks. The successful presale demonstrates that investors seek projects that solve practical problems. Worldwide investor interest has emerged because RXS is seen as one of the most promising investment opportunities. The RXS presale has achieved remarkable success since it surpassed the 85% completion mark. The token's presence on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, alongside its Certik audit, demonstrates its dedication to security and transparency, which are essential factors for building investor trust. The high demand from potential buyers who want to purchase tokens before the market launch creates massive opportunities for price growth. Conclusion In conclusion, While SHIB wrestles with maintaining its position, RXS emerges as a beacon of potential, with top analysts predicting a 14,786% rally and set to achieve this early. Those who missed the astronomical rise of SHIB in 2021 can hedge on RXS. With the presale window closing fast, savvy investors have a limited time and should act fast.
