Here’s what the trend in an indicator suggests about what could be behind this downturn. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Gone Cold As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has returned to neutral levels recently. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This metric essentially tells us about how the buying or selling behaviours differ between the user bases of the two cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase’s main traffic is made up of American investors, especially large institutional entities, while Binance serves investors around the world. When the Coinbase Premium Gap has a positive value, it means the US-based whales are participating in a higher amount of buying or a lower amount of selling than the Binance users, which is why the asset is more expensive on Coinbase. Similarly, it being negative implies a net higher buying pressure on Binance. Related Reading: Chainlink May Reach New ATH If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Says Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past couple of days: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been at notable positive levels earlier, but during the past day, its value has declined to the neutral zero mark. According to Maartunn, the source of the positive premium was Microstrategy’s latest buying spree. Indeed, the cooldown in the indicator matches up with the timing of the completion of the $5.4 billion purchase by Michael Saylor’s firm. The significant accumulation from the company had helped the cryptocurrency maintain its recent highs, but with the buying pressure depleted, Bitcoin has retraced to price levels under $93,000. BTC and the Coinbase Premium Gap have held a close relationship throughout 2024, so the metric could be to keep an eye on in the near future, as where it goes next may once again foreshadow the asset’s next destination. Naturally, a decline into the negative region could spell further bearish action for its price. In some other news, the Bitcoin Active Addresses indicator has observed a sharp jump recently, as Maartunn has shared in another X post. This metric keeps track of the daily number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart shared by the CryptoQuant analyst for the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Active Addresses: With this latest surge, the 14-day SMA of the Bitcoin Active Addresses has reached its highest point in eleven months. This suggests that a lot of activity has recently occurred on the network. Given that the asset has gone down in the past day, though, the most recent user interest has certainly not come for buying. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $92,400, down almost 6% over the last 24 hours.

This move aligns with a growing trend of corporations worldwide embracing Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Rumble Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Stock Rises The YouTube competitor is the latest company to join the Bitcoin bandwagon, as its Board of Directors approved a corporate treasury diversification strategy that allocates a portion of its excess cash reserves to BTC. Related Reading: Samara Asset Group Eyes $32.8 Million Bond Issuance To Increase Bitcoin Holdings As part of this strategy, Rumble plans to purchase up to $20 million worth of BTC. The company described Bitcoin as a “valuable tool for strategic planning.” Rumble CEO and Chairman Chris Pavlovski explained: We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly US presidential administration and increased institutional adoption. Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. The company stated that its management would evaluate factors such as market conditions, Bitcoin’s trading price, and Rumble’s cash flow needs to determine the timing and amount of BTC purchases. However, it emphasized that the strategy could be modified, paused, or discontinued. Interestingly, the announcement followed a poll conducted by Pavlovski on X, where he asked users whether Rumble should add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Over 93% of the 43,790 respondents voted in favor of the proposal. Rumble’s stock price surged after the announcement, reflecting investor confidence. The tech company’s shares closed at $7.31, marking a 12.63% increase in a single day. BTC as a Corporate Asset: A Winning Strategy? Rumble’s decision to add BTC to its balance sheet mirrors the approach of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a pioneer in Bitcoin treasury management. Yesterday, the Michael Saylor-led firm revealed that it had acquired an additional 55,000 BTC, bringing its holdings to $5.4 billion. Related Reading: Metaplanet’s Total Bitcoin Holdings Exceed 1,000 BTC Following Latest Purchase MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin play has worked tremendously for the company’s stock performance. In the past year alone, MSTR price has increased by more than 670%, outperforming both BTC and the S&P 500 regarding returns on investment. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet recently crossed the 1,000 BTC milestone as it continues to bolster its Bitcoin holdings with frequent purchases. Additionally, speculation about major tech giants like Dell and Microsoft entering the Bitcoin market could fuel demand and drive the asset’s price to new highs. A recent analysis by crypto experts shows that BTC may hit the highly-anticipated six-figure price target early next year. BTC trades at $92,071 at press time, down 5.5% in the past 24 hours.

The first major support sits near the $3,250 zone. A clear move below the $3,250 support might push the price toward $3,150. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

The price must clear the $1.4550 resistance zone to start a fresh increase in the near term. XRP price is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $1.50 level. The price is now trading below $1.450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.4550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might gain traction if it clears the $1.4550 resistance. XRP Price Stuck Below $1.50 XRP price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1.50 level. It dipped again and even spiked below the $1.30 level. A low was formed at $1.2828 and the price is now recovering losses unlike Bitcoin and like Ethereum. There was a move above the $1.3250 and $1.340 resistance levels. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.5389 swing high to the $1.2828 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $1.420 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $1.45 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.420 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.450 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.5389 swing high to the $1.2828 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.4550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $1.50. A clear move above the $1.50 resistance might send the price toward the $1.550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.600 resistance or even $1.620 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.650 or $1.6550. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $1.4550 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.3200 level. The next major support is near the $1.30 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.30 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.2800 support. The next major support sits near the $1.2650 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

DOGE could restart increase if it clears the $0.400 resistance. DOGE price started a downside correction below the $0.420 level. The price is trading below the $0.400 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3920 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.400 and $0.4100 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Fresh Increase Dogecoin price started a downside correction below $0.450 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE traded below the $0.420 and $0.400 support levels. A low was formed at $0.3646 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.380 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4808 swing high to the $0.3646 low. However, the bears seem to be active below the $0.40 level. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.40 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.3920 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3920 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.400 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.4220 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4808 swing high to the $0.3646 low. A close above the $0.4220 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4520 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.4800 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.500. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.400 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3780 level. The next major support is near the $0.3650 level. The main support sits at $0.3500. If there is a downside break below the $0.3500 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.3200 level or even $0.300 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now near the 50 level.

Polkadot Sees Strong Developer Engagement One of the notable findings from the report is the developer activity on Polkadot. According to Electric Capital, the network had approximately 2,400 monthly active developers in July 2024, with 760 classified as full-time contributors. This positioned Polkadot fourth among leading blockchain networks, trailing only Ethereum, Base, and Polygon. Furthermore, Artemis tracked an average of 630 weekly active core developers and 760 ecosystem developers during Q3, underscoring a vibrant development community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained Polkadot also made significant strides in Q3 2024 with several key initiatives aimed at enhancing its ecosystem. The Decentralized Futures program, backed by a substantial $20 million fund and 5 million DOT tokens, has been pivotal in driving innovation. This initiative provided grants to various projects focusing on marketing, business development, governance, and technology. Notable projects supported include AirLyft, DotPlay, and BlockDeep Labs. Another critical development is the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM), a standardized messaging protocol that facilitates communication between different consensus-driven systems, including rollups. Daily XCM transfers averaged around 1,000, representing a 34% decline quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). In contrast, non-asset transfer use cases, referred to as “XCM Other,” experienced a 5% increase, averaging 200 daily transfers. Overall, total daily XCM messages averaged 1,300, reflecting a 29% drop QoQ. Despite these fluctuations, a significant portion of activity on the Polkadot network continues to occur through Polkadot rollups. DOT Market Cap Plummets 27% In Q3 In terms of market performance, DOT has experienced notable volatility through the year. From Q3 2023 to Q1 2024, DOT’s market capitalization soared by 150%, rising from $5 billion to $13 billion. However, in the subsequent quarters, including Q2 and Q3 2024, DOT retraced alongside the broader market, ending Q3 2024 with a market cap of $6.3 billion—a 27% decline QoQ. This drop also saw DOT’s market cap ranking fall from 14th to 15th, even as it remains the seventh largest base layer network. Transaction fees on the Polkadot chain have generally remained lower compared to competitors, attributed to the network’s structural design. In Q3 2024, transaction fees aligned with historical averages, totaling $84,000—a 44% decrease QoQ. Fees denominated in DOT also declined by 21% to 17,000. Related Reading: Institutions Just ‘Waiting To Buy Up’ Bitcoin, Says MARA CEO The Polkadot Treasury on the other hand, saw continued active usage, with 9.5 million DOT allocated for proposals, 7.4 million for bounties, and 2.5 million burned. A significant development was the approval of Polkadot Referendum 457 in Q2 2024, which diversified the treasury with USDT and USDC, enabling treasury proposals to be denominated in stablecoins. By the end of Q3 2024, the treasury balance stood at $122 million. Daily active addresses dropped to 6,200 (-26% QoQ), daily returning addresses decreased to 5,300 (-23% QoQ), and daily new addresses fell to 900 (-38% QoQ). In terms of immediate price action, the DOT price has traded at the $8 level for the past four days, and has since consolidated above it. The token has been one of the best performers since Donald Trump’s election on November 5, posting a substantial 96% gain in the monthly time frame.
