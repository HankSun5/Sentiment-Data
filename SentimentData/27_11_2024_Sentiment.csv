Here’s what the trend in an indicator suggests about what could be behind this downturn. Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Gone Cold As pointed out by CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn in a new post on X, the Coinbase Premium Gap has returned to neutral levels recently. The “Coinbase Premium Gap” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). This metric essentially tells us about how the buying or selling behaviours differ between the user bases of the two cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase’s main traffic is made up of American investors, especially large institutional entities, while Binance serves investors around the world. When the Coinbase Premium Gap has a positive value, it means the US-based whales are participating in a higher amount of buying or a lower amount of selling than the Binance users, which is why the asset is more expensive on Coinbase. Similarly, it being negative implies a net higher buying pressure on Binance. Related Reading: Chainlink May Reach New ATH If This Barrier Breaks, Analyst Says Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past couple of days: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been at notable positive levels earlier, but during the past day, its value has declined to the neutral zero mark. According to Maartunn, the source of the positive premium was Microstrategy’s latest buying spree. Indeed, the cooldown in the indicator matches up with the timing of the completion of the $5.4 billion purchase by Michael Saylor’s firm. The significant accumulation from the company had helped the cryptocurrency maintain its recent highs, but with the buying pressure depleted, Bitcoin has retraced to price levels under $93,000. BTC and the Coinbase Premium Gap have held a close relationship throughout 2024, so the metric could be to keep an eye on in the near future, as where it goes next may once again foreshadow the asset’s next destination. Naturally, a decline into the negative region could spell further bearish action for its price. In some other news, the Bitcoin Active Addresses indicator has observed a sharp jump recently, as Maartunn has shared in another X post. This metric keeps track of the daily number of addresses that are participating in some kind of transaction activity on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Smash $100,000? Rapid Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Continue Below is the chart shared by the CryptoQuant analyst for the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Active Addresses: With this latest surge, the 14-day SMA of the Bitcoin Active Addresses has reached its highest point in eleven months. This suggests that a lot of activity has recently occurred on the network. Given that the asset has gone down in the past day, though, the most recent user interest has certainly not come for buying. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $92,400, down almost 6% over the last 24 hours.

This move aligns with a growing trend of corporations worldwide embracing Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Rumble Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, Stock Rises The YouTube competitor is the latest company to join the Bitcoin bandwagon, as its Board of Directors approved a corporate treasury diversification strategy that allocates a portion of its excess cash reserves to BTC. Related Reading: Samara Asset Group Eyes $32.8 Million Bond Issuance To Increase Bitcoin Holdings As part of this strategy, Rumble plans to purchase up to $20 million worth of BTC. The company described Bitcoin as a “valuable tool for strategic planning.” Rumble CEO and Chairman Chris Pavlovski explained: We believe that the world is still in the early stages of the adoption of Bitcoin, which has recently accelerated with the election of a crypto-friendly US presidential administration and increased institutional adoption. Unlike any government-issued currency, Bitcoin is not subject to dilution through endless money-printing, enabling it to be a valuable inflation hedge and an excellent addition to our treasury. The company stated that its management would evaluate factors such as market conditions, Bitcoin’s trading price, and Rumble’s cash flow needs to determine the timing and amount of BTC purchases. However, it emphasized that the strategy could be modified, paused, or discontinued. Interestingly, the announcement followed a poll conducted by Pavlovski on X, where he asked users whether Rumble should add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Over 93% of the 43,790 respondents voted in favor of the proposal. Rumble’s stock price surged after the announcement, reflecting investor confidence. The tech company’s shares closed at $7.31, marking a 12.63% increase in a single day. BTC as a Corporate Asset: A Winning Strategy? Rumble’s decision to add BTC to its balance sheet mirrors the approach of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a pioneer in Bitcoin treasury management. Yesterday, the Michael Saylor-led firm revealed that it had acquired an additional 55,000 BTC, bringing its holdings to $5.4 billion. Related Reading: Metaplanet’s Total Bitcoin Holdings Exceed 1,000 BTC Following Latest Purchase MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin play has worked tremendously for the company’s stock performance. In the past year alone, MSTR price has increased by more than 670%, outperforming both BTC and the S&P 500 regarding returns on investment. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet recently crossed the 1,000 BTC milestone as it continues to bolster its Bitcoin holdings with frequent purchases. Additionally, speculation about major tech giants like Dell and Microsoft entering the Bitcoin market could fuel demand and drive the asset’s price to new highs. A recent analysis by crypto experts shows that BTC may hit the highly-anticipated six-figure price target early next year. BTC trades at $92,071 at press time, down 5.5% in the past 24 hours.

The first major support sits near the $3,250 zone. A clear move below the $3,250 support might push the price toward $3,150. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,000. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

The price must clear the $1.4550 resistance zone to start a fresh increase in the near term. XRP price is struggling to gain pace for a move above the $1.50 level. The price is now trading below $1.450 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.4550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might gain traction if it clears the $1.4550 resistance. XRP Price Stuck Below $1.50 XRP price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $1.50 level. It dipped again and even spiked below the $1.30 level. A low was formed at $1.2828 and the price is now recovering losses unlike Bitcoin and like Ethereum. There was a move above the $1.3250 and $1.340 resistance levels. The price tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.5389 swing high to the $1.2828 low. However, the bears seem to be active near the $1.420 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $1.45 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.420 level. The first major resistance is near the $1.450 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.5389 swing high to the $1.2828 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.4550 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $1.50. A clear move above the $1.50 resistance might send the price toward the $1.550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $1.600 resistance or even $1.620 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $1.650 or $1.6550. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $1.4550 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $1.3200 level. The next major support is near the $1.30 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $1.30 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $1.2800 support. The next major support sits near the $1.2650 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

DOGE could restart increase if it clears the $0.400 resistance. DOGE price started a downside correction below the $0.420 level. The price is trading below the $0.400 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3920 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.400 and $0.4100 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Fresh Increase Dogecoin price started a downside correction below $0.450 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE traded below the $0.420 and $0.400 support levels. A low was formed at $0.3646 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.380 level. The price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4808 swing high to the $0.3646 low. However, the bears seem to be active below the $0.40 level. Dogecoin price is now trading above the $0.40 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.3920 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.3920 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.400 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.4220 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4808 swing high to the $0.3646 low. A close above the $0.4220 resistance might send the price toward the $0.4520 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.4800 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.500. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.400 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3780 level. The next major support is near the $0.3650 level. The main support sits at $0.3500. If there is a downside break below the $0.3500 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.3200 level or even $0.300 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now near the 50 level.

Polkadot Sees Strong Developer Engagement One of the notable findings from the report is the developer activity on Polkadot. According to Electric Capital, the network had approximately 2,400 monthly active developers in July 2024, with 760 classified as full-time contributors. This positioned Polkadot fourth among leading blockchain networks, trailing only Ethereum, Base, and Polygon. Furthermore, Artemis tracked an average of 630 weekly active core developers and 760 ecosystem developers during Q3, underscoring a vibrant development community. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained Polkadot also made significant strides in Q3 2024 with several key initiatives aimed at enhancing its ecosystem. The Decentralized Futures program, backed by a substantial $20 million fund and 5 million DOT tokens, has been pivotal in driving innovation. This initiative provided grants to various projects focusing on marketing, business development, governance, and technology. Notable projects supported include AirLyft, DotPlay, and BlockDeep Labs. Another critical development is the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM), a standardized messaging protocol that facilitates communication between different consensus-driven systems, including rollups. Daily XCM transfers averaged around 1,000, representing a 34% decline quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). In contrast, non-asset transfer use cases, referred to as “XCM Other,” experienced a 5% increase, averaging 200 daily transfers. Overall, total daily XCM messages averaged 1,300, reflecting a 29% drop QoQ. Despite these fluctuations, a significant portion of activity on the Polkadot network continues to occur through Polkadot rollups. DOT Market Cap Plummets 27% In Q3 In terms of market performance, DOT has experienced notable volatility through the year. From Q3 2023 to Q1 2024, DOT’s market capitalization soared by 150%, rising from $5 billion to $13 billion. However, in the subsequent quarters, including Q2 and Q3 2024, DOT retraced alongside the broader market, ending Q3 2024 with a market cap of $6.3 billion—a 27% decline QoQ. This drop also saw DOT’s market cap ranking fall from 14th to 15th, even as it remains the seventh largest base layer network. Transaction fees on the Polkadot chain have generally remained lower compared to competitors, attributed to the network’s structural design. In Q3 2024, transaction fees aligned with historical averages, totaling $84,000—a 44% decrease QoQ. Fees denominated in DOT also declined by 21% to 17,000. Related Reading: Institutions Just ‘Waiting To Buy Up’ Bitcoin, Says MARA CEO The Polkadot Treasury on the other hand, saw continued active usage, with 9.5 million DOT allocated for proposals, 7.4 million for bounties, and 2.5 million burned. A significant development was the approval of Polkadot Referendum 457 in Q2 2024, which diversified the treasury with USDT and USDC, enabling treasury proposals to be denominated in stablecoins. By the end of Q3 2024, the treasury balance stood at $122 million. Daily active addresses dropped to 6,200 (-26% QoQ), daily returning addresses decreased to 5,300 (-23% QoQ), and daily new addresses fell to 900 (-38% QoQ). In terms of immediate price action, the DOT price has traded at the $8 level for the past four days, and has since consolidated above it. The token has been one of the best performers since Donald Trump’s election on November 5, posting a substantial 96% gain in the monthly time frame.

In a recent interview, he suggested that the current market challenges could be temporary and that the rally might not be over. Bullish Future For Bitcoin Amid Regulatory Shifts Reflecting on Pantera Capital’s journey since launching its Bitcoin fund 11 years ago, Morehead acknowledged the skepticism they faced in 2013. “People totally thought we were crazy in 2013,” he stated, emphasizing the persistent negativity surrounding Bitcoin. The executive views this prevailing pessimism as a positive sign, reinforcing his bullish stance. “So many people are still negative. It’s far from being a bubble,” Morehead told Bloomberg. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Alert: Expert Warns Of Upcoming 25% Drop, Timing And Trends Explained Pantera’s Bitcoin fund has yielded a substantial lifetime return of 132,118% since its inception in July 2013, when Bitcoin was valued at just $74. Morehead predicts that Bitcoin could eventually reach $740,000, attributing this potential growth to a changing regulatory landscape. Morehead highlighted the shift from “15-year regulatory headwinds to tailwinds,” particularly citing the more crypto-friendly policies expected from the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The original Bitcoin fund launched by Pantera is notable for being the first to provide US investors with direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. Having recently traded around $91,000 after nearing $100,000 last week, the Bitcoin price has surged approximately 120% this year. Advocating For Crypto Reserves Morehead also discussed Pantera’s new venture fund, Pantera Fund V, which aims to raise $1 billion to invest in various blockchain assets, including private tokens and “special opportunities” such as locked Solana (SOL) tokens from the FTX estate. “Fortunately, we raised the big fund right before the industry-wide blowups in 2022,” Morehead remarked, noting that this timing has allowed them to deploy capital effectively over the last few years. The company’s founder pointed out that many “generalist firms” have exited the cryptocurrency space, leaving fewer competitors in the market. This environment has reportedly enabled Pantera Capital to secure “better pricing and more advantageous deals.” Related Reading: BNB Price Sets Up for a Comeback: Bulls Eye Higher Levels Morehead, who has a background as a trader at Goldman Sachs, also commented on Trump’s proposal for a US Bitcoin stockpile. He described the idea as “rational,” arguing that holding gold as a reserve is an “outdated method” of storing wealth. “If they put some of that money in Bitcoin, that is a fantastic way to have a reserve currency holding,” he concluded. At the time of writing, the leading crypto has regained the $93,000 level, while recording a 1.5% decline in the 24-hour timeframe.

SHIB has managed to captivate the interest of both investors and crypto enthusiasts, as it is currently dealing at $0.00002566. The technical signals of the memecoin show notable preparation for a big rally, which has generated expectation for notable increases in the next weeks. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $500 Million Liquidated As Bitcoin Slides To $92K – Report Positive indicators Surface For Shiba Inu With reference to Shiba Inu on X, crypto expert Javon Marks expressed hope, noting that the value of SHIB might skyrocket. From what he saw, SHIB has already grown by 162% in the past few months, and this growth is likely to continue. One of the main things that supports this statement is the Hidden Bullish Divergence, a technical pattern that shows that price movement is about to happen. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) looks to be in some of its best positions in years, holding well broken out and up over 162% since, while also showing majorly positive responses to a recent Hidden Bullish Divergence! This divergence can suggest an over 75% move above the 2024 Highs but that… https://t.co/pKDT2dWaUn pic.twitter.com/0L7gwCcSAf — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) November 26, 2024 The trend basically shows that while the price of SHIB has been producing lower lows, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been making higher lows even during a consolidation phase. This points to a mounting optimistic pressure. Price Fluctuations And Short-Term Growth In the near term, SHIB has experienced significant price swings. In the last week, its price has gone up by 3.35%, and in the last month, it rose to around 54%. These increases show that the “joke coin” is picking up a lot of steam. However, the trip is not completely uneventful. Despite the favorable short-term development, the price of SHIB has dropped by 4.08% over the last six months, suggesting considerable volatility. Analysts warn that short-term profit-taking after recent advances could obstruct the memecoin’s price movement as it evolves. However, SHIB has a great possibility to grow further with the strong support of its growing ecosystem projects and community. Related Reading: Ethereum Momentum Builds: 10% Surge Sparks ATH Hopes Important Price Levels To Monitor Key price levels have a big effect on future movements for people who are keeping SHIB or thinking about getting in. Expert research says that the level of $0.000081 is the first important resistance point. If this level is broken, the price could go up by 215%. Also, SHIB is trading 3.20% below what it is expected to be worth in a month, which suggests that prices could go up in the short run. The next goal could be $0.00000900 if SHIB breaks through support at $0.00000850. The coin is expected to experience a 102% increase in the next six months for long-term investors, followed by a 92% increase in the following year, data from CoinCheckup shows. Technical clues indicate a possible breakout and robust long-term forecasts, thus Shiba Inu might be ready for a new phase of development.

The fund's high 2.5% expense ratio and lack of staking for certain assets present long-term investment concerns despite recent gains. My 'fair value' framework now shows a 10% adjusted discount, making the trade less compelling than before, though still viable. Downgrading GDLC to 'hold' due to reduced NAV discount and high market greed sentiment, but will reassess when conditions improve. It has been slightly over two months since I last wrote about the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund ( GDLC ) for Seeking Alpha. In September, I called GDLC ""crypto's deep value play"" and reiterated a 'buy' call. It is up over 100% since my last piece. GDLC: Where's The Diversification? (August 2022) Grayscale Digital Large Cap: A Potential Arbitrage Opportunity (June 2023) Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund: Achievement Unlocked (December 2023) GDLC: Too Cheap To Ignore Again (March 2024) GDLC: Crypto's Deep Value Play (September 2024) This is a fund that I've covered for Seeking Alpha a half dozen times over the last two years: Seeking Alpha My main critique of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap fund has been what I view to be a poor fundamental methodology. To a larger degree than natural product competitor Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( OTC:BITW ), GDLC has a significant weighting to top coins Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). While I've viewed this as a fundamental weakness of the fund as an investment product, my opinion as a swing trader has been bullish. In this brief update, we'll again look at my 'fair value' framework and assess whether or not now is a good time to take the win in GDLC. Fund Details Inception: 2/01/2018 Expense Ratio: 2.5% AUM: $750 million I still believe the 2.5% expense ratio is far too high for what this fund actually does. Especially when considering the opportunity cost of not staking the proof-of-stake assets in the fund. When GDLC was launched, each share represented exposure to ten different digital assets. Today, we see just five, and those five assets haven't changed in the two months since my last piece. After BTC and ETH, GDLC gives investors exposure to Solana ( SOL-USD ), Ripple ( XRP-USD ), and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ). The chain-native staking rates observable today are shown below: Asset Reward Rate Staking Ratio ETH 3.19% 28.18% SOL 6.41% 65.73% AVAX 7.82% 52.83% Source: Staking Rewards, as of 11/26/24 What's important to understand is not staking AVAX, SOL, and to a lesser degree ETH has an opportunity cost because those assets should be earning yield if they're not going to be used for purchasing other assets on chain or paying gas for DEX swaps. This is a large reason why GDLC may not be a great way to invest in crypto long term. Of course, there is a US regulatory story at play here regarding asset staking, and we'll see if that changes in the future with a new administration in January. 'Fair Value' Framework Of the five assets in the fund, the only one that I personally have zero direct exposure to is XRP. For the purpose of diversified exposure to crypto, I think you can do worse than GDLC, but I still think BITW is a better option at this point due to the fact that BITW shares provide exposure to ten assets rather than just five. Back in September, I reiterated GDLC as a 'buy' again because the fund was trading at a 39% discount to net asset value, or NAV. Today, we find the fund trading at just a 17% discount to NAV. Thus, this has been a very successful trade; especially when considering the appreciation in the assets themselves. For those who have not seen the prior work, my 'fair value' calculation zeroes out the altcoins after BTC and ETH and assigns a full valuation to the BTC and ETH in the fund. The reason I'm not willing to write down either of those assets is because Grayscale has not one, but two ETFs for both Bitcoin and Ethereum that trade at NAV. Thus, I view it as an inefficiency in the market that GDLC can trade at a discount to the BTC and ETH held by the fund: Asset Asset price Holdings/Share $ Val/Share Adjusted Val % of Fund BTC $93,027 0.00037288 $34.69 $34.69 75.5% ETH $3,305 0.00227141 $7.51 $7.51 16.3% SOL $228.6 0.00884517 $2.02 $0.00 4.4% XRP $1.35 1.06633127 $1.44 $0.00 3.1% AVAX $41.36 0.00766179 $0.32 $0.00 0.7% Share Value $45.97 $42.20 Source: Grayscale, CryptoPrices.cc, Author's calculations and adjustments as of 11/26/24 intraday Applying my standard adjustment to GDLC assets produces an adjusted 'fair value' price of $42.20. At a $38 market price, we get an adjusted discount rate of 10%. Given this, I very much believe there is still meat on the bone with this swing trade. However, there are additional considerations to keep in mind. Risks and other Considerations First of all, my view of 'fair value' may not be the same as the market's or that of any individual readers. Frankly, there is no real standard within the digital asset industry for assessing valuations. Furthermore, Bitcoin and Ethereum are very different types of networks and each investor may find valuing them at market price to be too generous. When I last covered GDLC, the 39% discount to NAV was compelling because it discounted even the Bitcoin in the fund if we wrote down the ETH to zero as we do with the SOL, XRP, and AVAX. We don't have that setup anymore, with a $38 share price and $34.69 BTC value per share. Alternative.me Something that I think investors should definitely be mindful of is the greedy sentiment in this market. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index printed a 94 on November 22nd. This took out the 2024 high of 90 on March 5th. BTC's March 14th high didn't get taken out until November 6th and the coin has gone up nearly in a straight line since. I would not rule out a deeper mini correction in Bitcoin before the end of the year. Finally, as discounted as GDLC was in September, related parties did not buy any GDLC shares during Q3-24. For quarter-ended September, related parties still owned 1,055,487 shares. We've generally seen related party holdings decline over the last few quarters. Investor Takeaways I'm still long GDLC, though I do hold less than I did in September. I see two primary reasons to hold the fund as a trade despite my fundamental issues with the product itself; NAV discount rate and broad crypto bullishness. Each of these reasons are less compelling than they were just 2 months. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index printed its highest figure in several years at 94 and the official discount rate has been more than chopped in half since mid-September. Even my adjusted discount is less compelling than it was previously, at just 10%. Again, I do still have some GDLC, but I'm downgrading the fund to a 'hold' and will surely revisit it again for Seeking Alpha when the setup merits.",BITW|GDLC,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|SOL,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-27 10:05:29

By 2024, 8% of Salvadorans have used Bitcoin to make payments. Expanding energy capacity is central to El Salvador’s economic strategy. We believe Bukele’s Bitcoin gambit can serve as a model of innovation, determination, and independence for the emerging world. El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin bet and sweeping reforms are turning it into Latin America’s ultimate comeback story. Special thanks to our EM Bond team for their perspective and contributions to this article. Introduction El Salvador has undergone a remarkable transformation under President Nayib Bukele, emerging as a beacon of innovation and resilience in Latin America. From adopting Bitcoin as legal tender to enacting sweeping fiscal and social reforms, the nation has defied global skepticism. VanEck recognized this potential early and made investments in Salvadoran sovereign debt. Despite the fierce rally in these assets, we estimate the nation’s just-issued 30-year bond is still priced 200 basis points cheap compared to its fair value, with projected returns exceeding 33% over the next year should spreads narrow to our target. During our visit to San Salvador last week to meet President Bukele and speak at the “Adopting Bitcoin” conference, we re-explored the ambitious vision driving El Salvador's future as the ""Singapore of Latin America."" El Salvador’s Past: Challenges and Stagnation For decades after its 1979-1992 civil war, El Salvador faced crippling challenges: Economic Struggles: National debt grew from 37.8% of GDP in 2001 to 95% by 2020, while economic growth averaged just 2% - the second-lowest in Central America. High Crime Rates: Persistent violence and gang activity made El Salvador one of the most dangerous countries in the world, stifling investment and social cohesion. Brain Drain and External Migration: Decades of instability prompted the migration of over 1.6 million Salvadorans abroad, primarily to the United States. This external migration hollowed out the local labor force and left the newly dollarized economy heavily reliant on remittances for hard currency, which at the peak accounted for 25% of GDP - approximately $8 billion annually. Bukele’s Reforms: A Turning Point Since his election in 2019, President Bukele has reshaped El Salvador with sweeping reforms, and the economy has seen significant gains. Crime Reduction: Homicide rates plummeted from 51 per 100,000 in 2018 to just 2.4 in 2023, transforming El Salvador into the safest country in Central and South America. During VanEck’s due diligence process, conversations with local taxi drivers revealed how Bukele’s crackdown on gangs has profoundly improved daily life for ordinary Salvadorans. Many drivers emphasized that they no longer must pay “protection money” to criminal groups, a burden previously consuming a significant portion of their income. More than one driver shared that his children can now play soccer outside in the evenings without fear - something unimaginable just a few years ago. These stories strengthened our conviction by highlighting how reduced crime is not just a statistic but a tangible, transformative GDP multiplier for families and communities across the country. Fiscal Discipline: Debt-to-GDP dropped to 59% in 2024, its lowest since 2008, thanks to $2.3 billion in sovereign bond refinancing and prudent budgetary measures. GDP Growth: Between 2021 and 2023, GDP grew 19%, a significant acceleration compared to pre-2019 averages. Tourism: The sector’s GDP share rose from 11.7% in 2019 to 12.3% in 2023. From January to July 2024, inbound visitors surged 22% year over year, creating 36,000 new jobs and reducing unemployment to 2.76%. Labor Force Participation: Participation reached 64.4%, the highest in El Salvador’s history. This set of catalysts has prompted Moody’s to upgrade El Salvador’s sovereign debt from Caa3 in May 2022 to Caa1 in May 2024 and S&P to raise its rating from CCC+ in June 2022 to B- in November 2023. S&P reaffirmed its B- rating with a ""stable"" outlook in April 2024. While these ratings are still considered “Junk,” their positive direction affirms El Salvador’s strategy for financial renewal. We expect the ratings agencies to follow bond prices higher and upgrade ES debt further soon. Cumulative GDP Growth in Select Latin American Countries 2021 - 2023 Source: World Bank as of 11/7/2024. Bitcoin: A Bold Experiment In June 2021, a supermajority of the Salvadoran Congress passed legislation making Bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. The government envisioned Bitcoin as a tool to encourage foreign investment, expand financial inclusion for the unbanked, and provide the nation with an uncorrelated reserve asset. The government offered $30 in Bitcoin to citizens who downloaded the Chivo Wallet to promote adoption. Research by Yale in February 2022 revealed that 68% of households were aware of the Chivo Wallet, and 78% of those had downloaded it. By 2024, 8% of Salvadorans have used Bitcoin to make payments. While some international observers initially viewed this as a modest figure, we believe it represents a meaningful step forward for a country with historically low rates of electronic payment adoption. The integration of Bitcoin into daily life is creating a foundation for broader acceptance and innovation in financial technology. El Salvador has also embraced Bitcoin as a reserve asset, holding 6,150 BTC, currently valued at ~$600 million with $150 million in unrealized gains. This sum currently represents 1.6% of the nation’s GDP of $36 billion, underscoring the government’s commitment to Bitcoin as a reserve asset. For comparison’s sake, if the U.S. were to authorize a Bitcoin reserve of 1 million BTC at an average price of $150,000, under legislation that Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced, the reserve would be worth $150 billion, representing only 0.57% of the U.S.’s GDP of $26.3 trillion. El Salvador's Bitcoin Worth >$600M Source: El Salvador Wallet Tracker, Artemis XYZ as of 11/21/24. El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy extends beyond reserves. There are plans for $1 billion “Volcano Bonds”, half of whose proceeds would buy Bitcoin, aim to fund the development of Bitcoin City, a futuristic economic zone powered entirely by geothermal energy. This city is designed to attract international investment and innovation with zero taxes on income, property, or capital gains. Additionally, the government offers a “Freedom Visa” program, which grants citizenship to individuals who donate $1 million to the nation’s development efforts. While the Volcano Bonds have yet to be issued, the delay reflects a combination of strategic prudence - avoiding additional debt issuance in a high-interest rate environment - and geopolitical considerations as the government navigates sensitive negotiations with the IMF. By demonstrating fiscal restraint and prioritizing debt reduction, El Salvador strengthens its negotiating position while maintaining the option to issue the bonds under more favorable conditions in the future. The Vision for El Salvador During our meeting with President Bukele, he outlined bold but achievable goals to position El Salvador as a hub for nearshoring U.S. export capacity. Pro-growth policies, including economic ""free zones,"" aim to attract multinationals in auto parts and tech manufacturing sectors by offering tax-free value-added operations. These initiatives are already luring investment, supported by a deregulated energy market and infrastructure improvements. Bukele also highlighted El Salvador’s substantial untapped gold reserves, which he described as the largest per capita and per square mile in the world. These deposits represent an enormous economic opportunity, but the previous leftist government banned mining activities in 2017. Bukele expressed his intent to reverse this law, citing the potential to extract the metal responsibly while adhering to modern environmental and sustainability standards. The president extended an invitation to VanEck’s gold geologists to research the deposits, signaling his administration’s willingness to collaborate with global experts to unlock this resource. If successful, gold mining could contribute to El Salvador’s economic transformation, adding another layer to the country’s diversification efforts. The author and President Bukele, as of 11/15/2024. Energy as a Catalyst for Growth Expanding energy capacity is central to El Salvador’s economic strategy. During our meeting with a senior government official in the president’s office tasked with coordinating between the state electricity company and private enterprises, key insights were shared about the nation’s energy landscape and its potential to attract high-tech industries: Current Energy Landscape: Peak baseload demand: 1.2 GW; installed capacity: 2.5 GW. Renewable energy (700 MW) includes geothermal, hydro, and one wind plant. Base power is primarily hydro and geothermal, with bunker and natural gas providing 380 MW. Planned Developments: By 2035, El Salvador aims to expand geothermal energy capacity with six or seven new 50 MW plants. A $1 billion government investment will fund energy projects over five years, with 15% of new generation reserved for government use. While $0.16/kWh for industrial power isn’t cheap, the senior official noted that this price is manageable for high-margin data center customers. This is particularly true given El Salvador’s unique direct undersea cable access with 30-millisecond latency hops to Miami. According to the official we met, this connectivity, combined with the government’s tax incentives, positions El Salvador as a competitive destination for data centers and AI-focused operations. El Salvador’s diversified energy strategy contrasts with neighboring Costa Rica, which faced energy shortages in 2023 due to its over-reliance on renewable energy sources like hydropower. Costa Rica's inability to meet demand during a dry season highlighted the risks of disconnecting fossil fuel-powered electricity generation – which they did for “green” purposes - without ensuring sufficient backup generation. In contrast, we think El Salvador’s mix of geothermal, hydro, and natural gas may provide a more resilient energy portfolio capable of supporting industrial and technological growth. Although no El Salvador data center customers had been announced at the time of publication, we heard confidence that agreements would be finalized soon, with companies drawn to the country's infrastructure, reliability, and policy advantages. Initiatives like the private Volcano Energy (23% owned by the El Salvador Government), which drives geothermal energy expansion for Bitcoin mining, further enhance El Salvador’s potential crossover appeal for Bitcoin miners and other industries with long-term needs for sustainable and secure power. Relations with the IMF and the U.S. El Salvador’s bold Bitcoin policy and fiscal reforms have complicated its relationships with international stakeholders, particularly the IMF and the U.S. During the Biden administration, diplomatic relations were strained. Sanctions were imposed on key Salvadoran officials, and human rights groups pressured the U.S. to take a tougher stance on the nation’s aggressive anti-crime policies. As El Salvador remains heavily reliant on remittances - $8 billion annually, or 24% of GDP - primarily from the U.S., maintaining a strong bilateral relationship is critical. The Biden administration’s approach has created significant headwinds, but a Trump presidency offers the potential for a reset. With Trump’s well-documented support for Bitcoin and focus on reshoring and “friend-shoring” supply chains, El Salvador could emerge as a strategic partner in U.S. efforts to build regional alliances. Trump advisors’ recent visit to El Salvador in June 2024, warmly received by the Bukele administration, has fueled speculation of closer cooperation in areas such as manufacturing, energy, migration, and Bitcoin mining. The IMF’s role remains central to El Salvador’s financial trajectory. Many believe the IMF is keen to secure a deal before the Trump administration takes office, fearing that a shift in U.S. policy could alter the negotiation dynamics. The release of El Salvador’s 2025 budget - a more austere spending plan designed to address the IMF’s preconditions - has been seen as a move to improve the likelihood of aid. However, Bukele’s subsequent major bond amortization isn’t due until 2027, which gives him considerable room to negotiate without immediate pressure. Why hurry to negotiate when the IMF’s position may change upon Trump’s inauguration? Investment Opportunity: A Contrarian Call VanEck’s early recognition of El Salvador’s potential has been validated with many of the bonds more than doubling from their 2022 lows. Bond Valuation: We still estimate El Salvador’s 30-year sovereign bond is priced 200 basis points cheap to fair value. Projected Returns: If reforms continue as expected and spreads narrow to our fair value target, we anticipate a total return exceeding 33% in the next year. Since BTC Purchase, Salvadoran Debt (+18%) Source: Bloomberg as of 11/8/2024 Conclusion El Salvador’s transformation is a testament to bold policymaking and resilience. From fiscal reforms to Bitcoin adoption and energy innovation, the nation has defied global skepticism and achieved measurable success - whether through USD bond performance, GDP growth, or Bitcoin valuation, boosting its reserves. To date, these achievements have resulted from El Salvador’s independent and often solitary efforts, pursued in the face of opposition from major international stakeholders, including the IMF and its largest shareholder, the U.S. Now, however, the landscape may be shifting. As the potential for closer cooperation with the U.S. grows and IMF engagement becomes more likely, El Salvador is poised to move from a solitary pursuit of its goals to a collaborative one. This emerging tailwind of international support could remove one of the country’s final hurdles, enabling it to achieve even greater economic integration and stability. For investors, this makes El Salvador’s sovereign debt a compelling opportunity. We believe Bukele’s Bitcoin gambit can serve as a model of innovation, determination, and independence for the emerging world.

Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance.

Duration measures a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes that reflects the change in a bond’s price given a change in yield. This duration measure is appropriate for bonds with embedded options. Quantitative Easing by a central bank increases the money supply engaging in open market operations in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity. Emerging Market securities are subject to greater risks than U.S. domestic investments. These additional risks may include exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls; less publicly available information; more volatile or less liquid securities markets; and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic, or social instability. Investments in emerging markets bonds may be substantially more volatile, and substantially less liquid, than the bonds of governments, government agencies, and government-owned corporations located in more developed foreign markets. Emerging markets bonds can have greater custodial and operational risks, and less developed legal and accounting systems than developed markets. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This risk is heightened with investments in longer duration fixed-income securities and during periods when prevailing interest rates are low or negative. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money.

Cardano (ADA) has experienced significant price movement, surging by 10.19% within the last 24 hours and 21.15% over the past week. The 9th crypto by market cap, now trading above $1, has demonstrated resilience following a period of consolidation. Recent data indicates that whale activity played a crucial role in this rally, with large-scale investors actively accumulating ADA during price dips.Cardano Whales Accelerate Accumulation in Cardano news today , Analytical data shared by analyst Ali Martinez highlights an extensive accumulation phase by ADA whales, who acquired over 130 million ADA during a recent price correction. An initial accumulation phase, occurring between early November and November 12, was followed by an observed upward price trajectory, suggesting that large holders anticipated a bullish breakout. Image Source: @ali_charts, X (Twitter) After ADA reached near $1.1, a temporary decline in whale holdings occurred, likely driven by profit-taking activity. However, from November 20 onwards, as ADA traded below $0.8, renewed accumulation activity was noted. Although this accumulation trend has recently flattened, the initial spike reflects a robust interest in ADA by significant market participants during dips.On-Chain Indicators Highlight Growing InterestFurther reinforcing this trend, TradingView's accumulation/distribution (A/D) indicator shows a notable increase in accumulation. The indicator rose when ADA’s price was approximately $0.3, moving from 12.00 billion to 12.13 billion on the A/D scale. Cardano Image Source Trading View Cardano Image Source Trading View While the accumulation line remained relatively stable over previous months, it surged just before the preceding price breakout. This correlation between ADA's price action and accumulation metrics proves the influence of large holders in driving market trends. Sustained Confidence in Cardano (ADA)Statistics from IntoTheBlock further validate the recent increased interest in ADA by large holders. Over the past week, inflows have grown by 35.54%, reflecting a consistent rise in activity. Cardano Large Holders Infows, IntoTheBlock Long-term metrics provide additional context, with a 30-day inflow increase of 51,478.87% and a 90-day rise of 23,448.85%.
