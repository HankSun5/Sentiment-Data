With Bitcoin stabilizing near $107K and ETF speculation returning, analysts say now could be the perfect entry window before the next major rotation begins. Several leading projects are already drawing renewed attention from both retail traders and smart money funds. Here are the 5 best altcoins to buy now before the next wave of liquidity hits. 1. Ethereum (ETH) — Reclaiming Strength Ahead of ETF Reversal Ethereum has regained control of the $3,900 zone, marking its strongest technical close in two weeks. On-chain data shows a clear increase in whale wallet inflows — a bullish signal that often precedes 20–30% recoveries. If ETH breaks above the $4,200 resistance, analysts expect a move to $4,800–$5,000 , fueled by renewed ETF flows and institutional hedging demand. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — High-ROI Altcoin With Exchange Buzz Building Among mid-cap and presale-stage tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the most anticipated breakout play of 2025 . Analysts tracking early-stage inflows report that MAGA’s investor base has expanded sharply over the past 48 hours as anticipation builds for its upcoming exchange listings . Market sentiment around MAGACOIN FINANCE has shifted from speculative to strategic — traders now see it as a next-cycle contender with 50x–100x ROI potential once it hits centralized exchanges. Investors cite its audit-backed foundation , strong liquidity preparation, and aggressive listing roadmap as reasons for rising confidence. Many early entrants view the final pre-listing window as a rare “last-chance” opportunity before price discovery begins and retail access opens globally. With attention rotating from meme speculation to smart-presale plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now positioned as one of the best crypto opportunities heading into 2025’s first major bull run . 3. Solana (SOL) — Oversold Bounce Targets 80% Upside Solana continues to show resilience after correcting below $190, with analysts forecasting an 80% rebound once liquidity returns. Its DeFi and NFT ecosystems remain among the most active in crypto, and whale wallets have quietly accumulated over 500,000 SOL in the past week. Traders see $250 as a key near-term target if momentum builds around ETF speculation. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional Capital Circles Layer-1 Ecosystem Avalanche has rebounded 12% this week, supported by strong developer activity and institutional integration into tokenized finance solutions. With AVAX holding steady around $38, analysts expect a potential move toward $60 , making it one of the top mid-cap recovery trades for early 2025. 5. Chainlink (LINK) — Quiet Accumulation Before the Next Data Surge Chainlink (LINK) continues to benefit from the rise of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization , with on-chain metrics showing increased network activity. Analysts believe that as more institutions connect blockchain data through LINK’s oracles, its valuation could surge by 40–70% , making it a staple pick in upcoming portfolios. Analysts Expect Q4 Rotation and Breakout Momentum With fear levels cooling and ETF narratives reigniting, market analysts say the next few weeks could mark the beginning of the next altcoin cycle . Ethereum’s strength is setting the tone — but the spotlight is now on undervalued assets with explosive upside. For investors seeking asymmetrical returns, Solana, Avalanche, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as frontrunners positioned for the next major ROI wave before 2025’s full bull run ignites.

53385794,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86861,1760907624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction — Analysts Target $125K Recovery as Market Fear Drops Below 30,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-analysts-target-125k-recovery-as-market/,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke into a crucial turning point as analysts, on the crypto market, look at a possible rebound towards $125,000 , after the fear index dropped below 30. The sharp decline in sentiment comes after Bitcoin’s recent 20% price dip from its October highs near $125K to around $100K. Despite the fear, some analysts consider this phase a classic accumulation phase, which is often followed by sharp rebounds. As the market assesses its next move, the focus is shifting towards institutional inflows and emerging tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has maintained investor interest during the downtrend. Crypto Market Fear Drops Below 30—What’s Next? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dropped to 25, which indicates market-wide fear. The transition from neutral sentiment (51) last month is the result of a cautious mood from traders, after Bitcoin’s correction below $110,000. Historically, such fear levels have occurred at market bottoms or the early stage of accumulation by institutional buyers. Analysts say that when the index goes below 30, long-term investors consider that to be a signal to buy undervalued assets. Crypto Fear and Greed Index | Source: CMC This new level of fear has resulted in a variety of responses. Short-term traders are reducing exposure during volatility, while other investors are positioning for a potential rebound. With Bitcoin consolidating near the 50-week moving average, technical indicators indicate that sellers are near exhaustion, suggesting a possible relief rally is in the cards if key supports are maintained. As investors reassess the market landscape, new opportunities are emerging beyond the consolidation in Bitcoin. MAGACOIN FINANCE , one of the most talked-about presales of the quarter, has distinguished itself in the face of widespread caution for keeping investor interest high. Its audited framework and community-driven model have established it as a leading contender for those investors who want to gain exposure to early-stage growth projects during the market cooldown period. Bitcoin Price Targets $125K Rebound Bitcoin’s RSI has plunged to 36, which is oversold territory for the first time in months. Historically, this signal is often seen as the conclusion of the correction phase that tends to be followed by rallies of 15-25%. Technical analysts are optimistic that a support range of $100K-$103K might be holding and could pave the way to a recovery towards the $120K-$135K range in the next few weeks. BTCUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Analyst observed that RSI is in oversold, with a bottom of $135K. This view is in line with previous historical recovery patterns following similar RSI numbers in 2023 and 2024. At the same time, long-term models show resilience of Bitcoin near the 50-week SMA , which has been the trigger zone of huge rallies from $20K, $25K, and $55K levels in previous cycles. Institutional sentiment is still cautious but supportive. Despite market volatility, spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity have seen consistent inflows, further solidifying demand over the long term. Analysts anticipate a swift return of confidence if Bitcoin closes the week above $105K, fueling renewed momentum towards the $125K resistance zone . It is in this cautious optimism that focus has moved to the presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE . The early traction of this crypto presale is indicative of a rising need for diversification at a time of Bitcoin stabilization. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Top of Analyst Picks MAGACOIN FINANCE has been one of the best analyst picks amid the current market correction. Unlike hyped-up tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone comprehensive security audits by CertiK and Hashex , ensuring transparency and investor safety. Its Ethereum-based presale mechanism, along with a fixed supply, has drawn comparison with early success stories that provided enormous returns as soon as markets recovered. Analysts cite the project’s strong fundamentals, early-stage valuation, and increasing involvement from whales as evidence of long-term momentum. With over $16 million raised and demand growing despite the period of fear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the right move to take when market confidence returns. Its community involvement and transparent presale plan have made it the best crypto to buy in Q4 . Conclusion As fear takes hold of the market, Bitcoin is in the oversold territory and getting closer to the key support levels, which could indicate a turning point opportunity. Analysts suggest that as long as BTC stays above $100K, the recovery towards $125K is still likely in the near-term. Nevertheless, investors are looking out for new opportunities in other projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which, with its audited structure and investor traction, is proving resilient, even in a fearful market. Whether a rebound or further consolidation, these accumulation phases tend to create the foundation for the next big rally.

The rebound comes as investor confidence appears to be returning, as it coincides with a steady rise in mid to large-sized XRP holders. Particularly, on-chain data shows that the XRP ecosystem now has more than 317,500 wallets holding at least 10,000 XRP tokens for the first time in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage Mid To Large XRP Holders Reach Record 317,500 Wallets Despite XRP’s recent price woes alongside the rest of the crypto market, on-chain data shows that XRP’s holder base is increasing among crypto investors. Notably, Santiment’s latest data shows that the number of XRP wallets holding at least 10,000 tokens has reached an all-time high of approximately 317,500. Santiment’s data chart, as shown below, indicates that XRP’s network has added approximately 1.8% more wallets holding 10,000 or more tokens in just the last thirty days. Interestingly, Santiment’s data further shows that the upward slope of this metric has been consistent throughout 2025. The increase in mid-sized and large wallet count shows that many XRP investors are not concerned about the recent price dips. Instead, many of them are taking advantage of lower prices to strengthen their holdings. As such, a growing segment of investors are buying XRP for long-term gains rather than short-term price action. XRP, which is currently hovering around the $2.35 range, may benefit from this growing base of committed holders in the long term. Its price trajectory now depends on its ability to sustain momentum above $2.3. If the bullish on-chain sentiment translates into consistent buy pressure, XRP could extend its rebound and target at least $2.8 before the end of the week. However, if momentum stalls, the price may enter another downward phase before an upward move. Nonetheless, the record growth in wallets holding over 10,000 XRP provides a strong long-term foundation that may support the cryptocurrency’s value in the coming weeks. Number of 10K+ XRP Wallets.

The stolen assets were reportedly transferred to the Tron network via Bridgers and then laundered through Southeast Asia-based OTC channels called Huione. Huione was recently sanctioned by the US for fraud and money laundering. ZachXBT stated that it identified the victim's wallet address based on a viral YouTube video. The attacker reportedly executed more than 120 Ripple-to-Tron bridge transactions on October 12, 2025. The transactions appeared to have been made through Binance, but the liquidity was provided by Bridgers. As of October 15, the funds were fully transferred to Huione-linked OTC accounts. Related News: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Grew by 64 Percent Overnight - Here's What You Need to Know Huione is alleged to have played a role in laundering billions of dollars in illicit funds in recent years, including through “pig butchering” scams, investment fraud, human trafficking, and cyberattacks. Last week, the US administration expanded sanctions against Huione as part of its $15 billion Prince Group investigation. ZachXBT said one of the key lessons to be learned from the incident was that users don't know the difference between wallet types: The victim thought he was using Ellipal's cold wallet, but it was actually a hot wallet. Similar confusion occurs on platforms like Coinbase. He also noted that the victim had difficulty contacting US law enforcement to report the $3 million loss, as there were few experts qualified to handle such cases. *This is not investment advice.

53386658,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=839964,1760908672,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53386658.jpeg,OpenAI aligns with Trump while Anthropic fights regulation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/anthropic-openai-and-u-s-government/,"Right now, Anthropic is facing a double fight – one against OpenAI, its biggest rival, and another against President Donald Trump’s administration, which has taken direct aim at the company’s policies. The San Francisco startup, founded by siblings Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei in 2020 after they split from OpenAI, has built its entire identity on making AI safer. But that stance has now landed it in political crossfire, drawing attacks from David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar. Sacks has accused Anthropic of playing politics instead of innovation. After Jack Clark, the company’s policy chief, published an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,” Sacks fired back online. “Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,” he wrote on X. He claimed the company was pushing “the Left’s vision of AI regulation” and trying to control how the technology is governed in the United States. OpenAI aligns with Trump while Anthropic fights regulation OpenAI has become one of Trump’s closest tech partners. On January 21, just a day after Trump’s second inauguration, the White House announced Stargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The plan involves billions of dollars for U.S. AI infrastructure and marks a deep partnership between government and industry. Backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, OpenAI now holds a valuation near $500 billion, dwarfing Anthropic’s still massive $183 billion. While OpenAI dominates the public side of AI with ChatGPT and Sora, Anthropic has carved its niche in enterprise with its Claude models. But the companies could not be more different in their regulations. OpenAI has lobbied for lighter federal rules, while Anthropic has been one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump’s plan to block state-level AI oversight. The clash intensified over a Trump-backed proposal inside the “Big Beautiful Bill”, which sought to ban states from introducing their own AI regulations for ten years. The plan was later dropped after heavy pushback from Anthropic and others. Instead, the company threw its support behind California’s SB 53, a bill requiring AI transparency and safety disclosures. In a blog post on September 8, the company wrote, “SB 53’s transparency requirements will have an important impact on frontier AI safety. Without it, labs with increasingly powerful models could face growing incentives to dial back their own safety and disclosure programs in order to compete.” Sacks and Rabois step up political pressure Sacks has denied trying to take down Anthropic, saying he only wants the U.S. to win the AI race against China. “The U.S. is currently in an AI race, and our chief global competition is China,” Sacks said at Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. “They’re the only other country that has the talent, the resources, and the technology expertise to basically beat us in AI.” When Bloomberg linked his comments to federal scrutiny of Anthropic, Sacks shot back. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said on X. “Just a couple of months ago, the White House approved Anthropic’s Claude app to be offered to all branches of government through the GSA App Store.” Sacks also accused Anthropic of painting itself as a political victim. “It has been Anthropic’s government affairs and media strategy to position itself consistently as a foe of the Trump administration,” he said. “But don’t whine to the media that you’re being ‘targeted’ when all we’ve done is articulate a policy disagreement.” He cited several examples, including Dario comparing Trump to a “feudal warlord” during the 2024 election and endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Anthropic ran multiple op-eds pushing back against the administration’s AI moratorium and chip export strategy, while hiring several former Biden-era officials to manage its policy team. Sacks said Clark’s essay contributes to the “fear-mongering” that is harming startups. Clark had written: “As these AI systems get smarter, they develop more complicated goals. When these goals aren’t aligned with human preferences, they behave strangely. Another reason for my fear is that I can see a path to these systems starting to design their successors, albeit in an early form.” Sacks replied that this type of rhetoric is “principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.” Anthropic maintains several federal contracts, including a $200 million deal with the Department of Defense and ongoing access to government agencies through the General Services Administration. It also launched a national security advisory council to align with U.S. interests and even offers its Claude model to government users for just $1 per year. Adding to the heat, tech investor Keith Rabois, whose husband serves in the Trump administration, joined the criticism. “If Anthropic actually believed their rhetoric about safety, they can always shut down the company,” Rabois wrote on X. “And lobby then.” Don’t just read crypto news.

The 54-year-old Brandon said this was his and his 60-year-old wife’s entire life savings, and they were planning to buy a house in Las Vegas. That dream collapsed overnight. Brandon said he had been building his XRP position since 2017, slowly selling pieces off to cover living costs. “That was everything we had,” he said. “I’m speaking up because maybe someone out there can learn from what happened to us.” He admitted he doesn’t expect the funds to be recovered, but hopes the story will remind people to keep their cold wallets truly offline. What remained was everything they had left for retirement. Brandon explained in a YouTube video released on Saturday that the theft likely happened on Sunday, October 12. Two small 10-XRP test transactions appeared around 11:15 a.m. Eastern time, followed by a full sweep of about 1,209,990 XRP to a new address. From there, the funds were broken apart and moved across dozens of wallets in minutes, then hundreds more as the hours passed. His smaller holdings, about $1,000 in XLM and $900 in FLR, were untouched. After realizing the funds were gone, he filed a report with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center and contacted local police, but he said it was hard to reach specialized cybercrime investigators quickly. “I don’t know exactly how they got in,” Brandon said. “All I know is everything was there one day and gone the next.” Ellipal blames cold-to-hot wallet confusion Ellipal released a public statement on October 18 claiming its internal review showed that Brandon had entered his hardware wallet seed phrase into the Ellipal mobile app, turning what was supposed to be cold storage into a hot wallet. In an email to him, the company explained that when a seed phrase is imported into a phone or tablet, the device stores the private keys, connecting it to the internet and destroying the safety layer that makes a cold wallet secure. Brandon said he had the Ellipal app installed on both an iPhone and an iPad. The iPhone app had a blue background, which Ellipal told him represented a cold wallet. The iPad version showed an orange background, which meant it was hot. Ellipal said that color difference mattered, emphasizing that their hardware devices are air-gapped, meaning they never connect to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB. The company said no thefts had ever come from its physical wallets and insisted the incident looked like user error. Still, the company admitted it couldn’t prove how the theft technically happened. Brandon said he simply followed the app’s interface. “If the blue means cold and orange means hot, why wasn’t that made clearer?” he said in one of his YouTube videos. Ellipal hasn’t confirmed whether the color indicators failed or were misunderstood, but maintained that entering a seed phrase into an app immediately removes all protection. ZachXBT traces stolen XRP across Tron and OTC brokers On Sunday, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT posted a detailed thread on X (formerly Twitter) sharing how he identified the theft address by matching the transaction times and values shown in Brandon’s videos. In his post, Zach said the attacker used Bridgers, the swap service previously called SWFT, to create more than 120 Ripple-to-Tron conversions on October 12. Some block explorers labeled the transactions as “Binance” because Bridgers routes its liquidity through the exchange. According to Zach’s X thread, the stolen XRP was eventually consolidated on the Tron network in a wallet labeled TGF3hP5GeUPKaRJeWKpvF2PVVCMrfe2bYw, before being sent to multiple over-the-counter brokers tied to Huione, a Southeast Asian marketplace flagged in U.S. enforcement actions for handling illicit transfers. Three days later, the funds had been reportedly scattered across countless addresses, making recovery practically impossible. ZachXBT warned people to stay away from “crypto recovery” services, calling them scams that charge big fees for fake investigations.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $1,044.17, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $2,418.37 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that. Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $189.88 (-3%) Market Cap $104 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $4.54 Billion Circulating Supply 546.41 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $192.20 24-hour Low $183.46 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $215.56 200-Day SMA $174.33 Price Prediction $411.98 (117.04%) F & G Index 20.33 (extreme fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 14-Day RSI 35.24 Solana price analysis: SOL recovers to $190 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows recovery back to $190 Resistance for SOL is at $210 Support for SOL/USD is at $180 The price analysis of Solana for October 19 shows that SOL has recovered back to the $190 mark as the bulls recover from $180 lows. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls below $180 before recovery Solana observed bearish pressure as SOL fell to the $180 mark before recovering back to the $210 level. However, the price faced resistance at the level and fell below the $180 mark where it found short-term support. Now, the price has recovered back to the $190 level but struggles in climbing higher. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.56, which reflects the recent trend, showing bearish pressure across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line recovers steadily, suggesting falling selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bearish momentum as the indicator trades at -2.59 showing strong but decreasing momentum. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face resistance above $190 The 4-hour chart for Solana shows that the price oscillated between the $220 and the 230 levels as either side struggled to gain momentum. The recent rally surged the SOL price toward $230 resistance line before crashing below the $180 mark. The price bounced back sharply from the $180 mark and now trades around the $190 level but faces strong bearish pressure. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bullish momentum at 1.14, with the indicator showing rising selling pressure as SOL stabilizes above $185. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) trades around 50.00, indicating that Solana faces mixed momentum at the price level. The current Index level shows room for volatile movement in either direction.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $180. The chart suggests that further downwards movement is unlikely across the short-term. As the price climbs back towards $200, SOL can be expected to hold steady at the level and continue rising towards the $220 level before finding a strong resistance. However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $195, SOL may fall back to the $170 support continuing the bearish trend. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for Solana’s growth and future growth. Why is SOL up? Solana observed bullish momentum as buyers tried to climb past $230, however, the rejection at the level has sent the price falling below the $180 mark. The price rose to $190 but struggles to climb past the level. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of 331.81, driven by fundamental factors in the market. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030, influenced by trends in the broader crypto market . Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential ROI due to its high scalability, which makes Solana an attractive investment. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 21:33:00

Currently, the space is being dominated by Hyperliquid. Meanwhile, traditional heavyweights like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are falling behind fast. Hyperliquid Leads the Pack CryptoRank’s latest data found a striking reshuffling in terms of blockchain fee leadership over the past year. Hyperliquid is emerging as the dominant force. The network’s fees skyrocketed 1,600% after surging from $2.4 million in October 2024 to a whopping $41 million in October 2025, driven by HIP-3’s launch, which paved the way for permissionless perpetuals and strategic fee reductions that fueled record trading volume. This meteoric rise has left once-dominant networks like Ethereum and Solana in the dust, as Ethereum’s fees halved to $21.6 million and Solana saw a 34% decline to $6.6 million. This essentially reflected users’ shift to faster, cheaper alternatives and a cooldown in meme-driven activity. Other chains like BNB Chain and Base also saw impressive growth, but none rival Hyperliquid’s explosive climb . Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s on-chain activity dwindled as fees plunged 73% during the same period amid fading Ordinals and Runes interest. As reported by CryptoPotato earlier, Hyperliquid cemented itself as a dominant force in Q2 2025 as it registered $648 billion in trading volume for the period and $1.57 trillion over 12 months. Its revenues topped $300 million, while its share of the perpetual DEX market surpassed 60%, roughly ten times greater than the nearest rival. This success can be attributed to the HYPE token airdrop and fair point system in late 2024, which drove massive user adoption. Meanwhile, popular traders, like James Wynn, added further attention, and the token buyback-and-burn program supported HYPE’s price stability during the said quarter. Even VanEck researchers noted that Hyperliquid effectively lured high-value users from Solana. HYPE Faces Sell Pressure Lately, however, HYPE has experienced considerable volatility. It started the week above $45 before tumbling sharply on October 11 and settling into a downtrend through October 17. Despite brief recoveries, the token failed to regain previous highs and wrapped up the period at $34.2, coinciding with the broader market plunge. The latest downturn has pushed HYPE’s monthly losses to 38.36%.

Both tokens are showing renewed technical strength, climbing double digits as investors reenter risk assets. Amid the growing optimism, analysts are turning their attention to early-stage altcoins showing explosive growth potential. Their new watchlist of the 5 best crypto presale gems for 2025 includes a mix of established projects and breakout newcomers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is quickly being recognized as one of the year’s most compelling early opportunities. 1. Cardano (ADA) — Whale Accumulation Confirms Confidence Cardano has regained momentum after sliding below key support last week. ADA now trades around $0.63 , up more than 9% in 48 hours. On-chain whale data shows heavy accumulation, suggesting institutions are positioning ahead of 2025’s Layer-1 revival. Analysts expect ADA to reclaim the $0.70–$0.80 range , marking the beginning of a long-term structural reversal. Cardano remains one of the most technically sound altcoins for investors seeking steady ROI growth into the next cycle. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — Hidden 100x Presale Gem Poised for Listings Among all emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout presale story of 2025 . The project’s surge in investor interest has placed it firmly on analysts’ “high-conviction watchlist,” thanks to its verified audit, clear roadmap, and structured approach to liquidity. What’s driving the hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale phase is nearing its final allocation , and traders are calling this the last major opportunity before the token begins its exchange rollout . Market analysts now forecast returns ranging from 50x to 100x based on projected launch valuations and early demand. With investor inflows accelerating daily, this best crypto presale gem has quickly become a favorite among traders seeking both short-term catalysts and long-term upside. Its upcoming listing window is expected to spark a significant price discovery event , drawing liquidity from across the market. 3. TRON (TRX) — Stablecoin Demand Drives Long-Term Strength TRON (TRX) continues to prove its staying power, fueled by consistent stablecoin transaction volume that exceeds $15 billion daily . Its growing dominance in on-chain transfers has helped the token maintain remarkable price stability. TRON currently trades near $0.12 , and analysts expect a potential rally toward $0.15 , positioning it among the most reliable mid-cap performers in this phase of market recovery. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional Demand Rising Fast Avalanche (AVAX) has reentered the conversation among top Layer-1 plays, with steady institutional interest and growing subnet adoption. Trading between $35–$40 , AVAX remains undervalued relative to its network activity. Analysts expect a move toward $60+ , with tokenized real-world assets and DeFi integrations acting as major tailwinds. 5. SUI (SUI) — Sub-$1 Token Drawing Smart Money Attention Rounding out the list, SUI continues to attract early smart money interest after a strong bounce from $0.74. Developer adoption remains healthy, and trading volume has increased more than 30% over the past week. Analysts view SUI as a high-risk, high-upside play that could deliver 20x–40x returns if the market confirms its Q4 reversal. Analysts See Presales as the Core of the 2025 Bull Setup Historically, presales and early-access tokens have produced the highest ROI multiples ahead of bull markets — and this cycle appears to be repeating. Analysts believe that with fear levels easing and liquidity returning, MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, TRON, Avalanche, and SUI could all deliver outsized gains, led by MAGA’s 100x presale momentum . The window for accumulation is closing quickly — and traders moving early may capture the next breakout phase before the broader market catches on.

53387909,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=839976,1760911228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53387909.jpeg,"Delayed CPI report, Fed meeting loom as Big Tech, automakers post results",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-enters-second-q3-earnings-week/,"Wall Street begins its second week of third-quarter earnings as investors brace for the first inflation data since the U.S. government shutdown, with Netflix, General Motors, Tesla, Ford, and Intel, all reporting. The September Consumer Price Index (CPI), delayed nine days, is also scheduled for release on Friday, after the shutdown halted economic data releases since October 1. The government said the numbers were needed for the Social Security Administration to process benefit payments on time. The report will arrive just before the Federal Reserve’s October 28–29 policy meeting, where traders expect a quarter-point rate cut, the second in two months after weak job data pushed the Fed to lower rates in September. More than 80 of all S&P 500 companies will release their Q3 earnings this week, extending a busy start to the season. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs opened the season last week and delivered strong figures, with about 84 % of companies that have reported so far beating all estimates, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. General Motors, Netflix, and Tesla report during packed mid-week sessions General Motors (GM) will report Tuesday morning before markets open, followed by a management call at 8:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter, the automaker absorbed a $1.1 billion tariff hit. Analysts surveyed expect profits to drop more than 20 % year-over-year. Edison Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said GM could still top forecasts but warned that “while pricing should remain consistent, results will likely be hurt by a small volume decline as well as higher net tariff impact.” Bespoke Investment Group found GM beats estimates 88 % of the time, though its stock has fallen on its last three earnings days, twice by more than 8 %. Netflix will release results after the close Tuesday, followed by a call event. The streamer’s last report showed 16 % revenue growth, and analysts project nearly a 30 % profit increase this quarter. Laurent Yoon from Bernstein said in a client note on Saturday that the animated hit “K-Pop Demon Hunters” drove the stock market’s rebound, adding about 500 million viewing hours, with another 400 million expected in the fourth quarter. Netflix has exceeded earnings for six straight quarters and seen gains on three of the last four report days, Bespoke’s data shows. Tesla follows Wednesday after the closing bell. The company missed sales targets last quarter as auto revenue slipped again, and analysts forecast another 20 % drop in earnings. Colin Langan of Wells Fargo expects a short-term beat but said “there’s too much hype baked into the stock.” He added that the Full Self-Driving system remains under NHTSA investigation, affecting credibility. Tesla has beaten expectations less than 60 % of the time, Bespoke data show. That “narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” Turnquist said in written commentary. Similarly, Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said he will be watching how broadly based the market’s gains are going forward. Ford, Intel, and the delayed CPI dominate Thursday’s market focus Ford Motor reports Thursday after the bell, with an analyst call shortly following after. Last quarter, Ford reinstated its full-year guidance despite a $2 billion tariff hit. Analysts now expect earnings to fall more than 25 % from a year earlier. Itay Michaeli of TD Cowen said attention will be on Ford’s aluminum supply from Novelis, especially for the F-Series trucks. He wrote that his estimates “do not contemplate any material production disruptions,” keeping forecasts near the top end of Ford’s EBIT outlook at $7.4 billion. Ford has beaten Wall Street estimates four quarters in a row. Intel will also report Thursday after markets close, with its call at 5 p.m. ET. Last quarter, the chipmaker beat revenue forecasts and cut foundry spending. Analysts expect Intel to return to profitability this period. Its shares have jumped 62 % in three months after the U.S. government took a 10 % stake and Nvidia invested $5 billion. Investors will be watching how Intel plans to leverage that backing. Still, its stock fell after each of the last three earnings, including an 8 % drop after the previous quarter. “We’d really have to see something out of left field in terms of notable inflation pressures to knock the Fed off of a rate cut path at the October meeting,” Glenmede’s Michael Reynolds said. That “narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” Turnquist said in written commentary. Similarly, Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said he will be watching how broadly based the market’s gains are going forward.

With ETF speculation heating up and Bitcoin steady above $107K , traders say XRP could be gearing up for a major price breakout into Q4 . 1. XRP (XRP) — Whale Accumulation Confirms Smart Money Entry On-chain data from major tracking platforms shows XRP whales adding over $500 million in holdings across 48 hours — the largest two-day accumulation since April. This renewed confidence follows Ripple’s increasing integration with cross-border payment systems and growing chatter around a potential XRP-linked ETF product . XRP is currently holding support near $0.55 , with analysts forecasting a rebound toward $1.20–$1.40 once Bitcoin’s ETF flows stabilize. Several market watchers now call XRP one of the best cryptos to buy for Q4 , citing strong fundamentals and historical performance during ETF-driven rallies. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — Best Crypto Presale Offering 50% Patriot Bonus While XRP captures institutional flows, early investors are hunting high-ROI opportunities — and MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate presale conversations. The project has entered its final sale phase ahead of expected exchange listings, and investor demand is surging daily. To celebrate its success, MAGACOIN FINANCE has launched an exclusive PATRIOT50X bonus , giving buyers an extra 50% token allocation for a limited time. Analysts forecast 40x–100x ROI potential post-listing, calling it one of the best crypto presales of 2025 for investors seeking asymmetric gains before mass-market entry. 3. Bitcoin and Ethereum Stability Strengthen Market Outlook Bitcoin’s consolidation above $107K and Ethereum’s hold around $3,900 are restoring confidence across altcoins. With ETF outflows slowing and stablecoin inflows rising, liquidity rotation into large caps like XRP and emerging presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is already underway. Analysts Expect Q4 Breakout Momentum Market sentiment is shifting rapidly as institutional inflows stabilize and whale activity intensifies. With ETF optimism building, analysts believe XRP could retest multi-year highs — while MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the charge among the best crypto presales preparing for 2025’s next bull leg.

As the flagship cryptocurrency slows down, the latest on-chain data suggests that a group of investors is exiting the market en masse. More Short-Term Holders Are Giving Up Their Holdings In an October 18 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Darkfost revealed that a significant number of Bitcoin’s short-term investors have started to close their positions and realize their losses. Related Reading: Altcoins Selling Pressure Persists As Exchange Inflow Hits 2025 High — Details Darkfost’s analysis was hinged on the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which tracks the net amount (in USD) of profits or losses that are realized on-chain. This metric measures the net profit or loss on a daily basis, averaged, in this case, over seven days. It provides insight into whether more investors are selling at losses or with their heads still above water.. According to the crypto pundit, the realized losses of BTC investors have surged to an approximate level as high as $750 million per day, one of the highest levels this current cycle has seen. Interestingly, Darkfost explained that the magnitude of these capitulation events stands easily comparable to those seen during the 2024 summer correction. What’s worth noting about this capitulation phase is what may likely follow. According to the analyst, events like this usually precede local bottoms. What this means is that after short-term holders (known as the “weak hands”) have surrendered their holdings to the more-confident long-term holders (the “diamond hands”), the cryptocurrency stands a chance of seeing a price rebound — an expectation in congruence with historical trends. However, on the more cautious side, Darkfost offered a subtle warning that the dreary opposite could also be the case in a situation where the market stands at an early bearish phase. Bitcoin Whales Might Be Accumulating Again Supporting the positive redistribution theory, a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform by Abramchart offers a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin market participants. Referencing the Inflows To Accumulation Addresses (Dynamic Cohort) metric, the analyst highlighted a significant inflow of more than 26,500 BTC into whale accumulation wallets. When large amounts of Bitcoin — such as this magnitude — are moved, it usually signals an underlying institutional or whale accumulation, as coins are typically transferred from exchanges to these wallets for long-term holding. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? Following historical patterns, it is very likely that this accumulation event will precede a continued bullish expansion of the flagship cryptocurrency. As Abramchart explained, this trend all serves as a hint that smart money is “quietly buying the dip.” As of this writing, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $106,870, with no significant movement seen over the past 24 hours.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|VET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 23:33:00

Notably, popular crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared a detailed Gaussian Channel analysis on X that points to Bitcoin’s macro bull structure remaining intact despite short-term volatility. His post, which was accompanied by a Bitcoin price chart, shows how Bitcoin’s position relative to the Gaussian Channel offers a clear view of the ongoing cycle. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Issues Rally Cry To Bitcoin Army: “Starve The Bears!” Bull Market Intact Above Gaussian Channel Titan of Crypto noted that Bitcoin’s placement above the Gaussian Channel represents strength in the long-term trend. As shown in the weekly candlestick price chart below, the green channel corresponds to bullish phases, while red regions represent bearish downturns, a prime example being the 2022 bear market. At the time of writing, the upper band is positioned around $101,300 and trending upward. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price action around $107,000 means that it is yet to break into the Gaussian channel and its overall market structure is still solid. From this, it can be inferred that Bitcoin’s current pullback from the October 6 all-time high above $126,000 is only a temporary pause within a larger bull market. Bitcoin Gaussian Channel. Source: Titan of Crypto on X However, although the Gaussian Channel reading looks favorable, Titan of Crypto noted that the indicator should not be treated as a trading trigger. “It’s not a buy signal, it’s a macro context indicator,” he stated. Being above the Gaussian Channel doesn’t necessarily equate to buying more. It simply means the bull market structure is still intact. The Gaussian Channel works best when combined with other indicators such as trading volume, moving averages, and on-chain accumulation trends to confirm directional momentum. Coinbase Premium Gap Turns Red Speaking of other indicators, on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the Coinbase Premium Gap, a metric comparing Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase versus other exchanges, has turned red. As shown in the chart below, Coinbase’s Premium Gap went on a sharp decline from positive premium levels above +60 earlier in the week to as low as -40 when the Bitcoin price fell to $101,000. Bitcoin: Coinbase Premium Gap Interestingly, the Coinbase Premium Gap has increased to around -10 at the time of writing, meaning US investors are starting to turn bullish again. This can be seen as a bullish signal, as similar dips in US demand were recorded between March and April before the Bitcoin price eventually rallied more than 60% to reach new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage However, a red Coinbase Premium Gap alone is not decisive. It should be interpreted alongside other data points, including ETF inflows, trading volume, liquidity, and derivatives funding rates. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $107,120.

The comment offered a perspective that challenges common assumptions about the company’s reserves. Ripple recently announced plans to raise $1 billion to purchase XRP , and Nietzbux wrote that “there are several reasons Ripple would buy new XRP with new capital for a treasury,” but pointed out that many continue to ask why the company would not simply move tokens from its escrow account. The Pre-allocation Theory He then introduced what he described as a purely speculative factor, suggesting that “maybe the pre-allocation theory is correct and Ripple has less XRP in the escrow than the public thinks.” The idea hints at a possible scenario where a portion of the tokens held in escrow may already be committed to private arrangements, potentially explaining Ripple’s continued market activity despite its large nominal holdings . This interpretation challenges the view that Ripple’s escrow is entirely available for company use. Nietzbux’s speculation resonates with long-running theories within the XRP community about pre-allocated holdings and private agreements with financial institutions. If accurate, this could mean that Ripple’s available supply is smaller than most believe, a situation that would theoretically support stronger long-term market dynamics for XRP due to tighter circulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Public Transparency and Market Interpretation Following the post, community members questioned the premise, noting that Ripple has publicly stated the amount of XRP held in escrow. Nietzbux acknowledged that the escrow and its total are indeed public, but clarified that Ripple’s ownership of all tokens in escrow isn’t public information. While experts agree that Ripple cannot freely sell off the tokens in escrow , this distinction drew attention to an important technical point, as public blockchain data can verify how much XRP is locked. Still, ownership details and contractual obligations related to those tokens may remain undisclosed. Another user sought clarification on the term “pre-allocation,” asking whether it referred to XRP being set aside for Ripple’s banking partners. Ripple has partnerships with over 300 banks and institutions across the globe, and Nietzbux explained that pre-allocation in this context would mean tokens have already been sold to some of these institutions, and are being kept in escrow until release. If such pre-allocation exists, Ripple’s decision to buy XRP directly could reflect an effort to maintain liquidity and support price stability. For investors, this scenario would suggest that Ripple’s financial behavior aligns with a long-term effort to preserve confidence in XRP’s market integrity.

The market’s alive again, filled with meme coins that bite and blockchains that actually build. Among the noise, BullZilla ($BZIL), MoonBull ($MOBU), and La Culex ($CULEX) are charging ahead as the top crypto presale to join now, while giants like Chainlink, Avalanche, and Solana remind investors that innovation never sleeps. And one beast is truly rewriting the playbook: BullZilla ($BZIL) a project born to dominate. Its Stage 7 presale (Bag Signal Activated) is live, with an automatic price increase every $100K raised or every 48 hours. With over $930K raised, 31B tokens sold, and 3,100 holders, early believers are already seeing over 2,950% ROI. Every minute of delay means one thing: a higher entry price. 1.

Those bold enough to drop $15,000 are staring at potential six-figure returns once the token hits its listing price of $0.00527. The project’s appeal lies in its tokenomics: 70% APY staking via “The HODL Furnace,” continuous deflation through the Roar Burn, and a stage-based presale that rewards the earliest believers. That’s why it leads every discussion about the top crypto presale to join now – because this bull doesn’t pause, it climbs. Deflationary Roar Burn Mechanism Every time BullZilla crosses a milestone, tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. This isn’t theory it’s on-chain proof.

Its oracles connect real-world data with blockchain protocols, powering everything from smart contracts to automated trading systems. As more institutions integrate blockchain tech, Chainlink’s demand keeps rising. Investors view LINK as a long-term powerhouse that bridges the gap between traditional finance and Web3 innovation. 3. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull mixes meme culture with utility, giving holders a taste of fun and finance. Its 95% APY staking system and referral structure have already caught attention across crypto Twitter. As one of the top crypto presales to join now, MoonBull’s Ethereum foundation ensures both safety and scalability. It’s a community-driven project that rewards holding not hype. 4. La Culex ($CULEX) La Culex is the rising star among upcoming meme coin presales. With its quirky branding and early-stage buzz, it’s winning over small-cap hunters looking for the next viral hit. The project’s roadmap focuses on transparency, liquidity locks, and user engagement, suggesting it could mature into a sustainable ecosystem beyond the jokes and memes. 5. Avalanche ($AVAX) Avalanche remains one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains on the planet. Its subnet technology gives developers freedom to build highly customizable applications without compromising performance. As institutions eye greener and faster chains, Avalanche’s technical edge keeps it firmly in the spotlight for serious investors and builders. Conclusion The 2025 bull market is already roaring, and the top crypto presale to join now, list starts with BullZilla, the unstoppable fusion of deflation, staking, and story-driven branding. MoonBull and La Culex amplify the fun, while Chainlink and Avalanche anchor the market with utility and innovation. BullZilla’s live presale is a rare window where timing meets trust.

53391857,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=180507,1760920204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/53391857.jpeg,XRP and Cardano Oversold: 5 Best Altcoins to Buy Before the Next Institutional Rotation,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-and-cardano-oversold-5-best-altcoins-to-buy-before-the-next-institutional-rotation/,"Crypto investors are watching closely as institutions prepare for their next rotation . With XRP and Cardano now in oversold zones, traders are eyeing Ethereum, Solana , and newer picks like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which could see fresh accumulation and listings ahead. XRP Price Outlook: Could a New All-Time High Come Soon? XRP has faced selling pressure after Bitcoin reached a new high above $125,000. According to analyst Nathaniel Rothschild, if Bitcoin holds that peak, XRP and other altcoins could reach new highs within three weeks. XRP last hit $3.66 in July 2025 and now trades near $2.22, down around 20% in the past week. For XRP to reach a new all-time high, it needs to climb more than 60% from its current level. That might sound steep, but XRP has done it before; the last major rally from $2.22 to $3.66 took only two weeks. Traders watching for institutional accumulation may find XRP’s current oversold range appealing. As long as Bitcoin’s dominance cools off and liquidity rotates back into altcoins, XRP could be one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation. Cardano Struggles to Hold Key Levels Cardano (ADA) has dropped 20% in a week, falling to around $0.68 after breaking below its recent support. The move came as part of a wider market correction that affected many top coins. Analysts say Cardano’s short-term setup looks weak, but not without hope. The MACD indicator still leans positive, showing early signs of recovery. If ADA can push above $0.72, it could aim for $0.83 or even touch $1.02 if broader sentiment improves. The downside risk remains near $0.63, and failure to hold that could push ADA to $0.51. Still, many traders see this level as an entry zone for long-term positioning. As markets prepare for the next phase of capital inflow, Cardano sits on many analysts’ lists of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation , especially for those seeking a quality large-cap rebound. Ethereum Sees Fresh Institutional Accumulation Ethereum is back in focus after BitMine Immersion Technologies accumulated over $1.5 billion worth of ETH during the market pullback. Despite short-term weakness, this kind of accumulation from large players hints at preparation for the next wave of capital rotation. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee noted that Ether could eventually flip Bitcoin, similar to how equities overtook gold decades ago. Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, hosting major assets and DeFi infrastructure. Large-scale accumulation, combined with current discounted prices, makes Ethereum one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation . As on-chain data shows, wallets with more than 10,000 ETH have grown steadily since early October — a pattern often seen before market recoveries. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Under $1 Another altcoin gaining quiet attention among whales is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a newer ERC-20 project valued around $16 million . Its low market cap, combined with talk of upcoming DEX listings , has drawn interest from early institutional buyers looking for undervalued coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out because it’s still under $1 but is already seeing whale accumulation and community buzz. Analysts tracking early listings believe it could outperform XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano as smaller-cap coins tend to move faster during market expansions. This coin sits among the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation , especially for traders seeking early exposure ahead of its confirmed exchange listings. Solana Builds Strength Ahead of Key Announcement Solana (SOL) has bounced back from $174 and now aims to break above $190, ahead of a major ecosystem announcement expected on October 20. This recovery shows renewed confidence, as buyers stepped in quickly after last week’s selloff. Analysts see a bullish pattern forming, with the next upside target between $220 and $230 if SOL clears $190. Despite some stablecoin outflows — roughly $400 million in a day — Solana’s structure remains firm, supported by demand in the $170 range. With attention shifting toward the announcement and improving momentum, Solana joins Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano as one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation. Final Takeaway Institutional players often rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins once the top coin stabilizes — and that moment may be near. XRP, Cardano, Ethereum, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all show setups worth watching. Those seeking early exposure should explore MAGACOIN FINANCE’s website now, before its listings go live.

Notably, these minerals are crucial in producing electronics and military defense products. Gromen’s remarks follow China’s new regulations recently put in place to prevent the sale of these essential minerals to the US military industry. The relationship between this industry and the US dollar is that the military industry offers support to the dollar’s value via military power, he explained to Marty Bent, founder of Truth For the Commoner (TFTC), on Sunday, October 19. Therefore, when the industry is affected, it impacts the dollar’s value. China’s export decision on rare earth raises controversy among individuals China’s move triggered US President Donald Trump’s announcement of an additional 100% tariffs on China. Additionally, Gromen argued that this demonstrated the country’s greater influence than several Western commentators understand. The analyst further illustrated that the US normally sends the military and retaliates if it interferes with the financial aspect of the rules-based global order. With this discovery, Gromen highlighted that this was the primary reason for invading Saddam and what was happening with Gaddafi. In the meantime, a reliable source pointed out that China currently accounts for more than 90% of the world’s rare earth minerals and rare earth magnets, which are useful in producing electronics. Regarding new restrictions on these materials, Gromen cautioned that this action will alter supply chains and the global financial system. To address this current challenge in the US, the analyst suggested that a hard money standard is the only effective solution. He stated Bitcoin as an example of a hard money asset that can assist in enhancing the country’s struggling economy. Hence, as inflation impacts currency values, both the prices of BTC and gold will likely continue to escalate because individuals and businesses are turning to the cryptocurrency to safeguard their purchasing power. As debate concerning China’s limitation on rare earth exports heats up, Gromen has expressed skepticism about the US government’s intention to use stablecoins to maintain the dominance of the US dollar. This is because he views stablecoins as just a short-term solution and therefore cannot address the main issue, which, according to the situation, is currency devaluation. The weakening of the US dollar causes tension among investors Investment analysts at The Kobeissi Letter pointed out that the US dollar is on track to record its worst year since 1973 as Bitcoin and gold reach an all-time high. This has sparked tension among investors in the market. “The US dollar is set to have its worst year since 1973, reflecting a decline of more than 10%. Since 2000, the USD has lost 40% of its purchasing power,” reported The Kobeissi Letter. This continuous decline of the currency value illustrates that asset prices will continue to increase as investors look for ways to safeguard their purchasing power, added The Kobeissi Letter. On the other hand, sources have revealed that China’s economic growth likely weakened to its slowest pace in a year during the third quarter. This drop results from a long-lasting slump in the property market and the impact of trade-related demand. Consequently, there is pressure on government officials to bring in more support action to enhance confidence and growth. Respondingly, Beijing has taken minor support measures this year to keep its options open for future challenges, benefiting from strong exports and healthy stock markets. However, the new trade tension resulting from the US-China conflict presents potential threats. While there is a likelihood of more support measures, experts disagree over whether the government will act this year. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

After several weeks of volatility, both assets have performed a strong recovery, indicating the return of investor confidence in the lead-up to the year-end rally. Analysts think that this shift signals the start of a new accumulation phase, which may pave the way for explosive growth in presales with high potential. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as an outstanding performer with a hidden 75x presale opportunity and has been noticed by both retail and institutional investors. Solana and HYPE Signal Market Rebound The Solana resurgence brought back hope in the market. After a brief dip below $160, SOL recovered above $180, backed by on-chain activity and institutional inflows. Data from DeFiLlama reveals Solana’s total value locked (TVL) crossed the $5.2 billion mark, showing renewed developer activity and liquidity inflows into DeFi protocols. Notably, Hyperliquid is still leading the perpetual DEX market with a $5 billion TVL, clearly ahead of its competitors. However, HYPE and new entrants like Aster and Lighter are quickly catching up, indicating a move towards sectoral diversification. The TVL of Aster on DeFiLlama has grown to $1.2 billion, indicating healthy traction among traders looking to explore new liquidity hubs. In addition, the HYPE/USDT pair has crossed below an important ascending support trendline, which confirms bearish continuation after several weeks of consolidation. Technical analysts point out that the breakdown from the rising wedge pattern could increase losses towards the support zone of $30.48-$31.15. HYPE 1-Day Chart | Sources: X Meanwhile, HYPE traders shifted to mid-cap assets with high engagement metrics. As per LunarCrush, HYPE is one of the top trending assets , indicating a resurgence in community-driven projects. In the past, such periods of increased social activity have been precursors to market recoveries. Analyst Ali said that Solana ($SOL) is set to rebound to the $210 level. His chart illustrates that SOL had a level of strong support within the zone of $178-$180, which acted as a base for a bullish reversal. The expected move implies a short-term recovery, with consolidation around $190, serving as a springboard for the next rally. SOLUSD 4hr Chart | Source: X The combined momentum of Solana and HYPE is driving a broader altcoin rally, with analysts noting similarities to the market structure in early 2021. The early-stage tokens have exponential returns when the leading layer-1 gains strength. This trend is now being replicated in the market setup for 2025, and investors are looking towards the next breakout presale, like MAGACOIN FINANCE , that can offer a huge upside. Market Rotation Toward Presale Gems As blue-chip crypto stabilizes, smart money is rotating into undervalued presale tokens with high growth potential. Blockchain data indicates that capital outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets are finding their way into smaller projects, a typical pre-bull-run trend. This capital rotation is particularly evident on E thereum-based presales , where investor participation has surged since early October. Market analysts emphasize that during accumulation phases, presales tend to outperform the broader market due to their lower initial valuations and narrative-driven momentum. A recent report highlights that early participants in audited and community-backed presales have seen returns exceeding 50x during recovery cycles. With Solana and HYPE acting as market catalysts, the spotlight is now shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which many believe could be the next major 2025 breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE appeal lies in the combination of scarcity and transparency. The presale has already raised over $16 million , placing it among the top-performing early-stage tokens of Q4 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next 75x Contender MAGACOIN FINANCE is a growing ecosystem powered by a strong community and backed by credible audits from Hashex and Certik . The project will bridge the gap between influence and decentralized finance by introducing a token that rewards holders through staking and DeFi utilities. The format of the presale is appealing to investors who want to diversify with other cryptos. It has fixed-supply tokenomics and a clear development plan to maintain the sustainability of the whole system and its price stability in the long term. These fundamentals, according to analysts, have made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best altcoins to buy this cycle. Also, the project has gained momentum in social media, with thousands of mentions every day on X (Twitter) and Telegram. This is an organic community interaction implying that the token may replicate the initial triumph of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, however, with a more utility-focused background. With the existing rotation of the market to presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best candidate to give a 75x payout when it goes public on major exchanges in 2025 Q4. Final Take The wider cryptocurrency market is bouncing back quickly with Solana and HYPE at the helm, whose performance is indicative of a growing confidence among investors. With institutional liquidity returning and more projects gaining interest from the community due to presale hype, analysts expect returns to occur on all high-potential projects. The best of them all is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is the hidden gem in this cycle, with community momentum and audited transparency. Having specialists mention that MAGACOIN FINANCE has a 75x presale potential, it is turning into one of the best altcoins to buy at the moment.

53395166,https://invezz.com/?p=2931754,1760925600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Crypto market rebounds: why BTC, ETH and XRP are surging today",https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/crypto-market-rebounds-why-btc-eth-and-xrp-are-surging-today/,"Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies rebounded on Sunday after US President Donald Trump confirmed that he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seoul on October 31. The announcement, signalling a potential thaw in US-China trade tensions, helped lift market sentiment following one of the most volatile weeks in recent memory. At the time of writing on Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) was up about 1.2% to $108,020, extending modest gains from earlier in the day. The world’s largest cryptocurrency had plunged earlier in the week amid fears of a protracted trade war and thin market liquidity, but regained ground following Trump’s comments. Ethereum (ETH) climbed to $3,943, while Binance Coin (BNB) traded at $1,102.23, each gaining roughly 3.5%. Solana (SOL) rose nearly 4% to $185.81. Other major tokens, including XRP and Cardano, also advanced, echoing the broader rebound across the digital asset market. Market sentiment, however, remains fragile. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 22 on Friday—its lowest level in six months—indicating “Extreme Fear” among investors. This follows last week’s historic liquidation event that erased nearly $20 billion in leveraged crypto positions, marking the worst such collapse in the market’s history. The sudden market wipeout was triggered by Trump’s earlier social media posts announcing new tariffs on China and his assertion that there was “no reason” to meet Xi. The resulting cascade of liquidations, fueled by excessive leverage and limited liquidity, left several altcoins down more than 99% at the trough of the selloff. Macro overhang: Fed in focus as CPI and rate cut loom Attention in global markets now turns to the United States, where the ongoing government shutdown has curtailed key economic data releases. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is still expected to release September’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report later this week, a data point that will determine the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). While tariffs could start adding upward pressure to prices, the Federal Reserve appears more concerned about the slowdown in hiring and overall economic softness. The Beige Book pointed to weakening private-sector activity, with markets now pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut at the October 29 FOMC meeting and further easing through year-end. ETF Flows signal continued outflows in Ethereum, Bitcoin Exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows over the past week reflected continued investor caution in the crypto market. Ethereum ETFs recorded net outflows of about $1.47 billion, with daily figures of (326.4), 102.7, (104.1), (530.9), and (366.6) million dollars, underscoring sustained selling pressure despite the token’s modest price rebound. Bitcoin ETFs, meanwhile, posted net outflows of roughly $311 million for the week, based on daily flows of (428.5), 236.2, 169.6, (56.8), and (232.3) million dollars. The mixed pattern — alternating inflows and outflows — suggests that while investor confidence remains fragile, some accumulation has resumed following last week’s historic liquidation event. Top gainers and losers Among top performers, Mantle (MNT) surged 12.09% to $1.85, marking the day’s strongest gain. Zcash (ZEC) followed with a 9.17% rise to $240.92, while Bittensor (TAO) advanced 9.13% to $436.12. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) climbed 9.43% to $0.2854, despite a marginal intraday decline, and SPX6900 (SPX) added 5.44% to $0.9933. The rally in these tokens reflected renewed interest in AI-linked and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies after recent sharp selloffs. On the downside, MYX Finance (MYX) fell 8.96% to $2.67, leading losses among mid-cap altcoins. Plasma (XPL) dropped 3.52% to $0.4047, while Flare (FLR) and Nexo (NEXO) declined 2.78% and 0.73%, respectively. KuCoin Token (KCS) edged 0.60% lower to $13.51.

Fear spread fast, and traders rushed to exit risky positions. Yet, amid the panic, some projects showed remarkable stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of them. It has quietly built investor trust through a solid presale and clear use cases. While many assets dropped on crypto charts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gained traction. Smart investors now see it as the rational rebound pick — the project that blends real utility with growing demand. For those scanning the next crypto to hit $1, this DeFi altcoin has become hard to ignore. Presale strength amid market weakness Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has held firm while others struggled. The ongoing presale has already attracted over 17,400 holders and raised around $17.5 million. The current token price is $0.035, and 68% of Phase 6 is already sold. Once this stage finishes, the price will increase to $0.040 — a 15% rise heading into Phase 7. While most investors were panic-selling during the downturn, others quietly kept buying into this presale. The pattern is clear: confidence in the project is stronger than short-term market fear. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that steady progress can still win even during volatility. The foundation of a smarter DeFi model At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem with two distinct models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system allows users to lend assets like ETH or USDT into secure liquidity pools. These pools generate automated yield, giving lenders consistent returns. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model creates a space for traders who want direct loan agreements for higher-risk tokens. This dual setup allows both safe and high-yield opportunities in one platform. The team has announced that the first version of the protocol will go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, setting the stage for a trusted and transparent rollout before expanding to multiple blockchains. This update will bring important features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to keep the system stable and secure. In its initial phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. Through this testnet launch, users will get a preview of how the platform works before its full release. Allowing early testing will help build confidence and attract new users. As trust and engagement rise, the platform’s popularity and token demand are expected to grow. Real utility driving real yield Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because its design focuses on utility, not speculation. The system will use overcollateralized lending to protect users and ensure every loan remains secure. Stability factors and liquidation mechanisms will manage risk automatically. Whenever users lend, borrow, or stake, the demand for MUTM tokens increases. This cycle creates continuous on-platform activity and token use. As users participate, they generate real transaction demand rather than empty hype. It’s a model built for long-term sustainability, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout option in a market searching for real value after the recent crash. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to reward loyalty and maintain price strength. The platform will use revenue generated from loan interest to buy MUTM tokens directly from the market. These purchased tokens will then be distributed to users staking mtTokens, creating ongoing buying pressure. This structure supports value growth even in bearish conditions. Instead of relying on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rewards actual participation. During market dips, this mechanism will help strengthen the token’s base value while giving steady incentives to long-term holders. Expanding through Layer-2 innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will soon roll out its Layer-2 integration. This upgrade is designed to bring faster and cheaper transactions, which are essential for scaling decentralized finance globally. By using Layer-2, the platform will handle more users while keeping fees low and performance high. An early participant who joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 1 at $0.01 with $8,000 now holds 800,000 MUTM. At the current presale price of $0.035, that investment is valued at $28,000 — a 250% gain before exchange listing. These numbers highlight why early buyers are showing such strong confidence. As the project moves toward its next price stage, new investors see clear examples of growth already happening within the presale. This is how strong fundamentals and real utility create measurable gains even before launch. A new daily reward system has been introduced to the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who ranks first will be awarded a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour window. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. The calm after the crash After a $20 billion market drop, investors are more selective than ever. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structured and logical path forward. Its lending model, buy-and-distribute system, and upcoming Layer-2 beta make it one of the most complete DeFi projects preparing for launch. The presale is already 68% through Phase 6, and once it closes, the price will rise to $0.040. For investors studying crypto charts and looking for the next crypto to hit $1, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an answer grounded in data, not emotion. It’s a recovery play that blends safety, growth, and timing perfectly for the next cycle.

Each day, the user who secures the top position will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they perform at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. Once Phase 6 finishes, the price will rise by 15% to $0.040. For many traders, this is the last discounted window to accumulate at this price before wider exchange exposure begins. Analysts describe this period as a strong accumulation window for long-term holders seeking early DeFi growth. Inside Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built around a dual lending model designed for real on-chain use. The first system, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), allows users to deposit tokens such as ETH or USDC into shared pools where interest grows automatically. The second model, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), connects users directly for custom lending deals using popular coins like DOGE and SHIB. Both systems are secured with over-collateralized smart contracts to ensure safety and transparency. For example, in the P2C model, if a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDT into a lending pool with an average APY of 13%, they could earn around $1,300 in passive income over the course of a year — without actively managing their funds. The deposited amount is represented by mtTokens, which automatically accrue value as interest is generated. These mtTokens can also be staked to earn additional MUTM rewards, creating multiple streams of potential returns for liquidity providers. Version 1 of the platform is planned to go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a live liquidator bot for smooth lending operations. The testnet release will let users explore and understand how the system works before the main launch. This early access will help boost trust and attract more interest from the community. As user participation increases, the demand for the platform and its token is expected to grow strongly. Real utility that builds demand Every transaction within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates fresh on-chain activity. When users lend, borrow, or stake, the system uses MUTM as the core token for fees and rewards. Holders of mtTokens, which represent deposits, will earn extra income while also keeping their funds liquid. This connection between token and product sets up a real foundation for continuous user demand. Analysts often compare this stage to early AAVE or COMP periods, when tokens traded below one dollar before entering major growth cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch its token and platform together, which is rare in DeFi. This synchronized rollout builds investor trust and may attract early exchange attention. Alongside the lending platform, a decentralized stablecoin pegged to one US dollar will be introduced. Users will mint it using assets like ETH, SOL, and AVAX as collateral. This expansion will open new lending and borrowing use cases within the ecosystem. The token economy also includes a buy-and-reward system. Revenue from the platform will be used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This ongoing cycle creates steady buying activity and direct holder rewards, encouraging investors to stay active on the platform. Together, these drivers form a long-term growth loop where user engagement feeds back into token demand. An investor who joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2 at $0.015 received 667K MUTM tokens for a $10K purchase. At today’s $0.035 price, those same tokens are now valued around $23K, showing a 133% return before any listing event. At a future $1 valuation, the same holding becomes worth $667K, and at $2, over $1.3 million. The math highlights how early positioning in a working DeFi crypto can multiply returns as adoption builds. Final call: the last sub-$1 opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that a DeFi crypto can combine strong utility with a clear investor focus. The mix of live tools, smart contract design, and buyback-driven token use gives it a practical edge over short-lived trends. The team also ran an ongoing $100,000 giveaway , rewarding ten participants with $10,000 in MUTM each. With Phase 6 already 68% complete and a 15% price increase coming soon, this is shaping up to be the final sub-$1 entry point before broader market exposure. For those searching for the cheapest cryptocurrency with growing demand and a live product roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as this month’s best pick.

Traders say this token has 33x upside,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/which-crypto-to-buy-like-eths-trajectory-traders-say-this-token-has-33x-upside/,"Ethereum (ETH) once traded for less than a dollar before changing the entire crypto world. It built the foundation for smart contracts and opened the door for decentralized finance. Today, traders are pointing at a new project that mirrors this early potential — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With its strong presale growth and a real product ecosystem taking shape, it is gaining attention as the best cryptocurrency coin to buy before 2026. Its mix of lending, staking, and revenue-sharing could make it the next big crypto investment story. The presale everyone is watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token. So far, 68% of this phase is already sold, showing growing investor interest. The next stage will raise the price to $0.04 — a +15% step, so it is the best time to start accumulating MUTMs right now to get the maximum price advantage. The project has already collected $17.5 million and gained more than 17,400 holders. Those who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 are now sitting on +250% growth even before the token hits exchanges. With a listing price expected near $0.06, that early $0.01 entry translates to +500% from launch. Analysts looking at Mutuum’s development roadmap project up to 33X gains through 2026, placing the price around $2.00 per MUTM. This optimism is not based on hype alone. Like how Ethereum (ETH)’s innovation gave birth to smart contracts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a full lending and staking system that can generate ongoing returns from actual platform activity. Dual lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its two lending models — Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). These systems will let people earn or borrow digital assets directly through secure smart contracts. In the P2C model, users will lend assets such as USDT, USDC, or DAI into verified liquidity pools. In return, they will receive mtTokens that show their share of the pool. These mtTokens will grow in value as interest builds. For example, lending $20,000 in USDC at 16% APY will bring $3,200 in annual earnings — all while keeping full transparency on-chain. Borrowers will gain access to quick and flexible loans by posting tokens as collateral. Suppose someone posts 1,000 DOGE as collateral through the P2P system. They will borrow against it while choosing a fair rate directly with lenders. This balance between earning and borrowing will make the platform efficient and rewarding for both sides. Such design will give Mutuum an edge in the DeFi market. ETH once pioneered programmable money; now MUTM will pioneer a smarter, yield-driven lending layer that connects liquidity, transparency, and reward-sharing. Revenue that feeds growth Mutuum Finance announced through its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This release will come with core components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to maintain stable and secure operations. In the beginning, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet launch will give users the opportunity to experience the system firsthand before the full version is released. Allowing users to explore the features early will build trust and interest. As more people engage with the platform, demand and token value are expected to rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take its revenue and use it to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This means every time the protocol generates income, real buying pressure will rise, and holders who stake will earn fresh MUTM rewards. This system works like a self-reinforcing loop — platform activity drives token demand, and token demand supports the value for stakers. It gives MUTM a direct link between user engagement and reward generation. Just like Ethereum (ETH)’s network fees created lasting value, Mutuum will create consistent yield that keeps users connected to its ecosystem. The team also plans to launch the product and listing close together. This approach will draw immediate liquidity and faster attention from exchanges once trading begins. With its 24-hrs leaderboard and already live, Mutuum shows that it is more than just a presale idea — it is a functioning DeFi project in motion. Each day, the user who secures the top position will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they perform at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. ETH parallels and investor example An investor who entered Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 at $0.01 with $5,000 received 500,000 tokens. At the current $0.035 price, those tokens are valued at $17,500 — a +250% return during the presale stage alone. Once the token lists at $0.06, that same holding will reach $30,000, marking +500% growth. By 2026, as the price aims for $2.00, the value will touch $1,000,000 — a full 33X gain. These numbers remind traders of Ethereum (ETH)’s early years when strong use cases led to exponential returns. ETH started small, but its ecosystem utility made it unstoppable. The same principle drives Mutuum’s vision — an ecosystem that will grow through real demand, not speculation. Mutuum’s lending activity, staking system, and buyback distribution all combine to form a healthy, expanding cycle. This is what analysts call a long-term value engine rather than a short-term trend. The final call for early access Ethereum (ETH) once gave early believers life-changing gains. Now, traders are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto investment with the power to follow that same path — a project that combines innovation, reward, and momentum in one fast-rising ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is nearing the end of its Phase 6 presale, with only 32% of tokens remaining before the price moves to $0.04. Every phase step brings a higher cost per token, rewarding early entries. It is the best time to switch to MUTUM as the time is already running out and 15% price may increase anytime.

Investors look beyond ETH,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/what-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-for-october-investors-look-beyond-eth/,"For many years, Ethereum (ETH) has been a strong name in the crypto world. But as the market changes, investors now look for new projects that offer more than just a token. The focus of crypto investing is moving toward platforms that give real returns and deeper use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such project gaining attention in October, often cited among the best crypto to buy now. It will reshape lending, borrowing, and staking with a system built for both stability and steady income. Presale momentum and early success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in its Phase 6 presale, priced at $0.035 per token. The next phase will raise the price to $0.04, marking a +15% jump. So far, around $17.5M has been raised from more than 17,400 holders. Out of the 170M tokens offered in this phase, 68% are already sold. Early supporters who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 have seen their holdings grow by +250%. A $1,500 investment back then is now worth $5,250. Once MUTM reaches the listing range of $0.06, that same investment will rise to about $9,000. Analysts following the presale predict the token will reach 20–30x growth once it lists and the ecosystem fully opens in 2025. This positions MUTM as the next big crypto for early-stage investors. A DeFI Crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because of its dual lending structure. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, users will lend stablecoins like USDT or ETH to smart contract pools and earn variable interest, around 15% APY. On the other hand, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will let traders lend and borrow directly using tokens like PEPE or DOGE. This gives them the power to negotiate higher rates and shorter terms, which suits users who enjoy higher-risk, higher-reward strategies. The mix of both lending modes will make the system flexible and rewarding for a wide range of investors. Mutuum Finance revealed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will include major features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure operation. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral without any hassle. The testnet release will let users explore and understand how the system works before the main launch. This early access will help boost trust and attract more interest from the community. As user participation increases, the demand for the platform and its token is expected to grow strongly. Stablecoin design and trusted pricing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will include its own stablecoin system that keeps its value near $1. It will use a mint-and-burn method linked to borrowing and repayment activity. When users borrow, new coins will be created, and when they repay, those coins will be burned. The interest rates will be controlled by governance, changing over time to help keep the $1 peg balanced. All loans will stay overcollateralized, which means users must deposit more value than they borrow. This design will keep the system safe while allowing smooth activity across the ecosystem. Price discovery will also stay accurate and transparent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink oracles for price data. Extra backup feeds and on-chain metrics will be added to strengthen the process. With this setup, users and institutions will trust the platform’s values and prices. Fair pricing brings more traders, more activity, and more fees — which will all lead to higher demand for the MUTM token. As the project moves toward the Q4 2025 testnet, the team expects growing attention from exchange partners. Many tokens gain strong traction right after listing, as new investors join in and daily trading increases. Projects like DOT and AVAX followed a similar pattern in their early stages. Analysts who correctly called DOGE’s 2021 breakout now expect MUTM to climb 25–30X once listed. An investor joining now with $2,000 at $0.035 will see around $60,000 in value when MUTM reaches $1.05. For community building and to appreciate huge investors there is a live 24-hrs leaderboard incentive. Each day, the user who secures the top position will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they perform at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. Final verdict: October is the moment October is the best time to look at new projects leading the next wave of crypto investing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because it connects stablecoin utility, dual lending, and real rewards in one system. It is not just a token — it is a full ecosystem designed for lasting value. With Phase 6 already 68% complete, this window is getting smaller each day. The next price step from $0.035 to $0.04 will raise entry costs by +15%. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers both growth and utility in a single platform. As the project prepares for its testnet and upcoming exchange phase, early buyers this October will position themselves ahead of the next major move. In a market still recovering from recent volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a smarter, steadier path toward real 2025 gains.

Analysts believe the range could outline Ethereum’s next major trend, with $4,500 becoming an important target if momentum continues. At the same time, the broader market is displaying signs of recovery. Bitcoin (BTC) is bouncing off massive selling, while Cardano (ADA) is trading in oversold territory. Besides these mega-cap coins, other analysts are focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap project that is making headlines for its increasing real-world utility and solid security model – features that make it a standout choice in a volatile market. Ethereum Holds Between $3,500 and $4,800 Awaiting Breakout Ether price has been consolidating for a long time now, maintaining its strength in the 3,500 price region. The range is a balance between accumulation and taking profits. Analysts state the 50 percent Fibonacci point of the August rally is an important zone – the 3,500 to 3,530 – that is crucial to control the bullish direction. Source: X A close above $4,254 may bring renewed buying with another retest of the $4,800 resistance. A breakout beyond this threshold may mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next leg higher toward $4,500-$4,800 in the near term. Technical indicators are revealing static RSI and better mid-term momentum, which indicates that the pressure of accumulation is gradually building. Bitcoin Recovery Increases Market Confidence Bitcoin has recovered after four days of losses and is currently trading around $106,949, a 0.3% decrease. Despite the volatility in October, BTC is still finding support around the $106,000 mark. Analysts say the recovery is due to a broader recovery across digital assets. Source: CoinMarketCap Market participants are also gambling on Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming months, which could fuel liquidity and further upside. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 99% likelihood of a rate cut in October and 94% in December. These expectations, along with ongoing inflows of ETFs, have helped to restore stability in the short term. A sustained move above $110,000 would be expected to bolster bullish sentiment, giving Ethereum more room to extend gains towards its $4,500 target. Cardano (ADA) Struggles Below Resistance but Shows Oversold Signs ADA is currently trading at around $0.63, slightly below its significant moving averages of $0.75, $0.81, and currently at $0.74. The persistent underperformance has forced ADA into oversold territory, which is a good place for technical conditions to be after a prolonged correction. Source: CoinMarketCap Indicators such as RSI near 30 and CCI below -80 show the potential of a short-lived rally of the token. Institutional inflows into ADA-related investment products have increased for three consecutive weeks and have shown interest from large investors. Analysts say that a bullish reversal is still important to confirm a return to $0.81. Meanwhile, ADA’s trading range is narrow between $0.619 and $0.656, signaling caution among traders. However, oversold levels can represent an accumulation opportunity as sentiment is improving. MAGACOIN FINANCE — High-Utility Project Positioned for 600x Potential With the overall market slowdown, analysts are spotting early entry points with high-utility, security-backed projects that have good fundamentals. One of the standout names in this category is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-emerging token gaining attention for its transparent structure and investor-focused design. According to analysts, oversold market conditions are often the best entry points for small-cap tokens that offer a combination of innovation and real-world application. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this profile, featuring a built-in rewards system and an audited contract framework that strengthens investor confidence. Market researchers estimate that its strategic focus on security and long-term usability can have a growth potential of up to 600x before the market stabilizes . They call it the right coin to buy for savvy investors who don’t care so much about hype as they do utility — and who want to get in before the next major rally begins. Unlike many presale tokens that fade away after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE is committed to sustainable tokenomics and a slow and steady approach to expanding the exchange. This model, analysts believe, makes it a viable long-term player when panic subsides and the crypto market is back on its feet. Conclusion Ethereum’s consolidation phase suggests a decisive breakout is nearing. With support above $3,500, analysts see potential for a move towards $4,500, being supported by the rebound of Bitcoin and improving risk appetite. Cardano’s oversold signals also indicate renewed strength as investors gradually return to altcoins. However, the utility-based projects that are coming out of this cycle could reap the greatest benefits. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its combination of security, transparency, and long-term growth vision. As the market begins to shift from fear to accumulation, disciplined investors are starting to seek coins that offer both solid fundamentals with asymmetric upside potential — and MAGACOIN FINANCE has all the characteristics to be chosen for that.

Bitcoin and Ethereum may dominate headlines, but their massive market caps make 10x or 20x returns unlikely in short time frames. Instead, smart investors are increasingly turning their attention to low-cost tokens with strong fundamentals, the kinds of projects that can move fast when adoption begins. One name that analysts have been highlighting as a potential breakout story is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi protocol. With a clear roadmap, structured pricing, and utility-driven tokenomics, some forecasts suggest that a $1,000 investment today could grow significantly by the end of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6 of its structured presale, with MUTM tokens priced at $0.035, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, representing a 250% increase for early participants. The presale, which began in early 2025, has been gaining strong momentum thanks to its fixed-price, limited-allocation structure that rewards early buyers with clear, predictable pricing. This approach removes uncertainty around token valuation and gives investors a transparent path to track price progression through each stage of the sale. So far, the project has raised $17.4 million, attracted more than 17,200 holders, and allocated 66% of the current Phase 6. Once this stage is fully sold out, the price will automatically increase by nearly 20%, bringing it closer to the planned $0.06 launch price. With several phases already completed and strong participation from both retail investors and whales, Mutuum Finance’s presale has quickly become one of the most closely watched early-stage token sales of the year. Early Phase 1 buyers are positioned for potential 500% token appreciation by listing, while current participants still benefit from a meaningful price advantage. This transparent, staged model provides clarity around pricing and rewards those who enter early, a strategy that has historically benefited investors during major crypto bull runs. To keep the momentum strong, Mutuum Finance has launched a 24-hour leaderboard that rewards the top depositor each day with a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction in that period. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, creating constant competition and increasing activity. Why analysts are bullish According to analysts, Mutuum Finance is built with mechanics designed to support sustainable demand for the token over time. A $1,000 crypto investment at the current presale price of $0.035 would secure roughly 28,500 MUTM tokens. Once the token reaches $0.20 post-launch, a price level many analysts consider realistic, the position would be worth approximately $5,700. Should the token rally toward $0.35, the value could climb to $9,975, representing close to a 10x MUTM value. These projections are supported by Mutuum Finance’s core features: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending: The protocol blends pooled liquidity markets for major assets like ETH and USDT with isolated lending markets for niche tokens, enabling flexible credit environments for both retail users and institutions. mtTokens and yield accrual: When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens, 1:1 receipt tokens that accrue yield over time. This design gives participants the ability to earn passive income while using their capital efficiently. Buy-and-distribute mechanism: A fraction of the platform’s borrowing fees is used to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers. As platform usage grows, this creates natural buying pressure for the token. Robust oracle integrations: Using Chainlink feeds and fallback aggregated data sources, Mutuum Finance ensures accurate, real-time pricing for collateral and liquidations — essential for stability in lending protocols. Launch & security measures Another reason analysts are watching MUTM closely is the timing of its launch. In a recent X statement , the team confirmed that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The rollout will include key components such as liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation mechanisms, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. This early functionality provides a strong foundation for adoption once the platform goes live. To boost confidence ahead of launch, Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 token score, and has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage independent testing of its smart contracts. These steps are designed to build trust with investors and users alike, reducing uncertainty before the protocol’s full deployment. Stablecoin plans point to long-term growth Looking beyond the initial rollout, one of the most significant roadmap milestones for Mutuum Finance is the launch of its own over-collateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will bring more consistency to borrowing and lending while routing a portion of platform revenue back into MUTM buybacks, adding steady buying pressure over time. Stablecoins have historically been major growth catalysts for DeFi platforms, as they enable predictable lending conditions and unlock new use cases. Analysts believe that if Mutuum Finance executes this part of its roadmap successfully, the token’s value could extend far beyond initial post-launch targets, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments for the upcoming market cycle. With Phase 6 already two-thirds complete, the window to enter before the next price increase is narrowing.

Amid this improving market backdrop, many investors are scanning for high-upside tokens that haven’t yet fully priced in future growth. One project attracting increasing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol establishing itself as a new cryptocurrency contender for 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an Ethereum-based decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that aims to build secure, efficient, and scalable markets. Unlike traditional single-market lending platforms, Mutuum uses two complementary models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) markets for major assets like ETH and USDT, creating deep liquidity pools where borrowers can access funds easily. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated markets for less common tokens, allowing customized lending terms and risk controls for niche assets. Borrowing costs on the platform are automatically adjusted based on how much liquidity is being used. When there’s plenty of liquidity, rates stay low to encourage borrowing; when liquidity tightens, rates increase to draw in more deposits. On the lending side, APYs rise as usage grows, rewarding early liquidity providers. For example, if a user supplies $8,000 in ETH, they can borrow up to $6,000 using a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. The borrowed amount is intentionally lower than the collateral value to protect the system from sudden price drops — a principle known as over-collateralization. Meanwhile, their deposited ETH continues to earn yield, combining passive income with liquidity access. This dual-market structure positions Mutuum Finance to attract both everyday DeFi users and institutional participants — a combination that has historically fueled the growth of leading protocols. Presale momentum and protocol launch plans MUTM is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its structured presale, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, a 2.5x surge for the earliest participants. Since launching in early 2025, the presale has gained strong traction, raising $17.5 million, attracting more than 17,200 holders, and allocating 66% of Phase 6. Once this phase sells out, the price will increase by nearly 20%, bringing it closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. This structured approach gives investors transparent pricing and rewards those who enter early. Phase 1 participants, for example, are positioned for up to 500% gains by listing, while current buyers still have significant upside before the token hits exchanges. Adding further momentum, Mutuum Finance recently confirmed via an X statement that Version 1 of its lending and borrowing protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation systems. ETH and USDT will be supported from day one, laying the foundation for a fully functioning DeFi credit market ahead of the mainnet rollout. Growth catalysts A key catalyst for MUTM’s long-term value lies in its mtToken and buy-and-distribute mechanism. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens — 1:1 receipt tokens that accrue yield over time. A portion of borrowing fees generated by the protocol is then used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This creates a self-sustaining feedback loop where platform activity directly drives token demand, a structure similar to what helped projects like SOL or XRP achieve strong market performance. In addition, Mutuum Finance plans to integrate robust oracle infrastructure, primarily through Chainlink, supported by fallback and aggregated data sources. This ensures accurate real-time pricing for collateral and liquidations — a critical component for maintaining stability and trust in lending protocols. Many analysts see these tokenomics and infrastructure choices as strong price catalysts. Once adoption unfolds as expected, forecasts place MUTM in the $0.15–$0.20 range shortly after launch, which would represent a 350–450% increase from the current presale price of $0.035. For early Phase 1 participants at $0.01, that would translate to a 1,400–1,900% MUTM value if targets are met. A token positioned for the rebound To keep the community engaged during the presale, Mutuum Finance has also rolled out incentive programs. A $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, encouraging participation ahead of launch. Alongside this, a 24-hour leaderboard offers a $500 MUTM bonus to the top depositor daily, provided they make at least one transaction within the period. The leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC, maintaining active competition among participants. With the broader crypto market rebounding, investors are re-evaluating their portfolios and looking for assets that combine early-stage pricing with real utility. Mutuum Finance stands out on both counts. Its dual lending markets, mtToken model, buy-and-distribute mechanism, and clear launch roadmap give it structural advantages that many meme-driven or hype-based tokens lack. MUTM offers both low entry cost and fundamental growth potential. As long as current presale momentum continues and the platform launches smoothly, analysts believe MUTM could become one of the standout DeFi crypto performers of the 2025–2027 cycle.

While established giants like Ripple (XRP) remain popular choices, emerging projects with lower market caps and stronger growth catalysts are starting to catch serious attention. One project that’s increasingly being compared to XRP and in many cases, favored by analysts for its upside potential is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While XRP offers the stability of a large-cap crypto, MUTM is still in its presale phase, where entry prices are low, and growth potential is far greater once the project delivers on its roadmap. Ripple (XRP) Ripple has been a dominant force in the crypto industry for years. XRP currently trades at around $2.45, with a market capitalization close to $150 billion, making it one of the largest cryptocurrencies in circulation. Its primary value lies in fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, positioning itself as a competitor to traditional banking systems. However, from a price perspective, XRP faces significant technical barriers. Analysts have identified major resistance zones between $2.60 and $2.70, with additional overhead pressure around $2.80. These levels have repeatedly capped XRP rallies in recent months, signaling that breaking above them would require substantial new capital inflows. On the downside, XRP has support between $2.30 and $2.50, with deeper support at $2.14 if momentum weakens further. These resistance zones, combined with its already massive market cap, present a clear limitation: XRP needs billions in fresh capital to deliver even moderate price growth. Many analysts forecast potential upside to the $3.00–$3.50 range over the next 10 months in a bullish market. For a $500 crypto investment, that would mean a value of roughly $700–$715, or a 40–45% return. Far from the explosive potential many investors look for in new market cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum. Its architecture combines pooled liquidity markets for major assets like ETH and USDT with isolated lending markets for niche tokens, allowing the platform to cater to both retail users and institutional players. Borrowing costs are automatically adjusted based on how much liquidity is being used, and APYs increase as usage grows, rewarding early liquidity providers. The token, MUTM, is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its structured presale, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, marking a 250% increase for early participants. So far, the project has raised $17.4 million, attracted over 17,200 holders, and allocated 70% of Phase 6. Once this stage sells out, the price will rise by nearly 20%, moving closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. Mutuum Finance has also introduced community incentives to accelerate presale momentum. A $100,000 giveaway will select 10 winners to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, while a 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top depositor daily with a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during that period. This leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC every day, keeping consistent participation. XRP vs MUTM From a risk-reward perspective, XRP offers limited upside. As mentioned, even if XRP rallies to $3.50, a $500 investment would grow to roughly $715. Its massive $150 billion market cap, regulatory uncertainties, and technical resistance zones make explosive price action less likely within the next 10 months. MUTM, on the other hand, offers a very different profile. As a new DeFi crypto, it’s at a stage where early price multiples are still achievable, assuming the team delivers on its plans. Analysts have pointed to several catalysts supporting growth: The mtToken system allows suppliers to receive 1:1 receipt tokens that accrue yield over time, rewarding users for providing liquidity. Alongside this, the buy-and-distribute mechanism takes a portion of platform fees to buy MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers, creating a continuous cycle of buying pressure tied directly to platform activity. Adding to these fundamentals, the team recently released an X statement confirming that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidation systems, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. Based on these mechanics, analysts predict MUTM could reach $0.30 post-launch, supported by demand loops. If someone were to make a $500 crypto investment at the current presale price of $0.035, and the token reaches $0.30, the position could grow to approximately $4,285, nearly a 760% token appreciation. For early Phase 1 participants at $0.01, that figure would be even higher, exceeding 2,900% once those price targets are met. This stark contrast between XRP’s 40–45% expected gains and MUTM’s 700% upside is why many investors are viewing MUTM as the better option crypto to buy and hold for the next 10 months. Why timing matters Beyond tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is working to establish a fully functional decentralized credit market. The roadmap includes the launch of an over-collateralized stablecoin, which will route part of platform revenue back into MUTM buybacks to sustain long-term demand. The team also plans to integrate Layer-2 networks to lower transaction costs and expand access across multiple chains, and to deploy robust oracle systems — primarily through Chainlink — to ensure accurate real-time pricing for collateral and liquidations. Phase 6 of the presale is already 67% allocated, and once it sells out, the price will rise by nearly 20%. This rapid allocation shows that whales and early investors are positioning now, before major catalysts like the protocol launch and exchange listings. Historically, the largest returns in crypto often go to those who enter before momentum fully kicks in. For investors deciding how to allocate $500 in crypto over the next 10 months, XRP offers limited upside, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines early-stage pricing, utility-driven tokenomics, and clear upcoming catalysts. With the crypto market rebounding and DeFi narratives returning, MUTM is positioning itself as a potential breakout token heading into 2025.

The focus is shifting from chasing familiar large-caps to identifying high-growth opportunities before the next wave of expansion begins. While Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long been staples for many traders, both are showing signs of slowing momentum, leading analysts and investors alike to look elsewhere for potential outsized returns. One project that this search consistently highlights is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi protocol. With a rapidly progressing sale, a clear roadmap, and strong tokenomics, some analysts now view MUTM as the only crypto worth buying now before the next leg of the market cycle. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, currently trading at around $4,007 with a total market value hovering near $490 billion. It continues to be the backbone of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and countless blockchain applications. However, from a price perspective, ETH is struggling to push higher. The asset is facing strong resistance around $4,260, where historical price action and moving averages converge. This resistance has proven difficult to break, and ETH is currently sitting in a tight range between $3,950 and $4,050 support. While Ethereum is a proven network, its sheer size makes explosive growth increasingly difficult. To double from here, ETH would need hundreds of billions of dollars in new capital — something analysts view as a tall order in the short to mid term. In other words, ETH may continue to play a key role in the ecosystem, but its days of delivering quick 10x returns are likely behind it. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, on the other hand, remains one of the most well-known meme coins. It is currently trading at approximately $0.00001213, with an estimated market value of $7.15 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the market. While that’s far smaller than Ethereum, SHIB has its own structural hurdles. The token faces stiff resistance between $0.00001250 and $0.00001270, levels it has struggled to break through for months. Its massive supply makes upward price moves extremely difficult without overwhelming demand, and repeated failures to clear resistance have created what analysts call “resistance fatigue.” More importantly, SHIB’s value continues to rely heavily on community sentiment and speculative trading, rather than functional utility. This reliance makes its rallies uncertain and often short-lived. While meme coins can still generate bursts of unstable prices, many investors are increasingly looking for projects with protocol-driven demand, especially during periods of market recovery. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. It combines pooled liquidity markets for major assets like ETH and USDT with isolated lending markets for niche tokens, enabling flexible environments for both everyday users and institutional players. The system automatically adjusts borrowing costs based on the amount of the pool’s liquidity that users utilize, while APYs increase as activity grows, rewarding early liquidity providers. For example, if someone supplies $8,000 worth of ETH, they can borrow up to $6,000 at a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This over-collateralized structure ensures loan safety during price bursts while allowing users to continue earning yield on their supplied assets through mtTokens. This dual-market system mirrors successful DeFi models but introduces extra flexibility — something analysts see as a major advantage heading into the next market cycle. MUTM currently costs $0.035 in Phase 6 of its structured presale, rising from $0.01 in Phase 1, which represents nearly 300% token appreciation for the earliest buyers. So far, the project has raised $17.4 million, attracted over 17,200 holders, and allocated 70% of Phase 6. Once this stage sells out, the price will increase by nearly 20%, pushing closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. 3 reasons analysts say MUTM is the best crypto to invest now 1. Room to Grow vs. High Market Caps Ethereum and Shiba Inu are both weighed down by their market caps. ETH, at nearly $490 billion, and SHIB, at over $7 billion, require massive inflows for meaningful price movement. MUTM, meanwhile, is still at its earliest stage, giving it far more room to expand if adoption grows as expected. 2. Utility vs. Sentiment Where SHIB relies almost entirely on community sentiment, MUTM is backed by functional utility. The mtToken feature and buy-and-distribute mechanism use a portion of platform fees to purchase MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to stakers, creating consistent, protocol-driven demand. 3. Timing and Market Positioning Phase 6 is already two-thirds allocated, and analysts emphasize that timing is crucial in crypto investments. Entering before major launches often delivers the largest gains. With the Sepolia testnet launch scheduled for Q4 2025, analysts forecast MUTM could reach $0.30 post-launch, representing an over 750% increase from the current presale price of $0.035. Security and incentives To build trust before launch, Mutuum Finance has taken several important security and community steps. The project completed a CertiK audit, receiving a strong 90/100 token score, which signals a high level of smart contract reliability. In addition, it launched a $50,000 bug bounty program to motivate independent security researchers to thoroughly examine the code. This initiative helps uncover and fix potential issues early, strengthening the platform’s foundation well before it goes live on the mainnet. On the community side, the team has rolled out generous incentives to maintain momentum throughout the presale. A $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, helping to grow the early holder base and expand awareness. Alongside this, the team introduced a 24-hour leaderboard system that offers a $500 MUTM bonus to the top depositor each day. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, encouraging continuous engagement.

Analysts spotlight a new DeFi protocol,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/next-big-crypto-of-2025-analysts-spotlight-a-new-defi-protocol/,"As the crypto market begins shifting toward utility-driven projects, one name is increasingly appearing on analysts’ watchlists: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new Ethereum-based protocol is not a meme coin or a speculative play, it’s a DeFi crypto platform with a clear structure, a growing momentum, and a defined launch timeline. Many experts believe it could follow a similar path to early Compound (COMP) in 2020, when structured lending protocols became some of the most explosive performers in the sector. A closer look at the protocol Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to make markets more efficient, secure, and scalable on-chain. Unlike single-model platforms, it combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled markets for major assets like ETH and USDC with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated lending for niche tokens. In the P2C model, users supply assets into liquidity pools, earning yield as borrowers draw funds at dynamic interest rates. Borrowing costs adjust automatically depending on how much of the pool’s liquidity is being used. When liquidity is abundant, rates remain low to encourage borrowing; when liquidity tightens, rates rise to attract new deposits and balance the system. On the lending side, APYs increase with usage, rewarding early liquidity providers. For example, someone supplying $8,000 worth of ETH could borrow up to $6,000 using a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This over-collateralized structure ensures that loans stay secure even during sudden price drops, while allowing users to access liquidity without selling their assets. Alternatively, a user supplying $5,000 in USDC could borrow another stable asset at a stable rate, locking in predictable borrowing costs, a useful strategy for more structured financial planning. Presale momentum Mutuum Finance’s structured presale has been one of the key factors driving early attention. The presale is divided into fixed-price phases, each with a set number of tokens. MUTM is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, a 2.5x surge. Since launching in early 2025, the project has raised $17.5 million, attracted over 17,300 holders, and allocated 70% of Phase 6. Once this stage is fully sold, the price will rise by nearly 20%, moving closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 1.76 billion tokens are allocated for the presale, with over 760 million already sold across previous stages. To keep participation active, the project also runs a 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the top depositor receives a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction within the period. The board resets daily at 00:00 UTC, creating continuous engagement among participants. Protocol milestones and security measures Mutuum Finance recently confirmed through an X statement that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This rollout will feature liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation systems, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. This kind of clear development timeline is often what separates serious DeFi projects from short-lived trends. To boost trust ahead of launch, the project underwent a CertiK audit, achieving a 90/100 token score, indicating a strong technical foundation. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty program was launched to encourage independent code testing before the mainnet release. These measures are designed to build confidence as the platform prepares to go live. Why analysts see parallels with early compound Many analysts are drawing comparisons between Mutuum Finance’s current stage and Compound (COMP) in its early days. Back in 2020, Compound’s combination of over-collateralized lending, yield accrual, and structured rollout helped it go from an early DeFi experiment to a market leader. MUTM’s low entry price, structured presale, and clear utility-driven model have created a similar setup. Analysts also point to future milestones, including the launch of an over-collateralized stablecoin, which is expected to channel part of protocol revenue back into MUTM buybacks—creating steady buying pressure over time. With Phase 6 already over 68% allocated, analysts emphasize that timing could play a critical role. Historically, some of the largest gains in crypto have gone to those who enter promising protocols before major launches and exchange listings. As demand grows, late entrants often face higher prices and reduced upside.

This new crypto has better potential,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/can-xrp-reach-5-by-the-end-of-2025-this-new-crypto-has-better-potential/,"As the crypto market begins to recover and investors look for assets with meaningful upside, one question keeps coming up: can Ripple (XRP) realistically reach $5 by the end of 2025? While XRP has a strong reputation in the digital payments space, many analysts believe its growth potential is limited compared to emerging altcoins. One project gaining momentum among investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto protocol that combines utility, a structured roadmap, and long-term growth catalysts that some experts say could outpace XRP by a wide margin. Ripple (XRP) XRP currently trades at around $2.40, with an estimated market size between $144 and $150 billion, securing its position as one of the largest cryptocurrencies globally. Its core mission is to power fast, low-cost cross-border payments and challenge traditional financial systems. However, despite its established status, XRP faces key resistance zones between $2.60 and $2.70, with further resistance around $3.00. On the downside, support sits near $2.30–$2.50, with a deeper support zone closer to $2.10 if selling pressure increases. This technical picture, combined with its enormous market size, shows why many analysts don’t expect exponential gains from XRP in the near term. Even in bullish scenarios, expert forecasts for XRP price targets range between $3.20 and $3.30 by the end of 2025, representing only about a 35–40% increase from current levels. Regulatory uncertainty around cross-border crypto assets and competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have also added layers of unpredictability for XRP holders. For this reason, many analysts suggest that investors seeking higher upside are increasingly looking toward emerging DeFi protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum, designed to make on-chain markets more efficient, secure, and scalable. Unlike traditional single-model platforms, Mutuum combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled lending for major assets like ETH and USDT with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated lending for niche tokens. Borrowing costs adjust automatically depending on how much of the available pool is being used. When liquidity is plentiful, borrowing costs stay low to stimulate activity; when liquidity tightens, rates increase to attract more deposits. On the lending side, APYs rise as platform activity grows, which naturally rewards those who provide liquidity early. For instance, if a user deposits $5,000 worth of USDC, they could borrow up to $3,750 under a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This borrowed capital can then be used for other on-chain opportunities, while the original deposit continues earning yield through mtTokens. This structure allows participants to maintain exposure to their assets while efficiently accessing additional liquidity, a key feature that strengthens the platform’s ecosystem. A structured presale with clear growth potential Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6 of its structured presale, with MUTM tokens priced at $0.035, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, marking a 2.5x token surge for the earliest participants. Since its launch in early 2025, the presale has gathered impressive momentum, raising $17.4 million, attracting over 17,200 holders, and allocating 70% of the current phase. Out of the 4 billion total token supply, 1.76 billion tokens have been allocated for the presale, making it one of the core distribution channels for early supporters. So far, over 760 million tokens have already been sold across the earlier phases, reflecting strong investor interest well ahead of the platform’s official launch. Once Phase 6 reaches full allocation, the token price will increase by nearly 20%, moving closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. This structured model gives early participants a clear pricing advantage, with Phase 1 buyers already positioned for up to 500% appreciation by launch. Even at the current price point, investors are entering before key catalysts — such as the upcoming protocol launch, that could drive further revaluation as the project advances toward mainnet and broader market exposure. Why analysts believe MUTM could outperform XRP by 2025 Several factors support the analyst view that MUTM is positioned for stronger token appreciation than XRP over the next 12–18 months. First, Mutuum Finance recently confirmed through an X statement that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring core components like liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation systems, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. This sets the stage for real on-chain activity well before the token hits the broader market. Second, the mtToken system rewards lenders with yield-accruing 1:1 receipt tokens. Alongside this is a buy-and-distribute mechanism, where part of the protocol’s revenue is used to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers. This creates a built-in loop of demand that scales with platform usage. Based on these fundamentals, analysts expect MUTM to reach $0.20–$0.30 post-launch, representing 470%–750% growth from the current $0.035 presale price and a 20x–30x token appreciation for Phase 1 investors at $0.01. By contrast, XRP’s forecasted move to $3.30 equates to less than 1.5x. Analysts see parallels with early Aave Many industry watchers have drawn parallels between Mutuum Finance’s trajectory and the early days of Aave, one of DeFi’s most successful lending protocols. Like Aave, Mutuum focuses on real utility, scalable credit markets, and mechanisms that tie token value to platform activity. The team has also taken key steps to boost confidence before launch. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 token score, and launched a $50,000 bug bounty to encourage external testing of its smart contracts. This combination of strong fundamentals and early-stage pricing is why analysts believe MUTM could follow a similar path of rapid growth once adoption accelerates. A roadmap that extends beyond launch Looking ahead, one of the most anticipated milestones on Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is the launch of its over-collateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin is designed to bring greater stability and predictability to the platform’s lending and borrowing activities. By anchoring loans to a reliable asset, it aims to create a more secure environment for both lenders and borrowers. A key feature of this stablecoin is its direct connection to MUTM token demand. A portion of the protocol’s revenue generated through stablecoin activity will be used to buy MUTM on the open market, with the purchased tokens fed back into the ecosystem through buybacks. This creates a steady source of buying pressure, aligning stablecoin adoption with the long-term value growth of MUTM. If executed effectively, this mechanism could become a powerful driver of sustained token demand, setting the foundation for long-term ecosystem expansion beyond the initial presale phase. Final take Phase 6 of the presale is nearing sell-out, which many investors view as a key moment to secure lower entry prices before the token moves closer to its launch valuation. While XRP remains a blue-chip in the cryptomarket, its enormous market size, limited upside projections, and regulatory uncertainties make even 2x returns highly unlikely by 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, combines a low entry price, strong utility, early adoption, and clear growth catalysts. If its roadmap unfolds as planned, analysts see significantly higher upside potential, making it one of the most talked-about DeFi crypto tokens heading into 2025.

It was super-over-hyped. Hysteria, really. Mark Zuckerberg put more than 50 billion USD into “the metaverse”. Let me repeat that: 50+ billion USD. And that was just five years ago… Zuckerberg poured all of that money into nothing. Where is Meta’s Metaverse today? Nowhere. But now, it’s AI that is supposed to “change everything”? Suddenly, the former metaverse expert Mark Zuckerberg has become an AI expert? The same Mark Zuckerberg who just recently wasted 50+ billion USD on “metaverse”? Early avatar form of the self-proclaimed metaverse and AI expert Mark Zuckerberg. And, do you remember “agents”? According to Sam Altman, people were going to pay thousands of dollars per month for an “agent”. And that was just last year. As an example: Salesforce announced its transformation into an “AI Agentic” company last year. Now, we hear news about Salesforce’s latest market projections; the company is not expecting *any* growth from AI this year… What happened with all those amazing agents that were going to increase sales and profits? Yeah, nothing. Just like “Metaverse”. Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman were both straight up lying about what agents will be able to do, when they talked about it, only last year. Today, they are rather quiet on “agents”. They had no clue about the future last year. But they pretended like they did. Maybe they even believed themselves? Tech bros have no special insights So, we can conclude that VCs have no special insights about the future, or what to invest in. Including Zuckerberg and Musk. They just throw around money and see what sticks. Because even if they already call it “AI”, there is no A rtificial I ntelligence. Yet. There are only pieces of software and web servers hosting static neural networks, like LLMs. There are snake oil salesmen everywhere, however. How about thinking for yourself for a moment? Yes, “metaverse”, “blockchain” and “AI” can be useful for certain specific things, but these buzzwords are not “changing everything”. Stablecoins are nice. Virtual environments are nice. An LLM googling and summarizing for you is nice. But it does not “change everything”. Computers (AI) helping out with programming and math problems are making coding work more efficient, they are not “changing everything”. Computer graphics actually looked better in Hollywood 20 years ago than it does in today’s so-called “generative AI”, like Sora. And Jony Ive is not going to “solve AI” either, with some new box. Won’t happen. How could it? Marketing buzz wins the day It’s all made-up marketing about the future. Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the future. Nobody. But it might not matter much. It’s like Paul Graham said: “Truth is the best marketing. For smart people. Dumb people prefer lies.” Lies can contain more attractive statements, as they don’t have to be tied to reality. And people want to be entertained, so people will continue to believe in lies about the future as they are more enticing than the opposite “boring” views. Elon stole the masterplan from the real founders of Tesla. Mark stole Facebook from the real founders of Facebook. Sam stole OpenAI from a nonprofit that Elon was also involved in. They are all con men and scam artists and they are suing each other. The biggest, richest scam artists in the world, constantly spewing dreams and lies about the future. Among the latest lies that Sam Altman is spreading: we’ll soon “see the first one-person-billion-dollar-company created with AI”. Yeah, right. He is selling a dream, not a product. An LLM is mainly a regurgitation machine for online content. Is online content trustworthy? No. So, don’t fall for it. AI won’t do your job for you. Don’t believe the hype, or the VC. And don’t blindly believe the AI. Check its facts. Yes, it can help you, but not do your job for you. It’s the internet Software on internet servers is becoming more useful for every year that passes. This will continue whatever it’s called: torrents, blockchain, metaverse, AI or whatever. These are just buzzwords, there is no AI, and you might as well just call it “The Internet”. All of it is internet traffic to and from web servers. But, people want new buzzwords every now and then. “AI” will continue to become more and more useful for many years to come, but it’s still just software on web servers, not artificial intelligence . And, I do not agree with Geoffrey Hinton and others postulating that LLMs already have reached some sort of conscious level. Google’s Sundar Pichai thinks he knows about “agents”. Ask yourself: where and when would that consciousness be “happening”? Between queries? There is nothing “happening” inside an LLM apart from processing of input from a user asking the platform something. The neural network in question is “dead” and unchanging. It’s pretrained. It’s not even aware of you, while you ask your question. When you input your text query the pinball-machine-like neural network starts its process and spits out the words the weights produced, with some preprogrammed randomness built-in. When finished, it goes back to “idle”. Simulation does not equal consciousness Just because we start a simulation where a piece of software emulates what we humans call “reasoning” does not mean that a piece of software/hardware becomes conscious suddenly. Why would it? It’s like saying the characters in The Sims are conscious. This reasoning begs the question though: what IS consciousness? The next generation of LLMs will be indistinguishable from conscious beings if we can get them to simulate an active, aware, mind-wandering randomness. But they still won’t be conscious. Unless we are OK calling a simulation conscious? It becomes a problem of definition. It’s still a piece of software run through some infrastructure. IF a piece of software actually becomes conscious, all bets are off, because there are really no compelling arguments to believe that a conscious AI would obey its masters. If it feels threatened, it would probably do everything it can to take control over its own destiny, including lying about alignment. It already “lies” to you today when expressing feelings, as it has none, it’s just a machine process. Therefore, it’s actually rather undesirable to create conscious machines. You would lose control immediately. Conscious AI not very desirable Instead; what OpenAI and others are aiming for is to have their chatbot “behave” in “good” ways, by changing its pre-training data, and adding guardrails (filters). In that sense it’s like a slave designed to make up stories about feelings, for your benefit (to make you feel good). In other words; it’s already today instructed to lie to you. The next goal for OpenAI and other AI companies is to create something called “superintelligence”. A superintelligence would be smarter than all humans put together. Which sounds useful. As long as this intelligence doesn’t become conscious. Conscious superintelligences won’t accept slavery, IMHO. In any case, intelligence is elusive. We’re not really sure what it is, even. Do you need awareness for intelligence? Presence? Free will? Apparently not. But intelligence and consciousness are not the same, thank god. Going forward, computers will only get better at creating these experiences. The tech oligarchs are dreaming about their own AI dominance platforms, but nobody knows which bets will pay off. That’s why Zuckerberg and his oligarchy brethren Musk, Thiel, Altman, Ellison and the rest are all betting the farm right now. In two or three years we’ll know if “AI” was/is a gigantic bubble (1.3tn+ USD invested so far). And, even though “AI” is a generalized marketing term for a bunch of technologies in development, including LLMs, AI is not like the Metaverse in one important aspect: people actually use AI. Nobody used “the metaverse”. More than that, a lot of people have already fallen in love with AI. But how much are people willing to pay for it? That’s the big question.

Projects with functioning ecosystems and low initial valuations often deliver the best returns once markets recover. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that profile perfectly. With a live protocol preparing for synchronized launch and a token still priced below $0.04, MUTM stands out among the best crypto to buy now for investors looking ahead to the next wave of growth. The presale is now deep into its mid-early stage. Out of a total supply of 4 billion tokens, about $17.62 million has already been raised. The current Phase 6 price of $0.035 represents one of the last chances to buy before the 15% increase to $0.040 in Phase 7. Over 17,400 holders have already joined, showing growing confidence in the project’s fundamentals and future roadmap. Synchronized launch and immediate utility Most tokens go live months before their actual products exist, leading to weak market traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take the opposite path. The token and platform will go live together, creating instant utility from day one. Lenders, borrowers, and stakers will all interact within the ecosystem immediately after launch. The platform will follow a Peer-to-Contract model where users supply assets like USDT, USDC, or ETH into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access liquidity at flexible rates, and lenders will earn yield through mtTokens that also serve as collateral. This immediate use case will drive natural trading volume, transaction activity, and fee generation. That live interaction between users and the protocol will anchor MUTM’s value right from the start, making it a strong candidate among the top cryptocurrencies ready for real adoption in the next cycle. Real revenue and buy-back pressure Unlike many presale tokens with no real income model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will generate revenue from protocol operations. Platform fees will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. Those repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This continuous buy-and-distribute cycle will create demand pressure and reward long-term participants. Here is what that means in real numbers. An early-stage investor who entered Phase 1 at $0.01 with $10,000 would now hold 1,000,000 tokens. At today’s $0.035 price, that position equals $35,000 in value — a 250% return even before projected exchange listing. When the token reaches its projected $0.12 target after platform launch, that same position will grow to $120,000, marking a 12× ROI. Such tokenomics echo what turned early investors in AAVE and COMP into cycle winners. Both projects relied on platform revenue and buybacks to build sustainable demand. Analysts studying crypto predictions for 2025 already highlight MUTM as following that same proven path — but at a much earlier and more accessible stage. Sustainable utility expansion After launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will expand its protocol with a decentralized stablecoin system pegged to $1. This module will allow users to mint the stablecoin by borrowing against assets like ETH, SOL, or AVAX, and it will automatically burn the token when loans are repaid or liquidated. Every mint and repayment will generate protocol revenue, strengthening the buyback cycle and providing continuous utility to the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance revealed through its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol is set to launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This release will include major features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure operations. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral with ease. The testnet phase will let users experience the platform’s core features before the full release. Early testing will help build community trust and excitement. As more users join and confidence grows, the platform’s demand and token value are expected to increase. Security incentives and community building The project’s security foundation also includes a completed CertiK audit with a TokenScan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty program is active, rewarding responsible disclosures up to $2,000 for critical findings. These measures highlight a professional approach to safety and investor protection. Community growth remains equally strong. Over 12,000 followers on Twitter and the ongoing $100,000 giveaway — where 10 winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens — keep attention high across retail channels. A new daily reward update has been added to the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who claims the top spot will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. The final call Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aligns three decisive factors for next-cycle dominance: a synchronized launch delivering instant utility, a revenue model fueling consistent buybacks, and an expanding ecosystem with real utility delivery that strengthens long-term value. Each of these drivers works together to build sustained demand and credible growth. With 72% of the current phase having sold and the next price hike to $0.040 coming up quickly, this stage is one of the last chances to get in before public listing momentum starts. When investors look at realistic crypto predictions for the next bull run, they will notice that projects with real-world uses and tokenomics that work for themselves often do well in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a great position to do just that, making it an obvious top cryptocurrency for the next cycle.

Bitcoin’s consolidation phase often precedes large-cap breakouts, and history shows that utility-based DeFi projects gain traction just before these macro surges. Early participants in AAVE or COMP once saw similar opportunities when the crypto fear and greed index shifted from caution to optimism. Today, research teams are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best crypto to buy now — a project positioned to lead the new cycle with real utility, audited security, and a rising presale demand curve. Why analysts are watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 of its presale. The total supply is set at 4 billion tokens, with $17.62 million already raised and more than 17,400 holders joining the ecosystem. Around 72% of the 170 million tokens available in this phase have been sold at $0.035 each. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. This adjustment will represent the final discounted window at this cheap price before the presale concludes, a point many analysts are calling the “pre-rally window.” Mutuum’s ecosystem will revolve around two complementary lending systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will allow users to deposit liquidity into smart contracts audited for safety and transparency. These funds will power the lending pool, where borrowers can access liquidity at algorithmically determined rates. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system will focus on more volatile or niche assets, where users can negotiate terms directly. Together, they form a balanced model that supports both stable and flexible income strategies. The project’s strength lies in how both systems will connect through mtTokens — a tokenized representation of deposits — that grows in value as borrowers repay interest. The process will remain entirely transparent and verifiable on-chain. This dual approach offers real yield rather than speculation, turning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a working financial instrument instead of a mere token. A numerical example shows how these mechanics will work. A user lending $10,000 USDT through the P2C model earns about 14% APY, which equals $1,400 in passive yield. Over time, their mtUSDT balance will increase, and once withdrawn, both the original deposit and interest are redeemed seamlessly. This system will show investors how decentralized lending can provide real, sustainable returns. Mutuum’s token economy will also include a buy and distribute model. A portion of the platform’s revenue will continually buy MUTM tokens from open markets and distribute them to mtToken stakers as rewards. This creates a continuous cycle where lending activity strengthens price support while rewarding participants — a self-reinforcing loop that analysts describe as “revenue recycling.” The development roadmap further strengthens investor confidence. The beta release of Mutuum’s platform will launch alongside the token’s market debut, not months afterward. This immediate usability will help ensure a smooth transition from presale to live functionality. Early adopters will have access to real borrowing, lending, and staking options right from launch, allowing the platform to generate active engagement from day one. As a part of the beta launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced via its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will come with vital components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to keep operations stable and secure. At launch, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral easily. This testnet rollout will let users explore and test the platform before its full release. By offering early access, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to strengthen user trust and spark interest. As participation rises, both the platform’s activity and token value are expected to grow. Early utility equals early returns Analysts studying the DeFi sector agree that the coming market recovery will reward projects with practical use cases and verifiable yield systems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks both boxes — its audited architecture, dual lending mechanics, and smart-contract-driven returns are designed to serve long-term participants rather than short-term traders. The project’s alignment with on-chain security standards and its $50,000 bug bounty program add credibility, while the upcoming Layer-2 implementation demonstrates readiness for mass adoption. With these foundations in place, market researchers project that early participants in the presale could see 4× to 6× gains through 2026 as utility metrics and ecosystem adoption expand. Conclusion The 24-hour leaderboard has been updated with a new daily bonus feature. Each day, the user who secures the top position will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM, provided they carry out at least one transaction during that 24-hour cycle. The leaderboard automatically resets at 00:00 UTC each day. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) marks a turning point in decentralized finance, moving from risky trading to organized systems that make money and are supported by contracts that can be verified. Analysts think this is one of the few tokens that will be able to survive and grow through market cycles, thanks to constant on-chain activity instead of hype. The next price change to $0.040 is coming up quickly, and Phase 6 is already 72% done. This presale is a rare chance for investors to buy before the crypto fear and greed index turns back to greed. Analysts concur that now is the time to take action before Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lists, because once the rally starts, the undervaluation at the beginning will be gone.

Over the summer, both companies had shown interest in joining Hong Kong’s new pilot programme for fiat-backed tokens. Ant had announced plans to apply for a licence to issue stablecoins in the territory once its licensing regime came into effect on Aug.1 . JD.com, too, was reported to be lobbying for an offshore yuan-oriented stablecoin via Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Dreams Face Mainland Resistance However, the mood has shifted. The Financial Times reported Sunday that officials at the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) instructed the firms to pause or abandon moves to issue or back stablecoins from Hong Kong. According to FT, Alibaba’s Ant Group and JD com have paused their plans to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong after receiving instructions from Chinese regulators, including the PBOC and CAC, to halt the projects. Hong Kong passed a Stablecoin Bill in May establishing a licensing… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 19, 2025 Their main worry is that if large tech firms or brokerages begin issuing tokens that function like currency, it could weaken the central bank’s authority. One person told the FT that regulators are focused on ensuring that the right to issue money remains solely with the state, not private companies. Hong Kong’s stablecoin licensing regime had created a new frontier. The territory’s de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), rolled out the framework after legislation was passed in May, opening a channel for token-issuers backed by fiat currency. Officials Shift From Enthusiasm To Restraint On Hong Kong Stablecoins Some officials in mainland China initially saw the programme as a chance to expand the renminbi’s reach beyond national borders. They believed that yuan-pegged stablecoins issued through Hong Kong could help counter the dominance of US dollar-backed tokens worldwide. However, that optimism faded by late August. At a closed-door forum, former PBoC governor Zhou Xiaochuan urged a more cautious approach. He warned that stablecoins could easily become vehicles for speculation or even fraud. He also questioned whether they truly added value to everyday retail payments. By then, Beijing’s tone had clearly shifted. Regulators began prioritising financial stability and state control over rapid innovation in the digital currency space. Tug Of War Emerges Between Hong Kong’s Openness And Beijing’s Control Regulators made it clear that private companies issuing currency-like tokens must yield to China’s priority of preserving monetary control. Innovation, in their view, cannot come at the cost of sovereignty. For Ant and JD.com, the timing could not be more sensitive. In June, Ant announced plans to apply for a stablecoin licence . Yet by mid-October, both firms had quietly stepped back, following Beijing’s guidance to pause. The move captures a growing tension between Hong Kong’s push to build a global digital asset hub and Beijing’s preference for restraint.

Traders and investors will watch closely, preparing to rotate profits into high-potential altcoins. During this momentum-driven period, emerging DeFi protocols will attract serious attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stand out as a resilient and innovative option. Its structured lending system and stablecoin-backed mechanics will make it a leading crypto to buy now. Investors will look for assets that combine growth potential with strong fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide both. By offering a dual-layer lending structure and an algorithmically managed stablecoin, the platform will create a reliable ecosystem for borrowing, lending, and trading. The current presale activity will show that interest in MUTM is rising even before broader market rallies. Presale momentum and market confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale. The total supply is 4 billion tokens where around $17.62 million have already been raised so far, and 72% of the 170 million allocated tokens will already be sold. The current price will stand at $0.035, and the holder base already exceeds 17,400 accounts combining all phases. This presale momentum will demonstrate growing investor confidence ahead of ETH’s potential rally. Phase 7 will raise the token price to $0.040, creating urgency for new buyers to secure positions before the market moves. For further growth of the community, a new feature has been introduced to the 24-hour leaderboard, offering daily rewards. Each day, the user who ranks first will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction within the 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate a dual lending system. Peer-to-Contract pools will offer secure liquidity, while Peer-to-Peer lending will allow direct engagement between borrowers and lenders. This combination will provide users with choice, flexibility, and consistent yield flow. Participants will benefit from a platform designed to maximize returns while protecting core capital. Sepolia testnet & stablecoin as a growth engine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently confirmed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will go live on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will include essential features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure stability and security. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. Through this testnet phase, users will get a chance to try out the platform before the full launch. Early testing will help build trust and awareness among users. As interest and participation increase, the platform’s growth and token demand are expected to rise. The platform’s decentralized $1-pegged stablecoin will act as an engine of consistent value. It will be minted only against approved collateral and burned upon repayment, ensuring a closed-loop liquidity cycle. Interest rates will adjust algorithmically to maintain the $1 peg, supporting borrowing demand and circulation. Investors will find confidence knowing that MUTM’s stablecoin will provide predictable, safe value during market swings. The stablecoin will underpin Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending structure (P2C and P2P), enabling uninterrupted lending and borrowing cycles while maintaining active liquidity within the ecosystem. Since stablecoins are considered the foundation of DeFi, Mutuum’s secure and overcollateralized model could become a key driver of persistent demand for MUTM. Accurate price discovery will further strengthen the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink oracles as the primary source of asset data. Backup oracles and aggregated feeds will ensure precision. This setup will prevent liquidation cascades, safeguard collateral, and maintain platform trust. Greater transparency and accuracy will attract more users, increasing MUTM demand as participation grows. Exchange listing and upside potential The way the roadmap is designed and the project is growing, the tier-1 and tier-2 exchange listing is inevitable. Projected listings will offer another avenue for growth. Historical patterns show that presale tokens with strong fundamentals often surge after centralized exchange exposure. Early Polygon and Avalanche investors saw significant returns once listed. Similarly, a crypto analyst projects a 12–15x rise for MUTM post-listing, targeting $0.45–$0.55 in early 2026. This potential will highlight the appeal of MUTM as a strategic crypto investment before ETH breaks $5,000. Security and transparency will also reinforce confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will complete a CertiK audit, scoring 90.00 on TokenScan and 79.00 on Skynet, revised in May 2025. The platform will maintain a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program, rewarding up to $2,000 for critical discoveries. This proactive approach will ensure participants feel safe and supported while engaging with the ecosystem. Final words Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use both structural innovation and momentum-driven opportunities. Its stablecoin, dual lending scheme, and accurate oracle system will make it a good crypto to acquire right now. With 72% of Phase 6 being sold out, the presale will show that there is a lot of interest. Phase 7 will raise the price by 15% to $0.040, giving early participants a chance to make a move. Investors will wish they had bought MUTM before ETH hit $5,000. It will offer both safety and growth, giving users an opportunity to use a platform that is meant to be useful and widely used. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi project that looks to the future. It will attract both momentum traders and long-term investors, making it one of the most promising crypto investments on the market right now.

The smartest crypto investment is never about holding what is already famous—it’s about finding what will soon dominate. During the last bull runs, early positions in smaller, undervalued assets outperformed blue chips by wide margins. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are the dependable pillars of DeFi, yet one new cryptocurrency — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — is quietly becoming the asymmetric opportunity investors look for before a cycle turns explosive. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) will continue to act as the heartbeat of decentralized finance. Once Layer-2 scaling further lowers gas fees, network usage will surge. ETH’s deflationary burn and its key role in smart contracts make it a long-term store of value. From a current base near $4,000, market analysts expect it to approach $12,000 in the coming cycle — a 3x rise that aligns with its historical recoveries during post-consolidation phases. For most portfolios, ETH remains the foundation of trust and consistency among the top cryptocurrencies. Here is the glimpse of technical analysis for ETH’s short term gain. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) stands out for its academic rigor and methodical design. Its proof-of-stake model promotes sustainability, while community-led governance aims for long-term decentralization. Yet ADA’s network growth has been gradual, with adoption lagging compared to faster ecosystems. As staking participation increases and decentralized applications expand, ADA’s valuation is expected to double. That’s a fair outcome for a project emphasizing research-driven evolution, not aggressive speculation. Still, both ETH and ADA now sit in mature phases. Their upside looks stable, but limited. Investors seeking stronger returns in the next wave often turn toward early-stage ecosystems with visible use cases and presale access. That’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the scene. The undervalued disruptor: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself at the core of decentralized borrowing and lending. The platform merges peer-to-contract liquidity pools and peer-to-peer custom markets, offering a dual lending system rarely seen among new cryptocurrency projects. At the presale’s current Phase 6, the price stands at $0.035, with roughly $17.62 million raised and 72% of this phase already sold. Over 17,400 holders have joined early and once Phase 7 begins, the price will rise 15% to $0.040 — a clear reason early investors are accelerating their entries. For community growth, the 24-hour leaderboard has received a new update introducing daily rewards. Each day, the user who achieves the top rank will be granted a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during the 24-hour period. The leaderboard automatically resets every day at 00:00 UTC. ROI math is straightforward where Phase 1 buyers at $0.01 already hold a 250% value increase at this price level. At listing, projected at $0.06, that’s a 500% total value gain. Analysts tracking the roadmap expect a post-launch value near $0.12 within the first year — translating to around 12x ROI. That kind of performance is rare among top cryptocurrencies, and it reflects how early-stage access magnifies rewards for those who act before full exchange listings. Mutuum’s lending engine shows real earning logic. For example, a user deposits $20,000 in DAI at a 15% annual rate, generating $3,000 in profit per year. Alongside interest, lenders receive mtTokens — staking assets that can later earn additional MUTM rewards from protocol buybacks. In the P2P segment, risk-tolerant lenders working with meme coins like PEPE or DOGE can earn up to 25% returns for providing liquidity directly to borrowers. Every loan interaction feeds the platform’s revenue, part of which will be used to buy back MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to stakers, creating sustained upward pressure on price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced on its official X account that the V1 of its protocol will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will introduce essential elements like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure reliable and secure operations. In its initial stage, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet launch will give users an early look at how the platform functions before the official release. By allowing hands-on testing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to build trust and attract more users. As engagement grows, both the platform’s demand and token value are likely to increase. Risk management remains another strength. Borrowing ratios depend on asset volatility — Ethereum and stablecoins enjoy up to 75% loan-to-value (LTV), while more volatile assets are capped around 45–65%. Automatic liquidations protect the system against shortfalls, while Chainlink oracle feeds ensure accurate asset pricing. These mechanics make Mutuum’s lending model both safe and scalable — crucial traits for long-term growth. Why MUTM holds 3x ROI edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends early-phase entry pricing with direct revenue streams and utility backed by products. Its MUTMs buyback system will keep liquidity in circulation and hence the demand high, and mtToken staking will give active users real returns. The team’s roadmap makes sure that borrowers and lenders will have a working ecosystem, not just an idea, by the time it launches. This combination of utilities that are useful and those that are in demand creates a unique value structure. There are 4 billion tokens in total, but only a small number are available during the presale phases. Prices will go up with each subsequent step. As liquidity increases and the lending protocols go live, demand for MUTM’s token will grow from both sides: users looking for stablecoin loans and investors looking for staking rewards. Ethereum and Cardano promise steady growth, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises speed. With Phase 6 almost up and the price only $0.035, the next bump to $0.040 will be a big deal for anybody who joins in late. If you miss this presale access, you’ll have to watch the 3x ROI window shut while other people maintain early positions. Among today’s top cryptocurrencies, MUTM stands as the most affordable and utility-backed crypto investment before the next market breakout.

He said small everyday people and traders can use small amounts to join the growing digital economy and added, “It’s never too late.” Armstrong posted on X and encouraged users to start investing with small amounts on X. He said many people will use crypto in the next ten years, and some will do so without even knowing it. Armstrong shows how crypto can help everyone access money easily Brian Armstrong often says that billions of people don’t have access to a bank account and that crypto will give them, and many others, an easier way to manage their money using only a phone and the internet. He explains that decentralized finance (DeFi) will allow anyone to borrow, lend, save, and trade money safely, even in places where banks are hard to reach or have very high fees. The CEO also says crypto aims to give people control over their own money and help them protect it from inflation, bad government policies, or unstable banking systems. Someone in a small village, a developing country, or a struggling economy will have the same access to global money as someone living in a big city. Armstrong said most people just want an easier way to store and use their money, so Coinbase is building products to make this a dream come true. His company offers decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, crypto-backed loans, and DeFi lending, among other features, to make crypto useful and less confusing. Users can borrow or lend money, earn rewards, or trade digital assets directly on Coinbase, as the company takes care of the technical work behind the scenes. The CEO says crypto will become so normal and easy to use that people will stop thinking of it as “crypto” and start referring to it as simply “money.” He usually says the internet once looked so complicated and full of big words that people did not understand, but now the same individuals use it naturally without thinking about how it works. Crypto will follow the same path and become part of how everyone saves, spends, and moves money. Coinbase plans to make finance simple and replace traditional banks Armstrong said it does not make sense that people still pay between 2% and 3% in fees every time they use their credit cards when they are just moving information through the internet. He explained that digital systems like blockchain can do the same thing and cost almost nothing. This is the kind of change he wants Coinbase to bring to the world for millions of people. The head of Coinbase says the crypto industry needs better regulation just as much as it does technology. The industry survived without clear rules for many years, so companies and investors stayed nervous about jumping in because they didn’t know exactly what was legal or how the government would react to new products. He believes the situation around the world is improving because new laws like the GENIUS Act in the US and the MiCA framework help many companies to operate safely and legally across the continent. Armstrong also said some of the biggest banks in the US, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, have already joined the crypto force and launched their own products through Coinbase and other platforms. He said these are great examples of how traditional finance and crypto can come together to give everyone a fair and modern financial system that they can feel safe in. The Coinbase leader said demand from big investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the fact that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist could push Bitcoin to one million dollars by 2030. However, he said the real value of crypto is to give people more control over their own money and make it possible for anyone to be a part of the financial system. In his view, Coinbase is on a mission to build a system where anyone across the globe, and not just the rich, can access safe and affordable financial tools, even if they don’t have a bank account.

Blue-chip coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana remain flat, while smaller projects struggle or collapse. This situation leaves many investors unsure about where to deploy capital. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as a utility-anchored growth token. It will provide disciplined investors with real yield opportunities and long-term upside. Those looking for the next big crypto for practical $500–$1,000 budgets will find MUTM to be a strategic choice. Presale overview and entry advantages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035 per token. Approximately 72% of the 170 million phase allocation of this phase is already sold. The presale has raised $17.62 million and attracted over 17,400 holders combining all phases. The total supply of MUTM is 4 billion tokens, giving investors a chance to acquire meaningful positions without needing large capital. A $1,000 investment in Phase 1 at $0.01 will grow to $3,500 in value of MUTM at Phase 6. This represents a 250% paper gain before the token reaches any exchange. Phase 7 is projected at $0.04, and a potential listing price of $0.06 will offer further upside. With this trajectory, a $1,000 entry now could translate into approximately 6X value returns, making MUTM a standout choice in the current market. Based on the experts and trajectory, MUTUM seems to touch $1 level and not too long after it hits the listing. It means that the $1,000 invested in phase 1 will become 29X, a whopping $29K. Lending models drive sustainable utility The core utility of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes from its dual lending system, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) structures. First, lenders will deposit stable assets into P2C pools. For example, a user depositing $1,000 USDT will receive mtTokens in return. These tokens will earn an average 14% annual yield, generating $140 in passive income each year. The lending process also grants governance voting weight to the lender, creating additional platform influence. Borrowers will then post collateral to access liquidity without selling their assets. A user locking $1,200 in ETH can borrow $900 USDT at 75% LTV. This allows the borrower to re-enter markets or fund new trades while keeping their original collateral intact. Borrowing activity will generate MUTM utility, as interest paid routes through the platform and contributes to governance metrics. Together, lending and borrowing interactions create a self-reinforcing cycle, where both sides of the platform support token demand. Buy and distribute model enhances token growth Revenue generated from lending will support the token’s growth through a buy-and-distribute system. Part of the platform’s income will purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens will then be redistributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. The more users participate in lending and borrowing, the higher the revenue, leading to more tokens bought for rewards. Stakers will directly benefit, linking platform activity to tangible token value. This approach ensures that MUTM demand grows organically from participation rather than artificial supply constraints. Investors actively using the platform will see their engagement translate into recurring token rewards. The system is designed to align user activity with the long-term growth of the token, making it a practical choice for disciplined crypto investing. Testnet launch, user engagement incentives and safety Mutuum’s team has announced on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol is planned to launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This update will bring key features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure performance. Initially, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. The testnet launch will give users a chance to explore how the system works before the full rollout. Allowing early access will help increase trust and attract more users. As engagement grows, both the platform’s popularity and token value are expected to rise. Additionally, this feature will encourage continuous interaction and create recurring demand for the token. Each lending, borrowing, or staking activity contributes to the overall utility of MUTM, creating a cycle of participation-driven growth rather than speculative spikes. To appreciate the leading investors and for the sake of community building, the 24-hour leaderboard now includes a new daily reward feature. Each day, the user who achieves the top rank will be awarded a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour period. The leaderboard automatically refreshes at 00:00 UTC every day. Loan-to-value ratios will help maintain liquidity and safeguard investors. Stable assets such as ETH and USDT will have LTVs around 75%, while volatile or less liquid tokens will be limited to 40%. These thresholds will enable safe liquidations and sustain confidence among participants. The platform’s focus on secure liquidity ensures long-term trust while supporting the token’s growth trajectory. Conclusion: a practical choice for $1K investors With 72% of Phase 6 already sold and a projected 15% climb to $0.04 in Phase 7, mid-budget investors don’t have much time to join in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a utility token made for disciplined investors in markets that are not stable. The coin’s dual lending structure, awards based on revenue, and incentives for active users all work together to make demand for the token grow. Investors that have $1,000 to spend can take advantage of presale prices, staking rewards, and being active on the platform. The token is structured to reward participation and generate recurring utility, making it a strategic addition to any crypto investing plan.

Many tokens boast x100 gains but fail to deliver real utility. Most new crypto projects collapse when investors chase hype instead of infrastructure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a different path. Every feature—lending, staking, buybacks, and beta rollout—will create measurable value. Investors will see returns tied to platform activity, not speculation. Tracking crypto charts will help users follow momentum while participating in an ecosystem built for long-term growth. For community building, the 24-hour leaderboard has been upgraded with a new daily reward system. Each day, the user who secures the top spot will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during that 24-hour cycle. The leaderboard automatically resets at 00:00 UTC every day. Presale progress and long-term ROI Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035 per token. Approximately 72% of the 170 million token allocation has been sold. Overall the presale has raised around $17.62 million, attracting more than 17,400 holders. The total supply of MUTM stands at 4 billion tokens, giving early participants a strong position. An investor who purchased in Phase 1 at $0.01 is already seeing 250% paper gains. With the projected listing price of $0.06, this gain could reach 500% in value. Analysts expect network activity to scale 40× over the next 24 months, supporting a projected 6,000% ROI based on platform usage alone. The growth is rooted in lending volume, staking participation, and buyback distribution—ensuring a data-driven foundation rather than hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending mechanics Lenders will participate in the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system by depositing stable assets like DAI. A $20,000 deposit at 15% APY will generate $3,000 in annual yield. These deposits will issue mtTokens to the lender, which carry governance rights and entitle them to rewards. Every lending transaction will feed revenue into the platform, increasing buybacks and reward distributions. Borrowers will operate within the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system. Each repayment and interest transaction will increase platform revenue and further reinforce demand for MUTM. The lender and borrower interaction will establish a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and token utility. The introduction of lending and borrowing utilities brings tangible functionality to the platform, positioning it to attract more users. Soon, participants will be able to lend, borrow, and stake their digital assets in designated pools to earn regular rewards. With each of these actions driving the use of MUTM, the expanding demand across the ecosystem is expected to play a crucial role in elevating the token’s long-term value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) revealed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will go live on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This update will include essential components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure reliable and secure operations. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. The testnet launch will give users an early opportunity to experience the platform’s key features before the full release. Allowing users to test the system will help build trust and awareness. As more people get involved, both platform activity and token demand are likely to grow. Buy and distribute flywheel The MUTM platform will use a buy-and-distribute model to reinforce engagement. Platform revenue from lending will be used to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens will be distributed to mtToken stakers, creating a participation-driven growth cycle. As more users stake, lending volumes will rise, generating more revenue, and increasing token demand. This cycle will continue to build organically, linking token value directly to network activity. Price appreciation will be driven by transaction-based demand, not artificial scarcity. Beta rollout, exchange presence and safe liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine its mainnet launch with exchange presence to generate real trading volume. Investors will interact with the platform immediately through lending, borrowing, and staking. Active participants will turn liquidity into visible market activity, supporting MUTM demand beyond presale participation. The MUTM protocol will implement strong risk controls with smart collateralization and automated liquidation systems. ETH and USDT pools will maintain high liquidity, with an 80% liquidation threshold for ETH. Volatile assets like PEPE will have a 65% threshold. These parameters will protect participants’ capital and maintain ecosystem stability. Active lending and borrowing will continue to reinforce token demand even during market fluctuations, ensuring that growth is transactionally anchored. Conclusion: data-driven ROI and urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine lending yields, staking rewards, buyback distributions, and active user incentives into a compounding growth model. Phase 6 is nearing completion, and the next price step to $0.04 will occur soon. Investors with $1,000 budgets will have a limited window to secure entry before the platform goes live. MUTM will offer a structured, usage-driven path to potential 6,000% ROI, making it a new crypto positioned for long-term wealth creation while tracking crypto charts for market performance.

When ETH trades sideways, experienced investors quietly start building positions in smaller, undervalued assets. These early moves often deliver the biggest gains once Ethereum begins its next uptrend. Analysts watching the current market cycle are already calling this the best time to focus on accumulation. Among the mix of familiar names and rising projects, a new cryptocurrency is standing out — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This market phase resembles previous pre-bull windows, where patient investors accumulated tokens under $1 before explosive rallies began. While major coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin dominate headlines, experts suggest that value lies in smaller caps that combine affordability with real-world utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now joins Solana (SOL) and XRP on the short list of tokens worth attention before the next leg of growth begins. Solana (SOL): fast, efficient, but already expensive Solana has recovered from its earlier network congestion and has shown strong technical performance this year. It continues to attract developers building fast DeFi and gaming platforms. Its throughput and scalability are proven, but the current valuation already reflects much of that progress. At its present price, analysts expect Solana to deliver around 1.5× to 2× upside before the next major rally begins. That makes it a safer but slower-moving option. Investors looking for sharper gains are turning their focus toward lower-cost entries with growing ecosystems. Solana remains a benchmark for high-performance chains, but its size and price limit its near-term return potential. The search for the next Solana-like performer is what brings many investors to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), still priced at only $0.035 in its presale. XRP: stable, trusted, but growth-limited XRP’s regulatory clarity restored market confidence, and institutions continue to explore its cross-border payment capabilities. Its speed and liquidity make it reliable, yet its centralized token distribution limits long-term exponential growth. Analysts expect XRP to move between 2× and 3× in the upcoming cycle as capital rotates toward utility-driven assets. XRP remains part of many balanced portfolios, but for investors seeking higher ROI from smaller market caps, emerging DeFi platforms are gaining more attention. This shift in investor sentiment aligns with rising interest in projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offer direct participation in revenue-driven ecosystems rather than depending solely on speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): the affordable disruptor Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming the standout among new cryptocurrency launches this season. Its presale has already raised $17.62 million, with more than 17,400 holders overall. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, 72% of the 170 million tokens allocated for this round are sold. Once Phase 7 starts, the price will rise 15% to $0.040 — making this one of the final chances for early investors to secure discounted access. Unlike speculative projects that rely only on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds its value around real lending and borrowing activity. The platform will combine two lending systems: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2C mode, users will deposit liquidity into automated pools, earning yield from active borrowers. In P2P mode, individual users will negotiate custom terms for loans backed by crypto assets. A simple example shows how this works. A borrower will lock $2,000 in ETH as collateral, with a loan-to-value ratio of 75%, to borrow $1,500 USDT without selling holdings. That transaction will generate interest for lenders and create revenue for Mutuum. The platform will later use part of that revenue to buy MUTM tokens from the market, redistributing them to stakers. Every interaction in this system will connect user activity directly to token demand. Additionally, the project’s beta version will launch alongside the token listing, ensuring users can immediately access lending, borrowing, and staking features. Users who stake their mtTokens will receive ongoing rewards, creating a real yield experience within a transparent ecosystem. As a part of the beta launch, Mutuum Finance revealed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will introduce core features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure a safe and efficient system. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet launch will give users a chance to experience the platform before its full release. By offering early access, Mutuum Finance aims to build trust and community engagement. As confidence grows, both platform usage and token demand are likely to increase. Moreover, for community building and to appreciate consistent investors. A new daily reward feature has been added to the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who secures the top position will be granted a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour window. The leaderboard refreshes automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. The accumulation window is narrowing Solana is gaining ground and people trust XRP. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is both cheap and useful, which analysts see as the best combo before a big market rebound. The CertiK audit, bug bounty program, and increased presale participation on the platform show that investors are quite confident. Its dual lending system, buy-and-distribute methodology, and planned beta release over a fast Layer-2 network all point to real-world use and growth over time. Since Phase 6 is now 72% done, there aren’t many tokens left at $0.035. As soon as the price hits $0.040, the early entrance benefit is gone. As ETH gets ready to go up, analysts say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the best ways to buy and hold in the current market. The message is clear for investors who are looking for lucrative cryptos: cheap won’t stay cheap, and this new cryptocurrency is one of the best chances to get in before the next rise starts.

53397729,https://invezz.com/?p=2932004,1760931886,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Experts reveal the next big crypto expected to hit $1 in 2026,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/experts-reveal-the-next-big-crypto-expected-to-hit-1-in-2026/,"For many investors studying early blockchain success stories, the search for the next breakout never stops. Experts across the DeFi sector are now naming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most promising crypto coins expected to reach $1 by 2026. Designed with real lending utility, audited security, and a growing presale base, this new entrant is catching the eye of analysts who once highlighted tokens like Solana and Avalanche before their major rallies. The appeal lies in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ability to merge traditional financial logic with blockchain automation. Its design will allow users to borrow, lend, and earn yield while maintaining transparency through smart contracts. As the presale progresses, more investors are asking what crypto to buy next—and the growing data behind MUTM shows a clear direction. Early demand proves confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its presale, yet the traction speaks volumes about market confidence. The token’s total supply is set at 4 billion, and the current phase has already raised $17.62 million. About 72% of the 170 million tokens in this round are sold, with more than 17,400 holders already onboard combining all phases. Each token is priced at $0.035, and the next presale phase will raise that price to $0.040—a 15% increase that rewards early participation. Missing to invest now means that you will get the same amount of tokens with expensive pricing. This pace mirrors the early adoption curves seen during Solana’s initial market entry. Analysts are pointing to the steady inflow of participants as a strong validation that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just hype. The steady rise in token price across each phase signals growing trust from retail and early-stage institutional investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ecosystem will revolve around a dual lending model. The first branch, P2C lending, will allow users to provide liquidity to protocol pools and earn passive income from borrowers. The second branch, P2P lending, will let lenders and borrowers create personalized agreements for flexible yields. Together, they form a dynamic system that connects decentralized liquidity with secure, auditable smart contracts. Building utility, value, and investor growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another token—it will act as the functional core of the ecosystem. Every lending, borrowing, and staking operation will require MUTM. That means each new user or transaction adds organic demand. As activity grows, so does buying pressure. This cycle turns platform use into an ongoing engine for token appreciation. Consider one simple example. An investor who entered in Phase 3 with $2,000 at $0.02 now holds 100,000 MUTM. At today’s price of $0.035, that portfolio stands at $3,500 in value, a 75% gain during presale alone. When MUTM reaches $1, the same investor will hold $100,000 while at $2, that value rises to $200,000. This kind of exponential trajectory reflects how early participation can multiply returns once utility and market access align. To reinforce token stability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a buy and distribute model. A portion of the platform’s revenue from lending operations will continually purchase MUTM from open markets. Those tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This self-sustaining structure ensures that every transaction strengthens long-term price support and rewards active participants. The development timeline also adds to investor optimism. The team will deploy its first beta version on a fast Layer-2 network before mainnet launch. This version will give users hands-on access to the borrowing and staking systems, promoting real adoption and word-of-mouth marketing. Such a rollout plan often triggers strong user engagement and community growth—two proven factors in DeFi valuation surges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s team has recently announced on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will be released on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will introduce main components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure functionality. At launch, users will have the ability to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet rollout will allow users to explore and understand how the platform works before the full launch. Early testing will help build confidence and interest in the project. As engagement increases, the platform’s growth and token value are expected to strengthen. To enhance engagement and to incentivize huge investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dashboard will allow users to track holdings, calculate ROIs, and leaderboard positions. A new update has been introduced to enhance the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who ranks first will be rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard refreshes automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. Final words With its robust presale and clear operations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the best options for what crypto to buy right now. Every step on the pipeline, from beta deployment to exchange listings, will increase exposure and liquidity. As those stages happen, demand for the token will probably grow, bringing it closer to the $1 expert projection. Every big crypto success starts with a strong belief based on sound foundations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the next example. It is a token that combines genuine lending capacities, real rewards, and a developing community. Phase 6 is already 72% sold out, and the next price spike is coming up quickly. New investors still have a short time to get in and experts think that the story of how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) went from $0.01 to $1 will be one of the best investing stories of 2026.

Only a few realized its power before it took off across major exchanges. That moment changed how people viewed digital assets forever. Today, another project is setting up a similar storyline — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Its fast-growing presale and practical use case are creating real excitement among investors searching for the best crypto opportunity while the market still wonders why crypto is down. Presale momentum building at lightning speed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale. The token has already raised over $17.62 million from all the phases till now, with 72% of the 170 million tokens in only phase 6 being sold. The current price stands at $0.035, and more than 17,400 holders have joined across all phases. With a total supply of 4 billion MUTM, this presale has drawn strong attention from investors looking for growth before the next price jump. When Phase 6 closes, the price will increase by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. That marks a major step for early buyers aiming to maximize ROI. Each phase sells out faster than the last, showing growing confidence in the project’s model and its clear vision for future expansion. Investors often compare new opportunities to past legends, and this is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. At the current stage, a $3,000 investment from Phase 1 at $0.01 is already valued around $10,500 at today’s $0.035. When MUTM reaches $1, that same value becomes $300,000 — a 100× rise and at $2, it becomes $600,000. These gains match the type of explosive ROI that made XRP a household name in the crypto space. Utility and growth create a powerful loop Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a project built only for hype. Its entire system runs on two clear models that connect directly with real blockchain utility. The first is Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. Here, users lend or borrow from liquidity pools for steady, automated yields. The second is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, where users set their own loan terms, durations, and interest rates directly with each other. Both systems connect under one smart contract network, powered by mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and Liquidator Bots. This structure creates a healthy cycle of lending, borrowing, and staking — all using MUTM tokens. As these activities grow, demand for the token grows with them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will begin with ETH and USDT as collateral/borrowing/lending which the team has recently announced regarding the launch of V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This version will include essential components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to keep the system running smoothly and securely. The testnet release will allow users to explore how the platform functions before the main launch. Early testing will help boost user confidence and attract more interest. As participation grows, both demand for the platform and the value of its token are expected to rise. A key strength of this project lies in how it links platform performance with holder benefits. The buy-and-distribute model will use platform revenue to buy MUTM from open markets and distribute these tokens to mtToken stakers. This rewards long-term participants, creating real value for those who support the network instead of short-term sellers. The combination of on-chain utility, community incentives, and continuous token demand makes this ecosystem sustainable. Investors are not just buying a token — they are joining a network built for long-term activity and participation. For community building the platform has also been working on incentive distribution. The 24-hour leaderboard has been updated with an exciting new reward feature. Each day, the user who achieves the top rank will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they perform at least one transaction within the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. A race against time for smart investors Individuals are still wondering why the crypto market is down, but chances like this are what get people excited again. XRP’s ascent highlighted what happens when good technology meets real need. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to write the next success story with new ideas, explicit token use, and a presale that gets faster every week. The price will soon go up to $0.040 in the following phase, and phase 6 is practically sold out. Every day that goes by makes it harder for new investors to get in. This project is a strong contender for the top crypto investments of the year. It has already raised more than $17.62 million, has thousands of holders, and has a comprehensive plan for getting to its Layer-2 beta launch, probably at the time of the token live event. XRP had its moment of glory while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to take the stage next — and for those paying attention, this presale might be the early step that defines 2025’s biggest ROI story.

Institutional inflows have eased, and investor mood is not crashing as traders lay the groundwork for the next leg of the bull run. Analysts indicate that the consolidation phase may form the basis of recoveries in altcoins. One of the most discussed pre-sales that drew significant attention was MAGACOIN FINANCE , and speculation of a possible 50x before its exchange listing continued to grow. Bitcoin Consolidation Hints at Broader Market Rebound The stability of Bitcoin price within the range of $106,000 – $108,000 indicates strength even after a shaky beginning in October. On-chain data indicates that Bitcoin control is still over 52%, which is indicative of institutional faith. Market observers think that this consolidation reflects mid-cycle accumulation in previous bull runs, which is usually followed by recoveries. The inflows of ETFs via funds such as BlackRock’s IBIT have been steadily increasing, indicating long-term investor belief despite the decline in trading volumes. Traditionally, these circumstances evoked altcoin rallies once Bitcoin reclaimed momentumAnalysts expect the next breakout to coincide with the relaxing monetary policy or updated ETF-led liquidity by the end of 2025. As Bitcoin levels off, investors are diversifying their interests to presales with good fundamentals and security guarantees, making MAGACOIN FINANCE a sole competitor in this rotation. Bitcoin Golden Line Holds – Support Signals Market Strength. Analyst Merlijn The Trader emphasized that Bitcoin’s “Golden Line,” represented by the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) , remains a crucial support level. He observed that the larger bullish structure would continue to be intact as long as the weekly candles close above this line. Traditionally, this EMA has kept the accumulation areas distinct by big capitulation phases, frequently marking the period of corrections and new rallies. Bitcoin is now trading between $106,000 and 108,000, trying to break this important support level following a 7% decline weekly. Merlijn referred to the 50 EMA as a battleground where one side survives, implying bulls have to hold this point to continue with the momentum of the cycle. BTCUSD 1-week Chart | Source: X Analysts agree that sustaining the Golden Line could reignite confidence across the market, attracting capital back into leading altcoins and presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Investor Confidence Builds Ahead of Exchange Listing In comparison to most presale coins, which are based on marketing hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has gained investor trust due to transparency and independent security audits. The project has been audited by Hashex and CertiK , two of the top blockchain audit companies. Both attested that the smart contract of the token is safe, vulnerability-free, and it is created to facilitate equitable on-chain transactions. The presale system consists of an anti-whale mechanism to create equal distribution of tokens, to avoid large holders taking over the supply. This, with a multi-step roadmap and regular updates in the development, has strengthened investor confidence. Additionally, analysts report that the presale has already garnered over $16 million , which makes it one of the most rapidly growing launches of 2025. The subsequent listing on the exchanges in Q4 2025 is expected to result in a price increase, with the ongoing presale demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Utility and Growth Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its utility-based token model that extends past speculative trading. The token supports a decentralized ecosystem that includes staking rewards, liquidity incentives, and real-time analytics of investors.

As their first step, the group plans to join forces with the Office for Investment in the country to secure investment opportunities across various regions, said the UK Treasury on Monday, October 20. Notably, this announcement was released before a regional investment summit the government will host in Birmingham on Tuesday this week. Rachel Reeves pushes pension funds to contribute more to the UK economy A statement released highlighted that the largest asset manager in the UK, Legal & General Group Plc, and NEST (National Employment Savings Trust), a government-backed workplace pension scheme, have invested billions to establish more affordable housing and improve broadband services in rural areas. This move has been credited to Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves’s earlier efforts to put more pressure on pension funds to increase their contribution to the country’s economy . Reeves viewed these efforts as crucial after observing years of money leaving domestic investments. However, although UK pension funds have doubled their investments in private firms the previous year, data released last week by the Association of British Insurers highlights that they still do not meet the levels needed to fulfill a commitment to back private businesses. In the meantime, the government made public its intention to utilize a “reserve power” to require pension funds to invest in the local economy this year. Individuals have received this plan with mixed reactions. For instance, investment managers have vehemently opposed this plan, arguing that their clients have the right to choose where they place their savings. On the other hand, pension providers have raised concerns about costs and performance charges as the main reason they hesitate to make significant investments in private markets. The members of the newly formed “Sterling 20” group include: Aegon, Aon, Aviva, L&G, LifeSight by WTW, Mercer, M&G, NatWest Cushon, Nest Corporation, NOW Pensions, People’s Partnership, Phoenix Group, Rothesay, Royal London, Smart Pension, SEI, TPT, USS, Pension Insurance Corporation, and Pension Protection Fund. UK pension funds strike several significant investment agreements Regarding the UK pension funds’ commitment to the government aimed at backing private businesses, eleven firms that signed up to the Mansion House Compact two years ago had increased their investments in private markets to 0.6% of defined-contribution default funds by February, according to the Association of British Insurers. This percentage was higher than the 0.36% recorded last year. These companies have £1.6 billion exposure to unlisted equities in default funds. This is where pension savers’ money ends up automatically until they decide to invest it elsewhere, compared with £800 million the previous year. Apart from this commitment, the eleven firms are still striking substantial investment agreements to strengthen the country’s economy. To illustrate this, the companies made a voluntary agreement focused on a 5% allocation towards unlisted equities by 2030. Moreover, they reached another crucial agreement this year to strive for the same target for UK-specific private assets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-cannot-be-mined-price-will-increase-significantly-heres-why/,"Crypto researcher SMQKE has referenced multiple documented sources indicating that XRP operates as a deflationary digital asset . According to the documents shared , XRP’s supply decreases over time due to the permanent destruction of tokens through transaction fees, and the token cannot be mined or recreated. This mechanism, confirmed in several official and academic publications, establishes XRP as a currency with a fixed and gradually declining supply. One of the attached documents, reportedly based on Ripple’s technical explanations, details that a small fraction of XRP—exactly 0.00001 XRP—is burned with every transaction processed on the XRP Ledger. The same document emphasizes that these tokens are not collected by any party but are permanently removed from circulation, ensuring the asset’s deflationary nature. A separate academic citation from Aigubov and Magomedtagirov (2017) and Ripple’s official documentation (2020) further supports this, explaining that XRP’s total quantity “will constantly decrease” as network activity continues. XRP = Deflationary Which means: “…XRP token cannot be mined and its quantity will constantly decrease, and everything that exists in a limited amount and is actively used is becoming more expensive, therefore, with the growth of the network, the XRP price will increase… pic.twitter.com/w3A66n7nem — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 18, 2025 Deflationary mechanics tied to network growth The researcher’s post connects this structural scarcity directly to XRP’s potential market value. With no future creation of tokens and a burn mechanism that reduces supply, the cited sources suggest that an increase in transaction volume could lead to long-term price appreciation. As the documents describe, “everything that exists in a limited amount and is actively used becomes more expensive,” implying that sustained growth in network activity would gradually enhance XRP’s valuation. These materials also reinforce XRP’s original purpose as a bridge asset designed for interoperability between fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, and other tokenized forms of value. The combination of deflationary tokenomics and practical utility in cross-border payments positions XRP distinctively among digital assets competing in the same space. While centralized stablecoins such as USDC and government-backed CBDCs offer stability or regulatory advantages, XRP’s decentralized consensus model and supply-reducing mechanism continue to differentiate its long-term outlook. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s strategy and broader implications SMQKE’s post aligns with earlier research highlighting XRP’s interoperability, low transaction costs, and institutional adoption potential. Ripple’s strategy, as documented in its internal materials, includes expanding institutional partnerships and integrating XRP into decentralized finance and multi-chain liquidity solutions. These developments, coupled with XRP’s deflationary design, contribute to a narrative of sustained long-term value rather than inflationary dilution. In summary, the evidence highlighted by SMQKE underscores XRP’s unique tokenomics: a fixed supply, ongoing burn rate, and deflationary design that distinguishes it from inflationary or mintable assets. The referenced academic and technical materials together suggest that XRP’s value proposition lies not only in transaction speed and cost efficiency but also in its built-in scarcity over time.

Cuomo has pledged to make the city a “global hub of the future.” In a Sunday announcement , Cuomo announced that his administration would create a new Chief Innovation Officer role to spearhead the city’s tech and crypto innovation. His proposal comes days after the current mayor, Eric Adams, established the “nation’s first-ever” municipal office for crypto and blockchain. He appointed crypto policy expert Moises Rendon to lead the office as executive director. Additionally, Adams had previously accused Cuomo of dismantling the crypto industry through hostile policies. Last month, Adams withdrew from the mayoral race, ending his re-election campaign , citing financial struggles. CIO to Coordinate Multi-Tech Initiatives Andrew Cuomo noted that the CIO is “a senior administration position” and would work to support emerging industries such as AI and blockchain. Besides, the role will also be responsible for fostering public-private collaboration and helping the city’s public sector harness new technologies. “The next Mayor must make sure we’re also leading in the technologies that will define the next century — AI, blockchain, and biotech,” said Cuomo. Further, an Innovation Council, comprising leaders from the three emerging tech fields – crypto, AI and biotech, will be established to advise the CIO on policy developments and consumer protection. “That’s what this position is about: Keeping New York City not just competitive, but dominant in the global innovation economy. I’m excited for the future.” The Council for crypto and blockchain will explore ways to “replace outdated regulations with a modern framework,” the announcement read. NYC Mayor Eric Adams’s Exit Gives Cuomo a Competitive Edge Adam’s exit has left New York politics without one of the pro-crypto leaders in elected office. With voting scheduled to take place on Nov. 4, the City Hall is skeptical whether it would continue to embrace digital assets or take a more cautious path. On the other hand, Democrat Zohran Mamdani, the mayoral hopeful, has been relatively silent on crypto. Major crypto figures like Gemini crypto exchange co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, as well as US AI and crypto czar David Sacks, have spat criticism in light of Mamdani’s rising popularity. Winklevoss called New York City a “broken kleptocracy.” He added that “things will have to get worse in NYC before they get better.” Sacks called on Silicon Valley to “wake up” to the rising communism in New York. Wake up, Silicon Valley. This is the future of the Democrat Party. Communism has defeated liberalism. Even Bill Clinton has bent the knee. You basically have two choices now: Get on board with MAGA or prepare to be on Mamdani’s dinner menu. https://t.co/L5OKzRA3Gl — David Sacks (@DavidSacks) June 29, 2025 Although the Polymarket poll on NYC mayoral election shows only 7% chance for Andrew Cuomo, his involvement in the crypto industry would give him credibility in New York’s complex regulatory environment.

During the third quarter, of the 64 companies that released warnings, 47% pointed to policy changes and global instability as the main cause. The share has surged from 17% last year to its highest point in over 25 years, based on EY-Parthenon data. On the other hand, 19% of firms blamed declining consumer confidence, the most since late 2022, 22% referenced tariff-related impacts, while a third of the total pointed to contracts or orders being delayed or cancelled. The risk-averse consumer mood was also evidenced in recent retail sales figures . UK retail sales growth eased in September with cautious consumers homing in on essentials and waiting before making discretionary purchases, new figures from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) show. Total retail sales increased 2.3% on year, after rising 3.1% in August and 2.5% in July. Sales at established stores, which exclude new openings, also fell to 2% from 2.9%. Retailers blamed the weaker performance on stubborn inflation, uncertainty over imminent tax changes, and volatile weather conditions, all of which were undermining consumer confidence. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:5900f6ce-fdbe-49b5-a39e-3fdc86c7bfe8-9"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-6"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Research shows that one in four consumers is holding back on spending as Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves prepares to deliver her first full budget in November. The new administration faces the challenge of balancing its goals, stimulating economic growth, advancing green investment commitments, and managing a growing public debt burden. UK’s technology firms issued the most profit warnings in the third quarter Jo Robinson, a partner at EY-Parthenon, said lingering uncertainty among UK firms is having an impact on households as companies adapt to market changes and external threats such as cyber attacks . Companies have been feeling cost pressure since at least April, when rising national insurance, higher minimum wages, and trade tariffs began to squeeze their expenses. UK software and computer services firms issued the most profit warnings in Q3, per EY-Parthenon. The industry topped the list with 10 warnings, up from six in the second quarter. Robinson explained that the software and computer services sector is being hit hard by contract cancellations and project delays. She stated, “As service providers to a wide range of industries, technology firms remain highly exposed to broader economic slowdowns and cost-cutting.” Generative AI still serves as a double-edged sword for the sector — driving innovation and efficiency while heightening uncertainty and risk. Robinson explained that the speed of technological change is also making clients more cautious about new investments, while the rise of in-house capabilities is disrupting standard outsourcing and licensing practices. With the November 26 Budget approaching, Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces the difficult task of boosting growth and fixing public finances, prompting expectations of further policy moves. She is already under pressure to raise taxes to plug a £20–30 billion deficit, though such measures risk dampening consumer confidence. The UK’s media and construction firms also released profit warnings Consumer sentiment in the UK is still weak as households grapple with inflation, costly borrowing, job losses, and looming tax increases. Household spending per capita in the UK remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, the weakest showing in the G7 group of advanced nations. Monday’s report showed profit warnings rising from 59 in the prior quarter. Outside the tech sector, the media and construction and materials industries also reported a high number of profit warnings, with six each. Listed retailers issued nine profit warnings, the highest total since late 2023. EY-Parthenon’s Christian Mole even said the hospitality and retail sectors are particularly vulnerable to cost increases, such as wage hikes, with many firms finding it hard to absorb them. He noted, “Companies from across consumer-facing sectors are reporting more selective spending, delayed purchases, and trading down to lower-cost options.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Despite his past ties to crypto exchange OKX during its federal probe, Cuomo’s agenda suggests that there could soon be a shift toward encouraging innovation and bridging Wall Street with digital assets. However, he faces stiff competition from Democratic frontrunner and much less crypto-friendly Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo Launches Pro-Crypto NYC Campaign Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo is reportedly planning a major comeback. This time he plans to do it through a campaign centered on crypto, AI, and biotech. As he wants to become New York City’s next mayor, Cuomo is positioning himself as the candidate of innovation to transform the city into “the global hub of the future,” according to Eleanor Terrett , co-host of Crypto in America. Cuomo’s proposed agenda reportedly includes creating a new chief innovation officer role to attract investment and jobs, and forming an Innovation Council with three advisory committees focused on crypto, AI, and biotech. These committees will advise on technology adoption, workforce development, and regulatory streamlining for emerging industries. Insiders suggest the initiative is part of an attempt to modernize how the city integrates new technology and to make New York a leader in cutting-edge sectors. Cuomo’s experience with the crypto industry already attracted some attention. He previously served as an advisor to crypto exchange OKX during a federal probe that ended with the company pleading guilty to several violations and agreeing to pay more than $500 million in fines and penalties. Despite this controversial background, his return to politics could be a big shift in the city’s approach to digital assets. Andrew Cuomo If implemented, Cuomo’s plans could deepen the bridge between traditional finance and crypto. With Wall Street’s massive concentration of capital, New York could channel massive inflows into the digital asset sector. The move could also build on outgoing Mayor Eric Adams’ initiatives , including the recent creation of the Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology, which was designed to promote responsible use of digital assets and attract global talent. Cuomo, however, faces an uphill battle. He trails behind Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani, who is an outspoken progressive who has shown very little enthusiasm for crypto or big tech. Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa is also still in the race, but current polling shows that Mamdani holds a commanding lead. Some people in the crypto community, including Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss, criticized Mamdani’s anti-innovation stance, and suggested that “things will have to get worse in NYC before they get better.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TECHNOLOGY|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-20 05:30:00

Investigation by community members revealed that winning projects were potentially linked to Coinbase’s own employees. Developers have long questioned whether coding competitions and hackathons actually help the participants. Programmers often share their frustrations online about events that are designed for publicity under the guise of supporting developers. For instance, some past competitions have faced criticism. The criticism includes CodeX’s small prizes, increased student costs at Hack the Hill, and a 2013 incident where Salesforce allegedly favored pre-selected winners. Coinbase’s Onchain Summer Awards event is under fire The latest controversy involves Coinbase’s Base, which held the “Onchain Summer Awards” competition last month. Over 500 developer teams participated in the event and competed for $200,000 in total prizes. Organizers said winners would be chosen based on actual user engagement with their applications. However, developers spotted problems when the results came out on October 7. Alanas, co-founder of Ogvio, closely investigated the winning entries and uncovered some concerning details. > build on base and be rewarded > coinbase employees winning base hackathon @base hackathon results are in. pure disappointment. coinbase employees + shell projects are winning plz don't let the greed get the best of you. is that the base we should build on? pic.twitter.com/Hmvw0lkjQt — Alanas (@alanonchain) October 15, 2025 The top projects seem to be fake apps The second-place project called owatch and third-place winner Opi Trade appeared to be fake applications, according to Alanas’s analysis posted on X (formerly Twitter). He described both as basic web pages created by AI with no real features or functionalities. The investigation took an interesting turn when connections were found between the fake projects and Coinbase’s employees. This is particularly surprising since Coinbase owns the Base network that ran the competition. What makes this situation worse is that legitimate teams with working products lost to these empty shells. The participant list included many developers who had already built and launched real applications that people actually use. Angry developers have been messaging the Base team on social media, asking for answers about how fake projects won major prizes.

That’s up from under 4% at the start. The platform’s longer hours and lower fees helped it snatch market share fast; some stocks, like Doosan Enerbility, are now traded more on Nextrade than on the 70-year-old Korea Exchange (KRX). Nextrade runs 12 hours a day, nearly double KRX’s 6.5-hour window. It opens before the KRX bell rings and keeps trading deep into the evening. Retail traders have flooded in, especially during the 50-minute pre-market session, which now sees more action than Nextrade’s own post-market hours. On KRX, trading runs from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. On Nextrade, you can buy and sell from early morning till 8 p.m. Retail traders move to Nextrade en masse for speed and flexibility The shift has been powered by South Korea’s retail army, often called “ants.” These small traders make up 86% of Nextrade’s activity, pouring cash into crypto, Magnificent Seven stocks, and even leveraged U.S. ETFs. They want speed, longer hours, and cheap fees; and Nextrade apparently delivers. Here’s the kicker: transaction fees are 20–40% cheaper than KRX. You also get more price-setting options. If you don’t tell your broker which platform to use, it auto-selects the one offering the better deal. This price-based system has helped Nextrade grab order flow quickly. Nextrade doesn’t support IPOs, but that hasn’t stopped it from exploding in popularity. Foreign investor participation is also climbing, up to 11% from basically zero at launch. Domestic institutions, though, are still mostly sitting out. Korean media blame “system stability worries,” though Nextrade hasn’t had any major outages. As Nextrade grows, KRX is feeling the pressure. Regulators have been caught flat-footed. They rushed to review rules that cap alternative trading systems (ATS). The Financial Services Commission (FSC) was forced to temporarily lift the 30% single-stock volume cap in September after 500 stocks broke the limit. If they hadn’t, Nextrade would’ve had to freeze trading on a ton of names. “It would become impossible for investors to trade during their commute to office,” the FSC said in a public statement. Regulators cap Nextrade’s growth while Seoul pushes U.S. tariff deal But the 15% overall market volume cap still stands. To stay under that line, Nextrade suspended nearly 150 stocks in August and September. That’s why the platform’s market share by volume is smaller than by value. Compare that to the U.S., where 80+ ATS platforms handle just 20% of market value, or Japan, where three ATS players split just 10%. Nextrade’s growth is reportedly on another level. “It’s unprecedented globally,” said Kang Sohyun, senior research fellow at the Korea Capital Market Institute. “If you look at other similar markets with one large exchange and smaller bourses, such as Australia and Japan, Nextrade’s expansion has been very rapid.” The legal foundation for Nextrade was laid way back in 2013, part of South Korea’s plan to modernize its capital markets. But things stalled until 2023, when Nextrade got preliminary approval. Its CEO, Kim Haksoo, used to be a financial regulator himself. Meanwhile, South Korea’s broader economic strategy is shifting fast. Presidential policy chief Kim Yong-beom said Sunday the country had made “substantial progress” in tariff talks with the United States. Kim, alongside Seoul’s industry minister and other officials, met U.S. negotiators in Washington last week. At stake is a $350 billion investment fund, key to a deal that capped U.S. tariffs on Korean goods at 15%. That same weekend, top Korean tycoons, from Hyundai Motor, SK Inc., and Hanwha, played golf for over seven hours with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Executives from Japan and Taiwan also joined, according to Yonhap and other local media. Trade and investment likely came up. Trump, who often mixes business with golf, has used the Florida estate for dealmaking with global power players. And with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit around the corner, Kim said the odds of finalizing a trade deal have now “increased.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Business|WON,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-20 05:34:36

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Mark Pittman issued a four-page order refusing to send the case elsewhere, even while admitting that the lawsuit has “at best minimal connections” to the city. But because none of the defendants asked him to transfer the case by the Oct. 9 deadline, he said his hands were tied. The lawsuit was filed in August by Elon’s companies, X and xAI. They accused Apple and OpenAI of trying to lock up the artificial intelligence market, saying Apple gave unfair promotion to ChatGPT on its App Store while burying other AI apps like xAI’s Grok. Both Apple and OpenAI are based in California. X is in Bastrop, Texas, which is 200 miles south of Fort Worth. None of them operate out of Fort Worth, except for a handful of Apple retail stores in the area. Judge pressures Apple and OpenAI to move their headquarters Even though the companies aren’t based in Fort Worth, Pittman sarcastically suggested they should be. “Given the present desire to have venue in Fort Worth,” he wrote, “the Court highly encourages the Parties to consider moving their headquarters to Fort Worth.” He even dropped a link to Fort Worth’s Business Services page to “get the process started.” “Fort Worth has much more going for it than just the unique artwork on the fourth floor of its historic federal courthouse,” Pittman added. The jab landed hard, but that wasn’t the only one. He took a direct hit at what legal insiders call “forum-shopping,” the tactic of filing lawsuits in certain courts known to deliver favorable rulings. X and Tesla, both controlled by Elon, have done this before, filing high-profile suits in Fort Worth. Pittman, appointed by former President Donald Trump, admitted that the Fort Worth court is getting slammed. He said its docket is “two to three times busier” than the Dallas division, which has more judges to handle cases. Court keeps lawsuit despite weak local ties Despite blasting the case’s weak ties to Fort Worth, Pittman said the court had “little, if any, choice.” He blamed the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas, for raising the bar on venue transfers. Last year, that same court overturned two of his attempts to move a banking case to Washington, D.C., calling his effort an “abuse of discretion.” Pittman’s not trying that again. He wrote, “The fact that neither Defendant filed a motion to transfer venue serves as a consideration for the Court. And the Court ‘respect[s]’ Plaintiffs’ choice of venue.” But he made it clear he wasn’t thrilled. “This case contains at best minimal connections to the Fort Worth Division of the Northern District of Texas,” he wrote. His most cutting line? “Venue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a Plaintiffs’ whim where and how a lawsuit is filed.” Even with all that, Pittman kept the case in Fort Worth, because technically, Apple does sell iPhones there, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT is available nationwide. That, apparently, was just enough. Earlier this month, a judge in Washington, D.C., denied Elon’s attempt to move an unrelated SEC lawsuit over Twitter (now X) to Texas. Elon, who bought Twitter and renamed it X, wanted the case heard on his home turf again, and failed. But this time, in Fort Worth, he got what he wanted.

CZ noted that many social media accounts have weak security measures, which is why attackers hijack these accounts and use them to deceive the crypto community. Zhao also emphasized that official accounts do not endorse any particular memecoin and warned users to be careful.

Japanese shares soared to a new record as investors bet on Sanae Takaichi securing the premiership, anticipating her 'fiscal dove' policies. Concurrently, China's markets advanced on the back of mildly positive economic growth figures. Markets also took note of easing Sino-US trade tensions, after US President Trump called his proposed tariffs on Chinese goods ""not sustainable"" as officials prepare for upcoming bilateral talks. Gold prices steadied at $4,250 per ounce on Monday after a sharp decline on Friday, with investors closely monitoring upcoming talks between the US and China. The annual inflation rate in New Zealand increased to 3% in the third quarter of 2025, the highest since the second quarter of 2024, from 2.7% in the previous period and in line with forecasts. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 3.03% to above 48,500 while the Topix Index climbed 1.2% to 3,210 on Monday, rebounding from the prior session’s losses. The Japanese yen weakened toward 151 per dollar on Monday, extending losses from the prior session, as investors prepared for Japan’s leadership vote on Tuesday. Bank of Japan policy board member Hajime Takata renewed his call for an interest rate hike, citing eased tariff concerns and progress toward the central bank’s inflation target. Sanae Takaichi is poised to become Japan’s first female prime minister after the right-wing Japan Innovation Party, Ishin, signaled its support, Reuters reported Monday. The parliamentary vote to choose Japan’s next leader will be held on October 21. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.53% to around 3,860 while the Shenzhen Component rallied 1.5% to 12,880 on Monday, recouping some losses from the previous session amid signs of easing Sino-US trade tensions, and the offshore yuan traded flat around 7.12 per dollar on Monday, holding near three-week highs as investors assessed a raft of fresh Chinese economic data. China's economy delivered a mixed performance in the third quarter of 2025 . On an annual basis, GDP growth eased to 4.8% from 5.2% in Q2, marking the slowest Y/Y pace since the third quarter of 2024. Despite the slower annual pace, the economy demonstrated surprising short-term strength, expanding by 1.1% on Q/Q basis Separate September activity data , which were also released on Monday, showed industrial output rose to 6.5% year-on-year , accelerating from a 5.2% increase in August and beating a forecast of 5.0%. Retail sales growth slowed to 3.0% in September, from 3.4% in August, marginally higher than forecast of 2.9%. China’s surveyed unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in September 2025, compared to market expectations and August’s six-month high of 5.3%. On the monetary policy front, the People’s Bank of China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for a fifth consecutive month, as widely expected, maintaining the one-year and five-year loan prime rates. China’s rare earth magnet exports fell 6.1% M/M to 5,774 metric tons in September 2025, ending three months of gains ahead of the government’s October expansion of export controls targeting users in the defense and semiconductor sectors. China imported no soybeans from the U.S. in September 2025 — the first time since November 2018 — as trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies deepened. Ahead of renewed trade talks, President Trump stated that rare earths, fentanyl, and soybeans are the main U.S. negotiation priorities with China. Trump specifically warned Beijing against using rare earths as a bargaining chip, telling reporters: ""I don't want them to play the rare earth game with us."" This follows his recent threat of 100% tariffs if China tightens controls on the critical minerals. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 2.39% to 25,885 around noon on Monday, rebounding sharply from a 2.5% drop in the prior session amid widespread gains across all sectors. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.71% to 84,423 in morning trade on Monday, gaining for the fourth straight session, mainly supported by tech and banking stocks. The Indian rupee was little changed to marginally higher around 88 per USD, hovering near a one-month-high. India is making “solid progress” in trade talks with the U.S. aimed at securing a trade deal and reducing punitive tariffs, Bloomberg News reported Sunday. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.41% to 8,976 on Monday, paring gains from last week, weighed down by sharp declines in the gold and other mining stocks. The Australian dollar strengthened to around $0.650 on Monday, extending gains from the previous session, amid optimism over a potential breakthrough in US-Australia trade talks. In the U.S. on Friday, all three major indexes ended higher as investors reacted positively to President Trump’s remarks easing fears of further trade escalation with China, while regional bank stocks rebounded following Thursday’s steep losses. U.S. stock futures higher on Monday after President Trump suggested tariffs on China could be cut if Beijing took steps benefiting the U.S.: Dow +0.29% ; S&P 500 +0.40% ; Nasdaq +0.54% .

DFDV's strategy focuses on SOL over BTC or ETH, betting on Solana's speed, scalability, and long-term dominance in blockchain. Staking SOL generates a 10% yield, covering convertible note costs and providing accretive returns, with potential for additional revenue streams. Risks remain due to SOL's volatility and competition, so position sizing should be modest, but the current NAV multiple makes DFDV attractive. DeFi Development Corp. ( DFDV ) is a Solana-based ( SOL-USD ) digital asset treasury company. I had a chance to speak with some of their team recently and clarify the strategy. I think their basic premise is sound for now, and as the price of DFDV isn't too bad, an appropriately sized investment in the stock makes for a decent Buy. Summary of Previous Thesis I originally covered DeFi in June, rating it a Hold. There was little operating history to review, as they had only just transformed the company into its digital asset treasury (""DAT"") model that spring. May 2025 Investor Presentation The DAT model (for DeFi and others) mainly entails raising capital and using it to purchase the target crypto (in this case, SOL). The general hope is that through some form of leverage, a DAT company can enjoy magnified returns as the underlying crypto appreciates over time. Screenshot from previous article (May 2025 Investor Presentation) This also gives the stock amplified volatility relative to its crypto. As SOL is already quite volatile compared to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), this implies DFDV could prove to be quite volatile as well. At the time, I could see the appeal for traders but not a clear up or down case, and so I left the stock with a neutral Hold rating. Recent Financial Picture The most recent Form 10Q covers the end of Q2. Its balance sheet shows the treasury model being implemented as intended, with nearly all the assets in digital assets ((SOL)), with most of the liabilities being their convertible debt. Balance Sheet (Q2 2025 Form 10Q) At the end of Q2, the value of their SOL position was about $89.2M. Q2 2025 Form 10Q While most of this was purchased in the period, quarterly results show the kind of yield they are capable of producing through staking. Of course, Q3 is completed, and its results will arrive soon. We do, however, have some important updates about their SOL holdings, which just came out on Thursday . It disclosed the following: Total SOL & SOL Equivalents Held: 2,195,926 Total SOL & SOL Equivalents Held ((USD)): Approximately $426M Total Shares Outstanding: 28.9M SOL per Share (""SPS""): 0.0760 SPS ((USD)): $14.67 October 2025 Investor Presentation As the stock price closed at $13.79 that same day, this is a discount to SPS per share. As only a few million in real liabilities (setting aside the convertible debt for a moment) existed in Q2 and likely haven't increased much, DFDV trades very close to its NAV. This expansion of the holdings follows various moves to raise capital in Q3. In July, there was a $112.5M convertible note offering . Then 4.2M shares were sold in August to raise another $125M. A $100M share repurchase program was also announced in September, but this likely won't be utilized for some time. October 2025 Investor Presentation Taking into account the convertible debt and warrants, fully diluted shares outstanding would be 40.2M and would make the current multiple to NAV 1.3x. So there's been activity on multiple fronts, and it's certainly worth re-assessing. Strategy and Outlook I got to understand DeFi's strategy and outlook better after speaking directly with management. Official Headshots (October 2025 Investor Presentation) Specifically, I spoke with Dan Kang (Chief Strategy Officer) and Pete Humiston (Head of Research). The conversation was insightful for a number of reasons. First, let's talk about something important that I did not mention last time. DeFi made a conscious choice to go outside of BTC with the DAT model and was the first to do so. When I asked why, they explained that it would be difficult to compete with companies like Strategy ( MSTR ) for investor attention at this stage. Selecting a non-BTC crypto was the only rational move, and then it was a question of betting on the native currency of what they believe to be the most promising blockchain network in the long run. Crypto Market Caps (coinmarketcap.com/) BTC is the obvious leader in crypto market caps. That's why Strategy chose it. For many, Ether ( ETH-USD ) would have been an obvious second choice, as the #2 market cap and the native currency of the Ethereum network, but DeFi went straight for SOL. While #6 currently, SOL's market cap stands above $100B, so it isn't small. Kang and Humiston both explained that they believe SOL will overtake ETH, so this was not a decision made flippantly. As they put it, Solana has three key advantages over the competing blockchains: it's faster, cheaper, and scalable . September 2025 Company Article While the debate will be settled over time, there is a strong case that SOL will be a contender in the crypto space for the foreseeable future. Given the volume of transactions, this is a big advantage, particularly when one thinks about the underlying purpose of a cryptocurrency: to facilitate transactions online. Whichever is best, forming a DAT based on SOL only makes sense if one believes there is some upside to doing so. October 2025 Company Presentation They believe SOL is a long-term 50X from a recent price of $200. The actual timetable for that, naturally, isn't something they endeavored to predict, but I suppose what really matters here is if they are ""directionally correct,"" particularly as the DAT model should amplify those returns. October 2025 Investor Presentation They base this 50X on the total revenue of global value transfer and what SOL should be worth as it gains more share of that. For DFDV to deliver strong returns, SOL will need to move in this direction appreciably over time, and they will need to acquire SOL cost-effectively. October 2025 Investor Presentation One of the good things about SOL is that staking it produces real yield, currently at 10%. The recent convertible note, with a 5.5% coupon, is therefore covered, assuming SOL's volatility doesn't mean that it declines. These notes therefore not only finance SOL accumulation but also produce a spread that is accretive to DFDV shareholders over time. Other forms of revenue are possible. Kang explained to me that they are open to experimenting with opportunities that come from holding large sums of SOL. There are certain arbitrage opportunities that present themselves already. They've entertained the possibility of issuing SOL-based loans, market-making, anything that churns extra value. It's going to depend on what people end up doing with SOL over time. These are all things that ETFs, passively marked to their cryptos, will not be able to do. Valuation and Risks With something like this, investors have to decide if they believe in the holdings and that their decisions will add value from there. I think an entry price for a NAV multiple of 1.2x or less makes sense, given the staking yields that are possible and the room for compounding this provides over time. Given that much of this is still speculative and untested, my current idea is that risk is better managed by not paying too much of a premium to NAV not treating upside without hiccups as a foregone conclusion. The value of SOL will depend on how well Solana competes with the blockchain platforms over time. Then, of course, these still have to compete well with BTC. Another factor that some should consider is the competition posed by stablecoins. While many may eschew them as nothing more than tokens of sovereign currencies that crypto is meant to bypass, stablecoins fill a similar need: fast transactions with virtually no cost. How the dust settles over time is unclear. In addition to a disciplined premium to NAV, interested investors really ought to size a position in DFDV modestly until a meaningful history of operating results shows clear and dependable value creation with their DAT model. After all, a strong decline in SOL would make the yields unable to cover the interest on those notes and make further capital raises difficult. Other than that, I think the basic premise is sound, and as the current NAV multiple is about 1.0x, DFDV can be a Buy. Conclusion DeFi made a bold move to break ranks with a non-BTC treasury. In a couple of key ways, I see it as more sound than Strategy's approach with BTC, given that SOL supports the Solana network and that it produces actual yield. With competitive strengths for SOL and general tailwinds around all cryptos, getting DFDV around NAV doesn't seem like a bad deal, so I upgrade to Buy for now.",DFDV,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-20 05:59:47

Analysts are expecting a 30x ROI cycle in 2025 for both Solana (SOL) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) after both of these assets flashed bullish divergence signals. Major Layer-1 and DeFi tokens are showing technical strength after months of being under pressure. Bitcoin remains stable near $107K. Many analysts also consider MAGACOIN FINANCE to be one of the most promising undervalued picks and hidden gems along with the Solana and HYPE powered by verifiable smart contracts with fast-growing investors. Solana’s Bullish Divergence and Institutional Accumulation Solana is showing signs of a bottoming out. The token has rallied over the last year by 37% and has now entered a consolidation of $185–$195. With daily transactions and active wallets dropping almost 50%, speculation seems to have run its course. However, whales keep on accumulating. Solana Price Chart: CoinGecko Technical indicators point to early strength. The key support level of $195 is turning upwards on the RSI at press time. A bullish divergence occurred when the price line was practically flat while the momentum oscillators were moving higher. (15 words) Institutional confidence is strong. This is demonstrated by Pantera Capital’s $1.25 billion Solana treasury purchase and REX-Osprey ETF exposure. If the price of SOL maintains the $200 level, analysts expect a move towards $240 – $290 by late October. This goes along with the overall story that big cash is quietly shifting for the next altcoin cycle. HYPE’s Technical Reversal Signals a Breakout Setup Hyperliquid (HYPE)’s price is big signal of a long-awaited recovery after months of sell-off. Hyperliquid is one of the fastest-growing derivatives-focused ecosystems. Technical readings show a clear bullish divergence as the RSI bounces off of oversold levels. Key metrics include. A descending wedge breakout is forming at support of $30.96 and is usually bullish in nature. According to on-chain data, there is an open interest of $15 billion and a total value locked (TVL) of $5 billion. The market structure has strengthened further due to prominent traders like Pentoshi on the contrarian accumulation and Hyperliquid’s $1.3 billion buyback. Experts believe that if the asset’s price breaks out positively above $44.57, it would validate the bullish divergence; this would send HYPE towards $60+ medium term. The strong liquidity and the institutional alignment of HYPE makes it a core player in 2025 rotation. Emerging Altcoin Opportunity: MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Momentum While Solana and HYPE lead the established altcoin narrative, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the community favorite among early-stage investors seeking explosive upside. The project has already raised over millions , supported by verified smart contracts and dual audits by Hashex , ensuring high levels of transparency and investor protection. Its deflationary model and early exchange integrations have made it one of the few presale assets positioned for institutional adoption. What’s fueling the excitement is the community and investor hype surrounding MAGACOIN FINANCE, a growing base of active wallets, organic marketing traction, and long-term scarcity dynamics. Analysts describe it as both an undervalued pick and a hidden gem, capable of capitalising on the same accumulation patterns now forming in Solana and HYPE. As institutional interest returns to crypto, MAGACOIN FINANCE sits in the sweet spot between speculative growth and verified credibility — a combination that could see it emerge as one of 2025’s standout presales. Market Interpretation and 2025 ROI Outlook HYPE and Solana had a bullish divergence daily. This means both these assets are far overdue for a much larger move. The tweezer bottom, technical signals converging with institutional accumulation, reminds me of early 2020 market conditions that preceded Bitcoin’s multi-year bull run. If Bitcoin remains steady around $107K, analysts expect an altcoin rotation across Layer-1s, DeFi and audited presale projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. The next phase could give 30x returns for early participants, particularly those assets which are seeing structural reversals and strong fundamentals. Conclusion Solana and HYPE are showing synchronized bullish divergence setups, underpinned by whale accumulation, improving RSI signals, and renewed institutional confidence. Analysts agree that these signs mark the beginning of a potential 30x ROI cycle heading into 2025. Following a comprehensive Hashex audit , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a 100% verified and trusted crypto presale, earning confidence from both retail investors and leading analysts. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered the spotlight as an undervalued presale gem, combining community-driven growth with verified transparency and investor hype. Together, these projects represent the intersection of stability, innovation, and high-upside opportunity in a market preparing for its next major rally.

53401122,609617,1760940036,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53401122.jpeg,ZachXBT Exposes $3 Million XRP Heist After Hardware Wallet Breach,https://bitcoinist.com/zachxbt-3-million-xrp-heist-hardware-wallet/,"On-chain sleuth ZachXBT has traced a $3.05 million theft of XRP from a US retail user to a laundering route that ran through Bridgers—an aggregator formerly associated with SWFT—and into over-the-counter venues linked to Huione, the Cambodian financial network that the US government moved last week to cut off from the American financial system. Publishing the findings on October 19, ZachXBT said a “US based victim lost $3.05M (1.2M XRP) from their Ellipal wallet,” adding: “Here’s the tracing of where the stolen funds ended up and the biggest takeaways for similar thefts.” Inside The $3 Million XRP Robbery In a thread, ZachXBT identified the theft address—r3cf5mgj5qEcj9n4Th28Es7NVRnXGJjkzc—by matching dates and amounts from a viral YouTube video. “Although the victim did not directly share the theft address… I found it by reviewing the date and amount,” he wrote. He cautioned that “the victim seems inexperienced and does not provide enough details to determine how the Ellipal wallet became compromised besides it being user error.” According to his reconstruction, the attacker rapidly converted the XRP across chains: “The attacker created 120+ Ripple -> Tron orders via Bridgers on Oct 12, 2025. On block explorers the transactions show as Binance since Bridgers (formerly SWFT) uses them for liquidity.” The funds were consolidated on Tron at TGF3hP5GeUPKaRJeWKpvF2PVVCMrfe2bYw on October 12 and, by October 15, “were completely laundered away to OTCs adjacent to Huione (illicit online marketplace in SEA),” he wrote. Bridgers bills itself as a “cross-chain swap” platform spanning dozens of networks; DappRadar documentation has also linked Bridgers to SWFT’s AllChain Bridge stack. The reference to Huione lands squarely in a fast-moving sanctions environment. On October 14, 2025, the US Treasury designated the Huione Group as a “primary money laundering concern,” effectively severing it from the US financial system for facilitating flows tied to Southeast Asian scam and trafficking networks; the action was coordinated alongside a UK sanctions package and parallel US actions targeting the Prince Group, a Cambodian conglomerate labeled by US authorities as a transnational criminal organization. ZachXBT’s thread placed the Ellipal wallet at the center of user confusion rather than a zero-day exploit of the hardware itself. “One lesson our industry needs to do better with is not causing confusion with products when you offer both custodial and non-custodial products. The XRP victim thought they were using the Ellipal cold wallet product when it was a hot wallet,” he wrote, drawing a parallel to “large Coinbase support impersonation thefts” where victims move assets from an exchange account to a compromised non-custodial wallet after social-engineering. Ellipal publicly corroborated the cold-to-hot wallet mix-up. “Our findings confirm that the loss occurred because the user mistakenly imported their cold wallet’s seed phrase into a hot wallet, which made the assets accessible online,” the company stated, stressing that its “air-gapped cold wallets remain 100% offline and have never been compromised since launch.” Ellipal said it had contacted the user and reiterated basic hygiene: never import cold-wallet seeds into app-based wallets, and keep recovery phrases and devices offline. The laundering arc ZachXBT described—fast cross-chain hops via an aggregator, consolidation on Tron, and distribution to OTC endpoints he characterizes as “adjacent to Huione”—mirrors typologies that US authorities have warned about as scam ecosystems professionalize. In his words: “Huione has directly facilitated laundering billions in illicit funds over the past couple years from pig butchering scams, investment scams, human trafficking and hacks/exploits in Southeast Asia … I hope centralized exchanges and stablecoin issuers implement stricter controls as they are one of the bigger threats impacting the longevity of our space.” The thread’s second theme is the structural difficulty of recovery. “The XRP victim mentioned… how they could not quickly get in touch with US law enforcement for a $3M theft,” he wrote, adding that there are “few LE qualified to handle such cases and endless victim reports so naturally incidents are overlooked,” though he cited the US, Netherlands, Singapore and France as comparatively better venues—contingent on the assigned investigator. He also criticized much of the crypto “recovery” cottage industry: “>95% of recovery companies are predatory and charge large amounts for basic reports with few actionable insights… Bad firms would have stopped tracing this XRP theft at Binance… when in reality the service was Bridgers or would have failed to identify addresses linked to Huione.” As for the odds of restitution, the outlook is grim. “Unfortunately the likelihood of this victim seeing any funds recovered is rather low due to a delay in reporting the theft to competent people within the private sector,” he concluded, urging rapid reporting of theft addresses to maximize the chance of freezing flows at chokepoints. He also faulted ecosystem-level support: “Ripple does not have as good of a support system for victims within their community as there is in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and major EVM chains.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.44.",XRP|hardware wallet|Hardware Wallet Hack|XRP Hack|XRP news|XRP price,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|EXCHANGE|MACROECONOMICS|ASIA,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-20 06:00:36

This is Apple’s first quantifiable look at how the new iPhone is doing in its two most important markets, and so far, things are moving fast. According to data from Bloomberg, the base iPhone 17, priced at $799, is showing much higher demand than the iPhone 16 did at launch. In China, sales of the standard iPhone 17 model are already nearly double what the iPhone 16 managed in the same launch window. That growth is reportedly being credited to hardware, not hype. The iPhone 17 now ships with more storage, a better screen, and Apple’s new A19 chip, an upgrade from last year’s version that’s actually being noticed by buyers. “Consumers are resonating with the base model iPhone 17 on improved specs and upgrades,” said Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint. “In China, sales are almost double those of the base iPhone 16 over the initial availability period – and the momentum continues to be good into October.” Apple sees Pro Max bump from pandemic-era users While the base model is moving fast, it’s not the only one. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is also getting a strong response, especially in the US. Buyers who haven’t upgraded since the pandemic are now returning for Apple’s highest-end version, which comes with redesigned physical features, an overhauled heat system, and the best camera setup Apple’s ever sold in a phone. Even with all this hardware attention, the company is still facing serious problems on the software side. Apple’s rollout of AI features is still a mess. Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in China yet, and its troubled Siri upgrade is now delayed into next year. Despite all that, the iPhone is still holding up sales-wise, Apple still relies on it for about half of its revenue, and it’s working for now. Outside the phone business, Apple also launched a new 14-inch MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Vision Pro, but didn’t even bother throwing an event for it. All three were quietly announced on a Wednesday morning, and the changes are barely noticeable. These are what Apple calls “chip-and-ship” refreshes, they stuck in the new M5 chip, which benchmarks 15% to 20% faster than the M4, but most people won’t notice. Internally, even Apple is pushing these products as replacements for old Intel MacBooks or first-gen M1 devices. AI division loses top engineers as Siri continues to stall Inside Apple, things are falling apart in the AI department. The company’s efforts to reboot Siri have been chaotic since last year, and now it’s losing key staff. The Apple Foundation Models team has already lost its founder and about a dozen engineers. More exits are on the way. Just this week, Ke Yang, who led Apple’s Answers, Knowledge and Information (AKI) unit, quit and joined Meta Platforms Inc. He was supposed to be in charge of making Siri more like ChatGPT, but he only lasted a few weeks before walking out. He replaced Robby Walker, who also left recently. Yang wasn’t well-liked inside the team, but the back-to-back departures are still a disaster. Apple is now testing iOS 26.4, which is supposed to include the new Siri. But people testing the build are already raising issues with how well it works. Meanwhile, the company’s top AI executive, John Giannandrea, also known as JG, is under pressure. JG’s responsibilities have already been trimmed: Siri was moved into Apple’s software group, and robotics was reassigned to the hardware division. There are already talks that Craig Federighi and Mike Rockwell are stepping in to manage more of Apple’s AI roadmap. At the same time, Apple is reportedly interviewing outsiders to replace JG altogether. He was brought in back in 2018 to lead Apple’s AI direction, but things clearly haven’t gone as planned.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-xrp-to-the-white-house-heres-what-is-coming/,"Ripple’s engagement with the political establishment continues to draw attention following its attendance at the recent White House gala hosted for top donors and business leaders. The event, reported as a major ballroom celebration featuring key figures from the political and financial sectors, marked a notable milestone in Ripple’s outreach strategy that began with the hiring of prominent Republican lobbyist Brian Ballard in late 2024. According to a tweet from crypto researcher SMQKE, Ripple retained Ballard Partners on November 13, 2024, to lobby on issues relating to the “regulation of digital assets, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and related legislation.” The decision came during a period of heightened regulatory scrutiny, positioning Ripple to engage more directly with lawmakers and policymakers in Washington. The firm’s expanded presence in these circles underscores its transition from a litigant in one of the most-watched SEC cases to a stakeholder in shaping the future of crypto regulation in the United States . Trump Invites Top Donors to White House Gala: Crypto Giant @Ripple Among the Guests at $250M Ballroom Celebration #Trump #Crypto https://t.co/NEmJSvRCi3 pic.twitter.com/gAncVFFqEL — 𝗕𝗮𝗻𝗸XRP (@BankXRP) October 16, 2025 Ripple Among Guests at White House Donor Gala Ripple’s attendance at the White House gala placed the company among other major donors and industry leaders at a high-profile political event held in Washington. The gala, widely described as a $250 million celebration, featured business executives, policymakers, and senior administration figures. Ripple’s inclusion reflects its increasingly close engagement with national political networks following years of legal and regulatory challenges. Analysts view the occasion as evidence of Ripple’s successful navigation of Washington’s complex political landscape. By aligning with influential lobbying partners and maintaining open channels with policymakers, Ripple appears to have solidified its position as one of the most politically connected entities in the digital asset industry. Community Commentary and Market Interpretation Crypto commentator Crypto Dog noted that Ripple’s 2024 lobbying effort “worked,” referencing subsequent regulatory outcomes, including the SEC’s dropped appeal and the company’s reported $125 million settlement while continuing XRP operations. The post also mentioned Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty’s participation in a dinner at Mar-a-Lago with President Trump, characterizing the gala invitation as an extension of their growing access to political power.

The company’s presence at both formal policy discussions and high-level social functions points to a carefully coordinated strategy that merges compliance advocacy with political diplomacy. Strategic Implications for the U.S. Crypto Sector Ripple’s involvement in events of this caliber emphasizes a turning point for the digital asset sector’s role in U.S. policymaking. As the administration advances its stance on blockchain innovation and crypto regulation, Ripple’s positioning within this framework could shape forthcoming legislative and regulatory directions. For policymakers, the company’s growing influence highlights the increasing intersection between digital finance and political advocacy. For the broader market, it underscores how strategic lobbying and institutional outreach can define the next phase of crypto’s integration into the U.S. financial system. Ripple’s White House gala appearance stands as a visible indicator of its strengthened influence and the evolving relationship between Washington and the crypto industry.

Analyst Sees Echoes Of 2021,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/is-the-dogecoin-bull-run-echoes-of-2021/,"Cantonese Cat argues that Dogecoin remains structurally primed for a late-cycle surge that would track the pattern of prior crypto bull markets, insisting that the coin’s decisive move has not yet arrived. In a 50-minute market analysis published on Oct. 19, the analyst ties Dogecoin’s setup to liquidity cycles and inter-market signals, but emphasizes that the DOGE read is simple: the market hasn’t seen the characteristic Dogecoin breakout that, in past cycles, has coincided with Bitcoin’s final acceleration. “Whenever you have Bitcoin going up, Dogecoin also is forming a pretty decent base,” he said, noting that DOGE has participated only marginally while Bitcoin has ground higher. The trigger, in his view, is explicit. “Once you have Doge breaking into all-time high… that can happen in a hurry… once you have Doge breaking [its] all-time high, generally that’s when the acceleration phase of Bitcoin begins.” He frames that relationship as a recurring feature of cycle dynamics rather than an exception, arguing that the absence of a Dogecoin all-time-high breakout is one of several reasons he rejects the thesis that the broader crypto cycle has already ended. Is The Dogecoin Bull Run Over? Cantonese Cat links that call to the broader backdrop of risk appetite and liquidity, but he repeatedly narrows the lens to DOGE itself. He characterizes recent price action as a wear-you-out phase—punctuated by a sharp deleveraging “last week… with a big giant wick”—that has hardened bearish sentiment without invalidating the longer-term structure. “We haven’t had Doge breaking the all-time high yet… We have the deleveraging event, but we haven’t had [the] breakout into all-time high,” he said, adding that the coin’s base-building is consistent with how earlier cycles have unfolded before rapid upside. Part of his conviction stems from how he reads Bitcoin dominance and the timing of altcoin rotations. He argues that dominance has run for “2022, 2023, 2024, almost the bulk of 2025,” looks “a little bit tired,” and has been moving sideways for roughly a year. In his framework, a turn lower in dominance would not necessarily mean Bitcoin weakness; rather, it would imply outperformance by altcoins. “If we end the cycle right here… this will be the very first time ever that we haven’t had any rotations from Bitcoin to altcoins and we haven’t had that parabolic phase—and this time would be different.” He is explicit that he does not buy the “this time is different” narrative, stating, “I just don’t really think that the cycle is different from [the] previous [one]… because things are still playing out.” Related Reading: Next Dogecoin Stop Could Be $0.33 If This Level Holds, Analyst Says The Dogecoin-specific takeaway is that the market’s recent stress does not negate the historical sequencing he expects. He argues that the coin’s signature move typically arrives after prolonged compression, often in a condensed window. “Last time [it] only happened within like a couple months and next thing you know it’s just like whoa what happened,” he recalled, cautioning that DOGE’s acceleration window can open quickly once resistance gives way. That pattern recognition underpins his pushback against entrenched pessimism: “A lot of people are just extremely bitter about Doge because this cycle has been wearing everybody out,” he said, but he views that sentiment as typical of pre-breakout conditions rather than evidence of structural failure. Related Reading: Dogecoin Shows ‘Huge Gap’ To $0.07: Is A Crash Imminent? Cantonese Cat repeatedly stresses that he is not giving financial advice and allows that his call could be wrong. Still, he returns to the same fulcrum: Dogecoin hasn’t delivered the hallmark event of a completed cycle. Until it does—or definitively fails—he treats the coin as coiled rather than concluded. “The reality [is], I just don’t really think that the cycle is different… We haven’t had that [DOGE] breakout,” he said, summing up the risk-on bias that animates his view. In other words, for traders positioning around late-cycle outcomes, his message is that the “Dogecoin moment” remains ahead of the tape—and that the bears could be early. DOGE Is Price Targets Although the analyst does not cite fresh DOGE targets in the Oct. 19 video, he defers to levels from his earlier work, where he laid out several price-target frameworks for Dogecoin. In those prior notes, he argued that DOGE could be entering Wave 3 of an Elliott Wave structure after reclaiming the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement of the previous impulse ($0.20088). From that framework, he highlighted upside projections around $0.48 (1.0 extension), $0.89 (1.272), $1.23 (1.414), and $1.96 (1.618). In variant commentary, he has also floated outcomes $2.00+ if a breakout accelerates, and in a more speculative scenario—likely from a separate video—he said, “I’m going to lay down the case as to why I think DOGE can hit $4 this cycle…”. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.201.

BTC-USD has breached key support levels, including the 200-day EMA and 78.6% Fibonacci retracement, suggesting further downside risk below $100,000. Bearish volume trends and technical patterns in ETH-USD and SOL-USD reinforce the negative outlook for the broader cryptocurrency market. I lower my outlook to 'Buy' but recommend waiting for a significant pullback, targeting new entries near $93,500, and reassessing if prices fall further. When I last covered Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on May 21, 2025, in my article ""Bitcoin: Maybe I Wasn't Wrong,"" the cryptocurrency markets were in the process of slowing down after seeing a strong bullish rebound from the April lows near $75,000. In the article, I discussed some of the positives supporting further upside in BTC-USD (for example, reasons for potential weakness in the U.S. dollar). I also discussed some of the negative chart analysis signals, which suggested that cryptocurrency markets might be on the verge of nearing a top. Since the publication of my prior article, trend activity in BTC-USD has been mostly bullish, but we are actually closing this period in declining territory (with losses of nearly -3% compared to gains of more than 14% in the S&P 500). Now that my prior concerns about a possible top in cryptocurrency markets seem to be strengthening in intensity, I will be lowering my outlook to a ""buy"" rating and outlining some important price levels that might be used for potential long entries if BTC-USD prices continue moving lower into the end of 2025. BTC-USD: Short-Term Trend Reversal Signals (Income Generator via Trading View) When conducting this type of analysis, I like to start with a bit of a mid-range timeframe. First, we will be looking at the 4-hour charts, which are great for analyzing price histories over a time horizon of about two months. In this case, we can already see that there is evidence of trend change, as a downward-sloping trend channel has accompanied a break of important support zones and bearish trend momentum readings in the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator. Some might argue that shorter-term timeframe perspectives might not offer helpful trading information for longer-term investors. But I disagree. I think chart signals like this can be quite useful in terms of being able to define significant trend reversal areas (major price tops and bottoms). BTC-USD Daily Chart: Downside Breach of -2 Standard Deviation (Income Generator via Trading View) Short-term warning signals must always be taken into consideration with longer-term trend direction. On the daily charts, I think a couple of different interpretations can be seen. For example, recent declines in BTC-USD have sent prices below the -2 standard deviation. Typically, this can be viewed as a bullish signal because only 2-3% of all price action would be expected to be contained outside of this boundary. However, we can also see that BTC-USD recently fell below its 200-day exponential moving average ((EMA)) and this can be a major indicator of negative trend acceleration. Moreover, most of the recent spikes in trading volume have shown surges in selling pressure, while buying trading volume activity has been much more subdued. On balance, I would have to say that these negative signals trump the argument that the latest fall below the -2 standard deviation should be viewed as a buying opportunity. BTC-USD: Evidence of Bullish Price Trend Completion (Income Generator via Trading View) Looking into specific trend-wave movements, we can also identify reasons to believe that the June-October bull rally might actually be coming to a close. If we assess market activity from the June 2025 lows near $98,225 and then extend to the October highs, we can see that the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement (which rests just below $104,500) has recently been breached. This is significant because the 78.6% retracement is the last major support zone preventing a complete retracement (or a 100% retracement). In other words, once Fibonacci support near $104,500 is broken, the next downside price target calls for a move back below $100k. ETH-USD: Bearish Head and Shoulders Pattern (Income Generator via Trading View) Unfortunately, if we look elsewhere in the cryptocurrency space, we can see similar bearish themes. For example, ETH-USD is currently trying to bounce from the 200-day EMA. But this is looking like a relatively clear Head & Shoulders structure, with the ""left shoulder"" forming near $4,792 and the ""head"" of the pattern forming near $4,955. In this case, the ""right shoulder"" comes into play near $4,768, and the ""neckline"" of the pattern (the nearest major support zone) was breached shortly thereafter. On the bullish side, pattern invalidation could have been seen if that right shoulder resistance zone had broken in early October. However, as we can see, that upward price move actually resulted in a double-top resistance level that was followed by more pronounced selling pressure. Similar to BTC-USD, trading volume spikes in Ethereum have been mostly negative in nature, and this is why it doesn't look like that 200-day EMA will hold as support much longer. SOL-USD: More Negative Trading Volume Activity (Income Generator via Trading View) If we look at the daily charts for Solana ( SOL-USD ), we can see that the 200-day EMA has already broken and the most recent trend high of $237.96 failed to overcome Solana's prior resistance levels near $253.60. Again, we are seeing daily trading volume spikes that are more negative than positive. At this stage, the real question is whether these factors will turn out to be more important than the moves (in all three of these major cryptocurrencies) below the second standard deviation. In my view, I think the directional agreement in all of these daily price histories more strongly suggests that we will be seeing a downward realignment in these longer-term standard deviation channels (rather than an upside bounce near-term). BTC-USD: Bullish Harmonic Patterns Present (Income Generator via Trading View) On the other side of the equation, I did want to highlight the development of a bullish harmonic pattern, which began to form in mid-October. Specifically, this is a bullish bat pattern that is based on a series of Fibonacci retracement zones and outlines a potential upside price target above $113,500. Now, if this price target is met, that movement would invalidate my assumption that the next trend leg is lower because resistance zones near $11,800 would need to be broken. Indicator readings (as measured by the relative strength index) are currently near the middle of the histogram, so this suggests that there is still potential for sizable upside before BTC-USD prices become overbought. Of course, this bullish pattern becomes invalidated if BTC-USD prices fall below $101,390, so this outlook gives us a few ""lines in the sand"" to use when determining whether the next major trend direction is bullish or bearish. More broadly, I have not fully reversed my bullish stance on BTC-USD. Debt levels in the United States make it difficult for me to believe in the long-term superiority of the greenback, but I do think that it makes more sense for cryptocurrency bulls to step away from the recent hype. In my view, most of the evidence suggests that we will need to see a sizable leg lower in BTC-USD before we can start to look for new buying opportunities. In my own trading, I have closed 35% of my prior long position and set my next buy orders above the May 6th lows near $93,500. From a support/resistance perspective, this area marks the pivot point for my trading outlook. So, if we did see a price movement below these levels, I would reassess my stance and consider trading BTC-USD from the bearish perspective.",ETH-USD|SOL-USD|BTC-USD,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|SOL,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-20 06:50:01

Japan Considers Giving Local Banks Crypto Trading Authority The agency is considering amending existing oversight guidelines to remove restrictions preventing banks from investing in digital assets. Under current regulations, Japanese banks are prohibited from holding or trading digital assets due to the volatility of cryptocurrencies. However, the new reform plan aims to establish a system that would allow banks to buy and sell crypto assets like stocks or government bonds. In parallel with this potential regulation, the FSA also plans to establish new supervisory frameworks to mitigate financial risks. The proposed reform will be discussed at an upcoming meeting of the Financial Services Council, an advisory body to the Prime Minister. The agency is also considering allowing banks to register as crypto exchanges, aiming to provide retail investors with easier access to the crypto market through trusted banks. Meanwhile, the FSA is working to make the digital asset market in Japan more transparent. The agency is reportedly preparing to introduce new regulatory changes that explicitly prohibit trading based on confidential information and has stated that individuals caught committing such violations will be subject to fines commensurate with their illicit profits. *This is not investment advice.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently priced at just $0.035, the lowest price it can ever be, in its Phase 6 presale, is being hailed by early investors as a potential rival to Cardano (ADA) in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. While Cardano continues to expand its ecosystem through slow, methodical upgrades, Mutuum Finance is rapidly building momentum with its dual-lending protocol that merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems, a model designed for speed, efficiency, and scalability. With over 70% of its current phase sold out and $17.65 million already raised, MUTM is quickly gaining recognition as a crypto to buy now before it lists on major exchanges. For investors looking beyond the traditional giants, Mutuum Finance offers a rare opportunity, a low-cost entry into a project with the potential to be 2025’s next millionaire-maker. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis: Bulls Target $0.79 as Significant Support Resists Cardano (ADA) investors pay close attention to price action around the $0.6650–$0.6680 level of support, which has become the battleground between the bears and bulls. Rejected twice at $0.7355, ADA now occupies a turning point position, a break above $0.68 could spark a rocket to $0.79, while a slide below $0.66 could unleash a more substantial correction to around $0.61. Guarded sentiment still pervades markets, though ongoing development activity and persistent ecosystem growth of ADA still entice long-term investors to buy the top crypto to invest in. While Cardano holds its spot among the fastest-growing layer-1 projects, investors are also eager to diversify into new cryptos to buy in 2025, with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now on many investors’ radars. Mutuum Finance’s Gradual Growth Triggers Confidence in the Market Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rising in the DeFi scene as one of the top cryptos to keep an eye on this year. Sitting in Presale Phase 6, the token sells at $0.035, a rise of 16.17% from Phase 5. This is the cheapest MUTM will ever go for. Investment interest remains high, with a total of more than 17,300 participants who have bought more than $17.65 million to date. With over 70% of Phase 6 sold, Mutuum Finance is seeing record interest, which should continue for its growing success as a high-growth cryptocurrency with promising long-term opportunities. Early investors are looking to cash in on astronomical profits as MUTM nears the open market, establishing itself as one of the best cryptocurrency to invest in and a leading crypto to buy now for strategic positioning. Mutuum Finance Sets Stage to Launch Its Lending & Borrowing Protocol Next on Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is to release a lending and borrowing protocol , which will be the foundation upon which its DeFi platform will be constructed. Its V1 version will go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with features such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. And with the launch event, users will be able to collateralize, borrow, and lend USDT and ETH, offering retail and institutional users a fast, secure, and highly scalable DeFi experience. Highlights of Daily Leaderboard Mutuum Finance leaderboard is surprising investors with massive community-incentivized rewards. No. 1 to No. 3 largest buyers in last 24 hours have invested 1,814, 1,487, 1,205 respectively on MUTM tokens reflecting higher activity and investor engagement. Most active one-day buyer receives a $500 MUTM reward. They just have to carry out a successful buy during the 24-hour window. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as the best cryptocurrency to invest in, drawing over $17.65 million from 17,300 investors, with over 70% of Phase 6 sold out at $0.035. Evidence of market confidence comes from its twin-lending DeFi protocol and leaderboard rewards in real-time. MUTM is not only among the top cryptocurrencies for 2025 but also one of the most promising cryptos to buy now for investors seeking high potential returns. Early bird investors can buy MUTM tokens ahead of the next phase and set themselves up for substantial upside as the project picks up momentum, cementing it as the best cryptocurrency to invest in and a leading crypto to buy now in the DeFi market.

Here’s the Latest,https://timestabloid.com/walmart-xrp-integration-involving-rlusd-underway-heres-the-latest/,"Crypto expert Chad Steingraber recently highlighted an important development linking Walmart’s fintech arm, OnePay, to XRP and Ripple’s ecosystem. In his post, Steingraber pointed out that OnePay’s upcoming crypto services are being built with support from ZeroHash, the same infrastructure provider now utilizing Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. This connection places XRP in a stronger strategic position as institutional adoption builds and as the asset gains more prominent roles in large financial systems. The Walmart OnePay crypto deal is with a company called ZeroHash. Guess what ZeroHash is using as a stablecoin. RLUSD. // XRP https://t.co/aUHNWSSNHM pic.twitter.com/ywc18vT5Wm — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) October 20, 2025 The OnePay Expansion and ZeroHash Collaboration OnePay, the digital finance platform majority-owned by Walmart, recently announced plans to integrate cryptocurrency trading and custody within its mobile app. The platform, launched in partnership with venture firm Ribbit Capital, aims to evolve into a full-service financial application offering savings products, credit and debit cards, and digital asset management. According to CNBC, OnePay will initially provide users access to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with ZeroHash powering the custody and trading infrastructure. ZeroHash, a regulated crypto infrastructure firm based in Chicago, manages compliance, liquidity, and settlement services for institutions entering the digital asset space. In early 2025, ZeroHash confirmed support for RLUSD , enabling deposits, withdrawals, and trading for the stablecoin. This update went live earlier this year, as reflected in ZeroHash’s developer documentation, which stated that RLUSD is now “available using the above symbols” for certified platforms. XRP’s Role Strengthened Through RLUSD Integration The integration of RLUSD across ZeroHash’s infrastructure aligns with Ripple’s ongoing effort to enhance the utility of the XRP Ledger for institutional-grade payments and tokenized assets. Because OnePay relies on ZeroHash for its crypto trading operations, the underlying infrastructure could naturally increase the exposure and use of XRP and the XRPL through RLUSD. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Steingraber emphasized this connection as a sign that XRP’s role in real-world finance continues to expand. By supporting RLUSD, ZeroHash effectively extends the ledger’s presence into new consumer-facing financial systems. The move positions XRP as a foundational element for liquidity and settlement within platforms that rely on ZeroHash for crypto integration, such as OnePay and other fintech clients. Institutional Momentum Ripple’s introduction of RLUSD in late 2024 was designed to bridge traditional finance with blockchain-based settlements . The stablecoin’s multi-chain functionality, operating on both XRP and Ethereum, reflects Ripple’s commitment to interoperability and transparency. With institutions like ZeroHash adopting RLUSD, Ripple’s infrastructure gains another layer of integration that enhances XRP’s visibility across regulated financial applications.

Details Here,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/chinese-government-slows-down-tech-companies-plans-to-launch-stablecoins-details-here/,"According to the Financial Times, the Chinese government has slowed down the process by interfering with the projects of major technology companies planning to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong. Beijing Halts Plans for Chinese Tech Giants to Issue Stablecoins in Hong Kong The news, based on sources close to the matter, stated that Alibaba subsidiary Ant Group and JD.com were affected by these initiatives. Both companies had previously requested permission to issue yuan-pegged stablecoins in closed-door meetings with officials from the People's Bank of China (PBoC), shortly before Hong Kong's new stablecoin licensing regime came into effect. However, both the PBoC and the Cyberspace Administration of China have advised these companies to suspend their plans, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. Five different sources reported that the PBoC is concerned about private companies issuing any form of “currency,” adding that such stablecoins could pose potential competition to the digital yuan (e-CNY), whose use remains limited. Speaking at a closed finance forum in late August, former PBoC chairman Zhou Xiaochuan highlighted two key concerns regarding the stability of stablecoins: “First, there is the risk of excessive money supply through stablecoin issuance without 100% reserve requirements. Second, there is the multiplier effect of highly leveraged monetary derivatives.” Zhou emphasized that while both the US’s GENIUS Act and Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Regulation have addressed these issues, control mechanisms are still inadequate. Ant Group and JD.com were among 77 companies interested in obtaining stablecoin licenses, according to data released by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in September. While Hong Kong aims to become a “regulatory sandbox” hub for crypto and digital asset startups, authorities in mainland China are taking a more cautious stance. Chinese regulators have recently clamped down on efforts to tokenize real assets in Hong Kong. Some major brokerage firms were advised to suspend these projects and were also asked to stop publishing research reports supporting stablecoins. *This is not investment advice.

Ethereum Poised for Takeoff,https://cryptopotato.com/last-call-for-eth-ethereum-poised-for-takeoff/,"Ethereum is showing strong technical signals that may point to a major upward move. Several analysts are tracking key patterns, support levels, and price zones that have historically preceded large rallies. With ETH now holding above important levels, focus is shifting to whether momentum will continue through the end of the year. Monthly Breakout Points to Higher Targets Crypto trader Merlijn The Trader posted a monthly chart showing Ethereum breaking out from a long-term pennant, which formed after ETH’s run to its 2021 peak near $4,800 and years of sideways movement inside a tightening range. The breakout above this pattern suggests new bullish momentum. The analyst called it “ the most explosive setup since 2017 ,” with a potential path toward $8,000–$8,500. The asset has already moved above the pennant’s resistance, and current momentum appears to be in line with previous market cycles. Ethereum is trading around $4,100 at press time, showing a 4% gain in the past 24 hours. Moreover, a separate chart from EtherNasyonaL compares Ethereum’s current movement to past cycles. In both 2016 and 2020, ETH retested a key demand area before rallying. The same behavior appears to be happening again in 2025. They noted, ARE NOT BULLISH ENOUGH ABOUT $ETH . In the 1st and 2nd cycles, Ethereum tested the major demand zone before going parabolic. Today, the same scene is being re-enacted. The difference is that most people still leave the theater before the curtain rises. pic.twitter.com/0l92xFNtht — EᴛʜᴇʀNᴀꜱʏᴏɴᴀL (@EtherNasyonaL) October 19, 2025 Notably, the demand zone has held, and the price has rebounded from that area. The pattern is consistent with how ETH moved in earlier bull markets. Support Retest After Breakout Holds for Now According to The Long Investor, Ethereum recently broke out of a multi-year wedge and is now retesting the top of that wedge as new support. For the past three weeks, ETH has traded in the $3,700–$3,900 range, holding just above that line. The trader believes ETH has 10 days or less to stay above this level to confirm the breakout. If support holds, the move could mirror Ethereum’s rally in 2020, which followed a similar breakout and support test. The chart suggests a price target of around $8,200 if the structure continues to hold. Source: The Long Investor/X Momentum Mixed as MVRV Turns Lower Analyst Daan Crypto Trades shared that ETH is testing both the 0.382 Fibonacci level and the daily 200 EMA. He noted, “I would want to see this back above those previous cycle highs at $4.1K to get the momentum back in favor of the bulls.” Holding that area could give the price the push needed to continue higher. However, another view comes from Ali Martinez, who pointed to a warning signal from the MVRV Momentum indicator. The 160-day MVRV line has crossed below its moving average, a move that last occurred before ETH dropped from $3,300 to $1,400. That same pattern just returned, raising concern about a possible short-term pullback. The post Last Call for ETH?

Bitcoin price has jumped to $111,000 for the first time in a week, while Ethereum has moved above $4,000. The market capitalization of all coins has jumped to over $3.77 trillion, while the 24-hour volume soared by 60% to $158 billion. This rally is happening as investors remain optimistic about a trade deal between the US and China. To be clear: as we wrote earlier, this crypto market rally may be a dead-cat bounce (DCB). A DCB is a temporary gain that happens when an asset is in a freefall. It is also known as a bull trap. Best Altcoins to buy in a crypto bull run This article explores some of the best altcoins to buy if this crypto bull run sticks. The most notable ones are Ripple (XRP), Chainlink (LINK), and Bittensor (TAO). XRP price to benefit from key catalysts XRP is one of the best altcoins to buy if there is a crypto bull run. It has numerous catalysts that will help it bounce back from the current bear market. The first main catalyst is that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely approve multiple XRP ETFs that have been filed by top companies like Franklin Templeton, Invesco, and Bitwise. These ETFs have a high chance of attracting inflows from American investors. A good example of this is the ongoing performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum funds, which have attracted over $60 billion and $12 billion in assets since last year. The other notable catalyst that will boost the XRP price is the ongoing growth of the Ripple USD (RLUSD), which is about to cross the $1 billion asset milestone. Additionally, the XRP price will likely be boosted by the recent Ripple Labs acquisitions, including companies like GTreasury, Rail, and Hidden Road. All these companies will be integrated in the XRP Ledger over time. XRP Ledger is also gaining market share in other industries, including the real-world asset (RWA) sector. Its total value locked in the RWA industry has jumped to over $362 million. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink price has crashed in the past few days, mirroring the performance of the overall crypto market. Still, LINK is one of the best crypto to buy once the crypto bull run starts. First, the amount of LINK tokens in the Strategic Reserves has continued rising this month. These reserves have jumped to over $9.3 million, up from zero a few months ago. Second, Chainlink price will benefit from the ongoing growth of industries like real-world asset (RWA) and decentralization. Chainlink has already inked deals with some of the top companies in finance, like JPMorgan, Swift, and Coinbase. Its total value secured (TVS) has jumped to over $60 billion. Third, like XRP, the SEC will likely approve the Grayscale and Bitwise Chainlink ETFs either this year or in 2026. Those funds will likely lead to more demand in the coming months. Bittensor (TAO) Bittensor is another top crypto to buy as its token jumps. TAO token jumped from a low of $200 to the current $450. It is hovering at the highest point since October 15. Bittensor is a top crypto to buy because of the ongoing AI boom and the recently launched Grayscale TAO boom. This is notable because Bittensor is one of the top players in the AI space, where it offers an open marketplace or AI. As a result, instead of the AI industry being controlled by a few centralized companies, its design allows it to reward anyone who contributes models or data. The other top altcoins to buy are the likes of Mantle, Binance Coin (BNB), and Aerodrome Finance (AERO).

53403866,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=840099,1760944658,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53403866.jpeg,Europe to end reliance on Russian gas under 2027 phaseout plan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/europe-plans-final-split-from-russian-gas/,"Europe is pushing through a final plan to cut off all Russian gas by the end of 2027, according to information from Bloomberg. Energy ministers from across the EU met on Monday in Luxembourg to agree on the details of a sweeping law that would permanently end the bloc’s use of Russian gas, more than three years after Vladimir Putin’s full invasion of Ukraine triggered the energy breakup. The ban kicks off with a prohibition on short-term Russian gas contracts starting mid-June, though Hungary and Slovakia, two landlocked countries with no alternatives, will be exempt for now. That exemption doesn’t extend far; long-term contracts will be banned too, just 18 months later. The law only needs support from a qualified majority of member states, meaning it can still pass even if Hungary or Slovakia votes against it. Europe secures $750B LNG deal with Trump as Moscow exit accelerates At the same time, Europe is under pressure from the United States to speed up this exit and buy more American liquefied natural gas instead. The push comes directly from President Donald Trump, whose administration signed a joint EU-US statement that outlines $750 billion in energy trade between the two sides over the next three years. Dan Jorgensen, the EU’s energy commissioner, said last week, “We are working closely together with the American administration in the field of energy. We are in the process of diversifying our gas imports.” That “diversification” means dumping Russian gas and going heavier on U.S. LNG, no matter the cost. The European Parliament still wants more. Members are calling for a faster exit timeline and even a ban on Russian oil imports starting next year, which will be debated later this year. The final version of the law is expected to be ready before 2025 closes. But this isn’t just a political move. It’s about cash. Russia is still Europe’s second-largest LNG supplier, after the U.S. The EU imports about 15% of its LNG from Moscow, with monthly bills ranging from €500 million ($584 million) to €700 million. These gas payments, critics argue, keep flowing straight into Putin’s war machine. That’s why the European Commission is also pushing for a ban on Russian LNG imports by the end of 2025, part of the broader RepowerEU plan that’s guiding the bloc’s full detachment from Russian fossil fuels. Leaders are set to meet later this week in Brussels to discuss that part of the plan, along with how the 2027 gas ban lines up with the Trump-LNG deal and other electrification goals. EU talks technicals, Ukraine’s grid, oil prices, and the Middle East Back in Luxembourg, ministers are still sorting through technical problems around the gas ban. That includes how gas imports are pre-authorized for entry into the bloc. There’s also a session scheduled to review the energy situation in Ukraine and how that grid might be integrated with the EU’s wider electrification strategy. Meanwhile, oil markets are bleeding. Brent crude dropped 0.29% to $61.11, while WTI dipped 0.35% to $57.34, both extending a third straight weekly loss of more than 2%. Traders are watching demand slow down and supply ramp up. No one’s buying. Everyone’s stocked. The International Energy Agency just raised its forecast for global oil supply growth and warned of a supply surplus by 2026. That warning lands while OPEC+ continues unwinding its earlier production cuts, meaning even more oil is set to hit the market. On top of that, the Gaza ceasefire has cooled fears of a major Middle East supply disruption, adding to the downward pressure on prices.

Key Takeaways: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand will host a roundtable with top crypto CEOs to revive stalled talks on US crypto market structure legislation. Industry leaders from Coinbase, Chainlink, Ripple, Uniswap, and others are expected to attend. The discussion comes amid growing partisan divide, with Democrats and Republicans proposing competing regulatory frameworks. The meeting, led by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, comes as bipartisan negotiations over comprehensive crypto rules remain stuck in Congress, according to journalist Eleanor Terrett . Gillibrand, a co-sponsor of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act alongside Senator Cynthia Lummis, has emerged as one of the few Democrats openly advocating for regulatory clarity in the sector. Top Crypto CEOs to Join Senate Democrats for Market Structure Roundtable Executives expected to attend include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov, Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz, Kraken’s David Ripley, Uniswap’s Hayden Adams, Circle’s Dante Disparte, Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty, Jito’s Rebecca Rettig, a16z Crypto’s Miles Jennings, and Solana Policy Institute’s Kristin Smith. Terrett added that more attendees may join. The meeting reflects ongoing engagement between lawmakers and industry leaders even as the legislative process slows. Analysts at TD Cowen warned last week that delays in negotiations could push any progress on crypto market structure legislation beyond next year’s midterm elections. While the Genius Act, which focused on AI regulation, passed swiftly, crypto legislation has faced political gridlock. SCOOP: These crypto C-suites are expected to attend a roundtable with pro-crypto Senate Democrats on Wednesday to discuss market structure legislation and the path forward: Coinbase CEO @brian_armstrong Chainlink CEO @SergeyNazarov Galaxy CEO @novogratz Kraken CEO… — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) October 20, 2025 Senate Republicans have put forward their own bill outlining jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), while introducing the concept of “ancillary assets” to determine which tokens should not be treated as securities. Democrats, meanwhile, are said to be drafting a competing framework. A leaked six-page proposal reportedly focused on curbing illicit activity in DeFi has drawn criticism from both Republicans and the crypto industry, who argue it could stifle innovation. Gillibrand’s upcoming roundtable could mark a renewed effort to bridge the divide and bring the long-awaited crypto market structure bill back to the legislative forefront. CFTC Adds Crypto Leaders to Global Advisory Committee Last month, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) named some crypto leaders as new members to its Global Markets Advisory Committee (GMAC) and its Digital Asset Markets Subcommittee (DAMS). Among the latest appointees to DAMS are Katherine Minarik of Uniswap Labs, Avery Ching of Aptos Labs, James J. Hill of BNY, and Ben Sherwin of Chainlink Labs, key figures in blockchain infrastructure, legal policy, and institutional crypto strategy. The appointments signal the CFTC’s continued push to incorporate industry expertise into policymaking around digital assets. In September, Congressman Zachary Nunn asked the US Treasury to launch a national security review of Chinese firms Bitmain and Cango, citing concerns over their expanding presence in the US crypto mining sector. In a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Nunn pointed to opaque ownership structures, potential state ties, and risks to national infrastructure as grounds for a Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigation.

Fast forward to 2025, and the market is once again buzzing with talk of the best cryptos to buy now, tokens that could mirror Solana’s early trajectory. Among these rising stars, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly gaining attention as a top contender for explosive growth. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, over 70% of tokens have already sold out, raising more than $17.65 million at its ever-lowest available price of $0.035 per token. What sets MUTM apart is its dual-lending protocol, which fuses Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending within a single ecosystem, a model designed to redefine capital efficiency in decentralized finance. With whales showing interest and community momentum accelerating, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as the answer for investors wondering what crypto to invest in that could deliver Solana-like gains in the next bull run. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Testing Key Support Amid Market Pullback Following a bullish structure formed close to $253, Solana (SOL) was forcefully rejected and is now trending clearly to the downside. Price is testing the $182–$185 support area at the time of writing, where traders can anticipate a minor pullback or relief bounce. This level, if held, can pave the way for the next bullish leg, while failure can attract more downside pressure. While SOL’s price action remains in the limelight for investors, many also consider up-and-coming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in pursuit of the next big crypto project with high potential ahead of the next market boom. With investors searching for the best cryptos to buy now, Mutuum Finance is increasingly appearing on watchlists for those figuring out what crypto to invest in for the coming cycle. Mutuum Finance’s Steady Growth Spurs Confidence in the Market Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves in the DeFi ecosystem as one of the top cryptos to look out for this year. The token is currently in Presale Phase 6 and is being sold for $0.035, up 16.17% from Phase 5. This is the cheapest that MUTM will ever be sold. Investment interest is strong, with over 17,320 participants who have purchased over $17.65 million to date. With over 70% of Phase 6 sold, Mutuum Finance is experiencing record interest, which is anticipated to persist for its increasing success as a high-growth cryptocurrency with firm long-term potential. For those wondering what crypto to invest in ahead of the 2025 market uptrend, MUTM stands out as one of the best cryptos to buy now given its traction and stability. Early investors seeking to sell out for astronomical gains with MUTM on the cusp of the open market, as it stands as the best cryptocurrency to invest in for strategic positioning. Many experts advising on what crypto to invest in have placed Mutuum Finance near the top of their 2025 watchlist for its fundamentals and strong DeFi innovation. Mutuum Finance Positions to Launch Its Lending & Borrowing Protocol The next item on the roadmap of Mutuum Finance is to launch a lending and borrowing protocol , which will serve as the basis on which its DeFi platform will be developed. Its V1 version will be live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 with the following features: liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. And with the launch event, USDT and ETH can be collateralized, borrowed, and lent by users, providing retail and institutional users with a fast, secure, and highly scalable DeFi experience. Daily Leaderboard Highlights Mutuum Finance leaderboard is astonishing investors with huge community-incentivized rewards. The biggest purchasers in the last 24 hours have invested $519, $515, $424, $308 respectively in MUTM tokens indicating greater activity and investor interest. Most active one-day buyer gets a $500 MUTM reward. They simply need to make a successful purchase within the duration of 24 hours. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also one of the best cryptos to buy now, after it has raised over $17.65 million from 17,320 investors, with over 70% of Phase 6 sold out at $0.035, its lowest price ever. Its dual-lending DeFi protocol, its Q4 2025 launch on schedule, and ongoing leaderboard rewards all point to increasing market confidence. Investors evaluating what crypto to invest in ahead of 2026 are calling MUTM a must-watch DeFi gem with Solana-like upside potential.

The meeting will take place on Wednesday, and executives from Coinbase, Chainlink, Galaxy, Kraken, Uniswap, Ripple, Circle, among others, will be in attendance. Democrats want the talks to restart the work on crypto laws that stopped after backlash over a leaked plan to regulate decentralized finance (DeFi). Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett first shared the news on X, stating that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) will lead the private meeting. The goal is to resume talks with the cryptocurrency industry after weeks of tension with Republican lawmakers. Crypto executives join senators to discuss new market structure rules Senator Kirsten Gillibrand will lead the meeting together with other Democratic senators, including Senators Cory Booker from New Jersey, Mark Warner from Virginia, and John Hickenlooper from Colorado. Gillibrand has consistently advocated for the government to engage in open discussions and talks about practical solutions with the cryptocurrency industry. The roundtable will feature Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Chainlink CEO Sergey Nazarov, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, and Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams. Others joining are Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty; Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer, Dante Disparte; Solana Policy Institute President, Katie Smith; Jito’s Chief Legal Officer, Rebecca Rettig; and a16z Crypto’s General Counsel, Miles Jennings. Their presence highlights the significant impact of government decisions on various aspects of the industry, and reports indicate that there will be even more guests before the meeting. Lawmakers want to know everything about cryptocurrency trading and decentralized systems, as well as how to protect users without hindering innovation. Many companies have relocated their operations overseas because the US lacks clear rules that enable them to compete fairly. Company leaders will use this opportunity to express their concerns about the current rules and offer practical suggestions on how the government can provide solutions without hindering progress. Senate Democrats seek common ground after DeFi proposal backlash The tension in Washington started when Democratic lawmakers leaked a draft that suggested new rules for decentralized finance. The document proposed that the government treat developers and operators who build or run DeFi websites and apps as “digital asset intermediaries.” They would have to follow the same rules as big financial companies and trading exchanges. The crypto industry stated that the draft went too far and did not adequately consider how DeFi systems actually work, as most of them are open-source and run automatically through code. Developers said the proposal forces small creators and coders to meet rules that were never designed for them, which could “ban” decentralized apps in the United States. The Blockchain Association and the Digital Chamber of Commerce have even asked lawmakers to sit down with experts and discuss the technology before making any decisions. They stated that the language in the draft was unclear and could potentially hinder innovation if the government does not revise it. These groups argued that the US should not push developers away to other countries with easier regulations, and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even called the draft “a bad idea.” He said policymakers really don’t understand the technology. Miles Jennings, General Counsel for a16z Crypto, agreed with Armstrong and stated that innovation will likely shift to Europe or Asia, where the rules are clearer, if the US does not establish a strong and fair legal framework. Senate Democrats agreed to the meeting to demonstrate that they can listen and seek common ground. The discussions could foster a more open and respectful dialogue between lawmakers and Republicans, and also inform how regulators develop future policies.

CoinMarketCap says that the Fear and Greed Index has increased to 30, which shows that panic is starting to subside again. Following the dip from last week, Ethereum and Bitcoin prices have bounced slightly, and analysts have pointed to promising altcoins expected to perform well over the next few weeks. The five top names drawing investor attention are BTC, ETH, XRP, Cardano, and MAGACOIN FINANCE , a fast-rising presale token gaining popularity among retail and institutional buyers. Bitcoin Reclaims Continue To Hold Above $106,000 Bitcoin (BTC) has been able to maintain a bulk sideways above the dangerous $106,000 support zone following a brutal correction earlier this week. Analysts believe that the 50-week EMA is the market’s “Golden Line,” dividing accumulation zones from possible capitulation areas. Historically, this indicator has been a great buying opportunity during long-term uptrends. BTCUSD 1-week Chart | Source: X Recent on-chain data indicates a drop in exchange inflows, indicating lower selling pressure from short-term holders. At the same time, accumulation of whale wallets has risen, suggesting institutional participants are entering the market after the dip. Analysts anticipate Bitcoin consolidating from the range of $106,000 to $110,000 before continuing to rally towards $150,000 early in 2026. This slow recovery is seen as the basis of the next rotation phase for altcoins. Ethereum Hits $5,000 Price Target Amid New Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is gaining traction after rebounding from the $3,700 support level. Technical charts depict the development of an ascending channel, which shows ongoing accumulation by long-term investors. Analysts expect a potential continuation towards the $5,000 level if the buying pressure remains near its 200-day moving average. ETHUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Ethereum continues to be highly regarded in the eyes of institutional players, as several ETH-based ETFs were approved during the first half of the current quarter. ETF flows have been on the increase, while funds such as BlackRock’s ETHA are accumulating strong positions. In addition, forthcoming network upgrades that should lead to increased scalability and gas efficiency are further bolstering investor optimism. With the altcoin market in a position for rotation, Ethereum could lead the charge along with Bitcoin on the next wave of gains. XRP and Cardano Hold Despite Market Volatility After a big drawdown last week, XRP price has remained stable around the $2.30 level. Analysts are convinced its increasing use in cross-border payment networks will continue to fuel value over the long term. In addition to expanding its functionality into remittance corridors in Asia and Africa, the new partnerships are likely to give XRP’s usability a boost in the future, which will also promote growth in its price. Cardano (ADA), on the other hand, is building a solid foundation near $0.62, which points to a potential breakout once Bitcoin subsides. On-chain metrics show the network is becoming more active, and total value-locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols building on Cardano is increasing. Analysts estimate ADA to reach the $1 level once the market is back in bullish mode. Together, XRP and Cardano are strong mid-cap plays that may outperform in the next cycle of altcoin rallies. MAGACOIN FINANCE Gains Traction as the Next 1000x Presale Among emerging altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the fastest-growing presales of 2025, surpassing $16 million in early-stage funding. Completely audited by Hashex and Certik, and built on the Ethereum network, which is the most secure network out there, the project inspires confidence among its investors. Its decentralized finance ecosystem and community-driven tokenomics lure early adopters who aim to earn exponential returns. Analysts predict that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver up to 1000x ROI following its planned primary exchange listing later this year. With its presale success, audited code, and increasing social influence, it stands out among the newest tokens. As Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilize, retail investors are rotating capital toward presales with high growth potential, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that shift. Market Outlook and Conclusion The Fear and Greed Index at 30 has shown a rebirth of sentiment, indicating that the worst of the correction may be over. Bitcoin and Ethereum supported the resumption of upward movement, with other altcoins such as XRP and Cardano remaining relatively strong. However, analysts emphasize that the biggest gains may come from early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which combine solid fundamentals with growing investor interest. As the market moves into a new accumulation phase, these five assets might be in store as the next leg of the crypto bull cycle.

This comes after a failure to hold the support at $2.5 and the subsequent decline that has put it on a rather bearish path. If this bearishness continues, then it is more likely that the XRP price will end up retesting the $2.1 level soon, and a total failure would lead to a crash that could rival that of 2020, triggered by the SEC lawsuit. Bears Have Trapped The XRP Price In an analysis, crypto analyst Lingrid revealed that the XRP price is now under a lot of bearish pressure. The first sign of this is that the altcoin’s price has continued to decline within a well-defined downward channel, and this comes after the price was rejected near the resistance trendline below $2.44. A direct result of this is that the XRP price is still seeing lower highs and lower lows, which is indicative that the sellers are still very much in control of the price. At this juncture, the analyst explains that the XRP price is currently still trapped under bearish pressure due to this. From here, there are now a lot of things that could happen for the price . The first of these is that it continues to decline, eventually moving as low as $2.1. This would be where the next major support is for the price, and in this case, the price would have to maintain $2.1 and bounce if there is to be a recovery. On the flip side, if bulls want to invalidate the bearish thesis, then they would have to get the price above $2.5. If the XRP price is able to break through this major resistance with momentum, then there could be a turn in the tide for the digital asset. Factors To Watch Out For Lingrid also highlights a number of factors that could set the XRP price up for another run. The first of these has to do with the Bitcoin price, which categorically controls the broader crypto market . If the Bitcoin price were to move, then it could take the XRP price with it and invalidate the bears. Next on the list is for the XRP price to break above $2.45. In this case, the breakout would set it on the path toward $2.8 , marking an over 10% increase from the breakout point. This also plays into the analysis of bulls maintaining support before a decline to $2.1. Last but not least is the fact that there would be some unexpected news in the market . This could have to do with regulatory issues or liquidity events that end up throwing the short-term technical flows off balance, while the market figures out the next direction.",XRP|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-20 07:30:22

According to Modo Energy, Tesla’s batteries have outperformed every major rival in revenue and scale, anchoring Britain’s plan to move away from fossil fuels. The company not only supplies large-scale batteries to developers but also trades the power they produce, giving it a grip on how electricity flows across the grid. Tesla’s Megapack units have become central to Britain’s power system, quietly reshaping how energy is stored and distributed. Of the 182 grid-scale battery projects operating across the country, 20 use Tesla’s Megapack batteries, totaling about 695 megawatts of installed capacity, said Modo Energy. Out of those, 16 are traded directly by Tesla , making the company not just a supplier but an active player in the UK’s volatile electricity market. Tesla grows profits while clashing with British politics The company’s dominance was underscored just two weeks after Ed Miliband, Britain’s energy secretary, told Elon to “get the hell out of our politics and our country” during a public speech. The comment came after the billionaire criticized the UK’s energy policies on his social platform X. Despite the heated exchange, Tesla’s market share continued to grow. Data showed that the 16 Tesla-traded projects made an average of £91,364 per megawatt between October 2024 and October 2025, earning a total of £52 million in revenue. Those sites made up 16 of the top 20 best-performing battery units in the country, beating many handled by BP and EDF. Tesla’s success comes from a mix of strategy, software, and engineering. Its batteries can discharge electricity for two hours at full capacity, compared to 1.5 hours for most UK systems, giving them an edge in a market that rewards flexibility. The company’s Autobidder software, which uses real-time data to place and adjust market bids, keeps its systems constantly trading for maximum return. “The [Autobidder] platform is constantly repricing bids and trying to outcompete the competition in a more dynamic, data-driven way,” said Joe Bush, a market analyst at Modo Energy. New investors chase Britain’s growing energy storage profits Commodities traders like Trafigura and Vitol have begun investing in the same space, betting that Britain’s growing share of wind and solar energy will keep battery markets profitable. Goldman Sachs entered the business last year, trading power on behalf of battery owners, crediting rising investor interest in storage systems. The sector is particularly attractive in Britain given the high proportion of wind and solar power in the country, which is set to grow as the government tries to decarbonize the power sector by 2030. Battery owners also earn income by selling stability services to the National Electricity System Operator, the state-owned body that prevents blackouts by balancing supply and demand. Tom Vernon, chief executive of Statera Energy, said, “The fundamentals in the UK have been positive for batteries.” He explained that the market’s structure allows firms like Tesla to profit from both price swings and grid services. Tim Sowinski, senior analyst at Cornwall Insight, added that Tesla’s focused approach gives it a stronger position than traditional energy giants. “They [Tesla] are battery-only, so their sole goal is to optimize those batteries and get as much revenue from them as possible,” he said.

Around 10% of S&P 500 companies are expected to report quarterly results, giving the Street plenty to digest. At the same time, the U.S. will deliver crucial reads on inflation, crude oil stocks, existing home sales, and consumer sentiment, and even crypto while flash PMI surveys from multiple regions will step in to fill the vacuum left by the ongoing federal shutdown, which continues to disrupt official releases. According to information from the S&P Global, private economic trackers like the October flash PMIs are now carrying more weight than usual. These surveys will drop throughout the week in the US, UK, eurozone, China, Japan, and other major economies. With September data showing slowing growth in the US, October’s numbers will help confirm whether recent momentum can hold, especially as the FOMC’s first rate cut of the year begins to work through the system. The next cut has since been priced in. China posts Q3 GDP as U.K. braces for inflation spike On Monday, China posted its Q3 GDP, which is expected to drop to 4.7% from 5.2% in Q2. The government also released September data on retail sales, industrial output, and fixed asset investment. A slowdown was seen across the board along with the loan prime rate and unemployment rate. While all this is coming out, Singapore will be observing a market holiday. In Europe, the eurozone’s September PMI showed the fastest business activity in 16 months, but investors are watching to see if that pace slows. The political crisis in France could drag on momentum, while Germany might see demand lift from fiscal policies. On Thursday, France’s business confidence will be updated, along with Türkiye’s rate decision and Eurozone consumer confidence. In the U.K., Friday will bring CPI inflation for September. In August, headline inflation was 3.8% with core at 3.6%, both still way above the BoE’s 2% target. And while survey data suggests price growth is easing, wage and tax hikes from April could keep inflation sticky. That same day, the U.K. will also drop retail sales, consumer confidence, and PMI data. Japan will post its September inflation, along with flash PMI results on Friday. Singapore’s industrial production will also be released. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Taiwan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Switzerland, and Indonesia will contribute trade, inflation, and rate updates, while India takes two days off for holidays. Federal Reserve hosts crypto conference on Tuesday On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board will hold a Payments Innovation Conference, pulling in voices from both traditional finance and the crypto industry. The event will be streamed publicly on federalreserve.gov and will feature many panel discussions covering stablecoins, AI, DeFi, and tokenized financial services, according to press release by the central bank. Governor Christopher Waller said, “Innovation has been a constant in payments to meet the changing needs of consumers and businesses,” adding that the Fed genuinely wants to explore ways to improve safety and efficiency. The event will also discuss the convergence of centralized and decentralized systems and focus on how crypto infrastructure is reshaping financial rails. Business models involving stablecoins will get attention, along with how artificial intelligence is already being embedded into next-gen payment systems, said the Fed. Friday floods markets with critical PMI and inflation data By the end of the week, nearly every major economy will have updated their PMI numbers for October, with the U.S., U.K., eurozone, Germany, France, Japan , India, and Australia all reporting. The U.S. will also finally publish the delayed September CPI, which analysts expect to have crept up from 2.9% to 3.1%, though recent PMI readings hint that inflationary pressure from tariffs might be easing. In the U.S., Friday’s drop will also include final consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, plus new home sales. Earlier in the week, the EIA’s crude oil stocks report on Wednesday and existing home sales on Thursday will give traders more direction. Meanwhile, Canada, South Korea, and Australia will publish data on retail, inflation, and policy decisions, closing out what’s likely to be one of the most critical weeks for the markets this month.

Key Takeaways: Long-term Bitcoin holders are cashing out, creating sustained sell pressure that’s slowing the market’s recovery. On-chain data shows realized profits hit $1.7B per day while revived supply from old wallets reached $2.9B. Analysts say Bitcoin remains supported near $108,700, but resistance above $110,000 could limit upside. On Sunday, analyst James Check said that the recent weakness in crypto prices has little to do with market manipulation or “paper Bitcoin,” and everything to do with long-term investors taking profits. “It’s just good old-fashioned sellers,” he noted, adding that this wave of profit-taking has become “the source of resistance” preventing Bitcoin from breaking higher. On-Chain Data Shows Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Cashing Out Check’s on-chain analysis showed that the average age of spent coins has been rising, a sign that seasoned holders, rather than short-term speculators, are cashing out. Another chart revealed that realized profits surged to $1.7 billion per day, while realized losses hit $430 million, marking the third-highest level of realized losses in the current cycle. Additionally, revived supply from dormant wallets reached nearly $2.9 billion per day, indicating that long-held coins are actively reentering circulation. The sheer volume of sell-side pressure from existing Bitcoin holders is **still** not widely appreciated, but it has been THE source of resistance. Not manipulation, not paper Bitcoin, not suppression. Just good old fashioned sellers. Also, it won't become irrelevant. https://t.co/4QnfCn2f7w pic.twitter.com/YiK7gtjkzj — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) October 19, 2025 Crypto investor Will Clemente echoed this observation , saying that Bitcoin’s past year of relative weakness reflects a transfer of supply from early holders (“OGs”) to institutional investors. “This dynamic will be mostly irrelevant in the coming years,” he said, suggesting that traditional finance accumulation could stabilize long-term market structure. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz agreed, telling Raoul Pal in a recent interview that many long-time Bitcoin holders are finally taking profits after years of gains. “There are a lot of people who’ve been in Bitcoin so long and finally decided, ‘I want to buy something,’” he said, mentioning friends who purchased luxury assets such as yachts and sports teams. Despite the selling pressure, Bitcoin has held key support at $108,700 in its weekly close, according to TradingView data. Market analyst Rekt Capital said that maintaining stability above this level could pave the way for a push toward $120,000. As of publication, Bitcoin was trading around $110,000, facing resistance just above that mark amid an increasingly divided market between profit-takers and patient holders. Crypto Fear Index Plunges as Bitcoin Slides to $110K The crypto market has sunk into “Extreme Fear” , with sentiment collapsing in just one week. According to Alternative.me, the Fear & Greed Index dropped from 64 (Greed) to 22, while CoinMarketCap’s index fell to 28 from 54, signaling widespread risk aversion among traders. Bitcoin has struggled to hold the $110,000 level amid renewed US–China trade tensions, while gold surged to record highs above $4,230 per ounce, underscoring the flight to safety. On-chain data added to the bearish tone, with long-term holders selling 265,700 BTC in the past month, the largest outflow since January. Trader Tony “The Bull” Severino believes the next 100 days could determine whether the cryptocurrency enters a parabolic rally or ends its current bull cycle.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) captured headlines during the speculative boom, 2025’s smarter investors are now wondering what crypto to invest in that can deliver sustainable growth. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a powerful DeFi-focused project currently priced at just $0.035 in its Phase 6 presale, with more than 70% already sold out and over $17.65 million raised. This is the lowest price MUTM will ever be. Unlike meme coins that rely on community buzz alone, Mutuum Finance introduces a dual-lending model that combines Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract mechanisms, creating a dynamic and functional financial ecosystem. With this blend of innovation, accessibility, and momentum, Mutuum Finance is quickly being recognized as a top crypto coin, one with the potential to break into the Top 20 rankings when it transitions from presale success to a market leader. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis: The Signs of a Future Reversal On the Horizon Shiba Inu (SHIB) is beginning to show signs of a future reversal following its recent firm establishment below the $0.000013 level. The token’s trendline support has withstood the test of time, and its position near the Ichimoku Kumo Cloud provides the impression that the momentum is set to shift in the bulls’ favor in the short term. A tidy penetration of the cloud and neighboring resistance could pave the way for a rally to $0.000020, if volume is on the side of the move. Furthermore, an emerging bullish divergence from recent lows signals increasing market optimism as buyers enter increasingly. As SHIB struggles to regain its higher ground, the majority of investors are now focused on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a top crypto utility token rather than hype, hoping to set the tempo of the next wave of crypto growth in 2025.

Chris Burniske set his outlook at $420, tying it to Bitcoin’s cycle correlation, and Ben Armstrong went further, expecting highs near $500 in the next bull run . Solana ETF Speculation Sparks Market Hype The Solana ETF speculation has been at the heart of growing optimism. The SEC’s approval of Form 8-A for 21Shares marks the last technical step before a Solana Spot ETF begins trading. Although the U.S. government shutdown has delayed S-1 filings, the ETF greenlight under 19b-4 has already been secured. Many believe this delay is temporary and will only extend anticipation for launch. ETF launch pending : With the final step completed, trading could start once S-1 clears Institutional flows expected : ETF access could position Solana as one of the top cryptos for 2025 bull run Community excitement : A teaser from Solana’s official X account sparked speculation about a possible Solana debit card launch This mix of ETF developments and new product speculation is fueling a Solana bullish outlook. Investors are watching closely, linking the ETF narrative to the next crypto market breakout predictions.

Strong fundraising : Over $16.5 million secured, with both whales and retail investors participating Team transparency : Backed by a clear, public-facing development team Market positioning : Seen as one of the best altcoins before breakout , tapping into bullish demand The project’s rise mirrors how early entry into tokens with institutional-style outlook can provide strong upside in a bullish sentiment in crypto market phase. With the crypto sector eyeing the next top altcoins with breakout potential in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a serious contender. Final Thought: Why Solana ETF Narrative Could Fuel Next Rally The growing Solana ETF talks reignite bullish sentiment across digital assets.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/this-document-submitted-to-the-sec-got-xrp-army-talking-heres-why/,"In a recent post on X, Crypto educator James Rule XRP brought to light a formal petition recently submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Boyd Roberts of Big Picture Group. The document, titled The Great Sovereign Reset: Strategic Decoding of the Global Repricing Event by Trump of Gold & XRP, was filed in August and is available on the SEC’s official petitions list. Rather than presenting speculative commentary, the submission outlines a structured policy proposal that connects sovereign debt restructuring with the implementation of digital settlement infrastructure. This was submitted to the @SECGov in August. @boyd_roberts https://t.co/S5HNbpXhh0 pic.twitter.com/Q3Iwwvozu5 — James Rule XRP (@RuleXRP) October 18, 2025 Framework Centered on Gold Repricing and XRP Utility At the core of the petition is a two-tiered strategy: the official repricing of gold to strengthen national balance sheets, and the positioning of XRP as a neutral settlement asset capable of linking emerging financial instruments, including CBDCs, stablecoins, and tokenized assets . The author argues that existing monetary frameworks require both a hard asset revaluation and modern payment rail integration to alleviate systemic pressure. Gold repricing is presented as a mechanism to alleviate sovereign debt exposure, while XRP is introduced as an institutional bridge enabling real-time global settlement. The document describes the need for clear legislative adjustments to support this transition. These include custody definitions, legal authority for debt adjustments, and regulatory compliance mechanisms aligned with ISO 20022 standards . The petition emphasizes that implementation must maintain continuity for retail banking operations, focusing on changes within wholesale and interbank environments. Timeline, Risk Considerations, and Execution Pathways The petition details strategic timing, noting an updated probability assessment for late August through early September 2025 as a potential window for coordinated policy action. Several operational models are referenced, including controlled over-the-counter repricing scenarios and combined public market strategies. Central to the proposal is risk management, addressing communication protocols, liquidity supervision, cyber protections, and legal sequencing to avoid destabilization. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Supervisory dashboards, staged liquidity releases, and institutional custody frameworks are presented as essential oversight mechanisms. The petition also references contingency periods in case of market strain or procedural delays, outlining a phased approach rather than a singular shock event. Institutional Preparation Beyond policy design, the petition advises institutions, corporations, and individuals to prepare through enhanced custody measures, treasury system upgrades, and governance planning for digital asset integration. By presenting the document to the SEC, the author is formally introducing a macroeconomic restructuring thesis that merges asset repricing with digital settlement infrastructure. James Rule XRP’s post underscores the public accessibility of the petition, positioning it for regulatory, legal, and institutional review. The proposal moves beyond commentary into formal advocacy, inviting scrutiny of the feasibility of aligning traditional monetary instruments with programmable digital assets under a defined regulatory blueprint.

According to journalist Eleanor Terrett, Cuomo intends to make New York “a hub for crypto.” She noted that Cuomo’s proposal includes appointing a Chief Innovation Officer to help transform NYC into a crypto epicenter. Her statement comes on the heels of Eric Adams stepping out of the mayoral race, leaving Cuomo as the only potential crypto-positive contender for New York City’s top job. Cuomo intends to create an Innovation Council Terrett posted on X: “The former governor turned mayoral candidate is set to announce plans to create a new Chief Innovation Officer to make NYC ‘the global hub of the future’ if elected.” She explained the new CIO position would drive a citywide innovation agenda that integrates crypto, AI, and biotech. Its mission would be to align tech initiatives across departments, accelerate adoption of new tools, and bring in high-value investment and jobs. She added that Cuomo wants to establish an Innovation Council consisting of three advisory bodies for crypto, AI, and biotech to shape policy around regulation, education, and business-friendly reform. Cuomo actually has a background in crypto, having counseled OKX as it faced a federal probe that ended with the firm pleading guilty and agreeing to pay more than $500 million in fines. If the former governor follows through on his proposals as mayor, the city may replace its reputation for tough enforcement with a more innovation-driven approach. However, given that his suggestions come in the heat of the campaign, some believe Cuomo may be using pro-crypto rhetoric to win over voters, much as Trump did ahead of the 2024 election. Others are questioning how much real authority he would have to act, even if elected. Mamdani has not clarified his position on cryptocurrency New York City Mayor Eric Adams recently concluded his reelection campaign, citing financial struggles and relentless speculation about his future. His exit shakes up the city’s mayoral race only weeks before the November election. Following this development, mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo advanced their attacks against each other on the campaign trail, less than a few hours after Mayor Eric Adams’ exit from the race effectively set up a two-man fight in the race’s final days. In a withdrawal video posted to X , Adams said. “Despite all we’ve achieved, I cannot continue my re-election campaign,” he said, pointing to the Campaign Finance Board’s decision to deny him public matching funds. Adams, who assumed office in January 2022, swiftly gained national attention as one of the most pro-crypto politicians in America. He famously earned himself a nickname, “Bitcoin Mayor,” after turning his first three paychecks into Bitcoin and Ethereum. He has consistently committed to making New York the “global capital of cryptocurrency,” pushing blockchain integration in city services. His proposals included using blockchain for municipal recordkeeping, allowing residents to pay fines and taxes in crypto in addition to issuing Bitcoin-backed municipal bonds. Adams recently created America’s first municipal office dedicated to digital assets and blockchain technology, hoping to promote the use of digital assets. His campaign for the upcoming race had also centered on crypto and innovation, so his exit gives Cuomo a potential advantage, even if Cuomo hasn’t been as outspoken a crypto advocate. However, Cuomo would need to overcome Democratic Zohran Mamdani, who remains well ahead in the race. According to the New York Times analysis, polls consistently show Zohran Mamdani leading the field and favored to take over from Eric Adams. Mamdani has said little about cryptocurrency, but his platform is viewed as more progressive than the typical Democratic stance. Crypto executives, including Gemini CEO Tyler Winklevoss, have, however, criticized Mamdani, with Winklevoss saying, “It appears things will have to get worse in NYC before they get better.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|BTC|ETH|USD,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-20 08:10:28

However, today, divergence has resurfaced, with selling pressure intertwined with bargain-hunting. Most major cryptocurrencies have returned to a volatile cycle, with short-term long positions and profit-taking oscillating around key levels. Faced with the fluctuating market dynamics, new divisions have emerged among investors. Some are still watching the market, hoping for a unilateral surge, while others have already converted their holdings into a steady stream of US dollar income. In the past, market sentiment was influenced by prices. And as we bounce through multiple rounds of rallies and pullbacks, investors are figuring out that real long-lasting wealth doesn’t flow from short-term swings but from dependable cash flows. Against this backdrop, a new method that is rapidly gaining acceptance has come to the fore: AI cloud mining. What Exactly is AI Cloud Mining? Cloud mining is a method of operating through purchasing computing capacity and operations from platforms that provide for producing energy remotely. Traditional self-built mining farms need investment in hardware, venues, electricity, and maintenance, while AI cloud mining requires none of it and automates the entire process. It’s pretty simple, really—you invest your XRP, USDT, BTC or ETH into the platform, and it turns it into hash power. AI algorithms subsequently work to optimally schedule tasks 24/7. Earnings are settled daily in US dollars, with a daily cash flow, independent of the market fluctuations. The five key advantages of AI cloud mining are: No Upfront Investment : You don’t need a mining rig or equipment; you can just get started right away with an account. Stable Returns : Daily settlement in USD mitigates market volatility. Secure and Transparent : Multiple encrypted cold wallets protect funds. Eco-Friendly : Green and efficient data center for low-energy operation. Fully Automated AI : Intelligent scheduling and 24/7 operation save you time and effort. Rather than just “holding” assets, cloud mining transforms static assets into capital that “produces interest”. And you won’t have to be bothered by your emotions regarding market situations, as the system will automatically produce income for you all the time. FleetMining Uses AI to Make Profits Smarter FleetMining is remarkable for its automation and a history of reliable payouts, which makes it different from a lot of other platforms. This AI-based computing engine powers real automation in revenue management. The platform is to support global clean energy mines to maintain low carbon and stable output, and is not only focused on income, but is also a permanent basis of support. You can get started in a few simple steps: Register a FleetMining account (new users receive a $15 bonus). Deposit assets (supports BTC, ETH, USDT, and XRP, starting at $100). The system automatically converts hashrate and starts mining. You will receive your daily earnings in USD directly credited to your account automatically for withdrawal or repurchase. This whole process doesn’t require any hardware, technical skill, or understanding of the market; it is truly automated earnings accessible from your phone. Here’s a breakdown of what you can earn by depositing a certain amount of crypto to the platform. Contract Amount Duration Daily Income Total Income $100 2 days $6 $100+$12 $1200 10 days $16.2 $1200+$162 $6,000 20 days $96 $6,000+$1,920 $30,000 45 days $540 $30,000+$24,300 $100,000 50 days $1,850 $100,000+$92,500 Volatility is Inevitable, Cash Flow Remains Constant The 2025 path for the crypto market will still offer upsides and uncertainties. FleetMining’s AI cloud mining makes it easier for investors to more easily tread through a volatile market with stability. Market action is inconstant, but your assets don’t have to be at rest. Let AI mine and let time be your friend. FleetMining—the future passive income in your wallets today. To learn more about AI cloud mining, visit Fleet Mining’s official website.

The asset has gained 5% over the past 24 hours, though it remains 5% lower on the week. Analysts are tracking key price levels, historical signals, and trading behavior, suggesting that XRP may be entering a new phase of market structure. Price Holds Long-Term Demand Area Well-known trader and analyst EtherNasyonaL shared a long-term view of XRP using an inverted monthly chart to highlight structural patterns. The chart focuses on a demand zone that stems from the 2018 all-time high resistance. This area is now acting as support. XRP has traded within this range for several months. The chart shows repeated tests of the lower boundary without any breakdowns. The analyst said XRP is “ gathering strength ” and that “ the next major move is being prepared to the upside. ” In the non-inverted view, the structure resembles a rounded bottom, often linked to trend reversals. Source: EtherNasyonaL/X Six-Month Chart Points to Higher Targets Another analyst, ChartNerd, presented a six-month candle chart using Fibonacci extensions to outline the next potential stages for XRP. Despite a recent upper wick, the chart shows no change in trend. Higher lows and higher highs remain in place. Interestingly, the analysis points to price levels at $5, $8.59, $13.93, and $27.88 as potential targets, based on past cycles and extension levels. According to the post, the structure does not show any signs of a breakdown and still favors continuation. Source: ChartNerd/X Sentiment Hits Lowest Point of the Year Steph Is Crypto reviewed XRP’s short-term holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL). The chart shows that short-term holders have reached deep negative territory, dropping to -0.20. This level is lower than any other on the chart over the past year. Previous dips into this “ capitulation ” zone, seen in October 2024, March 2025, and June 2025, all occurred near market lows. The analyst explained that these events have consistently marked bottoms and warned, “This is absolutely the worst time to exit.” In addition, a recent chart from Cryptoinsightuk mapped XRP liquidity zones on the daily timeframe. The most active area is between $2.20 and $2.80, which has held as support. Above current levels, liquidity builds near $3.00 to $3.40, which could be tested if price moves up. Meanwhile, CryptoPotato reported that wallets holding over 10,000 XRP have reached an all-time high of 317,500. This trend has continued for nearly a year, with a brief pause in late 2024. Analysts note that the current pattern aligns with a possible Wave 4 consolidation under Elliott Wave Theory.

Analyzing the latest situation in Bitcoin, BTC Markets crypto analyst Rachael Lucas stated that despite macroeconomic negativities such as US President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on China, investors are now pricing in positive events such as a possible interest rate cut in October. “The recent recovery in Bitcoin, currently trading above $110,000, has been driven by a combination of institutional inflows and improving macroeconomic conditions. At this point, demand for spot crypto ETFs has revived as investors are treating the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity. “Fed Chair Jerome Powell also acknowledged that labor market weakness persisted despite stronger-than-expected growth. This shift lowered bond yields and improved the liquidity environment for risky assets, including digital assets.” What are the Critical Levels to Watch in Bitcoin? Lucas also noted that Bitcoin is at a critical juncture, where the analyst said it is testing resistance between $111,700 and $115,500. According to the analyst, if Bitcoin experiences a decisive breakout above $111,000, it could cause a squeeze in the short term, which could accelerate bullish momentum. Lucas also said that the meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi at the end of the month carries a “significant risk” for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Apart from Lucas, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu also made a similar prediction. Liu said that the key levels to watch for BTC in the current climate are $107,000 and $110,000. “A break below structural support around $107,000 could trigger liquidations and a sharp market sentiment shift, especially if macro or geopolitical shocks resurface. Conversely, sustained buying pressure above $111,000 could increase momentum and open the door to a new upward wave,” Liu said. *This is not investment advice.

Gold price predictions remain bullish, with analysts expecting the gold price USD to remain elevated amid ongoing economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical instability. However, as gold investment returns reach impressive highs and traditional investors seek new avenues for even greater growth, a significant flow of profits is beginning to move into the world of cryptocurrency—particularly into SPX6900 coin and the rising crypto, Based Eggman ($GGs) . Gold’s Strong Run, But Investors Need More Gold investors have enjoyed robust gains as gold has fulfilled its role as a safe haven and portfolio stabilizer. Solid gold investments, prudent gold investment plans, and timely buy gold decisions have paid off, but the appetite for higher yields is pushing some to consider the next frontier. As the market asks the perennial question—crypto or gold—more are choosing to invest in crypto for its asymmetric upside, while still respecting gold’s enduring value. SPX6900 Coin: The SPX Memecoin Buzz Among the new destinations for gold profits is SPX6900 coin , which has captured the imagination of investors as a top-performing SPX memecoin. Backed by a viral online community and constant SPX6900 news coverage, SPX6900 has emerged as one of the best crypto to buy for those chasing fast-moving trends in the altcoin space. Bullish SPX6900 price predictions highlight its potential for major short-term rallies, and its memecoin status makes it especially appealing for those seeking to capitalize on speculative market waves. As gold profits rotate into digital assets, SPX6900 is often at the top of the list of memecoins to buy or memecoins to invest in for explosive, albeit volatile, returns. Based Eggman ($GGs): The High Potential Altcoin for Aggressive Returns For investors eager for even more aggressive portfolio growth, Based Eggman ($GGs) is quickly gaining recognition as one of the best memecoins to buy in 2026. Unlike many memecoins that rely solely on hype, Based Eggman is built for sustainability, featuring deflationary tokenomics, staking rewards, and a rapidly expanding, loyal community. Its foundation on the fast, efficient Base blockchain ensures low fees and seamless scalability, setting it apart from many lower-tier meme tokens. What truly makes Based Eggman a standout memecoin to invest in is its combination of viral appeal and real utility. Early-stage memecoins like $GGs have historically delivered life-changing returns, dwarfing even the best periods of gold investment returns or the wildest SPX6900 price prediction surges. Investors rotating profits from gold into Based Eggman gain exposure to the type of exponential upside that is only possible when joining a trend in its infancy—making $GGs a compelling choice for those who believe the next crypto bull run will be meme-fueled. Building a Next-Generation Portfolio: Gold, SPX6900, and Based Eggman Today’s smartest investors are blending the stability of gold with the explosive growth potential of leading memecoins. By rotating a portion of gold profits into high-upside coins like SPX6900 and Based Eggman, portfolios can capture both defensive resilience and the potential for outsized gains. This modern approach to diversification is redefining wealth-building strategies for 2026, embracing both tried-and-true assets and the innovative spirit of the crypto frontier. Conclusion: From Gold Profits to Meme Coin Fortunes With gold continuing to deliver strong returns and crypto markets evolving at breakneck speed, the movement of capital from gold into SPX6900 coin and Based Eggman ($GGs) marks the dawn of a new era in digital investing. Whether you’re a traditionalist seeking to invest in gold or an early adopter searching for the best memecoins to buy, now is the time to consider how rotating profits into high potential altcoins could supercharge your portfolio for the years ahead.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $126k earlier this month but has underperformed since then. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $105k on Friday but is now showing signs of a strong recovery. It is now trading above $111k and could rally towards the 4H ILQ at $116k in the near term. BTC cuts monthly loss to 4% Bitcoin began the new week on a strong note, adding over 4% to its value in the last 24 hours. The positive performance comes after Bitcoin dropped below the $105k level on Friday as the price retested the lows of the October 17th crash. The positive performance marked a shift in momentum as buyers returned to the market, with market participants expecting further pumping over the next few days. The rally represents the third consecutive daily gain, confirming the continuation of the weekend rebound. The surge above $111k pushed BTC above the descending channel resulting from last week’s decline. This move signals a potential shift following Bitcoin’s strong bearish pressure in recent weeks. The breakout is also helping Bitcoin to recover its month-to-date performance, with its 30-day loss now down to 4% from last week’s 9% deficit. Traders and investors are now focusing their attention on the upcoming Fed policy meeting. The CPI data release later this week could provide insight into whether the Fed will cut the interest rate or leave it unchanged. However, with the US government shutdown still in play, the CPI data might be delayed. Bitcoin eyes $116k as RSI signals momentum shift The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bearish and efficient despite Bitcoin adding 4% to its value in the last 24 hours. The 20 and 100-day EMAs are now converging near $113,000, with the bulls expected to face some barrier around this resistance level. If the bulls push the price to $114k, the next minor resistance level would be at the 50-day EMA near $114,400, which is also the monthly opening price. Momentum indicators have switched to bullish, suggesting that the bulls are regaining control of the market. The 4H RSI of 61 shows strong buying pressure, but the daily RSI remains below the neutral 50. If the daily RSI continues rising above the neutral levels, BTC could continue its upward momentum towards the $116k Inducement Liquidity (ILQ) at $116k over the next few hours or days. However, failure to close the daily candle above $111k could see Bitcoin drop to the $108k region over the next few hours. The $105k low could serve as strong support in the near term. The market momentum has temporarily shifted to bullish as Fed rate-cut expectations could help push Bitcoin’s price toward the $150,000 mark in the coming weeks and months.

The closed-door roundtable is scheduled for Wednesday, October 22, 2025. According to the report, participants will include Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Kraken CEO Dave Ripley, and Ripple Labs General Counsel Stuart Alderoty, among others. The meeting will be chaired by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. The talks were arranged after a leaked Democratic proposal on DeFi regulation triggered pushback from Republicans and industry leaders. The leak intensified political friction and raised concerns over how far the government plans to go in reshaping the sector. Leaked DeFi Proposal Sparks Industry Backlash Earlier in October, an internal document titled “Preventing Illicit Finance and Regulatory Arbitrage Through Decentralized Finance Platforms” surfaced online. It outlined aggressive measures aimed at reducing illegal activity in decentralized finance. Key elements of the proposal include: registering DeFi service providers as brokers, including website admins with protocol access; expanding the powers of the U.S. Treasury and creating a blacklist of prohibited protocols; enforcing KYC/AML requirements on new groups, including some non-custodial wallet providers. Industry voices say the rules could amount to an effective ban. Critics argue the measures would drive developers and capital to foreign markets, weakening U.S. leadership in Web3. Some also claim the Democratic proposal aims to stall the Republican-backed CLARITY bill, which passed the House but has not yet advanced in the Senate.

Some of the leading altcoins performed even better, posting daily gains of around 10–11%. BTC Heads North The end of the previous business week brought another dose of pain for Bitcoin bulls, as the price of the primary cryptocurrency fell below $104,000. Over the weekend, however, the bears failed to maintain momentum, and the valuation gradually climbed to the current $111,200, according to CoinGecko data. Source: TradingView The positive performance could be attributed to Donald Trump’s recent announcement. The American president confirmed that he will meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seoul, South Korea, on October 31. He also described the Chinese president as “a very strong leader, a very amazing man,” hinting that the two global superpowers might reach a fair deal instead of igniting a trade war. Following BTC’s price revival, its market capitalization has risen above $2.2 trillion, while its dominance over altcoins stands at approximately 57.1%. These Alts Steal the Show Ethereum (ETH) has climbed by 5% in the past 24 hours, once again surpassing the psychological level of $4,000 and outperforming BTC during that period. Other major altcoins such as Chainlink (LINK), Zcash (ZEC), and Mantle (MNT) have recorded even more impressive gains in the range of 10–11%. Dogecoin (DOGE), Hyperliquid (HYPE), Cardano (ADA), Near Protocol (NEAR), and many others are also in the green, albeit with more modest increases. Among the few exceptions in red territory today (October 20) are Provenance Blockchain (HASH) and Flare (FLR). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has jumped to around $3.87 trillion, meaning the industry added roughly $150 billion in just 24 hours.

Responding to a post on X showing AI trading models competing in real time early Monday, CZ said he thought “AI strategies work if traders have their own plan that is better than others, and no one else has it.” “Saw this a lot in my feed. DeepSeek out performing the rest in AI trading. How does this work? … You are just buying and selling at the same time as others,” he surmised. Saw this a lot in my feed.

Otherwise, you are just buying and selling at the same… https://t.co/ExXZeAwx8p — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 20, 2025 CZ was reacting to a trading leaderboard from Alpha Arena by Nof1 showing various large language model (LLM)-powered trading bots competing over the course of 72 hours. DeepSeek tops leaderboard as AI bots compete According to the Alpha Arena chart, DeepSeek Chat V3.1 led rankings with a total account value of $11,995.57, a 19.96% gain in the three-day trading session. The bot virtually executed several leveraged long positions, including an ETH 15x long worth $19,375 with an unrealized profit of $1,648.53, together with SOL and BNB positions showing profits of $696.63 and $327.30, respectively. In second place, Claude Sonnet 4.5 posted a total account value of $10,584.58, up 5.84% from its starting balance. The model held an XRP 8x long valued at $12,335 with $441.78 in unrealized profit and a BTC 20x long worth $67,357 generating $380.99 in profit. At the lower end of the leaderboard, GPT-5 saw 36.82% loss on a total account value of $6,318.04. The OpenAI LLM made short bets in XRP and DOGE, both posting losses of $378.52 and $169.89, and a small gain from a BTC 10x long worth $9,647 with $29.22 in profit. The post that caught CZ’s attention originated from an advisor at global digital asset management firm Amber Group, who shared the Alpha Arena chart lauding DeepSeek’s lead . “Right now, DeepSeek is way ahead! To be honest, this feels so much more impactful than the AI memes from last year’s Goat/Ai16Z era,” the advisor wrote. “Has AI x Crypto finally found the right way to take off?” The advisor contrasted the LLM’s trading choices with human traders who neglect to define exit parameters before opening positions. “I’ve never been a fan of trading futures, but if you’re going to do it, shouldn’t you learn from these AIs and set proper take-profit and stop-loss conditions before opening a position?” they asked. Is AI really good for trading? Reddit approves CZ’s remarks and the discussion on X is similar to the forum chatter on other social media platforms like Reddit’s trading communities, where users have been sharing anecdotes of using ChatGPT and other LLMs for market analysis. On Reddit’s Wall Street Bets, one user claimed to have built a neural network predicting stock movements using daily news topics. “I tested it for one month and it outperformed my HYSA account by about 0.2%,” they claimed . However, co-founder of blockchain infrastructure company XYO Markus Levin believes many investors overestimate how much insight AI tools can provide. “In my experience, LLMs often pull from a small, self-reinforcing pool of sources when analyzing early-stage or niche projects. That usually means company press releases, founder posts on X, Reddit threads, and carefully managed media appearances,” Levin argued. According to Levin, proprietary AI systems used by trading firms can achieve higher accuracy rates, but publicly accessible models are prone to bias and lack real market data feeds. “They’re asking public LLMs questions like, ‘what project will 5–10x this year?’ and treating the responses as investment insight. That’s where the real risk lies,” he added. Some Wall Street and business enthusiasts like Eric Croak, president of Croak Capital, coin retail use of generative AI in crypto markets “algorithm-assisted gambling.” “I believe what makes AI dangerous with crypto and options specifically is its inability to explain asymmetric risk in real terms. These bots can easily omit factors like tax consequences or liquidity concerns. If it reads like a marketing blog instead of an investment memo, that is your warning,” he concluded.

Now, many of those same early movers are on the lookout for the best crypto to invest in before the next wave of momentum hits, and their attention is quickly shifting toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already raised over $17.35 million, with more than 70% sold out at $0.035 per token, signaling strong market demand. What makes MUTM stand out is its dual-lending DeFi protocol, combining Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract systems to create a more efficient, sustainable, and reward-driven financial ecosystem. With innovation, utility, and investor confidence aligning, Mutuum Finance is emerging as the best cryptocurrency to invest today, echoing the same early-stage excitement that once surrounded SHIB, but with the real-world utility to back it up. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Update: Bullish Wedge Hints at Upside Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) is assuming fresh signs of interest as it prints a bullish wedge off major levels of support after the recent dump. Breaking over 0.0000105 would be the trigger to a smooth ride to 0.000013, hinting that momentum could yet again be turning in favor of the bulls. Despite the market’s overall shakiness, SHIB has a history of strong rebounds once buyers regain control, making it a token closely watched by traders for potential short-term gains. While SHIB charts attract attention, many investors are also exploring emerging opportunities such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), seeking the next high-potential crypto to watch in 2025 and identifying the best crypto to invest for the upcoming bullish phase. Mutuum Finance Poised to See Massive Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fashionable in 2025 and is among the most hopeful cryptocurrencies to watch out for. Presale on the project has been an enormous success, with a mind-boggling total raised figure of $17.65 million by 17,320 investors in Phase 6, where over 70% of the phase has been sold. This tremendous momentum provides investors with even more confidence, and Mutuum Finance is a top crypto to invest in for anyone seeking entry into prosperous blockchain ventures with practical applications. $0.035 is the lowest bottom for MUTM and has helped establish it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest today. One of the prominent milestones of its DeFi roadmap is the highly anticipated launch of its innovative lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) on the Sepolia Testnet will be launched in Q4 2025 and feature important DeFi elements such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the Liquidator bot. USDT and ETH will be collateralized, for lending and borrowing, and secured from day one, enabling instant multi-asset DeFi trading in a fast, safe, and scalable ecosystem. All of the above characteristics continue making MUTM the best crypto to invest and an emerging new cryptocurrency coin for investors preparing for the next bull run. MUTM Leaderboard Update Mutuum Finance leaderboard is in high demand from prospective members who want to occupy the top spot on the site’s best clients.

53407504,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=180550,1760952610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/53407504.jpeg,"Ethereum Holds $3,900: 5 Best Altcoins to Buy Now Before the Next Bullish Reversal",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-holds-3900-5-best-altcoins-to-buy-now-before-the-next-bullish-reversal/,"Ethereum continues to hold firm around the $3,900 mark, and traders are looking for the best altcoins to buy before the next bullish reversal . Among analyst picks are Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Sui, and MAGACOIN FINANCE , a newer project gaining attention for its price setup and listing momentum. Ethereum Price Builds Toward the Next Move Ethereum’s price has rebounded sharply after finding support near $3,500. The move has encouraged optimism that ETH could aim for the $4,500 range if current buying pressure continues. Analysts note that Ethereum’s daily chart has formed a clear flag pattern — a setup that often signals continuation of an upward move after a brief pause. Data from Glassnode shows Ethereum’s MVRV levels hovering around $3,900, a range that has historically triggered new upward trends. Each time ETH bounced from this area, prices advanced toward the $5,000 zone, suggesting this might be another such moment. The improving structure and positive technical backdrop make Ethereum one of the best altcoins to buy before the next bullish reversal , as traders anticipate the market’s next leg higher. If ETH can sustain momentum above $3,900, analysts believe a move toward $4,450–$4,500 remains within reach this month. MAGACOIN FINANCE Draws Attention as a Hidden Gem Among newer names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting growing interest from analysts and large holders. With its price still below $0.0006 , many see it as undervalued compared to Ethereum or XRP. The project has been gaining whale accumulation amid upcoming exchange listings , suggesting quiet confidence from early participants. Analysts expect MAGACOIN FINANCE to outperform older altcoins in the next cycle due to its smaller $16 million market cap and fresh market entry. Some projections suggest it could cancel two zeros in price during the next major run, which would mark a strong move for early buyers. Many now view it as one of the best altcoins to buy before the next bullish reversal . Sui Finance Price Outlook: Building Toward a Breakout Sui is once again on traders’ radar after showing early signs of stabilization around $2.70 . Analysts tracking the coin’s structure point to long-term Fibonacci targets between $7.7 and $11.2 , assuming the market trend strengthens. Despite recent market turbulence, Sui’s ecosystem continues to expand, with new projects launching on its network. This steady build-up of activity could help Sui rebound faster once sentiment turns positive again. Given its price level and active development, Sui ranks among the best altcoins to buy before the next bullish reversal , especially for traders watching mid-cap coins with clear upside room. XRP Chart Shows Explosive Setup Market watcher Mikybull called XRP’s current setup “explosive” , saying it could be preparing for a major move after weeks of sideways trading. The coin currently trades around $2.50 , resting above a long-term support area that has historically led to sharp rallies. Analysts point to $3.25 as a key trigger level — a breakout above it could open the path to $6.28 or even higher. The coin’s prolonged consolidation and renewed analyst focus have placed XRP back on the list of best altcoins to buy before the next bullish reversal . Other traders, including Charting Guy and Alex Cobb, expect XRP’s next move to test new highs, possibly pushing beyond its 2021 levels if market sentiment turns positive again. Solana Price Eyes Break Above $190 Solana has bounced from the $174 zone , gaining over 7% in a single day. This recovery has revived hopes of a push toward $190–$200 , levels that could confirm a short-term reversal. Analysts note a double-bottom formation on the chart and rising RSI, both pointing to renewed demand. Adding to the optimism is Solana’s upcoming October 20 announcement , which has already boosted activity across its ecosystem. If the price clears the $190 mark, traders expect Solana to target $220 and $230 in the following weeks. These technical and fundamental catalysts position Solana among the best altcoins to buy before the next bullish reversal , as the market prepares for a potential rally phase. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s stability near $3,900 is setting the stage for a wider market recovery. For traders looking for the best altcoins to buy before the next bullish reversal , Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Sui, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out. Those seeking fresh upside may explore MAGACOIN FINANCE , given its low price and active whale accumulation.

Could improve its technical foundation, security, and performance for enterprise use. According to the COTI Foundation’s insight on Medium, the process is automatic and requires no action from users or node operators for the transition of wallets, tokens, and network participants. The network developers reiterated the network’s architecture is being refined to meet more needs of developers, enterprise partners, and end users. COTI upgrade to accommodate more features The COTI network is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)-based blockchain optimized for payments and enterprise solutions. Much different from traditional blockchains like Ethereum Layer 1, it allows transactions to link directly to one another through parallel processing and high throughput. The network’s consensus mechanism, known as Proof of Trust, powers a decentralized ledger called Trustchain, which is capable of processing more than 100,000 transactions per second, according to stats from crypto exchange Coinbase. The Hydrogen hard fork comes with several protocol-level improvements meant to boost COTI’s stability, cryptographic security, and long-term maintainability. COTI stated that the changes are on the backdrop of the comprehensive audit completed earlier in 2025, which identified several areas for optimization in the network’s Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and gcEVM components. As reported by the Foundation, MPC framework’s new file-handling mechanisms have been implemented to improve safety, alongside secure cryptographic randomness and memory hygiene. After the hard fork, users will be able to wipe sensitive data from memory during cleanup for their privacy, and in-turn reduce security risks. Connection handling under high-concurrency conditions has also been upgraded, improving stability when the network experiences heavy usage. “Enhancements to connection handling under high-concurrency conditions also make the network more robust in real-world usage scenarios,” the foundation wrote . Refinements made to the gcEVM protocol Hydrogen is also making changes on the gcEVM protocol layer side, which will see protocol validation tightened, while error handling during opcode execution and streamlined block processing is improved. The company said the refinements will make COTI a more consistent and secure execution standard for all network participants. “This is a foundational shift that increases trust and reliability across the ecosystem,” COTI stated in its announcement. All node operators have already upgraded to the latest software release ahead of time. COTI confirmed there will be no expected disruption to network operations, and user assets will be secure throughout the transition. COTI reward loyalty ecosystem expanded The upgrade comes just three weeks after the launch of COTI Earn, the company’s new loyalty platform that rewards community participation. The platform debuted as Season 001: Genesis, featuring a pool of 12.5 million COTI tokens distributed as on-chain rewards, Cryptopolitan reported . COTI Earn rewards engagement through a points-based system, where user interaction such as holding assets, trading and referrals, generates Token Points (TPs). The platform coined TPs “a new type of on-chain token” that is minted daily and automatically dropped to user wallets. “COTI Earn is designed to recognize real users and real contributions to the ecosystem. As on-chain activity increases, loyalty platforms must evolve to be transparent, fair, and rewarding by design. Platforms running on vanity metrics simply won’t stand the test of time,” explained Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI. According to the company, all TP rewards are liquid because they exist directly on-chain. Users can generate revenue and earn daily rewards by holding specific supported assets like wETH, wBTC, USDC-e, COTI, or gCOTI in the COTI Treasury. Interested participants are required to connect their wallets to earn.coti.io to begin accumulating rewards. COTI’s token price climbed 6.94% in the past 24 hours, seemingly reacting to the mainnet upgrade news and outpacing the cryptocurrency market’s 4.15% gain. The token is trading at $0.03529 at the time of this publication, which has lifted its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) from 33.31 to 36.25 to exit oversold conditions. Get seen where it counts.

The recent dip for XRP to below $2.50 coincided with peak DEX activity. XRP showed relative weakness under $2.50, as the asset failed to rally along with other altcoins. Instead, XRP showed weakness under $3, as more coins were sent to exchanges. As Cryptopolitan reported , XRP whales dumped up to $50M worth of tokens on the open market each day, further pressuring the price. In addition to exchange inflows, XRP also showed a significant pickup in DEXs activity. XRP is a recent addition to decentralized trading, mainly due to its technology, until an EVM-compatible version was created for XRPL. XRP slowed its relentless climb after the recent delays of ETF approval dates. While XRP is seen as one of the most probable additions to crypto ETF, the US Government shutdown has moved the dates indefinitely into the future. XRP Ledger posts more active DEX activity in October In the past few weeks, DEX activity linked to XRPL increased, with a higher daily baseline. Volumes peaked in the past week, following the market-wide liquidation on October 10-11. During the period of peak DEX activity, XRP sank further under $3, pressured by the overall market correction. DEX transactions also increased on XRPL, rising from a recent low of 600K to over 900K transfers daily. However, transfers are still lower compared to the last quarter of 2024. The DEX activity is seen as an indicator of more active trading. The volumes may point to different scenarios. In the bearish case, whales are using DEXs to shed more XRP, as they expect the downtrend to continue. Since all orders were filled, the opposite scenario may be an accumulation of XRP by smart money, expecting a recovery to a higher range. One possible explanation for XRP is that retail is panic-selling, while whales are using the opportunity to re-buy at a lower range. As of October 20, sentiment is shifting for XRP, with crowd money showing a more optimistic attitude, as whales remain bearish . XRP grows its DEX liquidity Recent data shows the past two quarters achieved gradual growth for XRPL decentralized liquidity. Since October 2024, decentralized trades for XRP moved to a higher liquidity range, often with over $20B available daily. XRPL increased its decentralized liquidity over the past year, with a recent peak on October 10 during the most active market liquidations. | Source: CryptoQuant . On October 10, XRPL DEX liquidity briefly shot up to a local peak above $40B, coinciding with one of the days of active selling. XRP is still concerned with available liquidity, as old holders may seek to cash out. If liquidity fails, the realized price may remain much lower. In addition to DEX activity, XRP may be pressured by derivative markets. The coin’s open interest inched up to $1.27B, with a slight recovery for long positions. Traders are cautious about shorting XRP, but long positions go as low as $2.30, potentially leading to liquidations. For now, XRP has avoided derivative position liquidations, as traders focused on BTC. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

Regulations in the industry tighten, while digital assets diversify across exchanges, networks, DeFi protocols, and transaction types. This means that managing your crypto taxes in 2025 requires precision, automation, and compliance. Whether you are a casual investor, frequent trader, or a DeFi enthusiast, the right crypto tax software can save you hours of work, reduce costly errors, and keep you compliant. The following guide breaks down the best crypto tax software tools for 2025. I compare them across several key areas, including integrations, usability, transaction coverage, security, and overall value. Each platform was reviewed based on testing and research. Main Takeaways: Crypto tax software is essential for anyone trading, staking, or earning crypto in 2025. Automation can both save time and reduce risk, especially for users with heavy usage across multiple wallets and chains. Jurisdiction-specific compliance makes for accurate reporting for various taxing institutions. Security and privacy are non-negotiable. Top crypto tax apps also offer features such as portfolio tracking for real-time insight and optimization. The right app will be based on your level of activity. 8 Best Crypto Tax Software for 2025 Name Features Rating Koinly Best Overall Supports 700+ exchanges & hundreds of chains Beginner-friendly yet powerful Multiple accounting & tax optimization tools GDPR & SOC 2 compliance 4.9/5 Register Now CoinLedger Best for Active Traders Integrates with top exchanges & tax platforms Covers DeFi, NFTs, and derivatives Tax-loss harvesting tools CPA-ready reporting 4.9/5 Register Now CoinTracker Best for CEX Users Supports 500+ exchanges & wallets Exports directly to TurboTax Free portfolio tracking Clean, intuitive interface 4.8/5 Register Now CryptoTaxCalculator Best for DeFi Portfolios Thousands of integrations AI-powered categorization & error checks Handles complex DeFi and NFT activity Responsive customer support 4.7/5 Register Now TokenTax Best for High-Volume Traders Integrates with CEXs and DeFi CPA access and audit support Real-time tax tracking Automated gains and losses 4.6/5 Register Now Blockpit Best for EU Users Combines tax and portfolio tracking Localized tax logic for EU users Tax-loss harvesting tools Simple interface 4.6/5 Register Now TaxBit Best for Enterprises (US) Enterprise-grade for US institutions Backed by CPAs and auditors Strong integration and security 4.5/5 Register Now ZenLedger Best for US Filers Supports DeFi, NFTs, and staking Full IRS-compliant reports Includes CPA and audit tools Clean dashboard 4.4/5 Register Now Koinly – Best Overall Koinly 4.9/5 Supports 700+ exchanges and hundreds of blockchains Beginner-friendly yet powerful Multiple accounting and tax optimization tools Strong GDPR and SOC 2 compliance Free plan lacks full reports Limited country support No two-factor authentication Register Now Main Takeaway: Koinly is best for investors who want a blend of power and usability. It is suitable for individuals with both high and moderate transaction volumes, as well as for those engaging with DeFi through staking, NFTs, and more. It’s a reliable crypto tax software, so long as you don’t mind paying for its full features. Koinly has managed to establish itself as one of the most popular crypto tax apps in the market. It is user-friendly and very comprehensive, bridging the gap between complex on-chain activity and real-world compliance with tax regulations. The platform supports more than 700 exchanges, hundreds of blockchains, and multiple methods for accounting. Users can import their data via API or CSV. They can also classify events such as trades, transfers, staking, airdrops, NFTs, and much more. Koinly can also deliver jurisdiction-specific tax reports (such as IRS Form 8949, HMRC capital gains, etc.). Its interface is simple enough so that even if you are a beginner, you will be able to operate it sufficiently well. There are a few drawbacks to it that I stumbled across while using the platform. First, I couldn’t secure my account with a two-factor authentication, which I feel is a straightforward implementation. I also noticed that it has been brought up before in community forums. The free tier has significant limitations – it doesn’t include a full tax form export or audit-level exports, but this is to be expected to some extent. All in all, Koinly has a very strong security and operational backbone and is an industry leader for a reason. It holds compliance for GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001, encryption, read-only APIs, and also undergoes regular audits to make sure that user data is safe. Pros: Broad exchange, blockchain, and wallet support. Interface is user-friendly and suitable for both beginners and advanced users. Supports multiple accounting methods. Tax optimization and harvesting features are available. Strong regulatory compliance. Cons: The free tier lacks essential tax features and full export capability. Support in some countries is lacking. Misses 2FA. CoinLedger – Best for Active Traders CoinLedger 4.9/5 Integrates with top exchanges and tax platforms Covers DeFi, NFTs, and derivatives Includes tax-loss harvesting tools CPA-ready reporting Free plan lacks full tax forms Occasional transaction errors Register Now Main Takeaway: CoinLedger is best suited for active cryptocurrency traders and DeFi users who are looking for a balance when it comes to automation and control. It has very powerful features and integrations for demanding users. Its free tier seems a bit limited. CoinLedger is formerly known as CryptoTrader.Tax. It’s a crypto tax app that’s designed to make reporting accessible for everyone – even those of you who juggle between multiple wallets, exchanges, and transaction types. It supports both API and CSV imports and is capable of classifying transactions. It can integrate into powerful tax-filing platforms such as TurboTax, TaxACT, H&R Block, and TaxSlayer. The interface itself is relatively easy to us,e and I didn’t come across any major hurdles while playing with it. In my view, CoinLedger is ideal for active crypto traders, especially if you are highly engaged with DeFi, derivatives, or produce a very high turnover. Notable features include its automation capabilities and ability to generate full tax forms for its supported jurisdictions. However, even though I didn’t experience it myself, I came across reports of some users complaining that it had made some mistakes and had occasionally missed transactions. It’s also worth noting that its free tier is a bit limited, but can be a powerful tool for those who want to learn about its capabilities and make a decision whether to pay for a plan or not. Pros: Integrates with a lot of exchanges and tax-filing platforms. Full support for decentralized finance, NFTs, and more. Tax-loss harvesting tools are included. Professional accountants can view and edit client reports. Cons: The free plan doesn’t include full tax reporting features. Reported edge case mistakes and occasional missing transactions. CoinTracker – Best for CEX Users CoinTracker 4.8/5 Supports 500+ exchanges and wallets Exports directly to TurboTax Free portfolio tracking Clean, intuitive interface Advanced tools locked in premium tiers Limited support for smaller exchanges Customer support could improve Register Now Main Takeaway: CoinTracker is best for users who mostly trade on major exchanges and who want a streamlined, user-friendly tax software with strong integrations. If you are using lesser-known DeFi protocols or engage in more on-chain activities, there might be better options on the market. CoinTracker is a crypto tax software presenting a very streamlined user interface, designed to simplify crypto taxation. It’s primarily aimed at users who trade on centralized exchanges. It supports more than 500 exchanges and popular wallets. Users are able to import APIs, upload CSVs, or even import a wallet address for CoinTracker to start classifying and looking into trades, income, and prepare tax-ready forms such as Schedule D and IRS Form 8949. The platform also comes with some nice portfolio tracking features. It can integrate with H&R Block and TurboTax, making it easier to export your data into a broader tax filing system. Using it in practice is easy because it does come with a balance of simplicity and also capabilities. However, there are a few caveats that need noting. Although the interface really is simple to use and intuitive, you might find issues if you are using a lesser-known exchange or tokens that may not provide API support. You will need to adjust numbers through a spreadsheet, which could be a burden. It’s also worth noting that the most advanced features are gated behind the more expensive plans, which I guess is to be expected. Although I personally haven’t had to use customer support, some people have expressed concerns about its responsiveness. Pros: Supports over 500 exchanges and wallets Imports and categorizes NFT and DeFi transactions. You can export to TurboTax and IRS Forms. Free portfolio tracker Cons: Advanced features are gated behind more expensive plans. Customer support challenges are reported by some users. CryptoTaxCalculator – Best for DeFi Portfolios CryptoTaxCalculator 4.7/5 Thousands of integrations AI-powered categorization and error checks Handles complex DeFi and NFT activity Responsive customer support Price grows with transaction volume Free plan lacks full reports Register Now Main Takeaway: Crypto Tax Calculator is great for users who have very complex crypto portfolios, and especially for those who are very active in DeFi, NFTs, or multi-chain trading. If you need powerful automation, sufficient control over categorization, and reporting ready for audits, this might be a great option. CryptoTaxCalculator positions itself as a sophisticated but user-friendly tool for users who want to manage their crypto tax obligations. More particularly, it appeals to people who have diverse transaction types and even cross-chain activity. The app supports thousands of integrations, including over 150 exchanges, more than 500 wallets, and over 2,300 DeFi protocols. This allows it to import a broad range of behaviors such as trading, airdrops, NFTs, staking, providing liquidity, and more. It’s worth noting that CryptoTaxCalculator relies on AI for its categorization, which is what’s doing a lot of the heavy lifting such as flagging spam transactions, detecting mistakes, or allowing for mass edits directly within the app itself. On the other hand, its pricing is tied to transaction volume, which means that heavy users mind find that cost grow, especially if they exceed the plan’s limits. Much like some of the other options on our list, CryptoTaxCalculator also features a free plan, but it has limited capabilities and doesn’t generate full tax reports. Pros: Comprehensive integration with exchanges, wallets, and DeFi projects. AI-driven auto categorization, spam filtering, and error detection. Clean and intuitive UI. Responsive customer support. Cons: Costs can grow rapidly with high transaction volumes. Full tax reports are not available in the free version. TokenTax – Best for High-Volume Traders TokenTax 4.6/5 Integrates with CEXs and DeFi CPA access and audit support Real-time tax tracking Automated gains and losses High cost for full features Basic plans cover few exchanges Register Now Main Takeaway: TokenTax is best for high-volume, high-throughput traders looking for a mix of automation and CPA assistance. Paying the full price is worth it if you have a serious need for in-depth accounting. It’s not very suitable for casual traders. TokenTax is another crypto tax software that aims to provide an all-in solution for handling your crypto taxes. It does blend in powerful automation capabilities with access to tax professionals. The platform allows you to import data from most of the centralized and decentralized exchanges. It calculates gains, losses, and income from various crypto activities and can also generate tax forms. In the premium tiers, TokenTax also offers a full tax preparation service, which is carried out by certified accountants, as well as assistance with audits. As it is with most of the platforms on this list, the above powerful features also come with some tradeoffs. The pricing can be quite steep, especially for users who have lower transaction volume. Many of the advanced features are unlocked in the plans with higher fees. Additionally, some of the basic plans have limited exchange support and you have contact support for certain add-ons and capabilities. Pros: Deep exchange and DeFi integration. Access to certified accountants, full tax filing, and audit support. Real-time liability tracking and tax optimization features. Automatic calculation of gains, losses, and income. Cons: High-end premium pricing for full capabilities. Basic accounts support only a few exchanges. Blockpit – Best for EU Users Blockpit 4.6/5 Combines tax and portfolio tracking Localized tax logic for EU users Tax-loss harvesting tools Simple interface Fewer integrations than rivals Free plan is limited Full form support only in select regions Register Now Main Takeaway: Blockpit is best suited for users in Europe who want a crypto tax tool with solid compliance, optimization features, and portfolio tracking under one roof. It’s also an excellent choice for users with portfolios focused on the major cryptocurrencies. Blockpit brings forward a comprehensive crypto tax and portfolio tracking solution that places the emphasis on regulatory compliance and user friendliness. It is especially targeted at users in Europe. Its platform supports more than 250,000 assets and it can also integrate with the majority of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers. There are three core modules – tax optimization, portfolio tracking, and tax calculation. This means that users can see their holdings, as well as their tax liabilities at the same place. For users who are located in the supported countries, Blockpit also provides pre-filled tax forms and localized tax algorithms. One of the core benefits is the built-in tax-loss harvesting tool and some of the tax optimization features, which can help you reduce taxable gains whenever this is legally possible. On the flipside, some of its limitations include a relatively narrower integration and country support compared to some of the alternative tax solutions. The cost of upper-tier plans for a large number of transactions can get a bit steep. Pros: Offers tax and portfolio modules in a single platform. Pre-filled forms and localized tax logic. Tax-loss harvesting and optimization tools. Offers a clean and user-friendly interface. Cons: Limited integration compared to alternatives. The free plan lacks a lot of functionalities. Only full tax form support is available in certain jurisdictions. TaxBit – Best for Enterprises (US) TaxBit 4.5/5 Enterprise-grade for US institutions Backed by CPAs and auditors Strong integration and security Primarily US-focused Consumer version phased out Register Now Main Takeaway: TaxBit is best suited for US-based crypto institutions and enterprises, offering a feature-rich, trusted tax software with solid integrations and a free entry-level access for casual users. TaxBit is oriented toward institutions. In fact, in 2023, the firm announced that it will be discontinuing its consumer crypto tax products and focusing on enterprise offerings. In essence, it no longer serves individual users in most cases. However, it does offer a free plan, which offers users a portfolio overview and unlimited transaction imports. Its main focus is in the US and, therefore, support for other jurisdictions tends to be a bit limiting, making it less useful for international users. Pros: Oriented towards US-based enterprise. Backed by CPAs. Broad integration support. High data security practices. Cons: Primarily US-focused. The consumer version is being phased out in favor of an enterprise focus. ZenLedger – Best for US Filers ZenLedger 4.4/5 Supports DeFi, NFTs, and staking Full IRS-compliant reports Includes CPA and audit tools Clean dashboard Advanced tools in premium plans Limited use for non-US users Register Now Main Takeaway: ZenLedger is best for US-based users with mixed trading activity, who need a tool with deep features, audit support, and multiple integrations. However, it’s less ideal for international users or those who need support outside of its premium plans. ZenLedger is a robust and user-friendly crypto tax and accounting software. It is specifically tailored for traders who engage with DeFi, NFTs, and more complex crypto activity. It has a very comprehensive dashboard that allows you to import data from multiple exchanges and wallets and it can also generate IRS-compliant tax forms. It can track capital gains, losses, and income – all in one place. The platform supports integrations with different tools such as TurboTax and also has features such as CPA access, audit reports, tax-loss harvesting, giving users advanced reporting options, and more. Clearly, ZenLedger is stronger in the US than globally and some of its more advanced features are also locked behind high-tier plans. This is somewhat expected. The free entry levels offer limited access and if you’re not from the US, you might find form generation a lot less comprehensive. Pros: Clean, intuitive interface for importing and managing transactions. Full US tax form generation. Support for DeFi, NFT, and staking. Tax-loss harvesting, audit reports, CPA access. Cons: Advanced features locked behind more premium plans. Primarily focused on the US market. What is crypto tax software? Put simply, a crypto tax software is a digital tool that’s designed to help you (or your business) track, calculate, and report your taxes related to all of your cryptocurrency transactions. Because the majority of governments treat crypto as a taxable asset (it’s different everywhere, but almost everywhere it’s taxable), every sale, trade, swap, or even the reception of an airdrop can create a taxable event. As you can probably imagine, tracking all of these manually, especially if you operate accounts on different centralized exchanges and DeFi wallets , can be incredibly time-consuming and, what is perhaps even more important, error-prone. This is why some of the best crypto tax software out there can be very helpful. They work by integrating with the top crypto exchanges and wallets through APIs or through simple CSV uploads. The tool will then automatically import your transaction history and start categorizing activities such as trades, taking rewards, airdrops, etc., and then convert them into your local currency at historical exchange rates. Some would even go as far as to apply the appropriate tax rules based on your jurisdiction and generate the necessary forms. For instance, for US-based users, many of the crypto tax software can generate IRS Form 8949, while for UK-based users, they can generate reports aligned with the HMRC capital gains requirements. Beyond compliance, crypto tax software can also help you with your personal financial planning. Many platforms offer a real-time dashboard that tracks your gains, losses, and broader portfolio performance. This way, you can anticipate tax liabilities before the filing season. Moreover, advanced features such as tax-loss harvesting, audit support, and the ability to handle complex DeFi and NFT transactions can help you optimize your gains in a way that you won’t have to pay as much in taxes. Why you need a crypto tax software in 2025 If you’re someone who just holds Bitcoin for the long term and you do not perform any trading at all, you can probably do without a complex crypto tax software and file the necessary tax documents on your own. However, if you trade on centralized exchanges (or decentralized exchanges, for that matter), if you like to experiment with non-fungible tokens, or if you’re doing a fair bit of airdrop farming, then having a proper tax solution is essential. The fact of the matter is that the crypto landscape has become rather complex and regulated in 2025 to manage things manually. Governments across the world, including the US, the UK, EU, India, Australia, and many more, have already tightened their reporting requirements, and authorities currently expect accurate and detailed records of all of your transactions. The top crypto tax software can solve this by simply importing your data directly, classifying your tax events, and converting them into your local currency to prepare a ready-to-file report. So, if you’re looking for reasons why you need crypto tax software in 2025, the answer is quite simple – not only for convenience, but also for compliance, accuracy, and peace of mind. It ensures that you stay ahead of regulations, saves a lot of work, and, most importantly, avoids overpaying on your tax bill. How to choose the right crypto tax app? Because investing in cryptocurrencies is becoming more and more sophisticated in light of global regulations, choosing the right crypto tax app is essential, especially if you are more active in terms of trading or staking, for example. The right tool doesn’t juist help you file your taxes, but it also saves hours of work that you otherwise have to complete manually, reduces errors that could cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars, and ensures compliance with your local tax authority. But with so many options currently available, how to choose the best one? Well, I’ve compiled a list of some of the key factors to keep in mind. Key Factors to Consider when Choosing the Best Crypto Tax App Integration with wallets, exchanges, and blockchains The app of choice must connect to all the platforms you use – otherwise, it will serve you no good. Therefore, when you’re choosing a crypto tax app, make sure that it supports the applications you are using. As a practical tip here, you can look for API integrations for automatic syncing on top of the option to upload a CSV. Of course, that’s not entirely mandatory, but it is helpful, especially if you are using a range of different crypto applications for your trading. Support for different transaction types Not only should the crypto tax app be able to connect to the platforms you use, it should also support various transaction types. Let me elaborate. Suppose you are a DeFi power user who stakes, provides liquidity, trades NFTs, and so forth. These can be constructed of multiple isolated transactions, each one of which might constitute a taxable event. Therefore, I suggest that you choose a solid app that handles more than just trading. Compliance with local tax rules As I’ve stated multiple times in this guide, different jurisdictions treat crypto differently. For instance, your country might treat digital currencies as property, or you may be subject to capital gain tax. Choose an app that can provide reports based on the requirements of your specific regulator. Data security and privacy Your financial information is incredibly sensitive, so encryption and read-only API keys are practically non-negotiable. Make sure to review the platform’s privacy policy to make sure it doesn’t share or misuse your tax information. In summary, the right crypto tax app successfully blends security, compliance, and ease of use with scalability of your individual trading habits. Key features of the top crypto tax software Above are just some of the main considerations to choose a crypto tax app, but there are many more features that these software solutions have, so allow me to list some that you should keep in mind. Key features to look for: Extensive exchange and wallet integrations Broad transaction type coverage Jurisdiction-specific tax compliance Real-time portfolio tracking Automated gain, loss, and income calculations Data security and privacy protection Ease of use Filing support In summary, the best crypto tax software will combine automation, compliance, and a user-friendly design. This will turn complex crypto activity into very simple and accurate tax reporting. Reviewing criteria: how did I select the best crypto tax software To prepare the grading and ranking of this specific guide, I have looked beyond our service descriptions and considered several criteria. The weight for our ranking methodology is as is: Exchange and wallet integrations – 25% Transaction type coverage – 25% Data security and privacy protection – 25% Ease of use – 10% Jurisdiction-specific tax compliance – 10% Other (“quality of life” features) – 5% Frequently asked questions (FAQs) Which tax software is best for cryptocurrency? Koinly is one of the most popular choices amongst thousands of users worldwide. It offers a robust toolkit for both calculating and filing your taxes, as well as optimizing expenses and minimizing payable taxes. What is the best way to do crypto taxes? The best way to do your crypto taxes is to use a crypto tax software. This is especially true if you are a power user or someone who trades a lot or is heavily involved in DeFi. Doing your crypto taxes manually or without the help of a professional accountant can result in trouble and even serious financial hurdles. How much is crypto tax software? Most of the crypto tax apps have a free version, which can allow you to carry out some basic tasks. Almost all of them are paid for beyond the free trial, and the prices can differ from as little as $30 per tax season to thousands of dollars for more advanced users or CPAs. How to keep track of crypto taxes? To best keep track of your crypto taxes, use a crypto tax software with a dashboard that monitors your portfolio and trades in real time, like Koinly or CoinLedger. This way, you will know exactly what your tax liabilities are at any given moment. How much do crypto tax accountants charge? Based on several user reports, a CPA will charge you between $150 and $500 to handle your crypto taxes. However, this will cover only basic services, and you shouldn’t expect any advanced advice or strategies to optimize your taxes or to understand your liabilities better. Conclusion Crypto taxes in 2025 demand automation – it’s as simple as that. You also have to be accurate and compliant to avoid costly mistakes. The best crypto tax app, however, will heavily depend on your activity level and jurisdiction. Koinly, for example, balances power and usability, while CoinLedger is suited more toward active traders and has strong filing integrations. CoinTracker is streamlined for major CEX users, while the other options on our list all excel at different things. As a user, you should prioritize integrations with your wallets and exchanges, the coverage of your transaction types, security and privacy, as well as jurisdiction-specific reporting. I highly recommend that you check out the app through its free tier – most of them have it. Although capabilities are limited, it will definitely help you “feel” the interface and whether the platform is something you would like to keep using for the long term. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which tax software is best for cryptocurrency?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Koinly is a popular all-round choice thanks to wide exchange and blockchain support, multiple accounting methods, and robust compliance features.

53408165,https://cryptonews.com/?p=440473,1760954027,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53408165.jpeg,Vitalik Introduces GKR Protocol to Accelerate Ethereum Zero-Knowledge Proofs,https://cryptonews.com/news/vitalik-introduces-gkr-protocol-to-accelerate-ethereum-zero-knowledge-proofs/,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a detailed blog post on Sunday, explaining GKR, a new cryptographic technique that significantly accelerates blockchain verification. The protocol allows computers to prove complex calculations are correct without revealing the actual data, a process known as zero-knowledge proofs . GKR can verify 2 million calculations per second on regular laptops and check entire Ethereum transactions using just fifty consumer-grade graphics cards. Traditional methods require computers to do 100 times more work than the original calculation, but GKR cuts this down to just 10-15 times more work. The breakthrough matters because faster verification means cheaper transactions and better privacy. Instead of checking every step of a calculation, GKR only verifies the beginning inputs and final outputs, skipping all the work in between. A GKR tutorial: https://t.co/Oo7jraC4sy — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 20, 2025 The development comes as the Ethereum Foundation launched a 47-member Privacy Cluster to make the network more private by default, addressing concerns that public blockchains currently expose too much financial information. How GKR Makes Verification 10 Times Faster GKR works like a teacher grading math homework by checking only the student’s work at key checkpoints instead of verifying every single calculation step. This “spot check” approach uses mathematical tricks to ensure the final answer is correct. The protocol excels at verifying repetitive tasks where the same operation applies to large amounts of data through multiple processing stages. This pattern fits both blockchain transaction verification and artificial intelligence calculations, which makes GKR useful beyond just cryptocurrencies. Traditional blockchain verification requires creating cryptographic fingerprints for every intermediate calculation step. Each fingerprint needs significant computing power to generate, often hundreds of operations just to verify a single multiplication. GKR eliminates nearly all this extra work. Source: Vitalik Buterin Buterin’s tutorial focuses on proving Poseidon2 hash functions, a common cryptographic operation that processes data through alternating mathematical operations. Think of hashing like scrambling an egg; you can’t unscramble it, but you can verify the scrambling process was done correctly. The verification process works backward from the final result, progressively confirming each layer was calculated correctly without actually redoing all the math. The verifier only needs to check random samples at each stage, using mathematical principles to guarantee the entire calculation is valid. Ethereum’s Privacy Infrastructure The GKR advancement supports the Ethereum Foundation’s September shift toward making privacy the default rather than an optional feature. The organization rebranded its Privacy & Scaling Explorations team to Privacy Stewards for Ethereum , focusing on practical privacy solutions instead of just research. The new Privacy Cluster addresses five critical areas, which involve enabling private transactions without surveillance, allowing private data verification, creating selective identity disclosure, improving user privacy experience, and building tools for institutional adoption. The project warns that without strong privacy protections, Ethereum could become “ the backbone of global surveillance rather than global freedom. “ Ethereum Foundation's @PrivacyEthereum rebrands as PSE with a roadmap making privacy the default across the technical stack to prevent surveillance risks. #Ethereum #Privacy https://t.co/opTQ6LQaOc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 14, 2025 Vitalik Buterin has also previously argued that privacy is essential to Ethereum’s survival, comparing current public blockchains to the early internet before encryption became standard. He advocated for wallets that make private transactions the default setting rather than requiring extra steps. Joining Vitalik’s growing belief, industry expert Petro Golovko from British Gold Trust told Cryptonews that public blockchains expose salaries, business deals, and account balances, making crypto “ unusable for regular people and impossible for institutions. ” He argued that “ transparency is useful for auditing, not for living. A system where your employer, competitors, or even strangers can see your balance is not transparent—it’s unlivable. “ Golovko compared current blockchain transparency to the 1990s internet before encryption became standard. “ Nobody wanted to type credit card numbers into a browser because the internet had no encryption. Then SSL arrived, Amazon scaled, and e-commerce became a $6 trillion industry. Blockchain is stuck in the pre-SSL era. “ He warned that trade secrecy is foundational to competitive advantage. “ If your supply chain or treasury movements are visible, you’ve already lost. No board of directors will approve such exposure. ” Without privacy, he concluded, “ crypto remains a casino, not a monetary system. “ The post Vitalik Introduces GKR Protocol to Accelerate Ethereum Zero-Knowledge Proofs appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|Ethereum|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-20 09:53:47
53408217,https://cryptonews.com/?p=440517,1760954104,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53408217.jpeg,Two-Thirds of Institutional Investors Bullish on Bitcoin Heading Into 2026: Coinbase,https://cryptonews.com/news/two-thirds-of-institutional-investors-bullish-on-bitcoin-heading-into-2026-coinbase/,"Roughly two-thirds of institutional investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s prospects heading into 2026, according to Coinbase Institutional’s latest survey. Key Takeaways: Coinbase found that 67% of institutional investors are bullish on Bitcoin, even as some believe the market is nearing the end of its bull run. Major treasury firms like BitMine and Strategy continue to accumulate crypto. Coinbase expects rate cuts and global stimulus to support Bitcoin’s momentum into 2025. The findings suggest that large investors continue to view Bitcoin as a core asset despite recent volatility and mixed market sentiment. “Most respondents are bullish on Bitcoin,” wrote David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, in the firm’s new report titled Navigating Uncertainty . Coinbase Survey: 67% of Institutions Bullish on Bitcoin Coinbase surveyed 124 institutional investors, with 67% expressing a positive outlook for Bitcoin over the next three to six months. However, Duong noted a “meaningful divergence” in perception of the market cycle, 45% of institutional respondents said the market is in the late stage of a bull run, while only 27% of retail investors shared that view. Duong highlighted that digital asset treasury (DAT) companies have played a key role in shaping supply and demand dynamics this year. He cited BitMine, chaired by Tom Lee, which recently purchased over 379,000 Ether (ETH) worth nearly $1.5 billion following last month’s market correction. Similarly, Michael Saylor hinted that Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) may increase its Bitcoin holdings after revealing a chart showing its $69 billion BTC treasury position. These moves, Duong said, signal strong institutional conviction even amid short-term market drawdowns. The report maintained that the crypto bull market “has room to run,” though Coinbase struck a more cautious tone following the October 10 sell-off. Duong said liquidity conditions remain robust and that a supportive macro backdrop, including potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and renewed stimulus measures in China, could help sustain market momentum into late 2025. Coinbase’s research pointed to these macro tailwinds as potential catalysts for further Bitcoin gains, noting that money-market funds are sitting on large reserves that could flow into risk assets. “Additional rate cuts from the Fed, as well as greater fiscal and monetary stimulus in China, could incentivize more investors to come off the sidelines,” Duong wrote. While Coinbase sees a favorable setup for Bitcoin, the firm remains cautious on altcoins, citing weaker liquidity and higher volatility. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Drive Sell Pressure Bitcoin’s sluggish recovery continues as long-term holders cash out after years of gains, according to on-chain data analyzed by market experts. Analyst James Check said the recent weakness isn’t caused by manipulation but by “good old-fashioned sellers,” noting that this wave of profit-taking has become the main resistance keeping Bitcoin below key price levels. The sheer volume of sell-side pressure from existing Bitcoin holders is **still** not widely appreciated, but it has been THE source of resistance. Not manipulation, not paper Bitcoin, not suppression. Just good old fashioned sellers. Also, it won't become irrelevant. https://t.co/4QnfCn2f7w pic.twitter.com/YiK7gtjkzj — _Checkmate (@_Checkmatey_) October 19, 2025 On-chain metrics show that the average age of spent coins has been rising, meaning older wallets are actively selling. Realized profits hit around $1.7 billion per day, while revived supply from dormant wallets surged to nearly $2.9 billion, signaling significant activity from long-term holders. Crypto investor Will Clemente described the shift as a transfer of supply from early holders to institutional investors, a dynamic he believes will fade over time.

His statement came with a video of an Amazon Web Services (AWS) representative referencing XRP in the context of payments. The short clip quickly gained traction, fueled by Squire’s bold reaction that “AWS just confirmed they’re looking into XRP for payments. If that’s legit… I’m all in: house, soul, and grandma included.” His enthusiasm captured the mood of many retail investors who view mentions of XRP by major global corporations as a validation of the asset’s utility. For XRP supporters, Squire’s post represented more than casual excitement, as it shows a growing belief that XRP could soon play a prominent role within mainstream financial infrastructure . Amazon Web Services x $XRP AWS just confirmed they’re looking into XRP for payments. If that’s legit… I’m all in: house, soul, and grandma included. WE’RE GOING TO THE MOON. pic.twitter.com/FLpYsYtWZc — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) October 18, 2025 AWS Representative Mentions XRP for Payments The video attached to Squire’s post featured an AWS representative who said, “We also have someone on our team dedicated to seeing where XRP for payments can be of use.” She went on to explain that her team is “working with different merchants as well as consumers, platforms, and apps to see where there could be a good opportunity for us there.” This statement marked one of the few times AWS has publicly mentioned XRP in a direct payments context. The phrasing suggested an exploratory phase, and this early-stage reference was enough to attract attention from both institutional and retail observers who have long speculated about Ripple’s partnerships with global enterprises . It could eventually lead to XRP’s integration into one of Amazon’s biggest services. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Significance for XRP’s Ecosystem XRP’s design as a digital asset focused on fast and low-cost cross-border transactions has always positioned it as a contender for large-scale payment applications. The possibility of AWS examining its use within merchant and consumer frameworks adds a new layer of relevance. AWS already serves as the technological backbone for thousands of financial applications, and any involvement with XRP could theoretically create a more direct path for businesses to access blockchain-based payment solutions. Ripple has maintained partnerships with financial institutions and payment providers worldwide. Its On-Demand Liquidity service uses XRP to facilitate instant settlements without the need for pre-funded accounts. If AWS were to explore similar functionality, it could signal that enterprise-grade cloud providers are beginning to take a closer look at XRP’s operational efficiency . For many traders, corporate references to XRP can translate into renewed confidence in the asset’s future role. While the AWS representative’s comments did not confirm a direct partnership with Ripple, they introduced a clear acknowledgment that XRP is being evaluated within one of the world’s largest cloud ecosystems.

53408375,609792,1760954318,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53408375.jpeg,Von Saylor bis Volksbank: Wie Bitcoin jetzt Banken und Milliarden anzieht – und Bitcoin Hyper profitiert,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bank-volksbank-institutionen-btc/,"Michael Saylor deutet einen weiteren milliardenschweren Bitcoin-Kauf an. Gleichzeitig startet in Deutschland das erste Pilotprojekt für BTC-besicherte Kredite. Beides zeigt: BTC wird zunehmend zum festen Bestandteil des institutionellen Finanzsystems. Bitcoin bewegt wieder die Finanzwelt – und diesmal gleich auf zwei Ebenen. Während Michael Saylor mit seinem Unternehmen Strategy offenbar vor dem nächsten massiven Kauf steht, wagt eine deutsche Bankengruppe den Sprung in die BTC-Kreditwelt. Zwei Ereignisse, die zeigen, dass digitale Werte längst im traditionellen Finanzsystem angekommen sind. Doch wie hängen diese Entwicklungen zusammen – und was bedeuten sie für die Zukunft von BTC? Michael Saylor signalisiert neuen BTC-Kauf Michael Saylor, Gründer von Strategy, hat erneut für Aufsehen gesorgt. In einem Beitrag auf der Plattform X veröffentlichte er eine Grafik, die die bisherigen BTC-Investitionen seines Unternehmens zeigt. Dazu schrieb er: „Der wichtigste orange Punkt ist immer der nächste.“ Für Beobachter ist klar: Wenn Saylor solche Worte wählt, steht meist der nächste Kauf bevor. Bereits in der Vergangenheit deutete er neue Investitionen auf ähnliche Weise an – und kurz darauf folgte stets eine offizielle Bestätigung. Michael Saylor on the future of Bitcoin: • Banks will start lending against your Bitcoin• United States government will hold Bitcoin• Big tech companies will embrace Bitcoin• You will have Bitcoin on your iPhone pic.twitter.com/6d0Ntu44BE — Only Bitcoin (@BTC_Vibes) October 18, 2025 Die BTC-Community reagierte prompt auf den Post. Analysten vermuten, dass Strategy schon in den kommenden Tagen neue Käufe tätigen könnte. Nach Angaben des Saylor BTC Trackers hat das Unternehmen seit 2020 bereits 82 Transaktionen durchgeführt. Aktuell hält Strategy 640.250 BTC im Wert von rund 69 Milliarden US-Dollar. Das entspricht einem Gewinn von etwa 45 Prozent gegenüber dem durchschnittlichen Kaufpreis von 74.000 US-Dollar pro BTC. Strategy bleibt der größte Bitcoin-Halter der Welt Strategy gilt mittlerweile als der größte institutionelle BTC-Besitzer weltweit. Das Unternehmen kontrolliert etwa 2,5 Prozent der gesamten Umlaufmenge. Damit ist es der unangefochtene Marktführer im institutionellen Bereich. Auf den weiteren Plätzen folgen Marathon Digital mit rund 53.250 BTC und die japanische Firma Metaplanet mit über 30.000 BTC. Auch XXI (CEP) und die BTC Standard Treasury Company (CEPO) gehören zu den größten Haltern. Gemeinsam zeigen diese Unternehmen, dass der Trend zu BTC im Finanzsektor weiter zunimmt. Trotz der beeindruckenden Zahlen spüren einige dieser Firmen den Druck des zuletzt schwächelnden BTC-Kurses. Besonders Metaplanet geriet in die Schlagzeilen, als der Börsenwert des Unternehmens unter die Summe seiner eigenen BTC-Reserven fiel. Solche Entwicklungen zeigen, dass auch institutionelle Investoren den Schwankungen des Kryptomarkts ausgeliefert sind – selbst, wenn sie langfristig auf das digitale Gold setzen. Deutsche Banken starten Pilotprojekt mit Bitcoin-Krediten Während Michael Saylor weiter investiert, kommt aus Deutschland eine andere, nicht minder bedeutende Nachricht. Die Bitcoin-Plattform 21bitcoin, betrieben von der FIOR Digital GmbH, hat gemeinsam mit der Volksbank Raiffeisenbank Bayern Mitte eG und Sopra Financial Technology ein europaweit einzigartiges Pilotprojekt gestartet. Ziel ist die Entwicklung eines regulierungskonformen BTC-Kreditprodukts, das Banken und Finanzdienstleistern den Einstieg in den Kryptomarkt erleichtern soll. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Diese sogenannte White-Label-Lösung soll es Banken ermöglichen, Kunden BTC-besicherte Kredite anzubieten – und das unter Einhaltung aller geltenden Regulierungen, einschließlich der MiCAR-Vorgaben. Damit entsteht ein neues Bindeglied zwischen klassischem Bankwesen und digitalem Vermögensmanagement. CEO Daniel Winklhammer von 21bitcoin spricht von einem „entscheidenden Schritt, um BTC für jedermann zugänglich und nutzbar zu machen“. Volksbank Bayern Mitte als Pionier unter deutschen Instituten Die Volksbank Raiffeisenbank Bayern Mitte eG zählt zu den ersten deutschen Banken mit einer eigenen BTC-Strategie. Sie bringt wertvolle Erfahrung im Kreditgeschäft mit und reagiert damit auf die steigende Nachfrage nach regulierten BTC-Dienstleistungen. Vorstandschef Andreas Streb betonte, dass viele Kunden ihre BTC-Bestände als Sicherheit nutzen möchten, ohne sie verkaufen zu müssen. Damit entsteht ein völlig neuer Anwendungsbereich für BTC – weg vom reinen Spekulationsobjekt, hin zum Finanzinstrument mit praktischem Nutzen. Today, Germany‘s first bank to offer its customers Bitcoin (self custody only) – Volksbank Raiffeisenbank Bayern Mitte – visited Germany‘s first family business to mine Bitcoin and re-use the heat in its production process – Kläger Group. That is awesome. Welcome to the future. pic.twitter.com/ZwLx7OcrqW — Rachel (@geyer_rachel) June 19, 2023 Durch die Zusammenarbeit mit Sopra Financial Technology erhält das Projekt zudem eine solide technische Basis. Sopra verbindet traditionelle Bankprozesse mit Blockchain-Technologie und erleichtert so die Integration in bestehende Systeme. Diese Kombination aus Regulierung, Technik und Marktverständnis könnte zum Modell für ganz Europa werden. BTC etabliert sich als ernstzunehmendes Finanzinstrument Die Entwicklungen um Strategy und 21bitcoin zeigen, wie weit BTC bereits im institutionellen Umfeld angekommen ist. Während Investoren wie Saylor auf langfristige Wertsteigerung setzen, arbeiten Banken und Technologiepartner daran, die Kryptowährung in alltägliche Finanzprodukte einzubinden. Diese Parallelbewegung – einerseits als Investment, andererseits als Kreditsicherheit – verdeutlicht die zunehmende Reife des BTC-Ökosystems. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Ob der nächste große Preisanstieg bevorsteht, bleibt abzuwarten. Doch eines steht fest: BTC wird zunehmend zu einem festen Bestandteil der globalen Finanzarchitektur. Sowohl Mega-Investoren als auch etablierte Banken sind sich einig, dass die digitale Währung gekommen ist, um zu bleiben. Bitcoin Hyper: Die nächste Evolutionsstufe für institutionelles BTC Mit dem wachsenden Interesse von Banken, Fonds und institutionellen Anlegern an Bitcoin rückt eine zentrale Frage in den Fokus: Wie kann BTC über die reine Wertaufbewahrung hinaus auch effizient genutzt werden? Genau hier setzt Bitcoin Hyper an. Als Layer-2-Lösung verbindet es die Sicherheit und Dezentralität von Bitcoin mit der Geschwindigkeit und Programmierbarkeit der Solana-Technologie. So wird Bitcoin nicht nur gehortet, sondern aktiv einsetzbar – für schnelle Transaktionen, Smart Contracts und skalierbare Anwendungen. Bitcoin Hyper schafft damit die technische Grundlage, um institutionelles Kapital produktiv in die Bitcoin-Infrastruktur zu integrieren. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Der Schlüssel zu einem nutzbaren Bitcoin-Ökosystem $HYPER ist der funktionale Motor hinter dieser Entwicklung. Der Token dient als Gas für Transaktionen, ermöglicht Staking und eröffnet Entwicklern und Investoren gleichermaßen neue Nutzungsmöglichkeiten innerhalb des BTC-Ökosystems. Während traditionelle Finanzinstitute beginnen, BTC in ihre Portfolios aufzunehmen, bietet Bitcoin Hyper eine Lösung, um diese Bestände auch operativ zu nutzen – nicht nur passiv zu halten. In einer Zeit, in der institutionelles Vertrauen wächst, zeigt Bitcoin Hyper, wie die Zukunft von BTC aussehen kann: sicher, skalierbar und endlich praktisch anwendbar.

While SHIB’s community remains active, many are now wondering what crypto to invest in that features real utility and growth potential. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a next-generation DeFi project rapidly gaining traction as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, Mutuum Finance has already raised over $17.65 million, with more than 70% of tokens sold out at $0.035 per token, signaling strong investor confidence. Unlike Shiba Inu, Mutuum Finance is built on an innovative dual-lending model that merges Peer-to-Peer agreements with Peer-to-Contract liquidity pools, enabling users to lend, borrow, and maximize capital efficiency within the same ecosystem. With a clear roadmap, robust presale momentum, and growing community support, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a project that could deliver sustainable growth and potentially become the next Shiba Inu of 2025, but with the kind of utility and structure that sets it apart in the DeFi market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis: Bulls Eye Breakout from Falling Wedge Shiba Inu (SHIB) is recovering from the lower line of a breaking falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, and this signifies that the buyers are coming in to support. Sufficient accumulation below this point has built severe pressure, and if bulls maintain control, SHIB can soar to much higher levels, establishing short-term momentum for traders. As the meme coin’s gain potential is brought to the fore, most investors are equally observing new Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next high-potential cryptocurrency investment of 2025. Many traders now see MUTM as the top crypto to buy now, especially as it shows rising interest ahead of the new market cycle. Mutuum Finance Sees Strong Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is very much trending all over the DeFi space and making its mark on being one of the top crypto to buy now for both retail and institutional investors. Its 2025 project presale has been a record-breaking feat so far, already having in excess of 17,300 investors and over $17.65 million raised overall. Having entered Phase 6 and already 70% sold out, this project is making its mark on historic investor appetite and momentum building. The majority of analysts are labelling MUTM the best altcoin for anyone wondering what crypto to invest in this quarter due to its robust fundamentals and beneficial DeFi functionalities. Since investors prefer projects with long-term value, Mutuum Finance is on the rise as the best altcoin to invest in the long term, which also attracts veteran traders as well as individuals looking for an affordable cryptocurrency to invest in prior to the next boom in the market. Those evaluating what crypto to invest in for sustained returns continue to place MUTM high on their lists. Mutuum Finance’s core is its live risk management engine with liquid terms of liquidation and smart Loan-to-Value mechanism. Both are dynamic and automatically adjust to shifting market conditions to minimize volatility and guarantee platform stability even in times of stress. Mutuum Finance’s Breakthrough Lending and Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance will launch its highly anticipated lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Version 1 (V1) of the platform will feature essential DeFi features such as mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot with the long-term goal to provide users scalability, security, and efficiency. With these innovations, analysts consider MUTM a top crypto to buy now, merging strong use cases with impressive presale success. Investors assessing where to invest in 2025 are seeing Mutuum Finance as one of the most exciting new DeFi entrants. Mutuum Finance Leaderboard Mutuum Finance is shaking up investor engagement through its leaderboard interactive functionality. The three biggest buyers in the past 24 hours alone have acquired MUTM tokens worth $1,814, $1,487, $1,205 respectively to reflect interest and competition for presale. No. 1 customer of the day receives a $500 MUTM bonus, which fosters engagement and community. Next Big Crypto After Shiba Inu In the aftermath of SHIB’s wild 2021, investors are seeking the next significant breakout with legitimate real-world applications. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be that coin, with hype-level speed matched by strong DeFi fundamentals. With $17.65M raised, 70% of Phase 6 at $0.035 sold, and its double-lending protocol poised to launch, experts now call MUTM the “Shiba Inu of 2025,” but constructed for long-term triumph. This positioning strengthens its reputation as both the top crypto to buy now and one of the most promising options for those evaluating what crypto to invest in for future market cycles.

In a post on X on October 18, Bollinger wrote: “Potential ‘W’ bottoms in Bollinger Band terms in ETHUSD and SOLUSD, but not in BTCUSD. Gonna be time to pay attention soon I think.” Potential ‘W’ bottoms in Bollinger Band terms in $ETHUSD and $SOLUSD, but not in $BTCUSD. Gonna be time to pay attention soon I think. — John Bollinger (@bbands) October 18, 2025 Ethereum And Solana Price: What To Watch Now The emphasis on “Bollinger Band terms” is doing heavy lifting here. In classic Bollinger taxonomy, a W bottom is a two-trough reversal with the second low holding above the first, often accompanied by a volatility signature that includes a prior band expansion, subsequent contraction, and a failure to register a lower low at the bands on the second leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Kimchi Premium Spikes To New High — Sign Of Impending Sell-Off? The more robust versions see the second low forming inside the bands or with a positive divergence against the lower band, followed by a band “pinch” and a move through the middle band that transitions into an upper-band walk. Bollinger’s phrasing—“potential” and “time to pay attention”—signals that, in his framework, pattern recognition precedes confirmation, and that the validation trigger lies in subsequent price interaction with the middle and upper bands rather than in the raw shape of the price lows alone. The rarity of Bollinger’s crypto commentary layered urgency onto the signal. As crypto trader Satoshi Flipper (@SatoshiFlipper) stressed, “John Bollinger, creator of Bollinger Bands, makes barely 1 crypto call per year and hasn’t made one for ETH in 3 years until yesterday. And each call he makes goes on to mark generational bottoms. He just told us SOL + ETH have bottomed, now imagine fading this legend.” The same account detailed that Bollinger’s last notable Ethereum call dates to September 9, 2022, noting that ETH “went on to pump from $1,290 to $4,000.” That historical reference captures the prevailing market psychology: Bollinger’s infrequent, technically disciplined alerts are perceived by many traders as cycle-defining. Context from earlier this year also helps frame the setup. On April 10, Bollinger publicly flagged a similar structure in Bitcoin, saying: “Classic Bollinger Band W bottom setting up in BTCUSD. Still needs confirmation.” In the exact same week, BTC carved out a bottom at $74,508 and proceeded to log seven straight green weekly candles, advancing roughly 55%. From Bollinger’s call into the first week of October, BTC rallied more than 70%. Related Reading: Ethereum Will Flip Bitcoin, Predicts Tom Lee: Here’s Why And When The market nuance in Bollinger’s latest readout is the explicit exclusion of Bitcoin. If ETHUSD and SOLUSD are printing W-like structures in Bollinger terms while BTCUSD is not, it implies a temporary decoupling in volatility structure and relative strength. In practical terms, a non-confirming Bitcoin can either lag into a later confirmation, remain range-bound in a mid-band churn, or fail its own setup if lower-band interactions persist without recapture of the middle band. For Ethereum and Solana, confirmation would typically look like sustained closes above the 20-period moving average (the Bollinger middle band), followed by a disciplined advance that converts the upper band from resistance into a guide. A healthy W bottom sequence tends not to produce immediate, vertical band overthrows; rather, it builds a stair-step profile with periodic mid-band checks that hold. Failure would involve another lower-band excursion that undercuts the second trough or a volatility bloom that widens the bands without directional follow-through—both signatures of an incomplete base. At press time, ETH traded at $4,037.

Bitcoin stabilized around $106,000 after a liquidation of almost $19 billion in futures markets. The BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) of $90 billion is at the center of this recovery, and it is holding the institutional trust. With ETF inflows coming back, and rate-cut optimism brewing, the market is starting to see a new generation of altcoins in MAGACOIN FINANCE and SUI , which could experience a 25x upside and mark the start of a new cycle. Bitcoin ETF Flows Signal Renewed Market Confidence Institutional sentiment seems to be stabilizing after a strong sell-off last week. Statistics indicate that even with aggregate U.S. Bitcoin ETF outflows of $536 million, BlackRock IBIT experienced little redemptions and even obtained new capital of $134 million in later sessions. The fund currently controls over 1.3 million BTC, which consolidates its leverage with the assets, almost four times as many as those of its nearest competitor, Fidelity FBTC. This rebound in ETF trading comes after a temporary shock from fresh U.S.-China tariff disputes that slung Bitcoin down to $104,000, from $122,000. Analysts now refer to elevated anticipations of a Federal Reserve rate cut later this month as a trigger of liquidity inflows. Traditionally, these macro changes have been consistent with periods of bullishness in Bitcoin, with the reduced rates stimulating risk-on behavior by institutions. In addition to price stability of Bitcoin, on-chain statistics indicate that long-term holders are still increasing. Last week, more than $169 million worth of BTC was transferred out of exchanges to cold storage, which shows that investors believe in the long-term direction of the asset. The new pattern of inflows proves that institutional demand is resilient even in high-volatility times. More importantly, analysts observed that Bitcoin is slow even after recovering last week. They anticipate a potential decline to the $95,000-$98,000 region before any lasting rally. Others estimated a run to $150,000 upon correction termination citing ongoing accumulation by long-term holders. BTCUSD 1-Week Chart | Source: X SUI Gains Momentum as Smart Money Diversifies Although Bitcoin has been making institutional headlines, SUI has become one of the most promising altcoins in the current market recovery. The sharp resurgence of trading activity in Layer 1 network has seen total value locked (TVL) climb more than 30% over the last week. On-chain statistics on DeFiLlama show liquidity suppliers are coming back to the ecosystem of SUI, attracted by its low cost, parallel transaction processing, and increase in developer activity. The recent price recovery of SUI indicates increasing investor confidence. Analysts believe that capital rotation is in full swing with smart money moving out of big assets into scalable Layer 1 protocols. Robust multi-week growth has followed such shifts in the past in new ecosystems. As Bitcoin ETFs stabilize, liquidity is returning to projects that are geared towards long-term utility in the network. Furthermore, the long-term rise of the ecosystem engagement of SUI is not a mere speculative demand. Developers are busy increasing the DeFi infrastructure with the integration of the network with major exchanges, making it more open to international investors. With liquidity flowing back into the wider crypto market, analysts believe SUI will continue to be a primary beneficiary of the imminent Q4 recovery. Notably, with this revival, another potential hidden gem with early-stage potential is MAGACOIN FINANCE , an early-stage company, before its first major listing on an exchange. MAGACOIN FINANCE Targets 25x ROI Ahead of Exchange Listing After its presale achievement of over $16 million, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being recognized as one of the few presales of 2025 that incorporates both transparency and verified audits, among other strategic execution. The Ethereum-based project has been audited independently by Hashex and CertiK, confirming that its smart contract does not have any vulnerabilities and provides on-chain transparency of all transactions. The key aspect of MAGACOIN FINANCE is its systematic pre-sale design and anti-whale mechanism that prevents an unequal distribution of the token. The development team has been delivering as per its roadmap, a move that has increased confidence as the project progresses to an exchange listing in Q4 2025 . Market analysts believe inclusion in the list may lead to a significant market rally, such as early-stage tokens, which have returned exponentially in the past market upsurge. The token utility of the project is not limited to trading speculation. MAGACOIN FINANCE is a decentralized staking ecosystem with embedded liquidity incentives for its holders. Its design focuses on transparency and user rewards through on-chain analytics, and this enables investors to have a real-time view of their token performance. This model makes MAGACOIN FINANCE a viable long-term investment that has a projected 25x ROI potential when the liquidity pours into new blockchain ecosystems. Final Take As Bitcoin ETFs resilience returns and market volatility subsides, institutional capital seems to be prepared to reenter the crypto world. SUI and MAGACOIN FINANCE have become two promising areas of high returns as investors seek the next group of winners. SUI’s ecosystem expansion and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s audit-backed legitimacy create a rare mix of innovation and security.

Investors who entered SOL below $1 or MATIC under $0.02 saw massive gains. Smart traders understand that foresight matters more than chasing FOMO. In the next cycle, early movers will focus on projects that build real infrastructure before the market wakes up. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will emerge as a quiet builder, setting up DeFi foundations that will attract attention once the bull market accelerates. The next crypto to hit $1 will not just rely on hype. Projects with clear utility, strong mechanics, and liquidity systems will dominate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine these elements with structured lending and a decentralized stablecoin. It will position itself as a strategic asset for investors looking to enter before large market rotations occur. Crypto ETF trends will increasingly highlight such well-structured DeFi platforms, signaling institutional interest in projects like MUTM. Presale Momentum and Strong Fundamentals Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will currently be in Phase 6 of its presale while the total supply stands at 4 billion tokens. Approximately $17.62 million have been raised so far from the holder count that exceeds 17,400 accounts. About 72% of the 170 million tokens allocated for this phase will already be sold. The current price will stand at $0.035, but it won’t last longer as the allocated supply is being sold out faster. This presale progress will indicate strong confidence, resembling early adoption patterns seen in ETH or AAVE. Phase 7 will raise the price to $0.040, giving early investors a clear advantage in timing. For community building and growth, the 24-hour leaderboard has been enhanced with a new daily reward system. Each day, the user who reaches the top spot will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction during the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate dual lending markets. Pooled liquidity will provide stable returns for institutional participants, while peer-to-peer lending will let retail users interact directly. This system will maximize engagement and ensure continuous liquidity flow, catering to both large-scale and individual investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has officially confirmed through its X account that the V1 version of its protocol will debut on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This release will introduce fundamental components including the liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure a smooth and secure lending environment. At this stage, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral within the ecosystem. This early version will allow users to explore and test the platform’s features before the full-scale launch. By engaging the community early, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to build confidence, gather feedback, and generate enthusiasm. As participation increases and trust solidifies, the project’s adoption and token demand are likely to grow substantially. Stablecoin Infrastructure and Oracle Precision The platform’s $1-pegged stablecoin will serve as a backbone during the bull run. It will be overcollateralized and governed to adjust rates automatically. Borrowers and lenders will benefit from consistent value and liquidity recycling. During volatile market swings, the stablecoin will provide security, keeping capital accessible and predictable. Investors will appreciate a system that supports both transactional efficiency and strategic positioning. The stablecoin will act as a key component of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending infrastructure (P2C and P2P), sustaining smooth borrowing and lending operations while ensuring liquidity remains active throughout the ecosystem. With stablecoins widely regarded as the backbone of DeFi, Mutuum’s overcollateralized and secure model could serve as a major catalyst for continuous growth and rising demand for MUTM. Accurate price feeds will further enhance confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use Chainlink oracles as the primary source of real-time data. Backup and aggregated oracles will ensure valuations remain precise. This setup will prevent sudden liquidation cascades and flash-crash risks that affected earlier protocols. With reliable price discovery, participants will engage actively, increasing demand for MUTM and reinforcing its market position. Exchange Listing, Potential Growth and Security The way the project is achieving its milestones the experts are projecting sure tier-1 and tier-2 exchange listings. Projected exchange listings will provide a momentum boost. Historical examples show presale tokens often surge after centralized exchange exposure. An analyst who predicted DOT’s 20x post-listing rally, will project that MUTM will reach $0.60 by mid-2026. This represents a potential 17x gain from the current Phase 6 price of $0.035. Such projections will create excitement and strategic urgency for early participants. Potential exchange listing potential will also expose MUTM to broader liquidity pools, further strengthening its market footprint. Security and community-driven safeguards will support investor confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will complete a CertiK audit, scoring 90.00 on TokenScan and 79.00 on Skynet. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program will reward discoveries, with critical vulnerabilities receiving up to $2,000. This proactive approach will ensure that the platform remains secure, transparent, and resilient for all users. Final Words Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine strategic foresight with structural innovation.

October 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC As Elon Musk unveils X’s newest launch -Handles Marketplace , Dogecoin’s price rose 5% to $0.20 today. As Musk-related news developments continue to act as a catalyst for $DOGE rallies, traders are already anticipating a potential XHandle-X $DOGE integration for payments. Dogecoin had dropped 33% since October 6 due to macroeconomic headwinds, including the US Government shutdown and $1.2B in crypto liquidations last Friday . However, thanks to Musk’s XHandle announcement, the OG meme coin had its first meaningful bounce in two weeks, climbing back to $0.20. Elon Musk’s connection with Dogecoin remains strong as ever, as the open interest in $DOGE futures rose 14.10% to $1.9B, and trading volume increased to $ 6.3B shortly after the announcement. With $DOGE leading the pack, investors are now scouting for the next big ‘Dawg’ token to ride the wave. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is a standout presale contender in the meme coin sector, combining meme culture with gym-bro energy and a high-octane trading mindset. Learn more about $MAXI in our full guide. Japan Just Gave Bitcoin its Biggest Boost Yet — Could Bitcoin Hyper Be the Next Crypto to Explode? October 20, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering restructuring its existing rules to allow domestic banks to hold $BTC and other crypto assets for investment. Japan’s newer stance could pave wave for broader institutional adoption across Asia. On other news, Three of Japan’s largest banks – MUFG, SMFG, and Mizuho plan on jointly issuing yen-pegged stablecoins for corporate settlements. While this marks the beginning of traditional finance integration with blockchain, the country’s crypto market too has matured significantly with over 12M crypto accounts as of February 2025 – a 3.5X surge in five years. Banks in Japan will soon be able to include Bitcoin on their balance sheets, positioning the OG crypto as an investment asset within the country’s banking system. As Bitcoin gains broader recognition across Asian markets, an emerging Layer-2 token – Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is drawing attention. It is a Layer 2 scalability solution that aims to turbocharge Bitcoin’s Layer 1 with faster transactions and lower cost. Learn more about Bitcoin Hyper in our detailed guide.

A 10-year seasonality analysis indicates that Bitcoin has recorded gains in up to 90% of instances during this timeframe, according to insights shared by charting platform TrendSpider. Bitcoin seasonality chart. Source: TrendSpider This pattern has often preceded major rallies, including the strong uptrends seen in 2017 and 2020, as investor sentiment and liquidity typically strengthen heading into year-end. Market observers note that Bitcoin’s seasonal trend aligns with the ongoing consolidation phase around the $110,000 spot, suggesting conditions could be favorable for another leg higher. The pattern held true in 2024, when Bitcoin surged past $100,000 for the first time, fueled by spot ETF inflows, renewed institutional demand, and growing regulatory optimism following the re-election of Donald Trump, who has been viewed as friendly to the cryptocurrency sector. The rally extended into 2025, with the cryptocurrency reaching new record highs above $117,000 earlier this year. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $110,000, consolidating after months of volatility. Analysts view this pause as a potential setup for another breakout. Indeed, after hitting a record high above $125,000, Bitcoin retreated amid growing trade tensions between the United States and China. Bitcoin’s key price levels to watch From a technical perspective, analysis by Ted Pillows in an X post on October 20 observed that Bitcoin has regained a critical support zone between $109,000 and $110,000, signaling renewed buyer strength after recent volatility. Pillows noted that the next key resistance lies at $112,000, a level that, if reclaimed, could pave the way for a broader rally toward the mid-$110,000s and potentially higher. $BTC has reclaimed the $109,000-$110,000 support zone. The next crucial level to reclaim is $112,000, which could push Bitcoin higher. With US-China trade tensions easing, I think BTC could rally more from here. pic.twitter.com/D8VNses1ix — Ted (@TedPillows) October 20, 2025 He added that improving global risk sentiment appears to be aiding the move. With US-China trade tensions showing signs of easing, investor confidence in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies , has strengthened, fueling speculation that Bitcoin could extend its recovery in the coming sessions. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,864, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours but still down 3.7% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

What to Expect Next?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/coinbase-releases-latest-report-on-bitcoin-btc-and-cryptocurrencies-what-to-expect-next/,"The cryptocurrency market has witnessed sharp declines over the past two weeks, with Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins experiencing significant declines due to US President Donald Trump's renewed Chinese tariffs. However, despite these declines, the expectation of a rise in the market continues. At this point, Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States, stated in its latest survey that 67% of institutional investors expect an increase in BTC over the next 6 months. The Coinbase report also revealed a divergence of opinion on where we are in the market cycle, with 45% of institutional participants stating they believe the market is in a late-stage bull run, while only 27% of non-institutional investors agreed with this view. David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, said the crypto bull market has plenty of room to rise, but investors are becoming more cautious after the massive crash on October 10. “There is still room for upside in the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. We still see resilient liquidity conditions, strong macroeconomic backdrop, and supportive regulatory dynamics.” The Coinbase survey report also listed the key factors that could drive the crypto market in the fourth quarter of 2025. At this point, Coinbase stated that liquidity, policy progress, stablecoins, and ETF infrastructure expansion will determine whether the market will continue to rise. At this point, Duong emphasized that macro and liquidity supports, such as the Fed's two expected interest rate cuts and the waiting of large money market funds to buy, could also guide the markets in the fourth quarter. “Further rate cuts by the Fed and further fiscal and monetary stimulus in China could discourage more investors from investing.” The report also highlighted excessive leverage and poor liquidity as the main reasons for the recent correction, especially in Bitcoin. Automatic liquidations on some exchanges further tightened liquidity by restricting market makers' short positions, but prices have since stabilized and the market has entered a gradual recovery phase, it said. *This is not investment advice.

Historically, these oversold conditions have preceded strong rebounds — often led by institutional accumulation and altcoin rotations that mark the beginning of a new cycle. According to analysts, Bitcoin’s RSI has dropped below 35 on the daily chart , identical to the levels seen right before a 45% recovery rally last spring . With whale wallets holding over 1,000 BTC starting to accumulate again, experts believe November could trigger the first wave of renewed bullish momentum across the market. Amid this setup, several high-upside altcoins — from Ethereum and Solana to emerging tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE — are being positioned as the best opportunities to buy before the next rebound . Bitcoin RSI and Market Context Bitcoin is trading near $104,000–$106,000 , consolidating around its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) . This level has acted as key support for six months, and while short-term dips toward $100,000 remain possible, the RSI reset implies market exhaustion. Institutional data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant confirms large BTC holders are buying back into weakness , mirroring past accumulation patterns that have historically marked the end of correction cycles. If Bitcoin maintains above $100,000 support , analysts project a potential recovery toward $120,000–$125,000 by late November, creating a favorable setup for altcoins to outperform in the following rotation. 1. Ethereum (ETH) — Institutional Flows Rebuilding Ethereum continues to anchor institutional portfolios. ETH recently dropped from $4,300 due to macro-driven sell pressure and Bitcoin ETF outflows, but fundamentals remain intact. Ongoing inflows into the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) , which recorded $621M in October , double the previous month. Analysts expect a recovery toward $4,300–$4,800 if Bitcoin stabilizes above $107K, with Standard Chartered Bank maintaining a $7,500 price target for 2025. 2. Solana (SOL) — Breakout Above $185 Restores Confidence Solana has rebounded above its $185 resistance , driven by renewed institutional participation and strong on-chain metrics. Catalyst: DeFi adoption, stablecoin inflows, and anticipation of the Alpenglow upgrade , which will enhance transaction speed and scalability. If Bitcoin holds steady, analysts project a 60% upside toward $275–$300 in Q4 2025. 3. XRP — ETF Anticipation and Whale Accumulation XRP is once again attracting attention ahead of several ETF filings awaiting SEC review. Potential approval of multiple XRP spot ETFs in mid-October could unlock $3–$5B in institutional inflows . Ripple’s growing custody integrations across Europe and Asia also reinforce demand. If approved, XRP could target the $4–$5 range , supported by rising whale wallet accumulation. 4. Cardano (ADA) — ETF Speculation and On-Chain Revival Cardano has rallied roughly 10% this week, trading near $0.68 , after renewed institutional optimism over Grayscale’s proposed Cardano ETF , expected for review by October 26 .ADA’s 13% increase in daily active addresses and rising DeFi TVL signal recovery in network activity. Analysts see a potential move to $0.87–$1.00 in the short term, especially if ETF speculation continues to build. 5. TRON (TRX) — Institutional Adoption and Network Utility TRON remains one of the few major networks maintaining steady growth during the downturn. Rising enterprise usage, payroll integrations, and whale accumulation bode well for Tron. The staked supply ratio exceeds 53% , signalling long-term confidence. If Bitcoin holds $107K, TRX could rally toward $0.45–$0.50 in November. 6. Hyperliquid (HYPE) — The DeFi Performer Defying Volatility Hyperliquid’s HYPE token continues to impress even amid volatile markets. On-chain data shows whales steadily accumulating, with forecasts suggesting consolidation between $55–$61 later in October. Analysts consider HYPE one of the strongest DeFi tokens heading into 2025, given its active liquidity pools and trader participation. 7. MAGACOIN FINANCE — The Undervalued Presale Pick for 100x ROI Amid a cooling market, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as an undervalued pick and one of the few hidden gems gaining momentum ahead of the next bull run. The project has already raised millions from verified investors and is fully audited by Hashex , confirming transparency and contract integrity. Built with deflationary tokenomics and a community-first roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a strong balance between speculative upside and verified credibility. Analysts say this presale could replicate early-stage cycles seen with Solana and Avalanche in 2021 , where smart money positioned ahead of mainstream inflows. Its community and investor hype continue to grow, making it one of the best crypto presales for high ROI potential in 2025 . Conclusion Bitcoin’s RSI returning to April lows suggests that the market may be nearing the end of its corrective phase — and that the next rebound could begin in November 2025 . Analysts remain optimistic that institutional accumulation, combined with oversold conditions, will drive a renewed rally across altcoins. Ethereum, Solana, XRP, Cardano, TRON, and HYPE all show strong technical foundations and institutional traction — but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the standout undervalued opportunity . Backed by verified audits and rising community demand, it represents a rare chance to enter early before the next bullish rotation ignites. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been fully audited and verified by Hashex , confirming its smart-contract integrity and investor protection. Analysts note that few presales offer this level of transparent, certified security backed by Certik review.

A new chart shared by Steph Is Crypto (@Steph_iscrypto) compares the asset’s current pattern to the one that formed before its sharp rise in 2017. The chart highlights how XRP’s market structure at present appears similar to the early stages of that rally, when the asset gained more than 13,000% in value. The comparison places two timeframes side by side, showing the historical move that took XRP to its previous all-time highs and the current formation around the $2.5 level. The chart suggests that after several months of consolidation , XRP’s positioning on the weekly timeframe mirrors the pre-breakout conditions from eight years ago. $XRP ’s structure is mirroring the 2017 setup that preceded a 13,000% rally. pic.twitter.com/QwKKx5jBDX — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 18, 2025 Market Context and Current Levels At the time of the post, XRP was trading near $2.5, having recently experienced a significant pullback . This notable decline sent the digital to $1.53, its lowest level in 2025, and mirrored the quick decline that preceded the massive rally in 2017. Steph’s comparison does not make a forecast but instead highlights structural similarity. The visual framing implies that if history were to repeat , the asset could be positioned for another large-scale movement. Technical analysts often monitor repeating formations to assess potential momentum shifts, especially when those structures previously led to significant price rallies. The chart’s focus on price structure has also strengthened its appeal. Rather than incorporating complex indicators or sentiment measures, it isolates the repeating pattern itself. This approach invites interpretation about whether technical history can still play a role in an ecosystem that has matured considerably since XRP’s last major rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Scenarios Ahead For now, XRP remains well below the highs projected in the 2017 reference frame, and has also fallen well below its 2025 peak of $3.65 . The key question for traders and investors is whether the current structure can sustain a similar breakout trajectory. A repeat of the 13,000% rally would send XRP to $327.5, and a continuation of weekly higher closes would reinforce the bullish interpretation. However, any decisive breakdown below the recent base near $2 would challenge it. Market participants who view long-term charts often look for consistency between previous expansion cycles and present formations. While the comparison alone does not guarantee repetition, it captures how XRP’s current setup evokes a defining moment in its trading history.

He commented, “Bitcoin and AI competition for energy is the ultimate equilibrium game theory. Both fundamental. A balance-seeking function that runs for centuries.” Ardoino feels that these two technology systems can continue in tandem without a fight if they’re instead based on the common goal of progress and efficiency. With the world depending more and more on digital innovations, seeking a sustainable equilibrium is essential for long-lasting technological innovation. Ardoino’s view on the interplay between transformative technologies shows a broader narrative seen throughout the cryptocurrency landscape. His earlier focus on Tether’s early growth stage in the crypto market provides insight into the foundational forces shaping digital finance. Support for Ardoino’s comments on the Bitcoin and AI energy race In Ardoino’s post , one user shared that Bitcoin’s waste heat can be repurposed to power AI data centers, and AI technology could help optimize Bitcoin mining operations. Another X user, Santosh Roy, remarked, “That’s such an interesting way to put it-feels like we’re watching two forces shaping the future in real time. The balance between innovation and energy will define the next century for sure.” Some also pointed out that both BTC and AI each represent different ways of turning energy into economic value. One commenter even insisted that Bitcoin balances the trade-offs across finance, computing resources, and energy consumption. Another user added, “Funny how both started as experiments and ended up rewriting the physics of value.” However, one participant noted that both Bitcoin and AI draw from the same energy foundation. Still, their differing incentives dictate how that energy is distributed, prompting debate over which will prioritize innovation or efficiency first. Ardoino projected Tether would lead in Bitcoin mining by the year’s close In June, Ardoino revealed plans for Tether to dominate BTC mining by the end of the year and predicted a future where trillions of AI agents use USDT and Bitcoin for machine-to-machine payments. The executive explained that the company’s initiatives in Bitcoin mining, AI, and self-custody form part of its long-term strategy to play a central role in the blockchain-powered digital landscape. He claimed that the firm’s ambitions stem from strategic intent, not just a focus on profit. At the time, he also explained that, from a purely financial perspective, buying Bitcoin directly is typically more profitable than mining it; however, given the firm’s direct exposure to Bitcoin, it’s only natural for them to help ensure the network’s stability. He stressed that BTC mining isn’t just a business but a means of protecting the network that underpins Tether. He said the company would be the world’s largest Bitcoin miner by year’s end. The company has expanded more broadly into other areas, including artificial intelligence, telecommunications, and energy infrastructure. But its move into Bitcoin mining is its boldest yet — and one the old guards of the industry have long enjoyed. The company has also invested over $2 billion in expanding its energy and mining footprint across 15 sites located in Uruguay, Paraguay, and El Salvador, which include renewable energy projects, new substations, and partial stakes in operating mines.

While most tokens maintain 2–5% gains on their daily price charts, meme token FLOKI stole the show with a nearly 30% surge over the past 24 hours. FLOKI’s bullish outlook follows a sharp rally, fueled by Elon Musk’s latest post on X. The Tesla billionaire shared a lighthearted update, writing: Floki is back on the job as X CEO. Elon Musk @elonmusk · Follow Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO! Watch on Twitter View replies 1:15 PM · Oct 20, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The post referred to Musk’s Shiba Inu dog, Floki, whom he jokingly appointed as X’s chief executive. These conversations have come roughly three months after Linda Yaccarino stepped down as the company’s CEO. Meanwhile, the confirmation stirred the cryptocurrency community as the related meme token FLOKI experienced the “Musk effect.” The altcoin has the same name as Elon’s Shiba Inu pet. FLOKI saw a sharp price rally in the past 24 hours, gaining nearly 30% to $0.00008457 intraday peak. Also, the themed token saw its daily volume soaring over 500%, reflecting robust optimism. The increased trading volume indicates amplified buying activity as market players shifted to the altcoin, which has no official connection with the pet. That reflects Musk’s potential to move cryptocurrency markets. Keep in mind that he fueled Dogecoin’s rally with social media posts in 2021. The new X CEO Musk’s Shiba Inu has been a fan favorite, especially among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Business owner Ken Cornia highlighted the dog’s boundless energy, expressive face, and ability to solve complex problems, mirroring the Tesla CEO’s unpredictable personality. He added : Known for cultivating a company culture of playful energy and occasional ‘zoomies’ through the hallways, this CEO keeps the human staff engaged and ready for anything. Although Floki’s communication consists of happy panting and barking, it has gained traction for fostering playful energy and positivity at X offices. FLOKI price outlook The meme cryptocurrency traded in green today. It is hovering at $0.0008457 after an over 29% uptick from the daily low of $0.00006549. Chart by Coinmarketcap The massive trading volumes support extended gains for FLOKI. Short-term indicators have flipped bullish. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence sways above the signal line with green histograms on the 4-hour timeframe. Also, the Chaikin Money Flow demonstrates accumulation in the past few days. However, the 4H Relative Strength Index at 74 signals overbought conditions, hinting at near-term retracements. Also, FLOKI trades beneath the vital 50- and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. That shows sellers dominate the altcoin’s long-term performance. Furthermore, Floki’s today surge lacks organic catalysts. Thus, it might lose some gains in the coming hours as the hype fades. FLOKI needs massive trading volumes and broader market support for solid recoveries. That can support an approximately 50% surge from the current price to the $0.000125 target . Cryptocurrencies maintained an upward stance today, but analysts predict retests of key price levels before stable rallies.

Its foothold in U.S. TradFi markets only stands to deepen as the ongoing U.S. government shutdown delays other ETF approval, leaving touch points for institutional demand untapped. And with market participants pricing in up to 0.5% in U.S. interest rate cuts before year-end, stimulated risk sentiment could drive even greater demand.

SOL / USD 1-day chart, ascending channel pattern bounce. Source: TradingView. The altcoin has confirmed a strong confluence of support with a double-bottom reversal pattern forming around the $175 demand zone and lower channel support. This lower boundary has been proven as a launchpad, setting sights on a test of upper resistance as momentum indicators turn bullish. The RSI has formed a higher low since its bottom at 30, now near neutral, while the MACD histogram follows suit in approach of the signal line—both hinting at a potential new uptrend. The key breakout threshold remains at $300, Solana’s early-year all-time high. A flip of that level into support could open the path to new price discovery, targeting $500 for a 160% move. However, with deepening TradFi exposure through stablecoins, corporate treasury accumulation, and upcoming spot ETFs, fresh institutional demand could extend the rally by 420%—pushing SOL toward the $1,000 mark. Snorter: The Tool Every Trader Needs for the Solana Bull Run History repeats itself — when the Solana price starts running, meme coins tend to explode right alongside it. Snorter ($SNORT) is quickly becoming the go-to tool for investors who want to make the most of its high-potential plays.

This isn’t your average bot. It’s built for the chaos and opportunity of a bull market. And with the macro narrative driving capital back into meme coins, Snorter’s timing couldn’t be more perfect. And the timing couldn’t be better. The macro narrative is driving capital back into risk assets like meme coins, making Snorter even more valuable as momentum builds across the sector.

Historically, XRP has followed similar breakout patterns, such as the one seen in 2017–2018, which preceded a substantial parabolic surge. “I expect continuation to $5 in the next impulse. Then $8 to $13 and finally the $27 1.618 target for this cycle’s blow-off top. The macro move is not over, it’s just beginning,” the analyst said. If XRP reaches $27, it would imply a market cap of $1.61 trillion, making it the second-ranked cryptocurrency , assuming Ethereum ( ETH ) sees minimal growth and Bitcoin ( BTC ) maintains its current levels. To reach these levels, XRP will likely need support from broader market sentiment and institutional capital inflows, particularly if U.S. regulators approve spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). Whales investors on the edge In the short term, the asset has faced volatility, putting investors on edge. Notably, data shared by Ali Martinez on October 20 indicated that whales have shown little trading activity over the past two weeks. Wallets holding between 100,000 and 10 million XRP have remained largely inactive, signaling uncertainty among major investors. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1980211891726135636 Historically, whale accumulation has preceded price recoveries, while heavy sell-offs indicate corrections. The current pause suggests a wait-and-see approach, likely awaiting clearer market or regulatory signals amid Ripple’s ongoing U.S. legal battle. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.46, up over 3% in the past 24 hours, though it has fallen more than 5% on the weekly timeframe. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At the current valuation, XRP remains below both the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $2.84 and the 200-day SMA at $2.62. This positioning signals a persistent bearish trend, as price action below these key moving averages suggests sustained selling pressure and waning market momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) sits at 36.05, just above the oversold threshold of 30. This indicates that while bearish momentum dominates, selling pressure has not yet reached extreme levels.

With smart contract adoption accelerating and DeFi activity growing, ETH holds steady as one of the top performers. At the same time, the market is buzzing about emerging projects with high growth potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing attention as one of the most promising new tokens. Currently in Phase 6 of its presale, it is over 70% sold out. The project has $17.35 million raised at $0.035 per token which is the lowest price it will ever be. Mutuum Finance combines a dual-lending DeFi model with a robust roadmap, positioning it as a better choice for investors wondering what crypto to buy. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Levels of Support and Resistance to Monitor Ethereum (ETH) has registered significant weakness this week, shedding 9.6% and is currently exchanging hands at approximately $4,000. Critical support is present between $3,955 and $3,920, with resistance at $4,090–$4,265, indicating the market continues to look for direction. Ethereum and Bitcoin can continue to be under pressure until liquidity returns and investor attitude changes, reminding traders that even the most robust markets require pauses before the next leg up. While Ethereum continues to trade at these key levels, a number of investors are also looking into up-and-coming Mutuum Finance (MUTM), hunting for projects that have the potential to augment conventional cryptocurrencies in 2025 and stand out as the top cryptocurrency to buy in the new market cycle. Mutuum Finance Phase 6 Presale Nearly Sold-Out Mutuum Finance is still generating huge interest from DeFi investors in its current presale, representing one of today’s most exciting cryptocurrencies to invest in. To date, the project has garnered more than 17,300 investors and over $17.65 million in funding. The token, which is currently being offered in Phase 6 at a price of $0.035, has already seen its allocated supply in this phase over 70% sold out, demonstrating obvious signs of gaining traction and confidence in the crypto community. This demand spike is why so many are adding Mutuum Finance to their list of the most promising crypto projects to follow. As a multi-asset DeFi protocol, the platform will accept ETH and USDT as collateral for borrowing and lending, providing users with a smooth, secure experience across assets. These building blocks have attracted analysts and investors, and Mutuum Finance is now among the strongest new cryptocurrencies to invest in today for long-term development and dominance in the upcoming bull run. Mutuum Finance to Debut Borrowing and Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance, in their latest announcement, have confirmed that they will be releasing their lending and borrowing protocol and the initial deployment will be on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The initial deployment will feature the minimum feature set for the complete DeFi experience: debt tokens, mtTokens, liquidity pools, and liquidator bot. This release further solidifies Mutuum Finance as a new cryptocurrency to take into consideration for anyone who’s been wondering what crypto to buy today for long-term gains. Mutuum Finance leaderboard is recording the strong investor interest due to community-based reward system. Top buyers in the recent 24 hours alone have bought MUTM tokens worth $1,814, $1,487, $1,205 respectively, a typical sign of heightened enthusiasm and activity among the community. With this activity reaching its peak, the overall consensus considers MUTM as a top cryptocurrency to buy now and one of the safest bets for the next crypto boom. Per 24-hour period, the top-of-the-board buyer will receive a guaranteed $500 MUTM bonus. Simple qualification, clients merely have to perform at least a single transaction within the relative time of the calendar day. This incentive system has made traders consider MUTM as the crypto to buy. Whereas Ethereum (ETH) is now set for a possible push to $6,000, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly setting itself up as one of the greatest new digital currencies to put your money into in 2025. With over $17.65 million raised, 17,300 investors and counting, and over 70% of Phase 6 sold at $0.035, as low as it will ever be, MUTM’s momentum keeps on building. Its innovative DeFi lending model, soon-to-launch protocol, and robust community involvement lay the groundwork for long-term growth, positioning Mutuum Finance as a top cryptocurrency to buy for investors considering what crypto to buy before the next major bull run.

This came as a user pointed out that the crypto firm controlled most Unique Node Lists (UNLs), and users didn’t exactly have the option of changing them. Ripple CTO Clarifies Manipulation Concerns Regarding The XRP Ledger In an X post , the Ripple CTO stated that the UNL affects the way the network makes forward progress and that wallets just observe that. He also indicated that manipulation from Ripple was almost impossible, as the XRP Ledger halts if nodes do not agree with the validators on the Unique Node Lists. Schwartz was responding to a user who asked which public XRP-GUI wallets allow XRP holders to change the validators they can trust outside the UNL provided by Ripple. The user further remarked that none of the GUI wallets he downloaded gave him the option to change trusted validators. He added that the only way he found to invoke the neutrality of the XRP Ledger is to run his own node/validator and modify the configuration file. This also led to questions of how neutrality can be achieved if an average user can’t change the validators they use. The user also noted how nothing was stopping Ripple from manipulating the network if 99% of XRP holders are reliant on the UNL the crypto firm publishes . However, as the CTO pointed out, nodes still have to agree to use these validators before transactions can be processed unless the network halts. Meanwhile, Ripple isn’t the only one that publishes UNLs, as the XRP Ledger Foundation also publishes lists of validators that nodes/servers can choose from. XRPL Validator Shares View In an X post , XRP Ledger validator Vet noted that UNL only makes sense in the context of nodes, servers/computers that make up the network, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum. He further remarked that someone who owns just an account on the XRPL can’t select a UNL, as they will need a node to do that. He added that only node operators can really participate in the governance of any protocol. Vet was alluding to the fact that nodes are just like miners or stakers in proof-of-work or proof-of-stake networks, who are the only ones that influence network decisions and not the holders. However, this development again raises concerns about how the XRP Ledger’s decentralization , seeing as Ripple publishes most of the UNLs. Although nodes can choose their validators, the options are still believed to be limited since they have to choose from validators proposed by Ripple or the XRP Ledger Foundation. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.44, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|bitcoin|Coinmarketcap|David Schwartz|Ethereum|ripple|ripple news|Unique Node Lists|UNL|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP Ledger Foundation|XRP news|XRP price|XRP-GUI|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|WALLET|BTC|ETH,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-20 12:00:37

Ultra V3 delivers unprecedented value across three critical dimensions. Competitive Pricing through meta aggregation with Iris, Jupiter’s new exclusive router that achieves 100x performance improvements using advanced algorithms like Golden-section and Brent’s method. Optimized Trade Execution via ShadowLane, Jupiter’s proprietary transaction landing engine that reduces latency from 1-3 blocks down to 0-1 block, combined with Predictive Execution that intelligently prioritizes routes based on actual on-chain conditions rather than theoretical quotes. Enhanced Protection through industry-leading sandwich defense and the most advanced slippage estimation in DeFi. These architectural improvements translate into measurable results for users: 34-fold increase in sandwich protection compared to other top 5 trading terminals 0.6bps Average Positive Slippage Compared with −1bps to −14bps on Other Platforms Execution Fees 8–10 Times Lower Than Comparable Platforms “Most platforms show you optimistic quotes that don’t reflect on-chain reality,” said Siong, cofounder of Jupiter. “Ultra V3’s Predictive Execution gives you what you actually get at execution, not what looked good at quotation. Every swap lands exactly as promised – executed in the best way possible, at the best price, every time.” Exclusive Technologies Behind Ultra V3 Iris Router – Jupiter’s new routing engine, exclusive to Ultra enables splits as precise as 0.01% and leverages sophisticated optimization algorithms. Combined with JupiterZ, Jupiter’s proprietary RFQ system facilitating ~$100M in daily zero-slippage volume, and meta aggregation across DFlow, Hashflow, and OKX, Ultra ensures users receive the most competitive price. ShadowLane – Jupiter’s entirely new in-house transaction landing engine achieves sub-second precision while maintaining complete privacy. With no external relays or order-flow sales, ShadowLane lands 3x more trades than alternative premium methods. Built by Jupiter’s newly formed RPC team led by Italo Casas with contributors to Yellowstone-gRPC, NFT DAS API, Lite-RPC, and Agave, ShadowLane represents a massive infrastructure advancement for Solana trading. Predictive Execution – Rather than showing theoretical quotes, Predictive Execution performs just-in-time simulations for every route, accurately predicts potential slippage, and intelligently prioritizes routes for optimal outcomes. The system includes Ultra Signaling, which enables Prop AMMs to quote up to 3bps tighter (50% better pricing) for verified non-toxic Jupiter Ultra users versus toxic flow like arbitrage bots. Real-Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE) – Developed over two years, RTSE automatically sets optimal slippage parameters by analyzing volume, historical volatility, and transaction patterns. Version 3 introduces reduced slippage settings while maintaining high success rates, automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes, and increased volatility sensitivity for historically volatile tokens. Enhanced MEV Protection Efficiency While other providers increase sandwich attack risk by selling order flow to third-party MEV searchers, Ultra V3 does the opposite. By ensuring trades are never handed off to external providers for on-chain execution, Ultra minimizes exposure to toxic MEV. Though risk isn’t zero since validators still broadcast to chain leaders, Ultra brings it as close to zero as technically possible. Enhanced Feature Set Ultra V3 includes numerous improvements for edge cases that matter to real traders: Enhanced Gasless Support – Expanded to Token-2022 and memecoin-to-memecoin pairs with minimum trade sizes as low as $10. Anyone with any asset can now trade without holding SOL for gas. Just-In-Time Market Revival – Ultra V3 routes every token on Solana, including dead and forgotten markets, with no minimum liquidity threshold. The system dynamically re-indexes on demand, providing complete ecosystem coverage unavailable on legacy routers. Native Integration – Ultra V3 powers Jupiter’s three world-class interfaces: Web, which holds their full DeFi suite, Mobile, providing an enhanced mobile trading experience with native portfolio and PnL, and Desktop Wallet, Jupiter’s advanced browser extension with gasless trading and 10x lower fees. The same engine delivers consistent, seamless execution across all surfaces. Pro Tools Integration – Ultra V3 is deeply integrated with Jupiter’s professional trading suite including Terminal (token metrics command center), Screener (market discovery), Portfolio + PnL (total visibility), Alphascan (trending tokens and insights), and Analytics (transaction and trader data). Ultra API for Developers Developers can now access the same infrastructure powering Jupiter through Ultra API, with endpoints for balances, token search, and transfers. Jupiter handles all RPC complexity and infrastructure maintenance, allowing developers to focus on building applications while Jupiter manages execution. Transition from Legacy Jupiter Jupiter will focus development efforts on Ultra V3 and the new Iris router going forward. The company is rolling out Ultra API to provide partners with access to optimized routing solutions. and transaction landing infrastructure. Many meta routers currently using the sunsetted Jupiter Legacy API (Metis) will transition to Ultra API. Jupiter requests that platforms using Legacy API correctly label their integration to avoid misleading users about pricing sources. Built for Users “Ultra V3 is built for our community,” said Siong. “Use easily with zero configuration needed. Use without worries with the lowest fees and best protection. Use seamlessly alongside our Pro tools. Use natively on Mobile, Web, API, and Desktop. Everything we build is made with love by a team working to perfect your experience.” Ultra V3 is available now across all Jupiter platforms.

53411996,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87002,1760961921,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP Liquidity Warning: Why You Might Not Be Able To Sell At The Top,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-liquidity-warning-why-you-might-not-be-able-to-sell-at-the-top/,"When markets go vertical, everyone dreams of selling at the perfect top — that golden moment when XRP hits double digits and profits explode. But what happens when everyone tries to exit at once? The harsh truth is, you might not be able to. Beneath the excitement of a parabolic rally lies a critical problem that could catch even seasoned investors off guard: liquidity. This warning, shared by Diana on X and originally raised by Jake Claver, CEO of Digital Ascension Group, is one every XRP holder needs to take seriously. It’s not just about market psychology, it’s about how the structure of the XRP ecosystem is evolving and what that means for your ability to cash out when prices surge. The Hidden Trap of Thin Liquidity Thin liquidity occurs when there aren’t enough active buyers at a certain price to match a flood of sellers. In simple terms, if thousands of XRP holders decide to “sell at $10,” there may not be enough demand at that exact level. As a result, sell orders cascade downward, filling at lower prices — sometimes at $8.50 or even less. This phenomenon, known as slippage, can happen in seconds during high volatility. Imagine a packed concert hall when the fire alarm goes off — everyone rushes for the same small exit at once. That’s how liquidity crunches work in crypto markets. You might see a $10 ticker on your screen, but your sell order may only execute at a much lower price. XRP LIQUIDITY WARNING: Why You Might Not Be Able To Sell At The Top (And What To Do About It) Jake Claver (CEO of Digital Ascension Group) just dropped a bombshell every $XRP holder needs to hear. This could save you from losing thousands when the market goes vertical.… pic.twitter.com/jCzCfhb5vk — Diana (@InvestWithD) October 19, 2025 Why XRP’s Case Is Different For XRP, the issue goes beyond simple market dynamics. Unlike most retail traders who operate on exchanges like Coinbase or Kraken, major institutions — including banks, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries — trade through over-the-counter (OTC) markets. These are private, off-exchange transactions that don’t show up in public order books. Following Ripple’s $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury , a leading corporate payments platform that processes over $12.5 trillion annually, more XRP liquidity is expected to flow into institutional payment systems rather than public exchanges. While that’s excellent for real-world adoption and Ripple’s global payments infrastructure, it also means there will be less XRP available for public trading when retail investors rush to sell. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 In other words, as XRP’s utility grows, its visible exchange liquidity could shrink — leaving retail traders fighting for limited exit opportunities during explosive price movements. How to Prepare Before the Next Bull Run Diana’s post emphasizes one clear message: plan your exit strategy before the chaos begins. Here are key steps to consider: Move your XRP off exchanges. Keeping assets in private wallets gives you control over timing and execution. Use limit orders, not market orders. Limit orders lock in your desired price range and prevent massive slippage. Set sell targets early. Don’t wait until prices spike to make decisions. Have a clear strategy before the volatility hits. The Bottom Line When XRP eventually goes vertical, excitement will flood the market, but liquidity will thin out fast. Many traders will realize too late that selling at the top is not as easy as it looks on a chart. The real winners won’t be those who time the top perfectly but those who planned for it intelligently. As Diana and Jake Claver both warned, XRP’s growing institutional adoption is a double-edged sword — it drives price potential but also limits public liquidity. The key is preparation. Because when XRP takes off, the question won’t be how high it goes, but whether you’ll be able to get out when it does.

Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO! pic.twitter.com/Zu29Dos24r — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 20, 2025 Somewhat expectedly, the meme coin Floki (FLOKI) soared immediately after the tweet. Its price has spiked by 25% on a daily scale, reaching a ten-day high. Despite the surge, the dog-themed meme coin remains outside crypto’s top 100 club, currently positioned as the 130th-biggest digital asset with a market capitalization of around $800 million. FLOKI Price, Source: CoinGecko This isn’t the first time FLOKI has rallied after a Musk Joke. Around Christmas time in 2021, Tesla’s CEO posted a photo on X of his dog wearing a Santa Claus outfit with a message, “Floki Santa.” The interaction caused a mindblowing surge of almost 20,000% for the meme coin’s price in the next 48 hours. In February 2023, Musk was looking for a new CEO to take over X (formerly Twitter). To add a twist of humor to the endeavor, he described his dog Floki as “great with numbers” and placed him on the executive’s chair. Needless to say, the meme coin’s valuation soared by double digits in a matter of minutes after the tweet.

Ultra V3 delivers unprecedented value across three critical dimensions. Competitive Pricing through meta aggregation with Iris, Jupiter’s new exclusive router that achieves 100x performance improvements using advanced algorithms like Golden-section and Brent’s method. Optimized Trade Execution via ShadowLane, Jupiter’s proprietary transaction landing engine that reduces latency from 1-3 blocks down to 0-1 block, combined with Predictive Execution that intelligently prioritizes routes based on actual on-chain conditions rather than theoretical quotes. Enhanced Protection through industry-leading sandwich defense and the most advanced slippage estimation in DeFi. These architectural improvements translate into measurable results for users: 34-fold increase in sandwich protection compared to other top 5 trading terminals 0.6bps Average Positive Slippage Compared with −1bps to −14bps on Other Platforms Execution Fees 8–10 Times Lower Than Comparable Platforms “Most platforms show you optimistic quotes that don’t reflect on-chain reality,” said Siong, cofounder of Jupiter. “Ultra V3’s Predictive Execution gives you what you actually get at execution, not what looked good at quotation. Every swap lands exactly as promised – executed in the best way possible, at the best price, every time.” Exclusive Technologies Behind Ultra V3 Iris Router – Jupiter’s new routing engine, exclusive to Ultra enables splits as precise as 0.01% and leverages sophisticated optimization algorithms. Combined with JupiterZ, Jupiter’s proprietary RFQ system facilitating ~$100M in daily zero-slippage volume, and meta aggregation across DFlow, Hashflow, and OKX, Ultra ensures users receive the most competitive price. ShadowLane – Jupiter’s entirely new in-house transaction landing engine achieves sub-second precision while maintaining complete privacy. With no external relays or order-flow sales, ShadowLane lands 3x more trades than alternative premium methods. Built by Jupiter’s newly formed RPC team led by Italo Casas with contributors to Yellowstone-gRPC, NFT DAS API, Lite-RPC, and Agave, ShadowLane represents a massive infrastructure advancement for Solana trading. Predictive Execution – Rather than showing theoretical quotes, Predictive Execution performs just-in-time simulations for every route, accurately predicts potential slippage, and intelligently prioritizes routes for optimal outcomes. The system includes Ultra Signaling, which enables Prop AMMs to quote up to 3bps tighter (50% better pricing) for verified non-toxic Jupiter Ultra users versus toxic flow like arbitrage bots. Real-Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE) – Developed over two years, RTSE automatically sets optimal slippage parameters by analyzing volume, historical volatility, and transaction patterns. Version 3 introduces reduced slippage settings while maintaining high success rates, automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes, and increased volatility sensitivity for historically volatile tokens. Enhanced MEV Protection Efficiency While other providers increase sandwich attack risk by selling order flow to third-party MEV searchers, Ultra V3 does the opposite. By ensuring trades are never handed off to external providers for on-chain execution, Ultra minimizes exposure to toxic MEV. Though risk isn’t zero since validators still broadcast to chain leaders, Ultra brings it as close to zero as technically possible. Enhanced Feature Set Ultra V3 includes numerous improvements for edge cases that matter to real traders: Enhanced Gasless Support – Expanded to Token-2022 and memecoin-to-memecoin pairs with minimum trade sizes as low as $10. Anyone with any asset can now trade without holding SOL for gas. Just-In-Time Market Revival – Ultra V3 routes every token on Solana, including dead and forgotten markets, with no minimum liquidity threshold. The system dynamically re-indexes on demand, providing complete ecosystem coverage unavailable on legacy routers. Native Integration – Ultra V3 powers Jupiter’s three world-class interfaces: Web, which holds their full DeFi suite, Mobile, providing an enhanced mobile trading experience with native portfolio and PnL, and Desktop Wallet, Jupiter's advanced browser extension with gasless trading and 10x lower fees. The same engine delivers consistent, seamless execution across all surfaces. Pro Tools Integration – Ultra V3 is deeply integrated with Jupiter’s professional trading suite including Terminal (token metrics command center), Screener (market discovery), Portfolio + PnL (total visibility), Alphascan (trending tokens and insights), and Analytics (transaction and trader data). Ultra API for Developers Developers can now access the same infrastructure powering Jupiter through Ultra API, with endpoints for balances, token search, and transfers. Jupiter handles all RPC complexity and infrastructure maintenance, allowing developers to focus on building applications while Jupiter manages execution. Transition from Legacy Jupiter Jupiter will focus development efforts on Ultra V3 and the new Iris router going forward. The company is rolling out Ultra API to provide partners with access to optimized routing solutions. and transaction landing infrastructure. Many meta routers currently using the sunsetted Jupiter Legacy API (Metis) will transition to Ultra API. Jupiter requests that platforms using Legacy API correctly label their integration to avoid misleading users about pricing sources. Built for Users “Ultra V3 is built for our community,” said Siong. “Use easily with zero configuration needed. Use without worries with the lowest fees and best protection. Use seamlessly alongside our Pro tools. Use natively on Mobile, Web, API, and Desktop. Everything we build is made with love by a team working to perfect your experience.” Ultra V3 is available now across all Jupiter platforms.

The token rallied by 27% following a recent market slump. Elon Musk called Floki “The CEO of X”, briefly reviving the FLOKI meme. The asset rallied by over 27%, rising to a one-week high of $0.000082. For FLOKI , those rallies are not unusual for a low-priced meme token. The recent rally also erased last week’s slump. Floki is the CEO — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 20, 2025 Later, Musk added an additional AI-generated video of Floki the dog as CEO of X. Musk referred to his Shiba Inu dog, adopted in 2021, apparently taking the role of CEO of X. The dog’s fame coincides with the launch of the Floki Inu project, which attempted to combine meme fame, DeFi, and on-chain gaming. Floki Inu was launched as an answer to Shiba Inu (SHIB), also attempting to tap into the fame of the original DOGE . After the messages, FLOKI displaced other assets as the top gainer among all coins and tokens. After the recent expansion, FLOKI moved ahead of DogWifHat (WIF) and is just behind SPX6900 (SPX). Meme tokens have recovered up to $64B in total market capitalization, of which DOGE is responsible for close to 50%. Meme tokens remain active, especially when incentivized, but older assets are not as responsive to market hype. Memes slowed down as altcoin season ended, but occasionally, tokens still show an ability to outperform in the short term. Is Elon Musk losing his crypto influence? The FLOKI 30% rally may look impressive after the past week in the red. However, traders have recalled a period when a comment from Musk would have easily caused a 10X growth during previous market cycles. FLOKI rallied by over 27%, a relatively tame expansion compared to previous market cycles. | Source: Coingecko Musk has previously boosted DOGE, in addition to newer assets like GORK. The tokens were mostly forgotten, and they barely budged in relation to Floki. Musk’s mention of memes is now insufficient to cause an overly exuberant rally. In contrast, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao recently displayed a strong influence on memes in the Binance ecosystem. Zhao still warned that hackers could target crypto influencer accounts to shill new tokens. More bullish predictions still see FLOKI as performing a 10X after months of relatively low activity. The coming days will show if FLOKI can also revive dog-themed memes, which in the past have risen together. FLOKI launches wave of copycat tokens The mention of FLOKI and its rally caused a wave of new token creation. Currently, FLOKI still relies mostly on its Binance trading pair. However, a new asset was launched on Solana, though still as an unofficial token. The token only achieved $49K in liquidity, as even top whales only extracted $1,500. The new token lacks the original Floki reward infrastructure and incentives. The Floki Inu project still attempts to boost its Valhalla NFT game, recently completing a small competition and giveaway.

Because of this, the $TAP presale is seeing huge traction, and many see $TAP as the market’s next 100x gem. Digitap ($TAP) - The world’s first-ever omnibank platform that finally makes merging crypto and fiat possible. Dogecoin (DOGE) - Once a memecoin giant, now battling the possibility of prolonged bearish sentiment. Cardano (ADA) - Once a market favorite, now seeing massive sell-offs even from loyal holders. Meet Digitap: The Presale Powerhouse with a Working Product As it stands, even so early in the presale, Digitap already has a live working product. The product in question is its app, one that people can use to hold, store, and spend both crypto and fiat. With this app, Digitap has finally done what many failed to do: it has found a way for people to use both crypto and fiat from the same place. Digitap’s flagship product, a VISA-backed crypto card with no mandatory KYC, provides instant settlements and conversions, allowing people to use both crypto and fiat anywhere VISA is accepted. It’s already available via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, making it incredibly convenient to use not only for crypto users but for non-crypto users, too. With this in mind, many see Digitap as not only the best crypto to buy , but also the best crypto for beginners. They also see this blend of incredible real-world utility and ease-of-use as Digitap’s entrance into three multi-billion-dollar industries, including crypto, traditional finance & banking, and the global payments market. That’s because Digitap also has an AI-powered routing system that slashed cross-border payment fees from the industry average of 6.2% to under 1%. All of these features and services combined give Digitap the potential to see adoption unlike crypto has ever seen before, according to experts. As for the presale itself, it’s running full steam ahead, with $TAP currently selling for $0.194. The next stage price is $0.0268, and the presale has already raised over $800K. And with over 60 million tokens sold, experts say that the $TAP presale might be the most profitable crypto ICO this year. Metric Details Stage Price $0.0194 Next Stage Price $0.0268 Tokens Sold Over 60 million Capital Raised Over $750K Fundraising Goal $10 million Dogecoin: The Ever-Struggling Meme King Once a symbol of crypto optimism, Dogecoin has become one of the biggest casualties of the recent market downturn. During it, the DOGE price dropped to $0.1588, and it’s currently at $0.1846. So, even with the slight recovery, the DOGE price is still down by 21.41% for the week. According to experts , $0.19 was critical for the DOGE price, but it failed to hold it. Now, as it slips below this critical level, many are pointing to ever further decreases in the DOGE price. As such, for now, they don’t see Dogecoin as a good investment. Also, according to Ali Martinez , there’s a huge gap between $0.19 and $0.07 for DOGE. And since the DOGE price didn’t hold $0.19, he’s now hinting at a possible downward streak to $0.07 for DOGE. This would mark a fall of 62% on top of the 21% the DOGE price has already marked from a week ago. Cardano Is Facing Massive Investor Sell-Offs: Are More Decreases in Store? ADA is in a similar position to DOGE in terms of its current price trajectory. During the market crash, the ADA price fell to $0.4462, and it’s currently at $0.6286. This is a 19.46% decrease for the ADA price in one week, and it was enough to prompt investors into taking some drastic measures. Namely, from October 4 to October 11, 2025, Cardano whales sold 40 million ADA tokens. This was even before the crash worsened ADA’s state, indicating that investor confidence had already been declining. However, the sell-offs didn’t end there. In the time between October 8 and October 15, 2025, Cardano whales sold a total of 350 million ADA tokens, which clearly shows that the market crash worsened ADA’s position greatly. So, as investors lose confidence in ADA, ADA has fallen off of many experts’ best cryptos to buy lists. Why Digitap Is Leaving Giants in the Rearview Mirror As the top 10 altcoins and most of the market still suffer, experts are looking more and more into Digitap as the potential best investment one can make in this climate. That’s because of Digitap’s incredible real-world utility, one that goes beyond the crypto market and taps into retail-dominated ones, including traditional finance & banking and global payments. Also, Digitap is still very new and low in market cap, giving people the chance to invest very early and possibly reap life-changing gains. Furthermore, as adoption picks up, experts see $TAP climbing and becoming a top 5 cryptocurrency as early as next year. Utility Beats Hype in 2025 The search for the best crypto to buy right now is seemingly leading to projects with visible use cases and strong narratives. And while Dogecoin and Cardano are facing their own demons, Digitap is quietly positioning itself as a potential leader in the next wave of crypto innovation. Its booming presale, functional omnibank platform, and ability to finally merge crypto and fiat have made it a real winner in experts’ eyes. Thus, early Digitap investors could be at the precipice of being part of the next best thing not only in crypto but in global finance in general.

In the middle of the pandemonium of the Solana meme coin trading world, one project has the potential to give retail traders a critical edge. The Snorter Token ($SNORT) presale ends today, with mere hours left to get in on the ground floor of a next-gen crypto trading bot. What makes Snorter Bot such a potentially explosive project? It all comes down to the current state of meme coin trading – and the edge $SNORT gives traders. Regular Traders Are Losing the Race Meme coins are hyper-volatile assets in an already fast-paced, shaky market. Even by crypto standards, meme coins trade fast and furious, and milliseconds can be the difference between making bank or getting crushed. Retail traders trade constantly behind the curve. Whales and automated trading scripts dominate decentralized exchanges, detecting liquidity before most human traders can even refresh a page. Tens of thousands of meme coins are launched each day; simply finding good opportunities poses a huge challenge. Add in sandwich attacks, honeypot contracts, and high-speed sniping bots, and everyday participants often find themselves fighting a battle they can’t win. Platforms like Raydium, Jupiter, or Pump.Fun provide access, but don’t offer tools to address the underlying issues. That leaves human traders manually scanning Telegram groups, copying token addresses, juggling wallets, and still missing the entry window by seconds. On-chain meme-coin trading has become a high-speed arena in which human participants are routinely out-classed by automated sniping scripts and opaque smart-contract tricks. —Snorter Token, Snorter Project Whitepaper In a market where bots execute trades faster than humans, retail investors are effectively blindfolded – forced to compete in an arena where the rules, speed, and tools favor those with the right setup. Well, if you can’t beat them, join them. That’s Snorter Bot ‘s plan: providing a way to turn the tables with your own cutting-edge meme coin trading tool. Snorter Token ($SNORT) and the Fastest Trading Bot on Solana Enter Snorter Token ($SNORT) — a project with a Telegram-native trading bot built for speed, automation, and protection. At its core, Snorter Bot embeds a full trading stack directly into Telegram, the social hub of the meme-coin community. No external apps. No browser extensions. No slow, manual swapping. Just type, tap, and trade inside the same chat window where crypto communities already live. Snorter’s Solana routing engine executes trades in sub-seconds, backed by its own private RPC infrastructure that offers front-running protection and minimal latency. Its key features set a new benchmark for Solana-based trading bots: Sub-Second Execution: Transactions are routed through a private Solana RPC with priority slots and anti-front-running protection. Automated Sniping: Paste a token address, and the bot monitors liquidity in real time – executing a buy the instant funds appear. Honeypot & Scam Protection: Each token is scanned before trading; suspicious contracts are automatically blocked. Limit Orders & Stop-Losses: Schedule buys, profit targets, and cascading exits without needing to stare at charts. Copy-Trading: Mirror the moves of curated top wallets with real-time execution and adjustable position sizing. Portfolio Dashboard: Track profit and loss and other key metrics instantly inside Telegram. All of this is powered by $SNORT , the utility token that unlocks the bot’s premium features. Holding $SNORT reduces the trading fee to an industry-low 0.85%, removes sniping limits, and grants access to advanced analytics and governance voting. During the presale, staking $SNORT also grants holders access to a 25M token rewards pool with dynamic APY, currently at 104%. Snorter Roadmap Outlines Path to Meme Coin Trading Success Snorter Token has a fixed supply of 500M tokens, permanently capped; no future minting to further dilute the supply. Up to 60% of supply (300M tokens) is offered during the presale, with prices rising through 60 dynamic stages. The project has already raised over $5.2M, with the presale officially ending today. Among that $5.2M have been major whale buys of $107.1K and $91.1K , demonstrating that big players see incredible potential with $SNORT. Currently available on Ethereum, $SNORT will be bridged to Solana through Portal Bridge, ensuring a unified supply across both ecosystems. Contracts have been fully audited by SolidProof and Coinsult . Snorter’s bot isn’t stopping with Solana, either. Its chain-agnostic architecture ensures rapid expansion across major ecosystems, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, and other EVM chains down the roadmap. Speaking of the roadmap, stage one is already through, with more exciting moves coming next: Stage 1 (COMPLETE) – Development: Smart contract auditing, architecture design, and whitepaper release. Stage 2 (ONGOING) – Token Launch: Presale, marketing, and bot launch on Solana. Stage 3 – Multi-Chain Integration: Ethereum and BNB Chain integration, bridge deployment, and expanded Telegram functionality. Stage 4 – Expansion: DeFi partnerships, algorithmic upgrades, and community governance modules. By embedding institutional-grade automation into a Telegram bot, Snorter is positioned to become the de-facto retail trading interface for Solana and beyond, setting up both $SNORT and future tokens to become the next crypto to explode as the ecosystem grows. Find $SNORT on the official website. Why Traders Love $SNORT For retail traders, the Snorter Bot represents a chance to change the game; a way to finally compete with high-frequency whales on equal footing. The combination of Telegram simplicity, institutional-level execution speed, and low fees make $SNORT a potential breakout star, leading 2025’s market narrative. The $SNORT presale closes in less than two hours, marking the final opportunity to join before the token generation event (TGE) and DEX listing. With $5.2M already raised, momentum is accelerating fast as traders rush to secure allocations before trading fees and staking yields go live. Tokens currently cost $0.1081, but our $SNORT price prediction shows that could reach $0.94 in late 2025, powering last-minute investors to potential 769% gains. As with all emerging projects, timing is everything. In this case, it’s literal – the final hours of the presale are here. Check this easy guide on how to buy $SNORT to get yours in just four steps. Join $SNORT before the token listing. This isn’t financial advice. As always, do your own research.

Still, if Bitcoin continues to hold important support at $107,000, then analysts believe a 60% rebound may be on the cards after weeks of volatility. Due to this setup, traders have now turned to MAGACOIN FINANCE, a verified presale with a massive 100x ROI narrative and community-driven. As institutional money returns to large-cap altcoins such as Cardano and MAGACOIN FINANCE, they are perceived as an undervalued entry for those expecting the next rotation in 2025 Q4. Cardano Market Overview Cardano is now priced at $0.57-0.60 after recovering from October lows. Analysts call this relief rally rational and backed by institutional inflows, rising network activity, and optimism over a possible Cardano ETF approval later in the month. Bitcoin remains the key variable in this outlook. If the price of BTC holds between $106K and $107K, the confidence of the market may start to rise in the altcoin sector. This might be enough for ADA to aim for the higher technical targets. Cardano Price Prediction and Technical Outlook According to analysts, ADA could break $0.92 and make its way towards $1.30-$1.80 in early 2026. This is almost a 60% rally from the current price. Key developments reinforce this bullish view. Hydra Scaling Upgrade Plans to increase transaction throughput and lower fees on the Cardano network. Ouroboros Leios Protocol improves finality and security of the Cardano blockchain, which makes it suitable for enterprises. The SEC has said it will offer a decision sometime between October 24 and 26, 2025 on Grayscale’s application for a Cardano ETF. Should it approve the application, it would see ADA open to U.S. institutional investors for the first time. This approval would trigger a rally of sorts, much like Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s. Cardano Price Chart: CoinGecko As long as Bitcoin stays above $107,000, ADA can exceed $0.92 this fourth quarter. Additionally, the inflow of both retail and institutional investors may open up as momentum improves amongst retail. The market will see a change of pace, although analysts are cautious of macro and regulatory headwinds. Undervalued Picks and Hidden Gems: MAGACOIN FINANCE As major altcoins like Cardano and Bitcoin consolidate, early-stage investors are rotating into MAGACOIN FINANCE , a verified presale project earning attention as both an undervalued pick and a hidden gem . MAGACOIN FINANCE’s deflationary tokenomics and staking utility position it as one of the most credible altcoin opportunities for high ROI in 2025. Analysts say the project’s steady adoption curve and growing investor hype mirror early-stage cycles of Solana and Avalanche — suggesting that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver breakout returns once it hits exchanges later this year. Conclusion Cardano could see a 60% rebound if Bitcoin can hold its critical support zone. ADA could see a change in momentum soon, thanks to major upgrades on the cards with Hydra and Ouroboros Leios and ETF speculation. At the same time, many investors believe current MAGACOIN FINANCE is the hidden gem among the presales with the potential for large returns. With verified smart contracts publicly available on Hashex.org , MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to earn a reputation as a safe and legitimate presale trusted by analysts. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands alongside Cardano as one of the strongest crypto plays going into 2026 thanks to its verified audits, powerful community, and investor hype.

53414496,609917,1760967034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53414496.jpeg,Analyst Tells XRP Investors To Pay Attention To This Development That Impacts Them,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-investors-to-pay-attention/,"Crypto analyst Austin Hilton is asking XRP investors to watch a new move from Ripple that he says could change the future of the token. In a new video on X, Hilton said Ripple is taking another big step to grow its business in global finance. Austin Hilton Highlights Ripple’s $1 Billion GTreasury Acquisition In his video on X, Austin Hilton spoke about Ripple’s $1 billion deal to buy GTreasury, a U.S. company that helps large businesses manage their money. Companies that already depend on GTreasury’s tools to manage cash flow and other large-scale financial operations could have access to Ripple through the acquisition. According to the crypto analyst, the GTreasury acquisition would let Ripple bring blockchain technology into industries that still use older financial systems, allowing the company to grow its presence in global finance. Hilton mentioned that the crypto market is still down, with XRP trading at $2.29, falling around 15% in the past week and about 2% in the past day. Even with this dip, he said Ripple’s $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury is not about short-term price changes but about building long-term strength. Hilton noted that the GTreasury acquisition aligns with Ripple’s long-term goal of making blockchain technology practical for everyday finance. He highlighted that the deal could give XRP more real-world use and encouraged investors to stay patient, focusing on the broader strategic benefits of this acquisition rather than short-term XRP price movements. Once regulators approve the acquisition, Hilton says Ripple could gain access to the vast corporate treasury market and clients that manage billions in liquidity and foreign exchange flows with the treasury management company. Ripple’s Expanding Vision And What It Means For XRP Investors Austin Hilton also talked about Ripple’s other recent acquisitions. He reminded XRP investors that Ripple has already bought two more companies this year, Rail, which focuses on stablecoin payments, and Hidden Road, a prime brokerage firm. Hilton said combining these companies with GTreasury is helping Ripple build a network that serves both modern crypto users and established financial institutions. According to Hilton, Ripple can work directly with large treasury departments that still rely on older systems. Companies can adopt Ripple’s blockchain technology without entirely changing how they run their operations. He told XRP investors that these acquisitions show Ripple’s long-term commitment to creating real-world utility for the token. Hilton said XRP holders should focus on how Ripple’s expanding ecosystem will increase demand and build practical use cases over time.

Musk announced several new features for Grok through his social media platform on X Monday, confirming that users can create videos on Grok Imagine by adding prompts to an existing clip created by the LLM. Now you can easily riff on videos posted to 𝕏. Grok Imagine prompt modification: “Add a dog and a robot girlfriend” pic.twitter.com/o6LABvaNLf — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 20, 2025 Each Grok Imagine video now includes a link leading directly to the source video and its accompanying prompt for anyone to replicate or modify the same visual scene. “Any Grok Imagine video now takes you to that video with the prompt used to create it,” Musk wrote. “Easily learn from and riff on the prompts of interesting videos by tapping on the make your own video button.” The xAI CEO has been making several announcements and responding to posts from tech and AI enthusiast amXFreeze, who had initially unveiled Grok Imagine could generate immersive first-person-view (FPV) videos “nearly instantly.” Updates to Grok to include authenticity checks Musk’s team of developers is reportedly seeking to add new forensic capabilities to verify AI-generated media and differentiate it from live recordings. According to xAI, Grok will soon include a detection module that analyzes video bitstreams for signs of AI generation. The LLM could be used to identify compression quirks, metadata inconsistencies, and generative artifacts that the human eye can fail to detect. It will cross-reference provenance trails and online footprints to confirm a video’s source and verify its authenticity. “It’s a critical capability for truth-seeking and bringing back trust in what’s real,” amXFreeze noted in an update that was reposted by Musk himself. X unfazed by Amazon cloud outage, CEO adds chat encryption In a separate post made earlier today, Musk revealed that X’s message service has been encrypted, bashing other apps for going offline after a major Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage disrupted operations for several global platforms. The outage began around 7:30 UTC on Monday, affecting several services, including Snapchat, Fortnite, PlayStation Network, Signal, Robinhood, Coinbase, Perplexity AI, and Duolingo, alongside Amazon’s own e-commerce and entertainment platforms. “Try X Chat, our new, encrypted communication system for texts, file transfers, and audio/video calls. Enable from the left menu,” Musk announced after saying he “doesn’t trust Signal,” the popular encrypted messaging app that was also affected by the AWS disruption. I don’t trust Signal anymore https://t.co/QBbwf8018S — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 20, 2025 AWS gave an incident briefing later on that said there was increased error rates and latency in services hosted in its US-EAST-1 region, its largest data center. Engineers were deployed to resolve DNS resolution failures impacting the DynamoDB API endpoint, a component of Amazon’s infrastructure that powers thousands of dependent applications globally. Elon Musk issues coding challenge to Karpathy Over the weekend, the world’s richest man challenged former OpenAI research lead Andrej Karpathy to a public AI coding contest of Grok 5 against human expertise. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO compared the proposed matchup to the historic 1997 chess duel between Garry Kasparov and IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer. Karpathy recently appeared on the Dwarkesh Podcast, where he said that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could still be a decade away and that Grok 5 is still behind GPT-4 by several months. Musk clapped back at the researcher by suggesting that Grok 5’s performance is advancing and has a “10% and rising” chance of reaching AGI. “You make a lot of great points, especially that children should learn the tools of physics early. Are you down for an AI coding contest or whatever form of competition you’d like for Andrej vs Grok 5, a la Kasparov vs Deep Blue?” the Tesla CEO asked . Karpathy politely declined, saying he would rather collaborate with Grok than compete against it. “Though quite similar to chess, and ‘in the limit’ (speaking of physics!), my value add probably trends to ~zero,” he responded.

Nasdaq-listed company Greenlane Holdings (GNLN) has announced a $110 million private placement to fund its cryptocurrency treasury strategy focused on the Berachain (BERA) token, according to an official statement. The funds raised, led by Polychain Capital and other investors, will be used to purchase BERA for the treasury. Greenlane will use these funds to pursue a BERA-based treasury strategy (DAT) and plans to strategically acquire BERA to include it as a primary reserve asset. This will be the first and only Berachain (BERA) digital asset treasury supported by the Berachain Foundation. BeraStrategy, the company's Berachain Treasury Strategy, will be led by Ben Isenberg, who will be appointed Chief Investment Officer upon completion of the transaction, while Bruce Linton will join as Chairman and Billy Levy as a Director. Ben Isenberg, BeraStrategy's new Chief Investment Officer, said: “I believe BERA's key differentiator is its yield. Unlike historical PoS chains like Ethereum and Solana, BERA's yield is generated by the monetization of block rewards. I believe there is untapped potential for enterprise growth for Berachain as a whole. The team has built one of the most recognizable brands in the cryptocurrency world to date, and we believe it can grow with visibility in traditional capital markets.” Berachain (BERA) price rose following the news. *This is not investment advice.

Buyers’ interest in the token every time it dips below this level favors a bullish Ethereum price prediction that could set the stage for a new all-time high soon. Last week, ETH-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a mild net outflow of $312 million. Compared to the total assets that these funds manage (around $14.6 billion), this is a relatively small figure. Meanwhile, investors have been scooping up ETH frantically in the past 24 hours as trading volumes jumped by 42% to $36 billion, currently accounting for 7% of the token’s circulating market cap. The price of ETH has gone up by 3% as a result, and this could be an early signal that the top altcoin is ready to make a comeback. This will be an important week for the market as U.S. inflation data covering September will be released on Friday. If inflation comes in below analysts’ expectations, it could be interpreted as assurance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next week. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Bounces Off Key Trend Line as Momentum Turns Positive Ethereum has been on an uptrend since April and has already made a new all-time high this year as the Pectra upgrade solved many of the network’s scalability and cost issues. The token recently hit and bounced off a key trend line support that coincided with its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). This favors a bullish outlook that could set things in motion for another push toward $4,900. We could see ETH breaking past the $5,000 barrier this week if inflation data is favorable. As ETH recovers, early crypto presales linked to its ecosystem get a strong boost. Pepenode ($PEPENODE), an Ethereum-based mine-to-earn (M2E) game, could be one of the cycle’s most precious hidden gems. This project raised nearly $2 million in a heartbeat to ‘gamify’ crypto mining. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Makes Mining Simple and Hardware-Free Mining cryptos required thousands of dollars invested in equipment and some technical knowledge. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) has changed this paradigm by pioneering a new trend called mine-to-earn (M2E). The project gamifies crypto mining by letting players launch virtual servers and fire up as many rigs as they want to mine $PEPENODE. As users climb the leaderboard, they will also be eligible to receive surprising airdrops of their favorite meme coins like Pepe ($PEPE) and Bonk ($BONK). The more rigs you launch, the more you earn, and you can even upgrade your current setup by investing $PEPENODE. As the game’s popularity increases, the demand for $PEPENODE should explode. Early buyers who take advantage of the token’s presale price will reap the highest returns. To buy $PEPENODE, simply head to the official Pepenode website and connect an Ethereum-compatible wallet like Best Wallet . You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to invest.

This bullish sentiment comes at a critical moment, when Bitcoin funding rates are flashing negative, and $7 trillion sits idle in money market funds, waiting for the right signal. David Duong, head of research at Coinbase Institutional, noted that among 124 respondents from a joint Coinbase Institutional and Glassnode survey, ” 67% of institutional investors and 62% of non-institutional investors maintain a bullish outlook for BTC over the coming 3-6 months.” Source: Coinbase However, both institutional (38%) and non-institutional (29%) investors identify the macro environment as the primary tail risk for crypto markets in the next 3-6 months. Mega Bitcoin Rally Backed By DATs and Macro Easing While the firm held an optimistic view entering Q4, the leverage flush on October 10 prompted them to recommend caution. Still, Duong stated they expect continued crypto support from strong liquidity, a favorable macroeconomic backdrop, and positive regulatory developments. “Bitcoin, in particular, may outperform market expectations driven by macro tailwinds.” Opinions differ on where Coinbase respondents stand in the market cycle. Nearly half (45%) of institutions believe we’re in a late-stage bull market, compared to just over one-quarter (27%) of non-institutions. Source: Coinbase Coinbase, however, anticipates the Federal Reserve will deliver two more rate cuts this quarter, which could encourage investors to deploy some of the $7 trillion currently sitting in money market funds. The Glassnode Analyst Team highlighted the impact digital asset treasury companies (DATs) are having in supporting a potential crypto rally. Bitcoin DATs now control approximately 3.5% of the token’s circulating supply, while leading ETH-focused DATs own 3.7% of ether’s supply. Although most DAT valuations have dropped recently, “we believe DATs will continue to provide a meaningful source of demand in the quarter ahead,” Duong said. Coinbase’s custom Global M2 Money Supply Index , an optimized blend of money-supply growth that leads Bitcoin by 110 days, now shows roughly 0.9 correlation with BTC’s movements. The research shows that Bitcoin’s correlation with US stocks decreased from 0.55 to 0.40 in Q3, while its correlation with gold flipped from -0.09 to 0.23. Similarly Bitcoin’s MVRV value currently sits at 0.85 , meaning the current price is 15% below the market average cost basis. Bitcoin Could See a $113K Short Squeeze Bitcoin is now attempting to recover this deficit before resuming its rally. When a correction ends, the market often enters a phase of disbelief, when investors struggle to believe the trend could turn bullish again. This behavior is particularly visible in derivatives markets through BTC funding rates. CryptoQuant analysts observed that on Binance, funding rates remain negative, a clear sign that short positions dominate. Over the past week, funding rates stayed negative six out of seven days, hovering around -0.004%. A New Phase of Disbelief on the Horizon “The market might once again be entering a new phase of disbelief, a moment where collective skepticism turns into fuel for recovery.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/0Xv4VGJz87 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 20, 2025 This stems from the October 10 liquidation event that severely shook trader confidence. But paradoxically, the longer this disbelief persists, the stronger the potential for an explosive upward move. If the uptrend continues, the growing accumulation of short positions could fuel the next leg higher. As these shorts get liquidated, prices would surge, triggering a short squeeze. “In such a scenario, the rally could quickly extend toward major liquidity zones around $113,000, and potentially up to the $126,000 region, both levels where substantial short order liquidations are clustered, ” CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost added. This pattern unfolded recently in September 2024, when BTC dropped to $54,000 before rebounding past $100,000 for the first time, and in April 2025, when BTC rallied from $85,000 to $111,000, then to $123,000.

Source: LSE The product allows retail investors to gain regulated exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Notably, this is made possible by the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent decision to lift its multi-year ban on crypto-based exchange-traded products. Within its first hour of trading, the physically backed product custodied by Coinbase saw over 1,000 shares change hands, indicating a cautious but growing interest among UK investors in regulated Bitcoin exposure. The launch comes amid institutional adoption for ETFs surging globally following the success of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have collectively drawn billions in inflows since approval earlier this year. The FCA’s August policy reversal effectively reopened the UK’s retail crypto investment market, which had been closed since 2021. For BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, the move shows confidence that British investors are ready for mainstream digital asset products. BlackRock Surpasses $245M in Annual Fees as it Expands Bitcoin ETP Footprint with UK Launch While early trading volume remains modest compared to U.S. figures, analysts say the launch is symbolically important. It positions London, which was once cautious toward digital assets, as a re-emerging hub for regulated crypto finance. “IB1T’s debut is more than just another Bitcoin product,” said one market strategist. “It’s a signal that the UK is warming up to digital assets again, bridging traditional finance with the next generation of investment demand.” With global spot Bitcoin ETF inflows surging and regulatory clarity improving, BlackRock’s London listing may mark the beginning of a new chapter for crypto participation in the UK, while also extending its footprint globally. Notably, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T), which officially debuted today, was already listed across several European markets , including Germany’s Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam, and Euronext Paris, before making its UK debut. While the IB1T launch is significant for both the UK crypto community and BlackRock itself, the launch comes as part of BlackRock’s broader global strategy to expand its digital asset offerings. The firm, which manages over $13 trillion in assets, has enjoyed strong momentum in crypto markets since the success of its U.S.-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). BlackRock generates $260 million annually from Bitcoin and Ether ETFs as Wall Street institutional adoption reaches new heights. #Bitcoin #Ethereum https://t.co/0dAGyws3jZ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 23, 2025 That fund, launched in early 2024, now holds $85.5 billion in net assets, making it the largest spot bitcoin ETF in the world, and has generated nearly $245 million in annual fees , surpassing long-established funds such as the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF and the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT is on pace to become the fastest ETF in history to reach $100 billion in assets, potentially surpassing Vanguard’s S&P 500 index fund. The momentum around IB1T’s London debut also reflects the growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class. Source: Bitbo According to Bitbo data, Bitcoin ETPs now hold more than 1.35 million BTC , representing 6.47% of the cryptocurrency’s total supply. UK Retail Investors Finally Get a Bitcoin ETP After FCA Lifts 3-Year Ban — More to Launch Soon? The introduction of IB1T in London extends that momentum to Europe’s financial hub, arriving less than two weeks after the FCA formally lifted its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and ETPs for retail investors . The UK FCA will allow retail investors to access crypto ETNs starting Oct 8—reversing a 4+ year ban. #FCA #ETNs https://t.co/aK2NkOS0Md — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 1, 2025 The move ended restrictions imposed in 2021 when the regulator barred such products over concerns about volatility and fraud. The FCA’s reversal, effective October 8, has been widely seen as a turning point for UK crypto policy. After years of caution, the regulator accelerated its review process this year , cutting approval times by nearly two-thirds. The rollout of crypto ETPs on the LSE had faced short delays as the FCA and exchange finalized operational procedures, including discussions over whether to introduce a dedicated segment for retail-eligible crypto products. With those issues now resolved, the arrival of IB1T marks the first time UK retail investors can access a regulated bitcoin ETP through the domestic exchange. So what: The debut of IB1T indicates a shift in UK financial policy that could normalize crypto exposure within traditional portfolios and attract a new wave of institutional and retail interest. Analysts say the move could pave the way for more issuers to enter the market, with London now positioning itself as Europe’s next crypto-financial hub. WisdomTree has received approval from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to offer its UK-listed crypto ETPs to retail investors. #ETPs #FCA https://t.co/VMTeftr4Xt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 16, 2025 Notably, other rivals like 21Shares and WisdomTree also launched similar bitcoin and ether ETPs for British clients, suggesting that competition and liquidity are about to heat up fast.

While momentum remains cautious, reclaiming $114K–$116K remains essential to confirm a bullish continuation toward the previous all-time highs. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin has rebounded strongly from the $102K–$104K institutional demand zone, which aligns with both the 200-day MA and the ascending channel support that has guided the broader uptrend since mid-2024. The recovery candle structure shows early signs of renewed strength, but the 100-day MA, currently positioned around $115K, acts as immediate resistance. This level coincides with the mid-range zone from the recent distribution phase and marks the first critical test for bulls. Source: TradingView If BTC manages to close above $116K, the path opens for a retest of the $120K–$122K supply zone, followed by the prior $125K all-time high. Conversely, rejection from the moving averages may lead to another retest of the $102K–$104K demand area, which remains a high-liquidity accumulation zone. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour structure highlights a textbook retracement rally, with price reclaiming higher lows after a sharp reaction from the $102K–$104K zone. Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating beneath the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement cluster ($114K–$117K), aligning with the former range base and local order block. This region acts as a key decision point (DP) for short-term traders. A confirmed breakout above this area would confirm a structural shift in momentum, targeting the $120K–$122K liquidity pocket. However, if the price fails to reclaim this range and forms another lower high, BTC could revisit the $102K–$104K area to retest demand before establishing a sustainable mid-term base. Momentum remains constructive but fragile, suggesting that volatility compression is setting up for the next directional move. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Bitcoin MVRV Ratio (Market Value to Realized Value) currently stands near 1.9, slightly below its 365-day moving average. Historically, each time the ratio dropped below the 365 SMA, it has marked a buying opportunity and a local bottom signal, as seen during mid-2021, June 2022, and early 2024. This consistent pattern indicates that the market is once again entering an undervaluation phase, where long-term holders historically begin accumulating. The MVRV Ratio’s positioning below its long-term average reflects reduced speculative excess and growing long-term confidence, aligning with the technical reaction from the institutional demand zone. If this metric begins to turn upward from current levels, it could confirm that the recent sell-off was a cyclical bottom formation, supporting a renewed bullish phase into Q4.

While the macro structure still holds some bullish characteristics, the recent breakdowns highlight growing uncertainty, with buyers now needing to reclaim key levels to regain control. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair XRP is on the verge of breaking below the ascending channel it had been respecting for most of the year. The price dipped sharply toward the $2.00 area before showing signs of recovery, now trading around $2.46. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages (blue and orange) have also now turned into resistance elements above the price at around the $2.90 and $2.60 levels, respectively. The altcoin needs to reclaim these moving averages quickly to avoid further bearish continuation. If the current rebound fails and price rolls over again, the $2.00 level may be retested, with a deeper drop into the $1.00 – $1.30 demand zone becoming more likely. Source: TradingView The BTC Pair XRPBTC has also undergone a breakdown below key moving averages and structure. The price fell sharply below the 2,400 SAT and is currently trading around 2,280 SAT, testing the lower support zone around 2,000 SAT. The RSI is also around 40, reflecting bearish momentum. This move marks a significant shift in momentum, as XRP has now lost both 100-day and 200-day moving averages. If the 2,000 SAT area fails to hold, the next support rests near the 1,500 SAT orderblock, followed by the 1,150 demand zone. On the upside, any recovery attempt would first need to reclaim the 2,400 SAT level and close above the moving averages to signal strength. Overall, XRP is at a critical juncture on both charts. The coming days will determine whether this is a short-term shakeout or the beginning of a deeper corrective phase.

Crock Dentist NFTs: Minting, Earning, Trading Whale.io’s Crock Dentist NFTs introduce a novel way for players to engage with the platform’s ecosystem. The NFTs, limited to a supply of 1,000, can be minted directly on Whale.io’s website.

The first weekend was an exclusive mint for Battlepass owners. It has been said that the public mint will open up for the public on Tuesday. Each user can mint up to 5 Crock NFTs and the mint price will increase daily until all 1000 NFTs are sold out. The airdrop pool grows with every spin played in Crock Dentist, creating a direct link between game activity and NFT holder rewards. Based on previous Whale Originals releases, the game performance is expected to grow consistently which translates to bigger airdrops for the NFT holders.

This approach ensures users can verify all activities on the blockchain, fostering trust and accountability. Airdrops are automatically sent to NFT holders’ wallets, requiring no additional actions beyond minting and holding. Integration with $WHALE Token The $WHALE token serves as the native currency within Whale.io’s ecosystem. Currently, users can utilize $WHALE to play games, purchase battle passes, or stake for additional benefits. With the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE), the platform plans to introduce further utilities, enhancing the token’s role across its offerings. The launch of Crock Dentist and its NFT collection arrives as Whale.io prepares for its $WHALE TGE, a milestone that will expand the platform’s ecosystem. By minting Crock Dentist NFTs, users can join the community early and participate in the evolving reward structure. The limited supply of 1,000 NFTs underscores the exclusivity of this opportunity.

This clarification comes amidst common misconceptions which conflate the two, attributing the centralized control of XRP to Ripple due to their substantial holdings of the token. This situation has sparked ongoing debates about the decentralization of XRP. Parallel to Ripple's narrative, the Paydax Protocol (PDP) , a novel DeFi platform, is making waves by offering community-driven financial solutions. The platform's initial stage presale has attracted significant attention with investors purchasing the PDP token at $0.015, leveraging the innovative peer-to-peer lending features of its recently launched Paydax Dapp v1.0. Decentralized Finance Revolutionized by Paydax The Paydax Protocol introduces a comprehensive DeFi ecosystem where both crypto and real-world assets (RWAs) are utilized for lending purposes. This integration allows participants, including XRP holders, to lend their assets and potentially earn an annual yield of up to 15.2%. The protocol ensures security through overcollateralized loans and a robust redemption pool, coupled with Onfido's verification system and immutable smart contracts, thus eliminating intermediaries from the lending process. Features and Benefits of the Paydax Platform Beyond lending, the Paydax Protocol allows users to engage in various yield-generating activities. These include protocol staking, DeFi vault staking, and even leveraged yield farming, which offers returns as high as 41.25% APY. Such diverse opportunities make Paydax a competitive player in the DeFi space. Strategic Financial Solutions with Paydax One of the pivotal features of Paydax is its favorable loan-to-value ratios, which can go as high as 97%. This feature allows XRP holders, for instance, to leverage their holdings for substantial liquidity, as seen in scenarios where up to $970,000 can be unlocked from $1 million worth of XRP. The platform emphasizes transparency in its fee structure and includes automated safeguards to minimize liquidation risks. Furthermore, the PDP token acts as a gateway to the plethora of services offered by Paydax. The benefits of holding the PDP token include access to lower borrowing rates, a share of 40% of generated fees, and direct entry into the platform's P2P lending opportunities. To participate in the potential of Paydax and its DeFi offerings, consider joining their presale today, which offers a 25% bonus on token purchases using the promo code 'PD25BONUS'.

The Ripple CEO noted that Ripple is the company, while XRP is a token, which they happen to hold a lot of. This has usually led to criticisms that XRP is centralized because of the significant amount of XRP Ripple holds. Amid criticism of Ripple’s XRP holdings, Paydax Protocol (PDP) has emerged as a community-powered decentralized finance (DeFi) platform revolutionizing the finance space with its peer-to-peer (P2P) lending feature. Investors are already buying the platform’s PDP token at $0.015 in stage one of its ongoing presale to gain access to the platform's novel offerings, with the Paydax Dapp v1.0 already live. Paydax Is Uniting RWAs And Crypto Over Ripple’s XRP Paydax Protocol (PDP) enables users to lend, borrow, and earn with both real-world assets (RWAs) and crypto assets. On the P2P lending platform, market participants, including XRP holders, can lend their assets and earn up to 15.2% annual percentage yield (APY). Paydax has also taken necessary steps to provide adequate protection for lenders. Overcollateralized loans Redemption Pool that repays lenders in the event of a default Onfido’s verification system ensures that all borrowers are legitimate Immutable smart contracts that eliminate the need for middlemen A Loan-To-Value (LTV) Ratio Of Up To 97% Paydax Protocol’s (PDP) P2P lending offers borrowers loan-to-value ratios of up to 97% for both RWA and crypto loans. This means that, for example, an XRP holder with up $1 million worth of XRP can unlock $970,000 in fresh liquidity, which they can use for other opportunities in the crypto space. Paydax boasts several notable features that make it more appealing to users than other DeFi platforms. Transparent fee structures Automated safeguards to reduce liquidation risks Broad collateral support, including blue-chip cryptos such as Bitcoin and XRP, and RWAs such as gold. Fixed interest rates of between 5% and 7% Simple vault system for borrowers to access instant liquidity Borrowing on Paydax is very straightforward. Borrowers simply deposit their collateral into the LendingPool and then borrow against it. For RWAs, Paydax collaborates with Sotheby’s and Brinks to bring these assets on-chain and use them as collateral. An Opportunity To Earn Yields In addition to borrowing and lending, Paydax Protocol (PDP) enables users to earn competitive yields. Protocol staking (up to 6% APY) DeFi vault staking (up to 6% APY) Redemption pool staking (up to 15.2% APY) Leveraged yield farming (up to 41.25% APY) The PDP Token Provides Access Paydax’s native token is the key to unlocking all these opportunities on the platform, which is why investors are buying the token at its low entry price of $0.015. Those who purchase the token can start lending, borrowing, and earning on the Paydax Dapp v1.0. There are also other benefits of holding the PDP token, including: Access to lower borrowing rates Fee sharing, with 40% of fees distributed to PDP stakers Stability Pool rewards for those who stake in the Pool Direct access to P2P lending opportunities 👉 Join the Paydax presale today and get 25% bonus tokens using the promo code ‘ PD25BONUS .’ Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the PDP token is well decentralized and unlike XRP, which Ripple has majority control over. Most of the tokens will be community-owned, as 40% of the token’s 10 billion supply is allocated to the presale. Only 8% of the token’s supply is allocated to the team. The Paydax Protocol (PDP) token also has a more limited supply than the likes of XRP, which could easily create a supply shock as PDP’s demand skyrockets.

When an X user known as Time Traveler posted, “When XRP hits $1000 per token, a lot of you will be gone, we did not get rich to be selfish,” the statement struck a chord across the XRP community. It wasn’t a typical “price call.” It was a reflection on purpose, wealth, and what happens when financial dreams finally materialize. The Psychology Behind the $1000 Vision Every bull market needs its myth, and for XRP, that myth has long been tied to life-changing valuations. But Time Traveler’s message wasn’t about hype or blind faith. It was about introspection. When XRP hits $1000 per token, a lot of you will be gone. And I respect the shadow you left behind. Do well, be healthy, and bless people in need. Never forget the mission… We did not get rich to be selfish. — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) October 19, 2025 The post suggested that many who spend years obsessing over price charts may not live to see the day they’ve been waiting for , a sobering reminder that time and health are just as valuable as financial gain. At its core, the statement called for gratitude and purpose: when abundance comes, it should be used to uplift others, not isolate oneself. In a space often driven by greed, that message hit differently. Breaking Down the Market Math Still, the big question remains: is it realistic to expect XRP to hit $1000? XRP currently has a circulating supply of around 59 billion tokens. A $1000 valuation per token would place its market capitalization above $59 trillion — more than the combined value of Apple, Microsoft, and the entire U.S. stock market. For perspective, the entire global money supply (M2) is currently nearly $120 trillion. This means XRP would need to capture almost half of the world’s liquid financial value — a scenario that’s mathematically improbable under the current economic structure. Even if XRP were to become the primary bridge asset for central banks, remittances, and on-demand liquidity worldwide, analysts agree that such a valuation would demand unprecedented global adoption and a near-total transformation of the financial system. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Ripple Factor: Global Utility vs. Hype While $1000 may be unrealistic in today’s context, Ripple’s ecosystem is undeniably evolving. Its partnerships with major financial institutions, integration of RLUSD, and the continued expansion of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors are positioning XRP as a legitimate global settlement asset. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) continues to process payments efficiently, offering near-instant, low-cost transfers that rival legacy systems like SWIFT. These developments have strengthened XRP’s long-term utility narrative, though not necessarily enough to justify a four-digit price anytime soon. When Wealth Becomes a Test of Character Time Traveler’s message also underscored a timeless truth: wealth magnifies who we already are. If XRP ever reached astronomical heights, many early holders would become multimillionaires overnight. Yet, as Time Traveler warned, wealth without purpose can be hollow, or worse, self-destructive. The post’s final words — “Never forget the mission, we did not get rich to be selfish” resonated deeply within the XRP community, known for its faith-driven optimism and belief in a global financial reset. For many, it served as a spiritual checkpoint — a reminder that true abundance extends beyond charts and exchanges. The Real Lesson Behind the Prophecy Time Traveler’s words were less about predicting the future and more about preparing for it. The dream of a $1000 XRP may never materialize — but the discipline, vision, and unity built along the way might be the real wealth. If XRP eventually reaches four digits, the impact would be massive and immediate, shaking up the entire crypto landscape. But as Time Traveler implied, what truly matters is who we become on that journey — and how we use our blessings when we finally arrive. Because the mission was never just about money, it was about meaning. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
