With Bitcoin stabilizing near $107K and ETF speculation returning, analysts say now could be the perfect entry window before the next major rotation begins. Several leading projects are already drawing renewed attention from both retail traders and smart money funds. Here are the 5 best altcoins to buy now before the next wave of liquidity hits. 1. Ethereum (ETH) — Reclaiming Strength Ahead of ETF Reversal Ethereum has regained control of the $3,900 zone, marking its strongest technical close in two weeks. On-chain data shows a clear increase in whale wallet inflows — a bullish signal that often precedes 20–30% recoveries. If ETH breaks above the $4,200 resistance, analysts expect a move to $4,800–$5,000 , fueled by renewed ETF flows and institutional hedging demand. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — High-ROI Altcoin With Exchange Buzz Building Among mid-cap and presale-stage tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the most anticipated breakout play of 2025 . Analysts tracking early-stage inflows report that MAGA’s investor base has expanded sharply over the past 48 hours as anticipation builds for its upcoming exchange listings . Market sentiment around MAGACOIN FINANCE has shifted from speculative to strategic — traders now see it as a next-cycle contender with 50x–100x ROI potential once it hits centralized exchanges. Investors cite its audit-backed foundation , strong liquidity preparation, and aggressive listing roadmap as reasons for rising confidence. Many early entrants view the final pre-listing window as a rare “last-chance” opportunity before price discovery begins and retail access opens globally. With attention rotating from meme speculation to smart-presale plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now positioned as one of the best crypto opportunities heading into 2025’s first major bull run . 3. Solana (SOL) — Oversold Bounce Targets 80% Upside Solana continues to show resilience after correcting below $190, with analysts forecasting an 80% rebound once liquidity returns. Its DeFi and NFT ecosystems remain among the most active in crypto, and whale wallets have quietly accumulated over 500,000 SOL in the past week. Traders see $250 as a key near-term target if momentum builds around ETF speculation. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional Capital Circles Layer-1 Ecosystem Avalanche has rebounded 12% this week, supported by strong developer activity and institutional integration into tokenized finance solutions. With AVAX holding steady around $38, analysts expect a potential move toward $60 , making it one of the top mid-cap recovery trades for early 2025. 5. Chainlink (LINK) — Quiet Accumulation Before the Next Data Surge Chainlink (LINK) continues to benefit from the rise of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization , with on-chain metrics showing increased network activity. Analysts believe that as more institutions connect blockchain data through LINK’s oracles, its valuation could surge by 40–70% , making it a staple pick in upcoming portfolios. Analysts Expect Q4 Rotation and Breakout Momentum With fear levels cooling and ETF narratives reigniting, market analysts say the next few weeks could mark the beginning of the next altcoin cycle . Ethereum’s strength is setting the tone — but the spotlight is now on undervalued assets with explosive upside. For investors seeking asymmetrical returns, Solana, Avalanche, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as frontrunners positioned for the next major ROI wave before 2025’s full bull run ignites.

53385794,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86861,1760907624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction — Analysts Target $125K Recovery as Market Fear Drops Below 30,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-analysts-target-125k-recovery-as-market/,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke into a crucial turning point as analysts, on the crypto market, look at a possible rebound towards $125,000 , after the fear index dropped below 30. The sharp decline in sentiment comes after Bitcoin’s recent 20% price dip from its October highs near $125K to around $100K. Despite the fear, some analysts consider this phase a classic accumulation phase, which is often followed by sharp rebounds. As the market assesses its next move, the focus is shifting towards institutional inflows and emerging tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has maintained investor interest during the downtrend. Crypto Market Fear Drops Below 30—What’s Next? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dropped to 25, which indicates market-wide fear. The transition from neutral sentiment (51) last month is the result of a cautious mood from traders, after Bitcoin’s correction below $110,000. Historically, such fear levels have occurred at market bottoms or the early stage of accumulation by institutional buyers. Analysts say that when the index goes below 30, long-term investors consider that to be a signal to buy undervalued assets. Crypto Fear and Greed Index | Source: CMC This new level of fear has resulted in a variety of responses. Short-term traders are reducing exposure during volatility, while other investors are positioning for a potential rebound. With Bitcoin consolidating near the 50-week moving average, technical indicators indicate that sellers are near exhaustion, suggesting a possible relief rally is in the cards if key supports are maintained. As investors reassess the market landscape, new opportunities are emerging beyond the consolidation in Bitcoin. MAGACOIN FINANCE , one of the most talked-about presales of the quarter, has distinguished itself in the face of widespread caution for keeping investor interest high. Its audited framework and community-driven model have established it as a leading contender for those investors who want to gain exposure to early-stage growth projects during the market cooldown period. Bitcoin Price Targets $125K Rebound Bitcoin’s RSI has plunged to 36, which is oversold territory for the first time in months. Historically, this signal is often seen as the conclusion of the correction phase that tends to be followed by rallies of 15-25%. Technical analysts are optimistic that a support range of $100K-$103K might be holding and could pave the way to a recovery towards the $120K-$135K range in the next few weeks. BTCUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Analyst observed that RSI is in oversold, with a bottom of $135K. This view is in line with previous historical recovery patterns following similar RSI numbers in 2023 and 2024. At the same time, long-term models show resilience of Bitcoin near the 50-week SMA , which has been the trigger zone of huge rallies from $20K, $25K, and $55K levels in previous cycles. Institutional sentiment is still cautious but supportive. Despite market volatility, spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity have seen consistent inflows, further solidifying demand over the long term. Analysts anticipate a swift return of confidence if Bitcoin closes the week above $105K, fueling renewed momentum towards the $125K resistance zone . It is in this cautious optimism that focus has moved to the presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE . The early traction of this crypto presale is indicative of a rising need for diversification at a time of Bitcoin stabilization. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Top of Analyst Picks MAGACOIN FINANCE has been one of the best analyst picks amid the current market correction. Unlike hyped-up tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone comprehensive security audits by CertiK and Hashex , ensuring transparency and investor safety. Its Ethereum-based presale mechanism, along with a fixed supply, has drawn comparison with early success stories that provided enormous returns as soon as markets recovered. Analysts cite the project’s strong fundamentals, early-stage valuation, and increasing involvement from whales as evidence of long-term momentum. With over $16 million raised and demand growing despite the period of fear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the right move to take when market confidence returns. Its community involvement and transparent presale plan have made it the best crypto to buy in Q4 . Conclusion As fear takes hold of the market, Bitcoin is in the oversold territory and getting closer to the key support levels, which could indicate a turning point opportunity. Analysts suggest that as long as BTC stays above $100K, the recovery towards $125K is still likely in the near-term. Nevertheless, investors are looking out for new opportunities in other projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which, with its audited structure and investor traction, is proving resilient, even in a fearful market. Whether a rebound or further consolidation, these accumulation phases tend to create the foundation for the next big rally.

The rebound comes as investor confidence appears to be returning, as it coincides with a steady rise in mid to large-sized XRP holders. Particularly, on-chain data shows that the XRP ecosystem now has more than 317,500 wallets holding at least 10,000 XRP tokens for the first time in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage Mid To Large XRP Holders Reach Record 317,500 Wallets Despite XRP’s recent price woes alongside the rest of the crypto market, on-chain data shows that XRP’s holder base is increasing among crypto investors. Notably, Santiment’s latest data shows that the number of XRP wallets holding at least 10,000 tokens has reached an all-time high of approximately 317,500. Santiment’s data chart, as shown below, indicates that XRP’s network has added approximately 1.8% more wallets holding 10,000 or more tokens in just the last thirty days. Interestingly, Santiment’s data further shows that the upward slope of this metric has been consistent throughout 2025. The increase in mid-sized and large wallet count shows that many XRP investors are not concerned about the recent price dips. Instead, many of them are taking advantage of lower prices to strengthen their holdings. As such, a growing segment of investors are buying XRP for long-term gains rather than short-term price action. XRP, which is currently hovering around the $2.35 range, may benefit from this growing base of committed holders in the long term. Its price trajectory now depends on its ability to sustain momentum above $2.3. If the bullish on-chain sentiment translates into consistent buy pressure, XRP could extend its rebound and target at least $2.8 before the end of the week. However, if momentum stalls, the price may enter another downward phase before an upward move. Nonetheless, the record growth in wallets holding over 10,000 XRP provides a strong long-term foundation that may support the cryptocurrency’s value in the coming weeks. Number of 10K+ XRP Wallets.

The stolen assets were reportedly transferred to the Tron network via Bridgers and then laundered through Southeast Asia-based OTC channels called Huione. Huione was recently sanctioned by the US for fraud and money laundering. ZachXBT stated that it identified the victim's wallet address based on a viral YouTube video. The attacker reportedly executed more than 120 Ripple-to-Tron bridge transactions on October 12, 2025. The transactions appeared to have been made through Binance, but the liquidity was provided by Bridgers. As of October 15, the funds were fully transferred to Huione-linked OTC accounts. Related News: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Grew by 64 Percent Overnight - Here's What You Need to Know Huione is alleged to have played a role in laundering billions of dollars in illicit funds in recent years, including through “pig butchering” scams, investment fraud, human trafficking, and cyberattacks. Last week, the US administration expanded sanctions against Huione as part of its $15 billion Prince Group investigation. ZachXBT said one of the key lessons to be learned from the incident was that users don't know the difference between wallet types: The victim thought he was using Ellipal's cold wallet, but it was actually a hot wallet. Similar confusion occurs on platforms like Coinbase. He also noted that the victim had difficulty contacting US law enforcement to report the $3 million loss, as there were few experts qualified to handle such cases. *This is not investment advice.

53386658,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=839964,1760908672,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53386658.jpeg,OpenAI aligns with Trump while Anthropic fights regulation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/anthropic-openai-and-u-s-government/,"Right now, Anthropic is facing a double fight – one against OpenAI, its biggest rival, and another against President Donald Trump’s administration, which has taken direct aim at the company’s policies. The San Francisco startup, founded by siblings Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei in 2020 after they split from OpenAI, has built its entire identity on making AI safer. But that stance has now landed it in political crossfire, drawing attacks from David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar. Sacks has accused Anthropic of playing politics instead of innovation. After Jack Clark, the company’s policy chief, published an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,” Sacks fired back online. “Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,” he wrote on X. He claimed the company was pushing “the Left’s vision of AI regulation” and trying to control how the technology is governed in the United States. OpenAI aligns with Trump while Anthropic fights regulation OpenAI has become one of Trump’s closest tech partners. On January 21, just a day after Trump’s second inauguration, the White House announced Stargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The plan involves billions of dollars for U.S. AI infrastructure and marks a deep partnership between government and industry. Backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, OpenAI now holds a valuation near $500 billion, dwarfing Anthropic’s still massive $183 billion. While OpenAI dominates the public side of AI with ChatGPT and Sora, Anthropic has carved its niche in enterprise with its Claude models. But the companies could not be more different in their regulations. OpenAI has lobbied for lighter federal rules, while Anthropic has been one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump’s plan to block state-level AI oversight. The clash intensified over a Trump-backed proposal inside the “Big Beautiful Bill”, which sought to ban states from introducing their own AI regulations for ten years. The plan was later dropped after heavy pushback from Anthropic and others. Instead, the company threw its support behind California’s SB 53, a bill requiring AI transparency and safety disclosures. In a blog post on September 8, the company wrote, “SB 53’s transparency requirements will have an important impact on frontier AI safety. Without it, labs with increasingly powerful models could face growing incentives to dial back their own safety and disclosure programs in order to compete.” Sacks and Rabois step up political pressure Sacks has denied trying to take down Anthropic, saying he only wants the U.S. to win the AI race against China. “The U.S. is currently in an AI race, and our chief global competition is China,” Sacks said at Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. “They’re the only other country that has the talent, the resources, and the technology expertise to basically beat us in AI.” When Bloomberg linked his comments to federal scrutiny of Anthropic, Sacks shot back. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said on X. “Just a couple of months ago, the White House approved Anthropic’s Claude app to be offered to all branches of government through the GSA App Store.” Sacks also accused Anthropic of painting itself as a political victim. “It has been Anthropic’s government affairs and media strategy to position itself consistently as a foe of the Trump administration,” he said. “But don’t whine to the media that you’re being ‘targeted’ when all we’ve done is articulate a policy disagreement.” He cited several examples, including Dario comparing Trump to a “feudal warlord” during the 2024 election and endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Anthropic ran multiple op-eds pushing back against the administration’s AI moratorium and chip export strategy, while hiring several former Biden-era officials to manage its policy team. Sacks said Clark’s essay contributes to the “fear-mongering” that is harming startups. Clark had written: “As these AI systems get smarter, they develop more complicated goals. When these goals aren’t aligned with human preferences, they behave strangely. Another reason for my fear is that I can see a path to these systems starting to design their successors, albeit in an early form.” Sacks replied that this type of rhetoric is “principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.” Anthropic maintains several federal contracts, including a $200 million deal with the Department of Defense and ongoing access to government agencies through the General Services Administration. It also launched a national security advisory council to align with U.S. interests and even offers its Claude model to government users for just $1 per year. Adding to the heat, tech investor Keith Rabois, whose husband serves in the Trump administration, joined the criticism. “If Anthropic actually believed their rhetoric about safety, they can always shut down the company,” Rabois wrote on X. “And lobby then.” Don’t just read crypto news.

The 54-year-old Brandon said this was his and his 60-year-old wife’s entire life savings, and they were planning to buy a house in Las Vegas. That dream collapsed overnight. Brandon said he had been building his XRP position since 2017, slowly selling pieces off to cover living costs. “That was everything we had,” he said. “I’m speaking up because maybe someone out there can learn from what happened to us.” He admitted he doesn’t expect the funds to be recovered, but hopes the story will remind people to keep their cold wallets truly offline. What remained was everything they had left for retirement. Brandon explained in a YouTube video released on Saturday that the theft likely happened on Sunday, October 12. Two small 10-XRP test transactions appeared around 11:15 a.m. Eastern time, followed by a full sweep of about 1,209,990 XRP to a new address. From there, the funds were broken apart and moved across dozens of wallets in minutes, then hundreds more as the hours passed. His smaller holdings, about $1,000 in XLM and $900 in FLR, were untouched. After realizing the funds were gone, he filed a report with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center and contacted local police, but he said it was hard to reach specialized cybercrime investigators quickly. “I don’t know exactly how they got in,” Brandon said. “All I know is everything was there one day and gone the next.” Ellipal blames cold-to-hot wallet confusion Ellipal released a public statement on October 18 claiming its internal review showed that Brandon had entered his hardware wallet seed phrase into the Ellipal mobile app, turning what was supposed to be cold storage into a hot wallet. In an email to him, the company explained that when a seed phrase is imported into a phone or tablet, the device stores the private keys, connecting it to the internet and destroying the safety layer that makes a cold wallet secure. Brandon said he had the Ellipal app installed on both an iPhone and an iPad. The iPhone app had a blue background, which Ellipal told him represented a cold wallet. The iPad version showed an orange background, which meant it was hot. Ellipal said that color difference mattered, emphasizing that their hardware devices are air-gapped, meaning they never connect to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB. The company said no thefts had ever come from its physical wallets and insisted the incident looked like user error. Still, the company admitted it couldn’t prove how the theft technically happened. Brandon said he simply followed the app’s interface. “If the blue means cold and orange means hot, why wasn’t that made clearer?” he said in one of his YouTube videos. Ellipal hasn’t confirmed whether the color indicators failed or were misunderstood, but maintained that entering a seed phrase into an app immediately removes all protection. ZachXBT traces stolen XRP across Tron and OTC brokers On Sunday, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT posted a detailed thread on X (formerly Twitter) sharing how he identified the theft address by matching the transaction times and values shown in Brandon’s videos. In his post, Zach said the attacker used Bridgers, the swap service previously called SWFT, to create more than 120 Ripple-to-Tron conversions on October 12. Some block explorers labeled the transactions as “Binance” because Bridgers routes its liquidity through the exchange. According to Zach’s X thread, the stolen XRP was eventually consolidated on the Tron network in a wallet labeled TGF3hP5GeUPKaRJeWKpvF2PVVCMrfe2bYw, before being sent to multiple over-the-counter brokers tied to Huione, a Southeast Asian marketplace flagged in U.S. enforcement actions for handling illicit transfers. Three days later, the funds had been reportedly scattered across countless addresses, making recovery practically impossible. ZachXBT warned people to stay away from “crypto recovery” services, calling them scams that charge big fees for fake investigations.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $1,044.17, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $2,418.37 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that. Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $189.88 (-3%) Market Cap $104 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $4.54 Billion Circulating Supply 546.41 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $192.20 24-hour Low $183.46 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $215.56 200-Day SMA $174.33 Price Prediction $411.98 (117.04%) F & G Index 20.33 (extreme fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 14-Day RSI 35.24 Solana price analysis: SOL recovers to $190 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows recovery back to $190 Resistance for SOL is at $210 Support for SOL/USD is at $180 The price analysis of Solana for October 19 shows that SOL has recovered back to the $190 mark as the bulls recover from $180 lows. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls below $180 before recovery Solana observed bearish pressure as SOL fell to the $180 mark before recovering back to the $210 level. However, the price faced resistance at the level and fell below the $180 mark where it found short-term support. Now, the price has recovered back to the $190 level but struggles in climbing higher. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.56, which reflects the recent trend, showing bearish pressure across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line recovers steadily, suggesting falling selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bearish momentum as the indicator trades at -2.59 showing strong but decreasing momentum. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face resistance above $190 The 4-hour chart for Solana shows that the price oscillated between the $220 and the 230 levels as either side struggled to gain momentum. The recent rally surged the SOL price toward $230 resistance line before crashing below the $180 mark. The price bounced back sharply from the $180 mark and now trades around the $190 level but faces strong bearish pressure. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bullish momentum at 1.14, with the indicator showing rising selling pressure as SOL stabilizes above $185. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) trades around 50.00, indicating that Solana faces mixed momentum at the price level. The current Index level shows room for volatile movement in either direction.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $180. The chart suggests that further downwards movement is unlikely across the short-term. As the price climbs back towards $200, SOL can be expected to hold steady at the level and continue rising towards the $220 level before finding a strong resistance. However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $195, SOL may fall back to the $170 support continuing the bearish trend. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for Solana’s growth and future growth. Why is SOL up? Solana observed bullish momentum as buyers tried to climb past $230, however, the rejection at the level has sent the price falling below the $180 mark. The price rose to $190 but struggles to climb past the level. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of 331.81, driven by fundamental factors in the market. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030, influenced by trends in the broader crypto market . Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential ROI due to its high scalability, which makes Solana an attractive investment. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 21:33:00

Currently, the space is being dominated by Hyperliquid. Meanwhile, traditional heavyweights like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are falling behind fast. Hyperliquid Leads the Pack CryptoRank’s latest data found a striking reshuffling in terms of blockchain fee leadership over the past year. Hyperliquid is emerging as the dominant force. The network’s fees skyrocketed 1,600% after surging from $2.4 million in October 2024 to a whopping $41 million in October 2025, driven by HIP-3’s launch, which paved the way for permissionless perpetuals and strategic fee reductions that fueled record trading volume. This meteoric rise has left once-dominant networks like Ethereum and Solana in the dust, as Ethereum’s fees halved to $21.6 million and Solana saw a 34% decline to $6.6 million. This essentially reflected users’ shift to faster, cheaper alternatives and a cooldown in meme-driven activity. Other chains like BNB Chain and Base also saw impressive growth, but none rival Hyperliquid’s explosive climb . Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s on-chain activity dwindled as fees plunged 73% during the same period amid fading Ordinals and Runes interest. As reported by CryptoPotato earlier, Hyperliquid cemented itself as a dominant force in Q2 2025 as it registered $648 billion in trading volume for the period and $1.57 trillion over 12 months. Its revenues topped $300 million, while its share of the perpetual DEX market surpassed 60%, roughly ten times greater than the nearest rival. This success can be attributed to the HYPE token airdrop and fair point system in late 2024, which drove massive user adoption. Meanwhile, popular traders, like James Wynn, added further attention, and the token buyback-and-burn program supported HYPE’s price stability during the said quarter. Even VanEck researchers noted that Hyperliquid effectively lured high-value users from Solana. HYPE Faces Sell Pressure Lately, however, HYPE has experienced considerable volatility. It started the week above $45 before tumbling sharply on October 11 and settling into a downtrend through October 17. Despite brief recoveries, the token failed to regain previous highs and wrapped up the period at $34.2, coinciding with the broader market plunge. The latest downturn has pushed HYPE’s monthly losses to 38.36%.

Both tokens are showing renewed technical strength, climbing double digits as investors reenter risk assets. Amid the growing optimism, analysts are turning their attention to early-stage altcoins showing explosive growth potential. Their new watchlist of the 5 best crypto presale gems for 2025 includes a mix of established projects and breakout newcomers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is quickly being recognized as one of the year’s most compelling early opportunities. 1. Cardano (ADA) — Whale Accumulation Confirms Confidence Cardano has regained momentum after sliding below key support last week. ADA now trades around $0.63 , up more than 9% in 48 hours. On-chain whale data shows heavy accumulation, suggesting institutions are positioning ahead of 2025’s Layer-1 revival. Analysts expect ADA to reclaim the $0.70–$0.80 range , marking the beginning of a long-term structural reversal. Cardano remains one of the most technically sound altcoins for investors seeking steady ROI growth into the next cycle. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — Hidden 100x Presale Gem Poised for Listings Among all emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout presale story of 2025 . The project’s surge in investor interest has placed it firmly on analysts’ “high-conviction watchlist,” thanks to its verified audit, clear roadmap, and structured approach to liquidity. What’s driving the hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale phase is nearing its final allocation , and traders are calling this the last major opportunity before the token begins its exchange rollout . Market analysts now forecast returns ranging from 50x to 100x based on projected launch valuations and early demand. With investor inflows accelerating daily, this best crypto presale gem has quickly become a favorite among traders seeking both short-term catalysts and long-term upside. Its upcoming listing window is expected to spark a significant price discovery event , drawing liquidity from across the market. 3. TRON (TRX) — Stablecoin Demand Drives Long-Term Strength TRON (TRX) continues to prove its staying power, fueled by consistent stablecoin transaction volume that exceeds $15 billion daily . Its growing dominance in on-chain transfers has helped the token maintain remarkable price stability. TRON currently trades near $0.12 , and analysts expect a potential rally toward $0.15 , positioning it among the most reliable mid-cap performers in this phase of market recovery. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional Demand Rising Fast Avalanche (AVAX) has reentered the conversation among top Layer-1 plays, with steady institutional interest and growing subnet adoption. Trading between $35–$40 , AVAX remains undervalued relative to its network activity. Analysts expect a move toward $60+ , with tokenized real-world assets and DeFi integrations acting as major tailwinds. 5. SUI (SUI) — Sub-$1 Token Drawing Smart Money Attention Rounding out the list, SUI continues to attract early smart money interest after a strong bounce from $0.74. Developer adoption remains healthy, and trading volume has increased more than 30% over the past week. Analysts view SUI as a high-risk, high-upside play that could deliver 20x–40x returns if the market confirms its Q4 reversal. Analysts See Presales as the Core of the 2025 Bull Setup Historically, presales and early-access tokens have produced the highest ROI multiples ahead of bull markets — and this cycle appears to be repeating. Analysts believe that with fear levels easing and liquidity returning, MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, TRON, Avalanche, and SUI could all deliver outsized gains, led by MAGA’s 100x presale momentum . The window for accumulation is closing quickly — and traders moving early may capture the next breakout phase before the broader market catches on.

53387909,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=839976,1760911228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53387909.jpeg,"Delayed CPI report, Fed meeting loom as Big Tech, automakers post results",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-enters-second-q3-earnings-week/,"Wall Street begins its second week of third-quarter earnings as investors brace for the first inflation data since the U.S. government shutdown, with Netflix, General Motors, Tesla, Ford, and Intel, all reporting. The September Consumer Price Index (CPI), delayed nine days, is also scheduled for release on Friday, after the shutdown halted economic data releases since October 1. The government said the numbers were needed for the Social Security Administration to process benefit payments on time. The report will arrive just before the Federal Reserve’s October 28–29 policy meeting, where traders expect a quarter-point rate cut, the second in two months after weak job data pushed the Fed to lower rates in September. More than 80 of all S&P 500 companies will release their Q3 earnings this week, extending a busy start to the season. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs opened the season last week and delivered strong figures, with about 84 % of companies that have reported so far beating all estimates, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. General Motors, Netflix, and Tesla report during packed mid-week sessions General Motors (GM) will report Tuesday morning before markets open, followed by a management call at 8:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter, the automaker absorbed a $1.1 billion tariff hit. Analysts surveyed expect profits to drop more than 20 % year-over-year. Edison Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said GM could still top forecasts but warned that “while pricing should remain consistent, results will likely be hurt by a small volume decline as well as higher net tariff impact.” Bespoke Investment Group found GM beats estimates 88 % of the time, though its stock has fallen on its last three earnings days, twice by more than 8 %. Netflix will release results after the close Tuesday, followed by a call event. The streamer’s last report showed 16 % revenue growth, and analysts project nearly a 30 % profit increase this quarter. Laurent Yoon from Bernstein said in a client note on Saturday that the animated hit “K-Pop Demon Hunters” drove the stock market’s rebound, adding about 500 million viewing hours, with another 400 million expected in the fourth quarter. Netflix has exceeded earnings for six straight quarters and seen gains on three of the last four report days, Bespoke’s data shows. Tesla follows Wednesday after the closing bell. The company missed sales targets last quarter as auto revenue slipped again, and analysts forecast another 20 % drop in earnings. Colin Langan of Wells Fargo expects a short-term beat but said “there’s too much hype baked into the stock.” He added that the Full Self-Driving system remains under NHTSA investigation, affecting credibility. Tesla has beaten expectations less than 60 % of the time, Bespoke data show. That “narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” Turnquist said in written commentary. Similarly, Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said he will be watching how broadly based the market’s gains are going forward. Ford, Intel, and the delayed CPI dominate Thursday’s market focus Ford Motor reports Thursday after the bell, with an analyst call shortly following after. Last quarter, Ford reinstated its full-year guidance despite a $2 billion tariff hit. Analysts now expect earnings to fall more than 25 % from a year earlier. Itay Michaeli of TD Cowen said attention will be on Ford’s aluminum supply from Novelis, especially for the F-Series trucks. He wrote that his estimates “do not contemplate any material production disruptions,” keeping forecasts near the top end of Ford’s EBIT outlook at $7.4 billion. Ford has beaten Wall Street estimates four quarters in a row. Intel will also report Thursday after markets close, with its call at 5 p.m. ET. Last quarter, the chipmaker beat revenue forecasts and cut foundry spending. Analysts expect Intel to return to profitability this period. Its shares have jumped 62 % in three months after the U.S. government took a 10 % stake and Nvidia invested $5 billion. Investors will be watching how Intel plans to leverage that backing. Still, its stock fell after each of the last three earnings, including an 8 % drop after the previous quarter. “We’d really have to see something out of left field in terms of notable inflation pressures to knock the Fed off of a rate cut path at the October meeting,” Glenmede’s Michael Reynolds said. That “narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” Turnquist said in written commentary. Similarly, Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said he will be watching how broadly based the market’s gains are going forward.

With ETF speculation heating up and Bitcoin steady above $107K , traders say XRP could be gearing up for a major price breakout into Q4 . 1. XRP (XRP) — Whale Accumulation Confirms Smart Money Entry On-chain data from major tracking platforms shows XRP whales adding over $500 million in holdings across 48 hours — the largest two-day accumulation since April. This renewed confidence follows Ripple’s increasing integration with cross-border payment systems and growing chatter around a potential XRP-linked ETF product . XRP is currently holding support near $0.55 , with analysts forecasting a rebound toward $1.20–$1.40 once Bitcoin’s ETF flows stabilize. Several market watchers now call XRP one of the best cryptos to buy for Q4 , citing strong fundamentals and historical performance during ETF-driven rallies. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — Best Crypto Presale Offering 50% Patriot Bonus While XRP captures institutional flows, early investors are hunting high-ROI opportunities — and MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate presale conversations. The project has entered its final sale phase ahead of expected exchange listings, and investor demand is surging daily. To celebrate its success, MAGACOIN FINANCE has launched an exclusive PATRIOT50X bonus , giving buyers an extra 50% token allocation for a limited time. Analysts forecast 40x–100x ROI potential post-listing, calling it one of the best crypto presales of 2025 for investors seeking asymmetric gains before mass-market entry. 3. Bitcoin and Ethereum Stability Strengthen Market Outlook Bitcoin’s consolidation above $107K and Ethereum’s hold around $3,900 are restoring confidence across altcoins. With ETF outflows slowing and stablecoin inflows rising, liquidity rotation into large caps like XRP and emerging presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is already underway. Analysts Expect Q4 Breakout Momentum Market sentiment is shifting rapidly as institutional inflows stabilize and whale activity intensifies. With ETF optimism building, analysts believe XRP could retest multi-year highs — while MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the charge among the best crypto presales preparing for 2025’s next bull leg.

As the flagship cryptocurrency slows down, the latest on-chain data suggests that a group of investors is exiting the market en masse. More Short-Term Holders Are Giving Up Their Holdings In an October 18 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Darkfost revealed that a significant number of Bitcoin’s short-term investors have started to close their positions and realize their losses. Related Reading: Altcoins Selling Pressure Persists As Exchange Inflow Hits 2025 High — Details Darkfost’s analysis was hinged on the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which tracks the net amount (in USD) of profits or losses that are realized on-chain. This metric measures the net profit or loss on a daily basis, averaged, in this case, over seven days. It provides insight into whether more investors are selling at losses or with their heads still above water.. According to the crypto pundit, the realized losses of BTC investors have surged to an approximate level as high as $750 million per day, one of the highest levels this current cycle has seen. Interestingly, Darkfost explained that the magnitude of these capitulation events stands easily comparable to those seen during the 2024 summer correction. What’s worth noting about this capitulation phase is what may likely follow. According to the analyst, events like this usually precede local bottoms. What this means is that after short-term holders (known as the “weak hands”) have surrendered their holdings to the more-confident long-term holders (the “diamond hands”), the cryptocurrency stands a chance of seeing a price rebound — an expectation in congruence with historical trends. However, on the more cautious side, Darkfost offered a subtle warning that the dreary opposite could also be the case in a situation where the market stands at an early bearish phase. Bitcoin Whales Might Be Accumulating Again Supporting the positive redistribution theory, a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform by Abramchart offers a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin market participants. Referencing the Inflows To Accumulation Addresses (Dynamic Cohort) metric, the analyst highlighted a significant inflow of more than 26,500 BTC into whale accumulation wallets. When large amounts of Bitcoin — such as this magnitude — are moved, it usually signals an underlying institutional or whale accumulation, as coins are typically transferred from exchanges to these wallets for long-term holding. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? Following historical patterns, it is very likely that this accumulation event will precede a continued bullish expansion of the flagship cryptocurrency. As Abramchart explained, this trend all serves as a hint that smart money is “quietly buying the dip.” As of this writing, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $106,870, with no significant movement seen over the past 24 hours.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|VET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 23:33:00

Notably, popular crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared a detailed Gaussian Channel analysis on X that points to Bitcoin’s macro bull structure remaining intact despite short-term volatility. His post, which was accompanied by a Bitcoin price chart, shows how Bitcoin’s position relative to the Gaussian Channel offers a clear view of the ongoing cycle. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Issues Rally Cry To Bitcoin Army: “Starve The Bears!” Bull Market Intact Above Gaussian Channel Titan of Crypto noted that Bitcoin’s placement above the Gaussian Channel represents strength in the long-term trend. As shown in the weekly candlestick price chart below, the green channel corresponds to bullish phases, while red regions represent bearish downturns, a prime example being the 2022 bear market. At the time of writing, the upper band is positioned around $101,300 and trending upward. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price action around $107,000 means that it is yet to break into the Gaussian channel and its overall market structure is still solid. From this, it can be inferred that Bitcoin’s current pullback from the October 6 all-time high above $126,000 is only a temporary pause within a larger bull market. Bitcoin Gaussian Channel. Source: Titan of Crypto on X However, although the Gaussian Channel reading looks favorable, Titan of Crypto noted that the indicator should not be treated as a trading trigger. “It’s not a buy signal, it’s a macro context indicator,” he stated. Being above the Gaussian Channel doesn’t necessarily equate to buying more. It simply means the bull market structure is still intact. The Gaussian Channel works best when combined with other indicators such as trading volume, moving averages, and on-chain accumulation trends to confirm directional momentum. Coinbase Premium Gap Turns Red Speaking of other indicators, on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the Coinbase Premium Gap, a metric comparing Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase versus other exchanges, has turned red. As shown in the chart below, Coinbase’s Premium Gap went on a sharp decline from positive premium levels above +60 earlier in the week to as low as -40 when the Bitcoin price fell to $101,000. Bitcoin: Coinbase Premium Gap Interestingly, the Coinbase Premium Gap has increased to around -10 at the time of writing, meaning US investors are starting to turn bullish again. This can be seen as a bullish signal, as similar dips in US demand were recorded between March and April before the Bitcoin price eventually rallied more than 60% to reach new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage However, a red Coinbase Premium Gap alone is not decisive. It should be interpreted alongside other data points, including ETF inflows, trading volume, liquidity, and derivatives funding rates. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $107,120.

The comment offered a perspective that challenges common assumptions about the company’s reserves. Ripple recently announced plans to raise $1 billion to purchase XRP , and Nietzbux wrote that “there are several reasons Ripple would buy new XRP with new capital for a treasury,” but pointed out that many continue to ask why the company would not simply move tokens from its escrow account. The Pre-allocation Theory He then introduced what he described as a purely speculative factor, suggesting that “maybe the pre-allocation theory is correct and Ripple has less XRP in the escrow than the public thinks.” The idea hints at a possible scenario where a portion of the tokens held in escrow may already be committed to private arrangements, potentially explaining Ripple’s continued market activity despite its large nominal holdings . This interpretation challenges the view that Ripple’s escrow is entirely available for company use. Nietzbux’s speculation resonates with long-running theories within the XRP community about pre-allocated holdings and private agreements with financial institutions. If accurate, this could mean that Ripple’s available supply is smaller than most believe, a situation that would theoretically support stronger long-term market dynamics for XRP due to tighter circulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Public Transparency and Market Interpretation Following the post, community members questioned the premise, noting that Ripple has publicly stated the amount of XRP held in escrow. Nietzbux acknowledged that the escrow and its total are indeed public, but clarified that Ripple’s ownership of all tokens in escrow isn’t public information. While experts agree that Ripple cannot freely sell off the tokens in escrow , this distinction drew attention to an important technical point, as public blockchain data can verify how much XRP is locked. Still, ownership details and contractual obligations related to those tokens may remain undisclosed. Another user sought clarification on the term “pre-allocation,” asking whether it referred to XRP being set aside for Ripple’s banking partners. Ripple has partnerships with over 300 banks and institutions across the globe, and Nietzbux explained that pre-allocation in this context would mean tokens have already been sold to some of these institutions, and are being kept in escrow until release. If such pre-allocation exists, Ripple’s decision to buy XRP directly could reflect an effort to maintain liquidity and support price stability. For investors, this scenario would suggest that Ripple’s financial behavior aligns with a long-term effort to preserve confidence in XRP’s market integrity.

The market’s alive again, filled with meme coins that bite and blockchains that actually build. Among the noise, BullZilla ($BZIL), MoonBull ($MOBU), and La Culex ($CULEX) are charging ahead as the top crypto presale to join now, while giants like Chainlink, Avalanche, and Solana remind investors that innovation never sleeps. And one beast is truly rewriting the playbook: BullZilla ($BZIL) a project born to dominate. Its Stage 7 presale (Bag Signal Activated) is live, with an automatic price increase every $100K raised or every 48 hours. With over $930K raised, 31B tokens sold, and 3,100 holders, early believers are already seeing over 2,950% ROI. Every minute of delay means one thing: a higher entry price. 1.

Those bold enough to drop $15,000 are staring at potential six-figure returns once the token hits its listing price of $0.00527. The project’s appeal lies in its tokenomics: 70% APY staking via “The HODL Furnace,” continuous deflation through the Roar Burn, and a stage-based presale that rewards the earliest believers. That’s why it leads every discussion about the top crypto presale to join now – because this bull doesn’t pause, it climbs. Deflationary Roar Burn Mechanism Every time BullZilla crosses a milestone, tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. This isn’t theory it’s on-chain proof.

Its oracles connect real-world data with blockchain protocols, powering everything from smart contracts to automated trading systems. As more institutions integrate blockchain tech, Chainlink’s demand keeps rising. Investors view LINK as a long-term powerhouse that bridges the gap between traditional finance and Web3 innovation. 3. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull mixes meme culture with utility, giving holders a taste of fun and finance. Its 95% APY staking system and referral structure have already caught attention across crypto Twitter. As one of the top crypto presales to join now, MoonBull’s Ethereum foundation ensures both safety and scalability. It’s a community-driven project that rewards holding not hype. 4. La Culex ($CULEX) La Culex is the rising star among upcoming meme coin presales. With its quirky branding and early-stage buzz, it’s winning over small-cap hunters looking for the next viral hit. The project’s roadmap focuses on transparency, liquidity locks, and user engagement, suggesting it could mature into a sustainable ecosystem beyond the jokes and memes. 5. Avalanche ($AVAX) Avalanche remains one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains on the planet. Its subnet technology gives developers freedom to build highly customizable applications without compromising performance. As institutions eye greener and faster chains, Avalanche’s technical edge keeps it firmly in the spotlight for serious investors and builders. Conclusion The 2025 bull market is already roaring, and the top crypto presale to join now, list starts with BullZilla, the unstoppable fusion of deflation, staking, and story-driven branding. MoonBull and La Culex amplify the fun, while Chainlink and Avalanche anchor the market with utility and innovation. BullZilla’s live presale is a rare window where timing meets trust.

53391857,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=180507,1760920204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/53391857.jpeg,XRP and Cardano Oversold: 5 Best Altcoins to Buy Before the Next Institutional Rotation,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-and-cardano-oversold-5-best-altcoins-to-buy-before-the-next-institutional-rotation/,"Crypto investors are watching closely as institutions prepare for their next rotation . With XRP and Cardano now in oversold zones, traders are eyeing Ethereum, Solana , and newer picks like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which could see fresh accumulation and listings ahead. XRP Price Outlook: Could a New All-Time High Come Soon? XRP has faced selling pressure after Bitcoin reached a new high above $125,000. According to analyst Nathaniel Rothschild, if Bitcoin holds that peak, XRP and other altcoins could reach new highs within three weeks. XRP last hit $3.66 in July 2025 and now trades near $2.22, down around 20% in the past week. For XRP to reach a new all-time high, it needs to climb more than 60% from its current level. That might sound steep, but XRP has done it before; the last major rally from $2.22 to $3.66 took only two weeks. Traders watching for institutional accumulation may find XRP’s current oversold range appealing. As long as Bitcoin’s dominance cools off and liquidity rotates back into altcoins, XRP could be one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation. Cardano Struggles to Hold Key Levels Cardano (ADA) has dropped 20% in a week, falling to around $0.68 after breaking below its recent support. The move came as part of a wider market correction that affected many top coins. Analysts say Cardano’s short-term setup looks weak, but not without hope. The MACD indicator still leans positive, showing early signs of recovery. If ADA can push above $0.72, it could aim for $0.83 or even touch $1.02 if broader sentiment improves. The downside risk remains near $0.63, and failure to hold that could push ADA to $0.51. Still, many traders see this level as an entry zone for long-term positioning. As markets prepare for the next phase of capital inflow, Cardano sits on many analysts’ lists of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation , especially for those seeking a quality large-cap rebound. Ethereum Sees Fresh Institutional Accumulation Ethereum is back in focus after BitMine Immersion Technologies accumulated over $1.5 billion worth of ETH during the market pullback. Despite short-term weakness, this kind of accumulation from large players hints at preparation for the next wave of capital rotation. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee noted that Ether could eventually flip Bitcoin, similar to how equities overtook gold decades ago. Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, hosting major assets and DeFi infrastructure. Large-scale accumulation, combined with current discounted prices, makes Ethereum one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation . As on-chain data shows, wallets with more than 10,000 ETH have grown steadily since early October — a pattern often seen before market recoveries. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Under $1 Another altcoin gaining quiet attention among whales is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a newer ERC-20 project valued around $16 million . Its low market cap, combined with talk of upcoming DEX listings , has drawn interest from early institutional buyers looking for undervalued coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out because it’s still under $1 but is already seeing whale accumulation and community buzz. Analysts tracking early listings believe it could outperform XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano as smaller-cap coins tend to move faster during market expansions. This coin sits among the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation , especially for traders seeking early exposure ahead of its confirmed exchange listings. Solana Builds Strength Ahead of Key Announcement Solana (SOL) has bounced back from $174 and now aims to break above $190, ahead of a major ecosystem announcement expected on October 20. This recovery shows renewed confidence, as buyers stepped in quickly after last week’s selloff. Analysts see a bullish pattern forming, with the next upside target between $220 and $230 if SOL clears $190. Despite some stablecoin outflows — roughly $400 million in a day — Solana’s structure remains firm, supported by demand in the $170 range. With attention shifting toward the announcement and improving momentum, Solana joins Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano as one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation. Final Takeaway Institutional players often rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins once the top coin stabilizes — and that moment may be near. XRP, Cardano, Ethereum, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all show setups worth watching. Those seeking early exposure should explore MAGACOIN FINANCE’s website now, before its listings go live.

Notably, these minerals are crucial in producing electronics and military defense products. Gromen’s remarks follow China’s new regulations recently put in place to prevent the sale of these essential minerals to the US military industry. The relationship between this industry and the US dollar is that the military industry offers support to the dollar’s value via military power, he explained to Marty Bent, founder of Truth For the Commoner (TFTC), on Sunday, October 19. Therefore, when the industry is affected, it impacts the dollar’s value. China’s export decision on rare earth raises controversy among individuals China’s move triggered US President Donald Trump’s announcement of an additional 100% tariffs on China. Additionally, Gromen argued that this demonstrated the country’s greater influence than several Western commentators understand. The analyst further illustrated that the US normally sends the military and retaliates if it interferes with the financial aspect of the rules-based global order. With this discovery, Gromen highlighted that this was the primary reason for invading Saddam and what was happening with Gaddafi. In the meantime, a reliable source pointed out that China currently accounts for more than 90% of the world’s rare earth minerals and rare earth magnets, which are useful in producing electronics. Regarding new restrictions on these materials, Gromen cautioned that this action will alter supply chains and the global financial system. To address this current challenge in the US, the analyst suggested that a hard money standard is the only effective solution. He stated Bitcoin as an example of a hard money asset that can assist in enhancing the country’s struggling economy. Hence, as inflation impacts currency values, both the prices of BTC and gold will likely continue to escalate because individuals and businesses are turning to the cryptocurrency to safeguard their purchasing power. As debate concerning China’s limitation on rare earth exports heats up, Gromen has expressed skepticism about the US government’s intention to use stablecoins to maintain the dominance of the US dollar. This is because he views stablecoins as just a short-term solution and therefore cannot address the main issue, which, according to the situation, is currency devaluation. The weakening of the US dollar causes tension among investors Investment analysts at The Kobeissi Letter pointed out that the US dollar is on track to record its worst year since 1973 as Bitcoin and gold reach an all-time high. This has sparked tension among investors in the market. “The US dollar is set to have its worst year since 1973, reflecting a decline of more than 10%. Since 2000, the USD has lost 40% of its purchasing power,” reported The Kobeissi Letter. This continuous decline of the currency value illustrates that asset prices will continue to increase as investors look for ways to safeguard their purchasing power, added The Kobeissi Letter. On the other hand, sources have revealed that China’s economic growth likely weakened to its slowest pace in a year during the third quarter. This drop results from a long-lasting slump in the property market and the impact of trade-related demand. Consequently, there is pressure on government officials to bring in more support action to enhance confidence and growth. Respondingly, Beijing has taken minor support measures this year to keep its options open for future challenges, benefiting from strong exports and healthy stock markets. However, the new trade tension resulting from the US-China conflict presents potential threats. While there is a likelihood of more support measures, experts disagree over whether the government will act this year. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?
