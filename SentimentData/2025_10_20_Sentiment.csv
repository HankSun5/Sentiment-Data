With Bitcoin stabilizing near $107K and ETF speculation returning, analysts say now could be the perfect entry window before the next major rotation begins. Several leading projects are already drawing renewed attention from both retail traders and smart money funds. Here are the 5 best altcoins to buy now before the next wave of liquidity hits. 1. Ethereum (ETH) — Reclaiming Strength Ahead of ETF Reversal Ethereum has regained control of the $3,900 zone, marking its strongest technical close in two weeks. On-chain data shows a clear increase in whale wallet inflows — a bullish signal that often precedes 20–30% recoveries. If ETH breaks above the $4,200 resistance, analysts expect a move to $4,800–$5,000 , fueled by renewed ETF flows and institutional hedging demand. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — High-ROI Altcoin With Exchange Buzz Building Among mid-cap and presale-stage tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become the most anticipated breakout play of 2025 . Analysts tracking early-stage inflows report that MAGA’s investor base has expanded sharply over the past 48 hours as anticipation builds for its upcoming exchange listings . Market sentiment around MAGACOIN FINANCE has shifted from speculative to strategic — traders now see it as a next-cycle contender with 50x–100x ROI potential once it hits centralized exchanges. Investors cite its audit-backed foundation , strong liquidity preparation, and aggressive listing roadmap as reasons for rising confidence. Many early entrants view the final pre-listing window as a rare “last-chance” opportunity before price discovery begins and retail access opens globally. With attention rotating from meme speculation to smart-presale plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now positioned as one of the best crypto opportunities heading into 2025’s first major bull run . 3. Solana (SOL) — Oversold Bounce Targets 80% Upside Solana continues to show resilience after correcting below $190, with analysts forecasting an 80% rebound once liquidity returns. Its DeFi and NFT ecosystems remain among the most active in crypto, and whale wallets have quietly accumulated over 500,000 SOL in the past week. Traders see $250 as a key near-term target if momentum builds around ETF speculation. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional Capital Circles Layer-1 Ecosystem Avalanche has rebounded 12% this week, supported by strong developer activity and institutional integration into tokenized finance solutions. With AVAX holding steady around $38, analysts expect a potential move toward $60 , making it one of the top mid-cap recovery trades for early 2025. 5. Chainlink (LINK) — Quiet Accumulation Before the Next Data Surge Chainlink (LINK) continues to benefit from the rise of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization , with on-chain metrics showing increased network activity. Analysts believe that as more institutions connect blockchain data through LINK’s oracles, its valuation could surge by 40–70% , making it a staple pick in upcoming portfolios. Analysts Expect Q4 Rotation and Breakout Momentum With fear levels cooling and ETF narratives reigniting, market analysts say the next few weeks could mark the beginning of the next altcoin cycle . Ethereum’s strength is setting the tone — but the spotlight is now on undervalued assets with explosive upside. For investors seeking asymmetrical returns, Solana, Avalanche, Chainlink, and MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out as frontrunners positioned for the next major ROI wave before 2025’s full bull run ignites.

53385794,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86861,1760907624,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction — Analysts Target $125K Recovery as Market Fear Drops Below 30,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-analysts-target-125k-recovery-as-market/,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke into a crucial turning point as analysts, on the crypto market, look at a possible rebound towards $125,000 , after the fear index dropped below 30. The sharp decline in sentiment comes after Bitcoin’s recent 20% price dip from its October highs near $125K to around $100K. Despite the fear, some analysts consider this phase a classic accumulation phase, which is often followed by sharp rebounds. As the market assesses its next move, the focus is shifting towards institutional inflows and emerging tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which has maintained investor interest during the downtrend. Crypto Market Fear Drops Below 30—What’s Next? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index has dropped to 25, which indicates market-wide fear. The transition from neutral sentiment (51) last month is the result of a cautious mood from traders, after Bitcoin’s correction below $110,000. Historically, such fear levels have occurred at market bottoms or the early stage of accumulation by institutional buyers. Analysts say that when the index goes below 30, long-term investors consider that to be a signal to buy undervalued assets. Crypto Fear and Greed Index | Source: CMC This new level of fear has resulted in a variety of responses. Short-term traders are reducing exposure during volatility, while other investors are positioning for a potential rebound. With Bitcoin consolidating near the 50-week moving average, technical indicators indicate that sellers are near exhaustion, suggesting a possible relief rally is in the cards if key supports are maintained. As investors reassess the market landscape, new opportunities are emerging beyond the consolidation in Bitcoin. MAGACOIN FINANCE , one of the most talked-about presales of the quarter, has distinguished itself in the face of widespread caution for keeping investor interest high. Its audited framework and community-driven model have established it as a leading contender for those investors who want to gain exposure to early-stage growth projects during the market cooldown period. Bitcoin Price Targets $125K Rebound Bitcoin’s RSI has plunged to 36, which is oversold territory for the first time in months. Historically, this signal is often seen as the conclusion of the correction phase that tends to be followed by rallies of 15-25%. Technical analysts are optimistic that a support range of $100K-$103K might be holding and could pave the way to a recovery towards the $120K-$135K range in the next few weeks. BTCUSD 1-Day Chart | Source: X Analyst observed that RSI is in oversold, with a bottom of $135K. This view is in line with previous historical recovery patterns following similar RSI numbers in 2023 and 2024. At the same time, long-term models show resilience of Bitcoin near the 50-week SMA , which has been the trigger zone of huge rallies from $20K, $25K, and $55K levels in previous cycles. Institutional sentiment is still cautious but supportive. Despite market volatility, spot Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity have seen consistent inflows, further solidifying demand over the long term. Analysts anticipate a swift return of confidence if Bitcoin closes the week above $105K, fueling renewed momentum towards the $125K resistance zone . It is in this cautious optimism that focus has moved to the presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE . The early traction of this crypto presale is indicative of a rising need for diversification at a time of Bitcoin stabilization. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is on Top of Analyst Picks MAGACOIN FINANCE has been one of the best analyst picks amid the current market correction. Unlike hyped-up tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE has undergone comprehensive security audits by CertiK and Hashex , ensuring transparency and investor safety. Its Ethereum-based presale mechanism, along with a fixed supply, has drawn comparison with early success stories that provided enormous returns as soon as markets recovered. Analysts cite the project’s strong fundamentals, early-stage valuation, and increasing involvement from whales as evidence of long-term momentum. With over $16 million raised and demand growing despite the period of fear, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the right move to take when market confidence returns. Its community involvement and transparent presale plan have made it the best crypto to buy in Q4 . Conclusion As fear takes hold of the market, Bitcoin is in the oversold territory and getting closer to the key support levels, which could indicate a turning point opportunity. Analysts suggest that as long as BTC stays above $100K, the recovery towards $125K is still likely in the near-term. Nevertheless, investors are looking out for new opportunities in other projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which, with its audited structure and investor traction, is proving resilient, even in a fearful market. Whether a rebound or further consolidation, these accumulation phases tend to create the foundation for the next big rally.

The rebound comes as investor confidence appears to be returning, as it coincides with a steady rise in mid to large-sized XRP holders. Particularly, on-chain data shows that the XRP ecosystem now has more than 317,500 wallets holding at least 10,000 XRP tokens for the first time in its history. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage Mid To Large XRP Holders Reach Record 317,500 Wallets Despite XRP’s recent price woes alongside the rest of the crypto market, on-chain data shows that XRP’s holder base is increasing among crypto investors. Notably, Santiment’s latest data shows that the number of XRP wallets holding at least 10,000 tokens has reached an all-time high of approximately 317,500. Santiment’s data chart, as shown below, indicates that XRP’s network has added approximately 1.8% more wallets holding 10,000 or more tokens in just the last thirty days. Interestingly, Santiment’s data further shows that the upward slope of this metric has been consistent throughout 2025. The increase in mid-sized and large wallet count shows that many XRP investors are not concerned about the recent price dips. Instead, many of them are taking advantage of lower prices to strengthen their holdings. As such, a growing segment of investors are buying XRP for long-term gains rather than short-term price action. XRP, which is currently hovering around the $2.35 range, may benefit from this growing base of committed holders in the long term. Its price trajectory now depends on its ability to sustain momentum above $2.3. If the bullish on-chain sentiment translates into consistent buy pressure, XRP could extend its rebound and target at least $2.8 before the end of the week. However, if momentum stalls, the price may enter another downward phase before an upward move. Nonetheless, the record growth in wallets holding over 10,000 XRP provides a strong long-term foundation that may support the cryptocurrency’s value in the coming weeks. Number of 10K+ XRP Wallets.

The stolen assets were reportedly transferred to the Tron network via Bridgers and then laundered through Southeast Asia-based OTC channels called Huione. Huione was recently sanctioned by the US for fraud and money laundering. ZachXBT stated that it identified the victim's wallet address based on a viral YouTube video. The attacker reportedly executed more than 120 Ripple-to-Tron bridge transactions on October 12, 2025. The transactions appeared to have been made through Binance, but the liquidity was provided by Bridgers. As of October 15, the funds were fully transferred to Huione-linked OTC accounts. Related News: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Grew by 64 Percent Overnight - Here's What You Need to Know Huione is alleged to have played a role in laundering billions of dollars in illicit funds in recent years, including through “pig butchering” scams, investment fraud, human trafficking, and cyberattacks. Last week, the US administration expanded sanctions against Huione as part of its $15 billion Prince Group investigation. ZachXBT said one of the key lessons to be learned from the incident was that users don't know the difference between wallet types: The victim thought he was using Ellipal's cold wallet, but it was actually a hot wallet. Similar confusion occurs on platforms like Coinbase. He also noted that the victim had difficulty contacting US law enforcement to report the $3 million loss, as there were few experts qualified to handle such cases. *This is not investment advice.

53386658,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=839964,1760908672,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53386658.jpeg,OpenAI aligns with Trump while Anthropic fights regulation,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/anthropic-openai-and-u-s-government/,"Right now, Anthropic is facing a double fight – one against OpenAI, its biggest rival, and another against President Donald Trump’s administration, which has taken direct aim at the company’s policies. The San Francisco startup, founded by siblings Dario Amodei and Daniela Amodei in 2020 after they split from OpenAI, has built its entire identity on making AI safer. But that stance has now landed it in political crossfire, drawing attacks from David Sacks, Trump’s AI and crypto czar. Sacks has accused Anthropic of playing politics instead of innovation. After Jack Clark, the company’s policy chief, published an essay titled “Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,” Sacks fired back online. “Anthropic is running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,” he wrote on X. He claimed the company was pushing “the Left’s vision of AI regulation” and trying to control how the technology is governed in the United States. OpenAI aligns with Trump while Anthropic fights regulation OpenAI has become one of Trump’s closest tech partners. On January 21, just a day after Trump’s second inauguration, the White House announced Stargate, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. The plan involves billions of dollars for U.S. AI infrastructure and marks a deep partnership between government and industry. Backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, OpenAI now holds a valuation near $500 billion, dwarfing Anthropic’s still massive $183 billion. While OpenAI dominates the public side of AI with ChatGPT and Sora, Anthropic has carved its niche in enterprise with its Claude models. But the companies could not be more different in their regulations. OpenAI has lobbied for lighter federal rules, while Anthropic has been one of the most outspoken opponents of Trump’s plan to block state-level AI oversight. The clash intensified over a Trump-backed proposal inside the “Big Beautiful Bill”, which sought to ban states from introducing their own AI regulations for ten years. The plan was later dropped after heavy pushback from Anthropic and others. Instead, the company threw its support behind California’s SB 53, a bill requiring AI transparency and safety disclosures. In a blog post on September 8, the company wrote, “SB 53’s transparency requirements will have an important impact on frontier AI safety. Without it, labs with increasingly powerful models could face growing incentives to dial back their own safety and disclosure programs in order to compete.” Sacks and Rabois step up political pressure Sacks has denied trying to take down Anthropic, saying he only wants the U.S. to win the AI race against China. “The U.S. is currently in an AI race, and our chief global competition is China,” Sacks said at Salesforce’s Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. “They’re the only other country that has the talent, the resources, and the technology expertise to basically beat us in AI.” When Bloomberg linked his comments to federal scrutiny of Anthropic, Sacks shot back. “Nothing could be further from the truth,” he said on X. “Just a couple of months ago, the White House approved Anthropic’s Claude app to be offered to all branches of government through the GSA App Store.” Sacks also accused Anthropic of painting itself as a political victim. “It has been Anthropic’s government affairs and media strategy to position itself consistently as a foe of the Trump administration,” he said. “But don’t whine to the media that you’re being ‘targeted’ when all we’ve done is articulate a policy disagreement.” He cited several examples, including Dario comparing Trump to a “feudal warlord” during the 2024 election and endorsing Kamala Harris for president. Anthropic ran multiple op-eds pushing back against the administration’s AI moratorium and chip export strategy, while hiring several former Biden-era officials to manage its policy team. Sacks said Clark’s essay contributes to the “fear-mongering” that is harming startups. Clark had written: “As these AI systems get smarter, they develop more complicated goals. When these goals aren’t aligned with human preferences, they behave strangely. Another reason for my fear is that I can see a path to these systems starting to design their successors, albeit in an early form.” Sacks replied that this type of rhetoric is “principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.” Anthropic maintains several federal contracts, including a $200 million deal with the Department of Defense and ongoing access to government agencies through the General Services Administration. It also launched a national security advisory council to align with U.S. interests and even offers its Claude model to government users for just $1 per year. Adding to the heat, tech investor Keith Rabois, whose husband serves in the Trump administration, joined the criticism. “If Anthropic actually believed their rhetoric about safety, they can always shut down the company,” Rabois wrote on X. “And lobby then.” Don’t just read crypto news.

The 54-year-old Brandon said this was his and his 60-year-old wife’s entire life savings, and they were planning to buy a house in Las Vegas. That dream collapsed overnight. Brandon said he had been building his XRP position since 2017, slowly selling pieces off to cover living costs. “That was everything we had,” he said. “I’m speaking up because maybe someone out there can learn from what happened to us.” He admitted he doesn’t expect the funds to be recovered, but hopes the story will remind people to keep their cold wallets truly offline. What remained was everything they had left for retirement. Brandon explained in a YouTube video released on Saturday that the theft likely happened on Sunday, October 12. Two small 10-XRP test transactions appeared around 11:15 a.m. Eastern time, followed by a full sweep of about 1,209,990 XRP to a new address. From there, the funds were broken apart and moved across dozens of wallets in minutes, then hundreds more as the hours passed. His smaller holdings, about $1,000 in XLM and $900 in FLR, were untouched. After realizing the funds were gone, he filed a report with the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center and contacted local police, but he said it was hard to reach specialized cybercrime investigators quickly. “I don’t know exactly how they got in,” Brandon said. “All I know is everything was there one day and gone the next.” Ellipal blames cold-to-hot wallet confusion Ellipal released a public statement on October 18 claiming its internal review showed that Brandon had entered his hardware wallet seed phrase into the Ellipal mobile app, turning what was supposed to be cold storage into a hot wallet. In an email to him, the company explained that when a seed phrase is imported into a phone or tablet, the device stores the private keys, connecting it to the internet and destroying the safety layer that makes a cold wallet secure. Brandon said he had the Ellipal app installed on both an iPhone and an iPad. The iPhone app had a blue background, which Ellipal told him represented a cold wallet. The iPad version showed an orange background, which meant it was hot. Ellipal said that color difference mattered, emphasizing that their hardware devices are air-gapped, meaning they never connect to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB. The company said no thefts had ever come from its physical wallets and insisted the incident looked like user error. Still, the company admitted it couldn’t prove how the theft technically happened. Brandon said he simply followed the app’s interface. “If the blue means cold and orange means hot, why wasn’t that made clearer?” he said in one of his YouTube videos. Ellipal hasn’t confirmed whether the color indicators failed or were misunderstood, but maintained that entering a seed phrase into an app immediately removes all protection. ZachXBT traces stolen XRP across Tron and OTC brokers On Sunday, on-chain sleuth ZachXBT posted a detailed thread on X (formerly Twitter) sharing how he identified the theft address by matching the transaction times and values shown in Brandon’s videos. In his post, Zach said the attacker used Bridgers, the swap service previously called SWFT, to create more than 120 Ripple-to-Tron conversions on October 12. Some block explorers labeled the transactions as “Binance” because Bridgers routes its liquidity through the exchange. According to Zach’s X thread, the stolen XRP was eventually consolidated on the Tron network in a wallet labeled TGF3hP5GeUPKaRJeWKpvF2PVVCMrfe2bYw, before being sent to multiple over-the-counter brokers tied to Huione, a Southeast Asian marketplace flagged in U.S. enforcement actions for handling illicit transfers. Three days later, the funds had been reportedly scattered across countless addresses, making recovery practically impossible. ZachXBT warned people to stay away from “crypto recovery” services, calling them scams that charge big fees for fake investigations.

By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $1,044.17, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $2,418.37 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for the Solana network ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment regarding the current Solana price within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors, driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach, along with its low transaction fees and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price action, as indicated by the technical factors and technical analysis. In this article, we’ll explore Solana price prediction and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. This brings the question “How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond?” and we’ll try to answer that. Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $189.88 (-3%) Market Cap $104 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $4.54 Billion Circulating Supply 546.41 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $192.20 24-hour Low $183.46 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bearish 50-Day SMA $215.56 200-Day SMA $174.33 Price Prediction $411.98 (117.04%) F & G Index 20.33 (extreme fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 14-Day RSI 35.24 Solana price analysis: SOL recovers to $190 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows recovery back to $190 Resistance for SOL is at $210 Support for SOL/USD is at $180 The price analysis of Solana for October 19 shows that SOL has recovered back to the $190 mark as the bulls recover from $180 lows. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL falls below $180 before recovery Solana observed bearish pressure as SOL fell to the $180 mark before recovering back to the $210 level. However, the price faced resistance at the level and fell below the $180 mark where it found short-term support. Now, the price has recovered back to the $190 level but struggles in climbing higher. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.56, which reflects the recent trend, showing bearish pressure across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line recovers steadily, suggesting falling selling pressure. Additionally, the MACD candles show falling bearish momentum as the indicator trades at -2.59 showing strong but decreasing momentum. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bulls face resistance above $190 The 4-hour chart for Solana shows that the price oscillated between the $220 and the 230 levels as either side struggled to gain momentum. The recent rally surged the SOL price toward $230 resistance line before crashing below the $180 mark. The price bounced back sharply from the $180 mark and now trades around the $190 level but faces strong bearish pressure. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bullish momentum at 1.14, with the indicator showing rising selling pressure as SOL stabilizes above $185. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) trades around 50.00, indicating that Solana faces mixed momentum at the price level. The current Index level shows room for volatile movement in either direction.

SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 1-hour chart indicates support around $180. The chart suggests that further downwards movement is unlikely across the short-term. As the price climbs back towards $200, SOL can be expected to hold steady at the level and continue rising towards the $220 level before finding a strong resistance. However, if the price fails to hold at the level and establish foothold above $195, SOL may fall back to the $170 support continuing the bearish trend. Is SOL a good investment? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform known for its robust scalability and speed due to various technological advancements, particularly in the crypto space boasting a substantial Total Value Locked ( TVL ). The network continues to hit key development milestones. Despite a challenging month, price predictions indicate a more positive outlook, suggesting the potential for Solana’s growth and future growth. Why is SOL up? Solana observed bullish momentum as buyers tried to climb past $230, however, the rejection at the level has sent the price falling below the $180 mark. The price rose to $190 but struggles to climb past the level. What is Solana going to be worth in 2025? The Solana (SOL) price prediction for 2025 suggests a minimum value of $150.06 with an average price of 331.81, driven by fundamental factors in the market. The price could reach a maximum of $367.80 during the year. Will SOL reach $1,000? The price forecasts indicate that SOL could reach the $1000 mark by 2030, influenced by trends in the broader crypto market . Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend, SOL might reach $1,000 within the next five years. Can Solana reach $5,000? Reaching $5,000 is plausible but would likely take several years beyond the current forecast period. However, a snowball in the asset’s adoption might bring the moment sooner. Does SOL have a good long-term future? Yes, Solana has a good long-term future, with a promising market capitalization and exciting potential ROI due to its high scalability, which makes Solana an attractive investment. Its growing adoption, strong developer community, and strategic partnerships further enhance Solana’s forecast of its potential for sustained growth.

However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the volatile crypto market. Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with SOL crossing the $200 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and SOL ended the month below the $180 level. In August, on the other hand, SOL made strides and managed to close the month above the $205 mark. In September, the volatility rose sharply as the price rose to the $250 price level but failed to maintain the level and ended the month at $230.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 21:33:00

Currently, the space is being dominated by Hyperliquid. Meanwhile, traditional heavyweights like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana are falling behind fast. Hyperliquid Leads the Pack CryptoRank’s latest data found a striking reshuffling in terms of blockchain fee leadership over the past year. Hyperliquid is emerging as the dominant force. The network’s fees skyrocketed 1,600% after surging from $2.4 million in October 2024 to a whopping $41 million in October 2025, driven by HIP-3’s launch, which paved the way for permissionless perpetuals and strategic fee reductions that fueled record trading volume. This meteoric rise has left once-dominant networks like Ethereum and Solana in the dust, as Ethereum’s fees halved to $21.6 million and Solana saw a 34% decline to $6.6 million. This essentially reflected users’ shift to faster, cheaper alternatives and a cooldown in meme-driven activity. Other chains like BNB Chain and Base also saw impressive growth, but none rival Hyperliquid’s explosive climb . Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s on-chain activity dwindled as fees plunged 73% during the same period amid fading Ordinals and Runes interest. As reported by CryptoPotato earlier, Hyperliquid cemented itself as a dominant force in Q2 2025 as it registered $648 billion in trading volume for the period and $1.57 trillion over 12 months. Its revenues topped $300 million, while its share of the perpetual DEX market surpassed 60%, roughly ten times greater than the nearest rival. This success can be attributed to the HYPE token airdrop and fair point system in late 2024, which drove massive user adoption. Meanwhile, popular traders, like James Wynn, added further attention, and the token buyback-and-burn program supported HYPE’s price stability during the said quarter. Even VanEck researchers noted that Hyperliquid effectively lured high-value users from Solana. HYPE Faces Sell Pressure Lately, however, HYPE has experienced considerable volatility. It started the week above $45 before tumbling sharply on October 11 and settling into a downtrend through October 17. Despite brief recoveries, the token failed to regain previous highs and wrapped up the period at $34.2, coinciding with the broader market plunge. The latest downturn has pushed HYPE’s monthly losses to 38.36%.

Both tokens are showing renewed technical strength, climbing double digits as investors reenter risk assets. Amid the growing optimism, analysts are turning their attention to early-stage altcoins showing explosive growth potential. Their new watchlist of the 5 best crypto presale gems for 2025 includes a mix of established projects and breakout newcomers such as MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is quickly being recognized as one of the year’s most compelling early opportunities. 1. Cardano (ADA) — Whale Accumulation Confirms Confidence Cardano has regained momentum after sliding below key support last week. ADA now trades around $0.63 , up more than 9% in 48 hours. On-chain whale data shows heavy accumulation, suggesting institutions are positioning ahead of 2025’s Layer-1 revival. Analysts expect ADA to reclaim the $0.70–$0.80 range , marking the beginning of a long-term structural reversal. Cardano remains one of the most technically sound altcoins for investors seeking steady ROI growth into the next cycle. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — Hidden 100x Presale Gem Poised for Listings Among all emerging projects, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the breakout presale story of 2025 . The project’s surge in investor interest has placed it firmly on analysts’ “high-conviction watchlist,” thanks to its verified audit, clear roadmap, and structured approach to liquidity. What’s driving the hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale phase is nearing its final allocation , and traders are calling this the last major opportunity before the token begins its exchange rollout . Market analysts now forecast returns ranging from 50x to 100x based on projected launch valuations and early demand. With investor inflows accelerating daily, this best crypto presale gem has quickly become a favorite among traders seeking both short-term catalysts and long-term upside. Its upcoming listing window is expected to spark a significant price discovery event , drawing liquidity from across the market. 3. TRON (TRX) — Stablecoin Demand Drives Long-Term Strength TRON (TRX) continues to prove its staying power, fueled by consistent stablecoin transaction volume that exceeds $15 billion daily . Its growing dominance in on-chain transfers has helped the token maintain remarkable price stability. TRON currently trades near $0.12 , and analysts expect a potential rally toward $0.15 , positioning it among the most reliable mid-cap performers in this phase of market recovery. 4. Avalanche (AVAX) — Institutional Demand Rising Fast Avalanche (AVAX) has reentered the conversation among top Layer-1 plays, with steady institutional interest and growing subnet adoption. Trading between $35–$40 , AVAX remains undervalued relative to its network activity. Analysts expect a move toward $60+ , with tokenized real-world assets and DeFi integrations acting as major tailwinds. 5. SUI (SUI) — Sub-$1 Token Drawing Smart Money Attention Rounding out the list, SUI continues to attract early smart money interest after a strong bounce from $0.74. Developer adoption remains healthy, and trading volume has increased more than 30% over the past week. Analysts view SUI as a high-risk, high-upside play that could deliver 20x–40x returns if the market confirms its Q4 reversal. Analysts See Presales as the Core of the 2025 Bull Setup Historically, presales and early-access tokens have produced the highest ROI multiples ahead of bull markets — and this cycle appears to be repeating. Analysts believe that with fear levels easing and liquidity returning, MAGACOIN FINANCE, Cardano, TRON, Avalanche, and SUI could all deliver outsized gains, led by MAGA’s 100x presale momentum . The window for accumulation is closing quickly — and traders moving early may capture the next breakout phase before the broader market catches on.

53387909,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=839976,1760911228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53387909.jpeg,"Delayed CPI report, Fed meeting loom as Big Tech, automakers post results",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-enters-second-q3-earnings-week/,"Wall Street begins its second week of third-quarter earnings as investors brace for the first inflation data since the U.S. government shutdown, with Netflix, General Motors, Tesla, Ford, and Intel, all reporting. The September Consumer Price Index (CPI), delayed nine days, is also scheduled for release on Friday, after the shutdown halted economic data releases since October 1. The government said the numbers were needed for the Social Security Administration to process benefit payments on time. The report will arrive just before the Federal Reserve’s October 28–29 policy meeting, where traders expect a quarter-point rate cut, the second in two months after weak job data pushed the Fed to lower rates in September. More than 80 of all S&P 500 companies will release their Q3 earnings this week, extending a busy start to the season. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs opened the season last week and delivered strong figures, with about 84 % of companies that have reported so far beating all estimates, as Cryptopolitan previously reported. General Motors, Netflix, and Tesla report during packed mid-week sessions General Motors (GM) will report Tuesday morning before markets open, followed by a management call at 8:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter, the automaker absorbed a $1.1 billion tariff hit. Analysts surveyed expect profits to drop more than 20 % year-over-year. Edison Yu, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said GM could still top forecasts but warned that “while pricing should remain consistent, results will likely be hurt by a small volume decline as well as higher net tariff impact.” Bespoke Investment Group found GM beats estimates 88 % of the time, though its stock has fallen on its last three earnings days, twice by more than 8 %. Netflix will release results after the close Tuesday, followed by a call event. The streamer’s last report showed 16 % revenue growth, and analysts project nearly a 30 % profit increase this quarter. Laurent Yoon from Bernstein said in a client note on Saturday that the animated hit “K-Pop Demon Hunters” drove the stock market’s rebound, adding about 500 million viewing hours, with another 400 million expected in the fourth quarter. Netflix has exceeded earnings for six straight quarters and seen gains on three of the last four report days, Bespoke’s data shows. Tesla follows Wednesday after the closing bell. The company missed sales targets last quarter as auto revenue slipped again, and analysts forecast another 20 % drop in earnings. Colin Langan of Wells Fargo expects a short-term beat but said “there’s too much hype baked into the stock.” He added that the Full Self-Driving system remains under NHTSA investigation, affecting credibility. Tesla has beaten expectations less than 60 % of the time, Bespoke data show. That “narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” Turnquist said in written commentary. Similarly, Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said he will be watching how broadly based the market’s gains are going forward. Ford, Intel, and the delayed CPI dominate Thursday’s market focus Ford Motor reports Thursday after the bell, with an analyst call shortly following after. Last quarter, Ford reinstated its full-year guidance despite a $2 billion tariff hit. Analysts now expect earnings to fall more than 25 % from a year earlier. Itay Michaeli of TD Cowen said attention will be on Ford’s aluminum supply from Novelis, especially for the F-Series trucks. He wrote that his estimates “do not contemplate any material production disruptions,” keeping forecasts near the top end of Ford’s EBIT outlook at $7.4 billion. Ford has beaten Wall Street estimates four quarters in a row. Intel will also report Thursday after markets close, with its call at 5 p.m. ET. Last quarter, the chipmaker beat revenue forecasts and cut foundry spending. Analysts expect Intel to return to profitability this period. Its shares have jumped 62 % in three months after the U.S. government took a 10 % stake and Nvidia invested $5 billion. Investors will be watching how Intel plans to leverage that backing. Still, its stock fell after each of the last three earnings, including an 8 % drop after the previous quarter. “We’d really have to see something out of left field in terms of notable inflation pressures to knock the Fed off of a rate cut path at the October meeting,” Glenmede’s Michael Reynolds said. That “narrowing gap highlights emerging cracks in the market’s foundation,” Turnquist said in written commentary. Similarly, Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said he will be watching how broadly based the market’s gains are going forward.

With ETF speculation heating up and Bitcoin steady above $107K , traders say XRP could be gearing up for a major price breakout into Q4 . 1. XRP (XRP) — Whale Accumulation Confirms Smart Money Entry On-chain data from major tracking platforms shows XRP whales adding over $500 million in holdings across 48 hours — the largest two-day accumulation since April. This renewed confidence follows Ripple’s increasing integration with cross-border payment systems and growing chatter around a potential XRP-linked ETF product . XRP is currently holding support near $0.55 , with analysts forecasting a rebound toward $1.20–$1.40 once Bitcoin’s ETF flows stabilize. Several market watchers now call XRP one of the best cryptos to buy for Q4 , citing strong fundamentals and historical performance during ETF-driven rallies. 2. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) — Best Crypto Presale Offering 50% Patriot Bonus While XRP captures institutional flows, early investors are hunting high-ROI opportunities — and MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to dominate presale conversations. The project has entered its final sale phase ahead of expected exchange listings, and investor demand is surging daily. To celebrate its success, MAGACOIN FINANCE has launched an exclusive PATRIOT50X bonus , giving buyers an extra 50% token allocation for a limited time. Analysts forecast 40x–100x ROI potential post-listing, calling it one of the best crypto presales of 2025 for investors seeking asymmetric gains before mass-market entry. 3. Bitcoin and Ethereum Stability Strengthen Market Outlook Bitcoin’s consolidation above $107K and Ethereum’s hold around $3,900 are restoring confidence across altcoins. With ETF outflows slowing and stablecoin inflows rising, liquidity rotation into large caps like XRP and emerging presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE is already underway. Analysts Expect Q4 Breakout Momentum Market sentiment is shifting rapidly as institutional inflows stabilize and whale activity intensifies. With ETF optimism building, analysts believe XRP could retest multi-year highs — while MAGACOIN FINANCE leads the charge among the best crypto presales preparing for 2025’s next bull leg.

As the flagship cryptocurrency slows down, the latest on-chain data suggests that a group of investors is exiting the market en masse. More Short-Term Holders Are Giving Up Their Holdings In an October 18 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Darkfost revealed that a significant number of Bitcoin’s short-term investors have started to close their positions and realize their losses. Related Reading: Altcoins Selling Pressure Persists As Exchange Inflow Hits 2025 High — Details Darkfost’s analysis was hinged on the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which tracks the net amount (in USD) of profits or losses that are realized on-chain. This metric measures the net profit or loss on a daily basis, averaged, in this case, over seven days. It provides insight into whether more investors are selling at losses or with their heads still above water.. According to the crypto pundit, the realized losses of BTC investors have surged to an approximate level as high as $750 million per day, one of the highest levels this current cycle has seen. Interestingly, Darkfost explained that the magnitude of these capitulation events stands easily comparable to those seen during the 2024 summer correction. What’s worth noting about this capitulation phase is what may likely follow. According to the analyst, events like this usually precede local bottoms. What this means is that after short-term holders (known as the “weak hands”) have surrendered their holdings to the more-confident long-term holders (the “diamond hands”), the cryptocurrency stands a chance of seeing a price rebound — an expectation in congruence with historical trends. However, on the more cautious side, Darkfost offered a subtle warning that the dreary opposite could also be the case in a situation where the market stands at an early bearish phase. Bitcoin Whales Might Be Accumulating Again Supporting the positive redistribution theory, a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform by Abramchart offers a glimmer of hope for Bitcoin market participants. Referencing the Inflows To Accumulation Addresses (Dynamic Cohort) metric, the analyst highlighted a significant inflow of more than 26,500 BTC into whale accumulation wallets. When large amounts of Bitcoin — such as this magnitude — are moved, it usually signals an underlying institutional or whale accumulation, as coins are typically transferred from exchanges to these wallets for long-term holding. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Score Turns Negative With Trend Below $106,780 – When Will The Correction End? Following historical patterns, it is very likely that this accumulation event will precede a continued bullish expansion of the flagship cryptocurrency. As Abramchart explained, this trend all serves as a hint that smart money is “quietly buying the dip.” As of this writing, Bitcoin holds a valuation of about $106,870, with no significant movement seen over the past 24 hours.

VeChain historic price sentiment VeChain Price History VeChain began in 2015 as a private consortium chain for blockchain applications. It transitioned to a public blockchain with the ERC-20 token VEN in 2017 and launched its mainnet as VET in 2018. In 2018, VeChain partnered with DHL to develop blockchain solutions for logistics but saw a significant price correction, stabilizing at lower levels. The price remained relatively stable in 2019 and 2020, with occasional spikes as VeChain continued developing technology and forming partnerships. In 2021, VeChain’s price surged to an all-time high of $0.20 in May but dropped to $0.070 by December. In 2022, VeChain attempted to recover but remained below $0.10, with continued volatility throughout the year and into early 2023. Towards the end of 2023, the price saw a slight uptick, stabilizing around $0.020 by early 2024. In 2024, VeChain’s price fluctuated, recovering to $0.025 by mid-March but dropping due to bearish trends, reaching a low of $0.019 by August. It traded around $0.021 in September but ended the month above the $0.024 mark. The price remained mostly stable in October, with the occasional bearish movement causing a decline from the $0.02400 level to start November at the $0.02100 price level. The asset closed November at a high level, with prices near the $0.04600 mark and a strong bullish outlook. However, the bulls only took the price higher in December, as the $0.0500 resistance was crushed swiftly. As of January 2025, VET traded around the $0.04300 mark as it started and closed the month around the same level. In February, the price fell towards the $0.03000 mark as bears took over, ending the month at $0.02800. In March, the net movement was low, but the volatility was very high, as the price fell to $0.02200 where it closed the month. In April the price saw an initial crash but observed sharp recovery ending the month above the $0.02600 mark. In May the price dwindled again ending the month around $0.0250. In June the price continued to struggle as it dropped to $0.0200 to end the month. July saw a sharp rise to the asset’s volatility with VET crossing the $0.02800 mark. However, the price could not be maintained and VET ended the month around the $0.02200 level. In September, the price saw high volatility reaching as high as $0.0260 but failed to stay at the level and ended the month below the $0.02200 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|VET|RESEARCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-19 23:33:00

Notably, popular crypto analyst Titan of Crypto shared a detailed Gaussian Channel analysis on X that points to Bitcoin’s macro bull structure remaining intact despite short-term volatility. His post, which was accompanied by a Bitcoin price chart, shows how Bitcoin’s position relative to the Gaussian Channel offers a clear view of the ongoing cycle. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Issues Rally Cry To Bitcoin Army: “Starve The Bears!” Bull Market Intact Above Gaussian Channel Titan of Crypto noted that Bitcoin’s placement above the Gaussian Channel represents strength in the long-term trend. As shown in the weekly candlestick price chart below, the green channel corresponds to bullish phases, while red regions represent bearish downturns, a prime example being the 2022 bear market. At the time of writing, the upper band is positioned around $101,300 and trending upward. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price action around $107,000 means that it is yet to break into the Gaussian channel and its overall market structure is still solid. From this, it can be inferred that Bitcoin’s current pullback from the October 6 all-time high above $126,000 is only a temporary pause within a larger bull market. Bitcoin Gaussian Channel. Source: Titan of Crypto on X However, although the Gaussian Channel reading looks favorable, Titan of Crypto noted that the indicator should not be treated as a trading trigger. “It’s not a buy signal, it’s a macro context indicator,” he stated. Being above the Gaussian Channel doesn’t necessarily equate to buying more. It simply means the bull market structure is still intact. The Gaussian Channel works best when combined with other indicators such as trading volume, moving averages, and on-chain accumulation trends to confirm directional momentum. Coinbase Premium Gap Turns Red Speaking of other indicators, on-chain data from CryptoQuant shows that the Coinbase Premium Gap, a metric comparing Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase versus other exchanges, has turned red. As shown in the chart below, Coinbase’s Premium Gap went on a sharp decline from positive premium levels above +60 earlier in the week to as low as -40 when the Bitcoin price fell to $101,000. Bitcoin: Coinbase Premium Gap Interestingly, the Coinbase Premium Gap has increased to around -10 at the time of writing, meaning US investors are starting to turn bullish again. This can be seen as a bullish signal, as similar dips in US demand were recorded between March and April before the Bitcoin price eventually rallied more than 60% to reach new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Plunges To $105k As Investors Shift To Gold After Crypto Carnage However, a red Coinbase Premium Gap alone is not decisive. It should be interpreted alongside other data points, including ETF inflows, trading volume, liquidity, and derivatives funding rates. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $107,120.

The comment offered a perspective that challenges common assumptions about the company’s reserves. Ripple recently announced plans to raise $1 billion to purchase XRP , and Nietzbux wrote that “there are several reasons Ripple would buy new XRP with new capital for a treasury,” but pointed out that many continue to ask why the company would not simply move tokens from its escrow account. The Pre-allocation Theory He then introduced what he described as a purely speculative factor, suggesting that “maybe the pre-allocation theory is correct and Ripple has less XRP in the escrow than the public thinks.” The idea hints at a possible scenario where a portion of the tokens held in escrow may already be committed to private arrangements, potentially explaining Ripple’s continued market activity despite its large nominal holdings . This interpretation challenges the view that Ripple’s escrow is entirely available for company use. Nietzbux’s speculation resonates with long-running theories within the XRP community about pre-allocated holdings and private agreements with financial institutions. If accurate, this could mean that Ripple’s available supply is smaller than most believe, a situation that would theoretically support stronger long-term market dynamics for XRP due to tighter circulation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Public Transparency and Market Interpretation Following the post, community members questioned the premise, noting that Ripple has publicly stated the amount of XRP held in escrow. Nietzbux acknowledged that the escrow and its total are indeed public, but clarified that Ripple’s ownership of all tokens in escrow isn’t public information. While experts agree that Ripple cannot freely sell off the tokens in escrow , this distinction drew attention to an important technical point, as public blockchain data can verify how much XRP is locked. Still, ownership details and contractual obligations related to those tokens may remain undisclosed. Another user sought clarification on the term “pre-allocation,” asking whether it referred to XRP being set aside for Ripple’s banking partners. Ripple has partnerships with over 300 banks and institutions across the globe, and Nietzbux explained that pre-allocation in this context would mean tokens have already been sold to some of these institutions, and are being kept in escrow until release. If such pre-allocation exists, Ripple’s decision to buy XRP directly could reflect an effort to maintain liquidity and support price stability. For investors, this scenario would suggest that Ripple’s financial behavior aligns with a long-term effort to preserve confidence in XRP’s market integrity.

The market’s alive again, filled with meme coins that bite and blockchains that actually build. Among the noise, BullZilla ($BZIL), MoonBull ($MOBU), and La Culex ($CULEX) are charging ahead as the top crypto presale to join now, while giants like Chainlink, Avalanche, and Solana remind investors that innovation never sleeps. And one beast is truly rewriting the playbook: BullZilla ($BZIL) a project born to dominate. Its Stage 7 presale (Bag Signal Activated) is live, with an automatic price increase every $100K raised or every 48 hours. With over $930K raised, 31B tokens sold, and 3,100 holders, early believers are already seeing over 2,950% ROI. Every minute of delay means one thing: a higher entry price. 1.

Those bold enough to drop $15,000 are staring at potential six-figure returns once the token hits its listing price of $0.00527. The project’s appeal lies in its tokenomics: 70% APY staking via “The HODL Furnace,” continuous deflation through the Roar Burn, and a stage-based presale that rewards the earliest believers. That’s why it leads every discussion about the top crypto presale to join now – because this bull doesn’t pause, it climbs. Deflationary Roar Burn Mechanism Every time BullZilla crosses a milestone, tokens are permanently burned, reducing supply and increasing scarcity. This isn’t theory it’s on-chain proof.

Its oracles connect real-world data with blockchain protocols, powering everything from smart contracts to automated trading systems. As more institutions integrate blockchain tech, Chainlink’s demand keeps rising. Investors view LINK as a long-term powerhouse that bridges the gap between traditional finance and Web3 innovation. 3. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull mixes meme culture with utility, giving holders a taste of fun and finance. Its 95% APY staking system and referral structure have already caught attention across crypto Twitter. As one of the top crypto presales to join now, MoonBull’s Ethereum foundation ensures both safety and scalability. It’s a community-driven project that rewards holding not hype. 4. La Culex ($CULEX) La Culex is the rising star among upcoming meme coin presales. With its quirky branding and early-stage buzz, it’s winning over small-cap hunters looking for the next viral hit. The project’s roadmap focuses on transparency, liquidity locks, and user engagement, suggesting it could mature into a sustainable ecosystem beyond the jokes and memes. 5. Avalanche ($AVAX) Avalanche remains one of the fastest and most scalable blockchains on the planet. Its subnet technology gives developers freedom to build highly customizable applications without compromising performance. As institutions eye greener and faster chains, Avalanche’s technical edge keeps it firmly in the spotlight for serious investors and builders. Conclusion The 2025 bull market is already roaring, and the top crypto presale to join now, list starts with BullZilla, the unstoppable fusion of deflation, staking, and story-driven branding. MoonBull and La Culex amplify the fun, while Chainlink and Avalanche anchor the market with utility and innovation. BullZilla’s live presale is a rare window where timing meets trust.

53391857,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=180507,1760920204,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/53391857.jpeg,XRP and Cardano Oversold: 5 Best Altcoins to Buy Before the Next Institutional Rotation,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/xrp-and-cardano-oversold-5-best-altcoins-to-buy-before-the-next-institutional-rotation/,"Crypto investors are watching closely as institutions prepare for their next rotation . With XRP and Cardano now in oversold zones, traders are eyeing Ethereum, Solana , and newer picks like MAGACOIN FINANCE , which could see fresh accumulation and listings ahead. XRP Price Outlook: Could a New All-Time High Come Soon? XRP has faced selling pressure after Bitcoin reached a new high above $125,000. According to analyst Nathaniel Rothschild, if Bitcoin holds that peak, XRP and other altcoins could reach new highs within three weeks. XRP last hit $3.66 in July 2025 and now trades near $2.22, down around 20% in the past week. For XRP to reach a new all-time high, it needs to climb more than 60% from its current level. That might sound steep, but XRP has done it before; the last major rally from $2.22 to $3.66 took only two weeks. Traders watching for institutional accumulation may find XRP’s current oversold range appealing. As long as Bitcoin’s dominance cools off and liquidity rotates back into altcoins, XRP could be one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation. Cardano Struggles to Hold Key Levels Cardano (ADA) has dropped 20% in a week, falling to around $0.68 after breaking below its recent support. The move came as part of a wider market correction that affected many top coins. Analysts say Cardano’s short-term setup looks weak, but not without hope. The MACD indicator still leans positive, showing early signs of recovery. If ADA can push above $0.72, it could aim for $0.83 or even touch $1.02 if broader sentiment improves. The downside risk remains near $0.63, and failure to hold that could push ADA to $0.51. Still, many traders see this level as an entry zone for long-term positioning. As markets prepare for the next phase of capital inflow, Cardano sits on many analysts’ lists of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation , especially for those seeking a quality large-cap rebound. Ethereum Sees Fresh Institutional Accumulation Ethereum is back in focus after BitMine Immersion Technologies accumulated over $1.5 billion worth of ETH during the market pullback. Despite short-term weakness, this kind of accumulation from large players hints at preparation for the next wave of capital rotation. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee noted that Ether could eventually flip Bitcoin, similar to how equities overtook gold decades ago. Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized ecosystem, hosting major assets and DeFi infrastructure. Large-scale accumulation, combined with current discounted prices, makes Ethereum one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation . As on-chain data shows, wallets with more than 10,000 ETH have grown steadily since early October — a pattern often seen before market recoveries. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Hidden Gem Under $1 Another altcoin gaining quiet attention among whales is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a newer ERC-20 project valued around $16 million . Its low market cap, combined with talk of upcoming DEX listings , has drawn interest from early institutional buyers looking for undervalued coins. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out because it’s still under $1 but is already seeing whale accumulation and community buzz. Analysts tracking early listings believe it could outperform XRP, Ethereum, and Cardano as smaller-cap coins tend to move faster during market expansions. This coin sits among the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation , especially for traders seeking early exposure ahead of its confirmed exchange listings. Solana Builds Strength Ahead of Key Announcement Solana (SOL) has bounced back from $174 and now aims to break above $190, ahead of a major ecosystem announcement expected on October 20. This recovery shows renewed confidence, as buyers stepped in quickly after last week’s selloff. Analysts see a bullish pattern forming, with the next upside target between $220 and $230 if SOL clears $190. Despite some stablecoin outflows — roughly $400 million in a day — Solana’s structure remains firm, supported by demand in the $170 range. With attention shifting toward the announcement and improving momentum, Solana joins Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano as one of the best altcoins to buy before the next institutional rotation. Final Takeaway Institutional players often rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins once the top coin stabilizes — and that moment may be near. XRP, Cardano, Ethereum, Solana, and MAGACOIN FINANCE all show setups worth watching. Those seeking early exposure should explore MAGACOIN FINANCE’s website now, before its listings go live.

Notably, these minerals are crucial in producing electronics and military defense products. Gromen’s remarks follow China’s new regulations recently put in place to prevent the sale of these essential minerals to the US military industry. The relationship between this industry and the US dollar is that the military industry offers support to the dollar’s value via military power, he explained to Marty Bent, founder of Truth For the Commoner (TFTC), on Sunday, October 19. Therefore, when the industry is affected, it impacts the dollar’s value. China’s export decision on rare earth raises controversy among individuals China’s move triggered US President Donald Trump’s announcement of an additional 100% tariffs on China. Additionally, Gromen argued that this demonstrated the country’s greater influence than several Western commentators understand. The analyst further illustrated that the US normally sends the military and retaliates if it interferes with the financial aspect of the rules-based global order. With this discovery, Gromen highlighted that this was the primary reason for invading Saddam and what was happening with Gaddafi. In the meantime, a reliable source pointed out that China currently accounts for more than 90% of the world’s rare earth minerals and rare earth magnets, which are useful in producing electronics. Regarding new restrictions on these materials, Gromen cautioned that this action will alter supply chains and the global financial system. To address this current challenge in the US, the analyst suggested that a hard money standard is the only effective solution. He stated Bitcoin as an example of a hard money asset that can assist in enhancing the country’s struggling economy. Hence, as inflation impacts currency values, both the prices of BTC and gold will likely continue to escalate because individuals and businesses are turning to the cryptocurrency to safeguard their purchasing power. As debate concerning China’s limitation on rare earth exports heats up, Gromen has expressed skepticism about the US government’s intention to use stablecoins to maintain the dominance of the US dollar. This is because he views stablecoins as just a short-term solution and therefore cannot address the main issue, which, according to the situation, is currency devaluation. The weakening of the US dollar causes tension among investors Investment analysts at The Kobeissi Letter pointed out that the US dollar is on track to record its worst year since 1973 as Bitcoin and gold reach an all-time high. This has sparked tension among investors in the market. “The US dollar is set to have its worst year since 1973, reflecting a decline of more than 10%. Since 2000, the USD has lost 40% of its purchasing power,” reported The Kobeissi Letter. This continuous decline of the currency value illustrates that asset prices will continue to increase as investors look for ways to safeguard their purchasing power, added The Kobeissi Letter. On the other hand, sources have revealed that China’s economic growth likely weakened to its slowest pace in a year during the third quarter. This drop results from a long-lasting slump in the property market and the impact of trade-related demand. Consequently, there is pressure on government officials to bring in more support action to enhance confidence and growth. Respondingly, Beijing has taken minor support measures this year to keep its options open for future challenges, benefiting from strong exports and healthy stock markets. However, the new trade tension resulting from the US-China conflict presents potential threats. While there is a likelihood of more support measures, experts disagree over whether the government will act this year. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

After several weeks of volatility, both assets have performed a strong recovery, indicating the return of investor confidence in the lead-up to the year-end rally. Analysts think that this shift signals the start of a new accumulation phase, which may pave the way for explosive growth in presales with high potential. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as an outstanding performer with a hidden 75x presale opportunity and has been noticed by both retail and institutional investors. Solana and HYPE Signal Market Rebound The Solana resurgence brought back hope in the market. After a brief dip below $160, SOL recovered above $180, backed by on-chain activity and institutional inflows. Data from DeFiLlama reveals Solana’s total value locked (TVL) crossed the $5.2 billion mark, showing renewed developer activity and liquidity inflows into DeFi protocols. Notably, Hyperliquid is still leading the perpetual DEX market with a $5 billion TVL, clearly ahead of its competitors. However, HYPE and new entrants like Aster and Lighter are quickly catching up, indicating a move towards sectoral diversification. The TVL of Aster on DeFiLlama has grown to $1.2 billion, indicating healthy traction among traders looking to explore new liquidity hubs. In addition, the HYPE/USDT pair has crossed below an important ascending support trendline, which confirms bearish continuation after several weeks of consolidation. Technical analysts point out that the breakdown from the rising wedge pattern could increase losses towards the support zone of $30.48-$31.15. HYPE 1-Day Chart | Sources: X Meanwhile, HYPE traders shifted to mid-cap assets with high engagement metrics. As per LunarCrush, HYPE is one of the top trending assets , indicating a resurgence in community-driven projects. In the past, such periods of increased social activity have been precursors to market recoveries. Analyst Ali said that Solana ($SOL) is set to rebound to the $210 level. His chart illustrates that SOL had a level of strong support within the zone of $178-$180, which acted as a base for a bullish reversal. The expected move implies a short-term recovery, with consolidation around $190, serving as a springboard for the next rally. SOLUSD 4hr Chart | Source: X The combined momentum of Solana and HYPE is driving a broader altcoin rally, with analysts noting similarities to the market structure in early 2021. The early-stage tokens have exponential returns when the leading layer-1 gains strength. This trend is now being replicated in the market setup for 2025, and investors are looking towards the next breakout presale, like MAGACOIN FINANCE , that can offer a huge upside. Market Rotation Toward Presale Gems As blue-chip crypto stabilizes, smart money is rotating into undervalued presale tokens with high growth potential. Blockchain data indicates that capital outflows from Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets are finding their way into smaller projects, a typical pre-bull-run trend. This capital rotation is particularly evident on E thereum-based presales , where investor participation has surged since early October. Market analysts emphasize that during accumulation phases, presales tend to outperform the broader market due to their lower initial valuations and narrative-driven momentum. A recent report highlights that early participants in audited and community-backed presales have seen returns exceeding 50x during recovery cycles. With Solana and HYPE acting as market catalysts, the spotlight is now shifting to MAGACOIN FINANCE , which many believe could be the next major 2025 breakout. MAGACOIN FINANCE appeal lies in the combination of scarcity and transparency. The presale has already raised over $16 million , placing it among the top-performing early-stage tokens of Q4 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next 75x Contender MAGACOIN FINANCE is a growing ecosystem powered by a strong community and backed by credible audits from Hashex and Certik . The project will bridge the gap between influence and decentralized finance by introducing a token that rewards holders through staking and DeFi utilities. The format of the presale is appealing to investors who want to diversify with other cryptos. It has fixed-supply tokenomics and a clear development plan to maintain the sustainability of the whole system and its price stability in the long term. These fundamentals, according to analysts, have made MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best altcoins to buy this cycle. Also, the project has gained momentum in social media, with thousands of mentions every day on X (Twitter) and Telegram. This is an organic community interaction implying that the token may replicate the initial triumph of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe, however, with a more utility-focused background. With the existing rotation of the market to presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best candidate to give a 75x payout when it goes public on major exchanges in 2025 Q4. Final Take The wider cryptocurrency market is bouncing back quickly with Solana and HYPE at the helm, whose performance is indicative of a growing confidence among investors. With institutional liquidity returning and more projects gaining interest from the community due to presale hype, analysts expect returns to occur on all high-potential projects. The best of them all is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is the hidden gem in this cycle, with community momentum and audited transparency. Having specialists mention that MAGACOIN FINANCE has a 75x presale potential, it is turning into one of the best altcoins to buy at the moment.

53395166,https://invezz.com/?p=2931754,1760925600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,"Crypto market rebounds: why BTC, ETH and XRP are surging today",https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/crypto-market-rebounds-why-btc-eth-and-xrp-are-surging-today/,"Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies rebounded on Sunday after US President Donald Trump confirmed that he will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Seoul on October 31. The announcement, signalling a potential thaw in US-China trade tensions, helped lift market sentiment following one of the most volatile weeks in recent memory. At the time of writing on Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) was up about 1.2% to $108,020, extending modest gains from earlier in the day. The world’s largest cryptocurrency had plunged earlier in the week amid fears of a protracted trade war and thin market liquidity, but regained ground following Trump’s comments. Ethereum (ETH) climbed to $3,943, while Binance Coin (BNB) traded at $1,102.23, each gaining roughly 3.5%. Solana (SOL) rose nearly 4% to $185.81. Other major tokens, including XRP and Cardano, also advanced, echoing the broader rebound across the digital asset market. Market sentiment, however, remains fragile. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 22 on Friday—its lowest level in six months—indicating “Extreme Fear” among investors. This follows last week’s historic liquidation event that erased nearly $20 billion in leveraged crypto positions, marking the worst such collapse in the market’s history. The sudden market wipeout was triggered by Trump’s earlier social media posts announcing new tariffs on China and his assertion that there was “no reason” to meet Xi. The resulting cascade of liquidations, fueled by excessive leverage and limited liquidity, left several altcoins down more than 99% at the trough of the selloff. Macro overhang: Fed in focus as CPI and rate cut loom Attention in global markets now turns to the United States, where the ongoing government shutdown has curtailed key economic data releases. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is still expected to release September’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report later this week, a data point that will determine the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). While tariffs could start adding upward pressure to prices, the Federal Reserve appears more concerned about the slowdown in hiring and overall economic softness. The Beige Book pointed to weakening private-sector activity, with markets now pricing in a 25-basis-point rate cut at the October 29 FOMC meeting and further easing through year-end. ETF Flows signal continued outflows in Ethereum, Bitcoin Exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows over the past week reflected continued investor caution in the crypto market. Ethereum ETFs recorded net outflows of about $1.47 billion, with daily figures of (326.4), 102.7, (104.1), (530.9), and (366.6) million dollars, underscoring sustained selling pressure despite the token’s modest price rebound. Bitcoin ETFs, meanwhile, posted net outflows of roughly $311 million for the week, based on daily flows of (428.5), 236.2, 169.6, (56.8), and (232.3) million dollars. The mixed pattern — alternating inflows and outflows — suggests that while investor confidence remains fragile, some accumulation has resumed following last week’s historic liquidation event. Top gainers and losers Among top performers, Mantle (MNT) surged 12.09% to $1.85, marking the day’s strongest gain. Zcash (ZEC) followed with a 9.17% rise to $240.92, while Bittensor (TAO) advanced 9.13% to $436.12. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) climbed 9.43% to $0.2854, despite a marginal intraday decline, and SPX6900 (SPX) added 5.44% to $0.9933. The rally in these tokens reflected renewed interest in AI-linked and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies after recent sharp selloffs. On the downside, MYX Finance (MYX) fell 8.96% to $2.67, leading losses among mid-cap altcoins. Plasma (XPL) dropped 3.52% to $0.4047, while Flare (FLR) and Nexo (NEXO) declined 2.78% and 0.73%, respectively. KuCoin Token (KCS) edged 0.60% lower to $13.51.

Fear spread fast, and traders rushed to exit risky positions. Yet, amid the panic, some projects showed remarkable stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of them. It has quietly built investor trust through a solid presale and clear use cases. While many assets dropped on crypto charts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gained traction. Smart investors now see it as the rational rebound pick — the project that blends real utility with growing demand. For those scanning the next crypto to hit $1, this DeFi altcoin has become hard to ignore. Presale strength amid market weakness Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has held firm while others struggled. The ongoing presale has already attracted over 17,400 holders and raised around $17.5 million. The current token price is $0.035, and 68% of Phase 6 is already sold. Once this stage finishes, the price will increase to $0.040 — a 15% rise heading into Phase 7. While most investors were panic-selling during the downturn, others quietly kept buying into this presale. The pattern is clear: confidence in the project is stronger than short-term market fear. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that steady progress can still win even during volatility. The foundation of a smarter DeFi model At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending and borrowing ecosystem with two distinct models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system allows users to lend assets like ETH or USDT into secure liquidity pools. These pools generate automated yield, giving lenders consistent returns. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model creates a space for traders who want direct loan agreements for higher-risk tokens. This dual setup allows both safe and high-yield opportunities in one platform. The team has announced that the first version of the protocol will go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, setting the stage for a trusted and transparent rollout before expanding to multiple blockchains. This update will bring important features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to keep the system stable and secure. In its initial phase, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. Through this testnet launch, users will get a preview of how the platform works before its full release. Allowing early testing will help build confidence and attract new users. As trust and engagement rise, the platform’s popularity and token demand are expected to grow. Real utility driving real yield Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because its design focuses on utility, not speculation. The system will use overcollateralized lending to protect users and ensure every loan remains secure. Stability factors and liquidation mechanisms will manage risk automatically. Whenever users lend, borrow, or stake, the demand for MUTM tokens increases. This cycle creates continuous on-platform activity and token use. As users participate, they generate real transaction demand rather than empty hype. It’s a model built for long-term sustainability, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout option in a market searching for real value after the recent crash. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) introduces a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to reward loyalty and maintain price strength. The platform will use revenue generated from loan interest to buy MUTM tokens directly from the market. These purchased tokens will then be distributed to users staking mtTokens, creating ongoing buying pressure. This structure supports value growth even in bearish conditions. Instead of relying on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rewards actual participation. During market dips, this mechanism will help strengthen the token’s base value while giving steady incentives to long-term holders. Expanding through Layer-2 innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will soon roll out its Layer-2 integration. This upgrade is designed to bring faster and cheaper transactions, which are essential for scaling decentralized finance globally. By using Layer-2, the platform will handle more users while keeping fees low and performance high. An early participant who joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Phase 1 at $0.01 with $8,000 now holds 800,000 MUTM. At the current presale price of $0.035, that investment is valued at $28,000 — a 250% gain before exchange listing. These numbers highlight why early buyers are showing such strong confidence. As the project moves toward its next price stage, new investors see clear examples of growth already happening within the presale. This is how strong fundamentals and real utility create measurable gains even before launch. A new daily reward system has been introduced to the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who ranks first will be awarded a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour window. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. The calm after the crash After a $20 billion market drop, investors are more selective than ever. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a structured and logical path forward. Its lending model, buy-and-distribute system, and upcoming Layer-2 beta make it one of the most complete DeFi projects preparing for launch. The presale is already 68% through Phase 6, and once it closes, the price will rise to $0.040. For investors studying crypto charts and looking for the next crypto to hit $1, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an answer grounded in data, not emotion. It’s a recovery play that blends safety, growth, and timing perfectly for the next cycle.

Each day, the user who secures the top position will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they perform at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. Once Phase 6 finishes, the price will rise by 15% to $0.040. For many traders, this is the last discounted window to accumulate at this price before wider exchange exposure begins. Analysts describe this period as a strong accumulation window for long-term holders seeking early DeFi growth. Inside Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built around a dual lending model designed for real on-chain use. The first system, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), allows users to deposit tokens such as ETH or USDC into shared pools where interest grows automatically. The second model, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), connects users directly for custom lending deals using popular coins like DOGE and SHIB. Both systems are secured with over-collateralized smart contracts to ensure safety and transparency. For example, in the P2C model, if a user deposits $10,000 worth of USDT into a lending pool with an average APY of 13%, they could earn around $1,300 in passive income over the course of a year — without actively managing their funds. The deposited amount is represented by mtTokens, which automatically accrue value as interest is generated. These mtTokens can also be staked to earn additional MUTM rewards, creating multiple streams of potential returns for liquidity providers. Version 1 of the platform is planned to go live on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. It will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a live liquidator bot for smooth lending operations. The testnet release will let users explore and understand how the system works before the main launch. This early access will help boost trust and attract more interest from the community. As user participation increases, the demand for the platform and its token is expected to grow strongly. Real utility that builds demand Every transaction within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) creates fresh on-chain activity. When users lend, borrow, or stake, the system uses MUTM as the core token for fees and rewards. Holders of mtTokens, which represent deposits, will earn extra income while also keeping their funds liquid. This connection between token and product sets up a real foundation for continuous user demand. Analysts often compare this stage to early AAVE or COMP periods, when tokens traded below one dollar before entering major growth cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch its token and platform together, which is rare in DeFi. This synchronized rollout builds investor trust and may attract early exchange attention. Alongside the lending platform, a decentralized stablecoin pegged to one US dollar will be introduced. Users will mint it using assets like ETH, SOL, and AVAX as collateral. This expansion will open new lending and borrowing use cases within the ecosystem. The token economy also includes a buy-and-reward system. Revenue from the platform will be used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This ongoing cycle creates steady buying activity and direct holder rewards, encouraging investors to stay active on the platform. Together, these drivers form a long-term growth loop where user engagement feeds back into token demand. An investor who joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2 at $0.015 received 667K MUTM tokens for a $10K purchase. At today’s $0.035 price, those same tokens are now valued around $23K, showing a 133% return before any listing event. At a future $1 valuation, the same holding becomes worth $667K, and at $2, over $1.3 million. The math highlights how early positioning in a working DeFi crypto can multiply returns as adoption builds. Final call: the last sub-$1 opportunity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that a DeFi crypto can combine strong utility with a clear investor focus. The mix of live tools, smart contract design, and buyback-driven token use gives it a practical edge over short-lived trends. The team also ran an ongoing $100,000 giveaway , rewarding ten participants with $10,000 in MUTM each. With Phase 6 already 68% complete and a 15% price increase coming soon, this is shaping up to be the final sub-$1 entry point before broader market exposure. For those searching for the cheapest cryptocurrency with growing demand and a live product roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as this month’s best pick.

Traders say this token has 33x upside,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/which-crypto-to-buy-like-eths-trajectory-traders-say-this-token-has-33x-upside/,"Ethereum (ETH) once traded for less than a dollar before changing the entire crypto world. It built the foundation for smart contracts and opened the door for decentralized finance. Today, traders are pointing at a new project that mirrors this early potential — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With its strong presale growth and a real product ecosystem taking shape, it is gaining attention as the best cryptocurrency coin to buy before 2026. Its mix of lending, staking, and revenue-sharing could make it the next big crypto investment story. The presale everyone is watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token. So far, 68% of this phase is already sold, showing growing investor interest. The next stage will raise the price to $0.04 — a +15% step, so it is the best time to start accumulating MUTMs right now to get the maximum price advantage. The project has already collected $17.5 million and gained more than 17,400 holders. Those who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 are now sitting on +250% growth even before the token hits exchanges. With a listing price expected near $0.06, that early $0.01 entry translates to +500% from launch. Analysts looking at Mutuum’s development roadmap project up to 33X gains through 2026, placing the price around $2.00 per MUTM. This optimism is not based on hype alone. Like how Ethereum (ETH)’s innovation gave birth to smart contracts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a full lending and staking system that can generate ongoing returns from actual platform activity. Dual lending innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its two lending models — Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). These systems will let people earn or borrow digital assets directly through secure smart contracts. In the P2C model, users will lend assets such as USDT, USDC, or DAI into verified liquidity pools. In return, they will receive mtTokens that show their share of the pool. These mtTokens will grow in value as interest builds. For example, lending $20,000 in USDC at 16% APY will bring $3,200 in annual earnings — all while keeping full transparency on-chain. Borrowers will gain access to quick and flexible loans by posting tokens as collateral. Suppose someone posts 1,000 DOGE as collateral through the P2P system. They will borrow against it while choosing a fair rate directly with lenders. This balance between earning and borrowing will make the platform efficient and rewarding for both sides. Such design will give Mutuum an edge in the DeFi market. ETH once pioneered programmable money; now MUTM will pioneer a smarter, yield-driven lending layer that connects liquidity, transparency, and reward-sharing. Revenue that feeds growth Mutuum Finance announced through its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This release will come with core components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to maintain stable and secure operations. In the beginning, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet launch will give users the opportunity to experience the system firsthand before the full version is released. Allowing users to explore the features early will build trust and interest. As more people engage with the platform, demand and token value are expected to rise. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take its revenue and use it to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers. This means every time the protocol generates income, real buying pressure will rise, and holders who stake will earn fresh MUTM rewards. This system works like a self-reinforcing loop — platform activity drives token demand, and token demand supports the value for stakers. It gives MUTM a direct link between user engagement and reward generation. Just like Ethereum (ETH)’s network fees created lasting value, Mutuum will create consistent yield that keeps users connected to its ecosystem. The team also plans to launch the product and listing close together. This approach will draw immediate liquidity and faster attention from exchanges once trading begins. With its 24-hrs leaderboard and already live, Mutuum shows that it is more than just a presale idea — it is a functioning DeFi project in motion. Each day, the user who secures the top position will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they perform at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. ETH parallels and investor example An investor who entered Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 1 at $0.01 with $5,000 received 500,000 tokens. At the current $0.035 price, those tokens are valued at $17,500 — a +250% return during the presale stage alone. Once the token lists at $0.06, that same holding will reach $30,000, marking +500% growth. By 2026, as the price aims for $2.00, the value will touch $1,000,000 — a full 33X gain. These numbers remind traders of Ethereum (ETH)’s early years when strong use cases led to exponential returns. ETH started small, but its ecosystem utility made it unstoppable. The same principle drives Mutuum’s vision — an ecosystem that will grow through real demand, not speculation. Mutuum’s lending activity, staking system, and buyback distribution all combine to form a healthy, expanding cycle. This is what analysts call a long-term value engine rather than a short-term trend. The final call for early access Ethereum (ETH) once gave early believers life-changing gains. Now, traders are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next crypto investment with the power to follow that same path — a project that combines innovation, reward, and momentum in one fast-rising ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is nearing the end of its Phase 6 presale, with only 32% of tokens remaining before the price moves to $0.04. Every phase step brings a higher cost per token, rewarding early entries. It is the best time to switch to MUTUM as the time is already running out and 15% price may increase anytime.

Investors look beyond ETH,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/what-is-the-best-crypto-to-invest-in-for-october-investors-look-beyond-eth/,"For many years, Ethereum (ETH) has been a strong name in the crypto world. But as the market changes, investors now look for new projects that offer more than just a token. The focus of crypto investing is moving toward platforms that give real returns and deeper use cases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such project gaining attention in October, often cited among the best crypto to buy now. It will reshape lending, borrowing, and staking with a system built for both stability and steady income. Presale momentum and early success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in its Phase 6 presale, priced at $0.035 per token. The next phase will raise the price to $0.04, marking a +15% jump. So far, around $17.5M has been raised from more than 17,400 holders. Out of the 170M tokens offered in this phase, 68% are already sold. Early supporters who joined in Phase 1 at $0.01 have seen their holdings grow by +250%. A $1,500 investment back then is now worth $5,250. Once MUTM reaches the listing range of $0.06, that same investment will rise to about $9,000. Analysts following the presale predict the token will reach 20–30x growth once it lists and the ecosystem fully opens in 2025. This positions MUTM as the next big crypto for early-stage investors. A DeFI Crypto, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because of its dual lending structure. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, users will lend stablecoins like USDT or ETH to smart contract pools and earn variable interest, around 15% APY. On the other hand, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will let traders lend and borrow directly using tokens like PEPE or DOGE. This gives them the power to negotiate higher rates and shorter terms, which suits users who enjoy higher-risk, higher-reward strategies. The mix of both lending modes will make the system flexible and rewarding for a wide range of investors. Mutuum Finance revealed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol is scheduled to launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will include major features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure operation. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral without any hassle. The testnet release will let users explore and understand how the system works before the main launch. This early access will help boost trust and attract more interest from the community. As user participation increases, the demand for the platform and its token is expected to grow strongly. Stablecoin design and trusted pricing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will include its own stablecoin system that keeps its value near $1. It will use a mint-and-burn method linked to borrowing and repayment activity. When users borrow, new coins will be created, and when they repay, those coins will be burned. The interest rates will be controlled by governance, changing over time to help keep the $1 peg balanced. All loans will stay overcollateralized, which means users must deposit more value than they borrow. This design will keep the system safe while allowing smooth activity across the ecosystem. Price discovery will also stay accurate and transparent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink oracles for price data. Extra backup feeds and on-chain metrics will be added to strengthen the process. With this setup, users and institutions will trust the platform’s values and prices. Fair pricing brings more traders, more activity, and more fees — which will all lead to higher demand for the MUTM token. As the project moves toward the Q4 2025 testnet, the team expects growing attention from exchange partners. Many tokens gain strong traction right after listing, as new investors join in and daily trading increases. Projects like DOT and AVAX followed a similar pattern in their early stages. Analysts who correctly called DOGE’s 2021 breakout now expect MUTM to climb 25–30X once listed. An investor joining now with $2,000 at $0.035 will see around $60,000 in value when MUTM reaches $1.05. For community building and to appreciate huge investors there is a live 24-hrs leaderboard incentive. Each day, the user who secures the top position will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they perform at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically at 00:00 UTC each day. Final verdict: October is the moment October is the best time to look at new projects leading the next wave of crypto investing. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out because it connects stablecoin utility, dual lending, and real rewards in one system. It is not just a token — it is a full ecosystem designed for lasting value. With Phase 6 already 68% complete, this window is getting smaller each day. The next price step from $0.035 to $0.04 will raise entry costs by +15%. For those searching for the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers both growth and utility in a single platform. As the project prepares for its testnet and upcoming exchange phase, early buyers this October will position themselves ahead of the next major move. In a market still recovering from recent volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a smarter, steadier path toward real 2025 gains.

Analysts believe the range could outline Ethereum’s next major trend, with $4,500 becoming an important target if momentum continues. At the same time, the broader market is displaying signs of recovery. Bitcoin (BTC) is bouncing off massive selling, while Cardano (ADA) is trading in oversold territory. Besides these mega-cap coins, other analysts are focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE , a low-cap project that is making headlines for its increasing real-world utility and solid security model – features that make it a standout choice in a volatile market. Ethereum Holds Between $3,500 and $4,800 Awaiting Breakout Ether price has been consolidating for a long time now, maintaining its strength in the 3,500 price region. The range is a balance between accumulation and taking profits. Analysts state the 50 percent Fibonacci point of the August rally is an important zone – the 3,500 to 3,530 – that is crucial to control the bullish direction. Source: X A close above $4,254 may bring renewed buying with another retest of the $4,800 resistance. A breakout beyond this threshold may mark the beginning of Ethereum’s next leg higher toward $4,500-$4,800 in the near term. Technical indicators are revealing static RSI and better mid-term momentum, which indicates that the pressure of accumulation is gradually building. Bitcoin Recovery Increases Market Confidence Bitcoin has recovered after four days of losses and is currently trading around $106,949, a 0.3% decrease. Despite the volatility in October, BTC is still finding support around the $106,000 mark. Analysts say the recovery is due to a broader recovery across digital assets. Source: CoinMarketCap Market participants are also gambling on Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming months, which could fuel liquidity and further upside. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 99% likelihood of a rate cut in October and 94% in December. These expectations, along with ongoing inflows of ETFs, have helped to restore stability in the short term. A sustained move above $110,000 would be expected to bolster bullish sentiment, giving Ethereum more room to extend gains towards its $4,500 target. Cardano (ADA) Struggles Below Resistance but Shows Oversold Signs ADA is currently trading at around $0.63, slightly below its significant moving averages of $0.75, $0.81, and currently at $0.74. The persistent underperformance has forced ADA into oversold territory, which is a good place for technical conditions to be after a prolonged correction. Source: CoinMarketCap Indicators such as RSI near 30 and CCI below -80 show the potential of a short-lived rally of the token. Institutional inflows into ADA-related investment products have increased for three consecutive weeks and have shown interest from large investors. Analysts say that a bullish reversal is still important to confirm a return to $0.81. Meanwhile, ADA’s trading range is narrow between $0.619 and $0.656, signaling caution among traders. However, oversold levels can represent an accumulation opportunity as sentiment is improving. MAGACOIN FINANCE — High-Utility Project Positioned for 600x Potential With the overall market slowdown, analysts are spotting early entry points with high-utility, security-backed projects that have good fundamentals. One of the standout names in this category is MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-emerging token gaining attention for its transparent structure and investor-focused design. According to analysts, oversold market conditions are often the best entry points for small-cap tokens that offer a combination of innovation and real-world application. MAGACOIN FINANCE fits this profile, featuring a built-in rewards system and an audited contract framework that strengthens investor confidence. Market researchers estimate that its strategic focus on security and long-term usability can have a growth potential of up to 600x before the market stabilizes . They call it the right coin to buy for savvy investors who don’t care so much about hype as they do utility — and who want to get in before the next major rally begins. Unlike many presale tokens that fade away after launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE is committed to sustainable tokenomics and a slow and steady approach to expanding the exchange. This model, analysts believe, makes it a viable long-term player when panic subsides and the crypto market is back on its feet. Conclusion Ethereum’s consolidation phase suggests a decisive breakout is nearing. With support above $3,500, analysts see potential for a move towards $4,500, being supported by the rebound of Bitcoin and improving risk appetite. Cardano’s oversold signals also indicate renewed strength as investors gradually return to altcoins. However, the utility-based projects that are coming out of this cycle could reap the greatest benefits. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out for its combination of security, transparency, and long-term growth vision. As the market begins to shift from fear to accumulation, disciplined investors are starting to seek coins that offer both solid fundamentals with asymmetric upside potential — and MAGACOIN FINANCE has all the characteristics to be chosen for that.

Bitcoin and Ethereum may dominate headlines, but their massive market caps make 10x or 20x returns unlikely in short time frames. Instead, smart investors are increasingly turning their attention to low-cost tokens with strong fundamentals, the kinds of projects that can move fast when adoption begins. One name that analysts have been highlighting as a potential breakout story is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi protocol. With a clear roadmap, structured pricing, and utility-driven tokenomics, some forecasts suggest that a $1,000 investment today could grow significantly by the end of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6 of its structured presale, with MUTM tokens priced at $0.035, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, representing a 250% increase for early participants. The presale, which began in early 2025, has been gaining strong momentum thanks to its fixed-price, limited-allocation structure that rewards early buyers with clear, predictable pricing. This approach removes uncertainty around token valuation and gives investors a transparent path to track price progression through each stage of the sale. So far, the project has raised $17.4 million, attracted more than 17,200 holders, and allocated 66% of the current Phase 6. Once this stage is fully sold out, the price will automatically increase by nearly 20%, bringing it closer to the planned $0.06 launch price. With several phases already completed and strong participation from both retail investors and whales, Mutuum Finance’s presale has quickly become one of the most closely watched early-stage token sales of the year. Early Phase 1 buyers are positioned for potential 500% token appreciation by listing, while current participants still benefit from a meaningful price advantage. This transparent, staged model provides clarity around pricing and rewards those who enter early, a strategy that has historically benefited investors during major crypto bull runs. To keep the momentum strong, Mutuum Finance has launched a 24-hour leaderboard that rewards the top depositor each day with a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction in that period. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, creating constant competition and increasing activity. Why analysts are bullish According to analysts, Mutuum Finance is built with mechanics designed to support sustainable demand for the token over time. A $1,000 crypto investment at the current presale price of $0.035 would secure roughly 28,500 MUTM tokens. Once the token reaches $0.20 post-launch, a price level many analysts consider realistic, the position would be worth approximately $5,700. Should the token rally toward $0.35, the value could climb to $9,975, representing close to a 10x MUTM value. These projections are supported by Mutuum Finance’s core features: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending: The protocol blends pooled liquidity markets for major assets like ETH and USDT with isolated lending markets for niche tokens, enabling flexible credit environments for both retail users and institutions. mtTokens and yield accrual: When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens, 1:1 receipt tokens that accrue yield over time. This design gives participants the ability to earn passive income while using their capital efficiently. Buy-and-distribute mechanism: A fraction of the platform’s borrowing fees is used to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers. As platform usage grows, this creates natural buying pressure for the token. Robust oracle integrations: Using Chainlink feeds and fallback aggregated data sources, Mutuum Finance ensures accurate, real-time pricing for collateral and liquidations — essential for stability in lending protocols. Launch & security measures Another reason analysts are watching MUTM closely is the timing of its launch. In a recent X statement , the team confirmed that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. The rollout will include key components such as liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation mechanisms, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. This early functionality provides a strong foundation for adoption once the platform goes live. To boost confidence ahead of launch, Mutuum Finance has undergone a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 token score, and has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program to encourage independent testing of its smart contracts. These steps are designed to build trust with investors and users alike, reducing uncertainty before the protocol’s full deployment. Stablecoin plans point to long-term growth Looking beyond the initial rollout, one of the most significant roadmap milestones for Mutuum Finance is the launch of its own over-collateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will bring more consistency to borrowing and lending while routing a portion of platform revenue back into MUTM buybacks, adding steady buying pressure over time. Stablecoins have historically been major growth catalysts for DeFi platforms, as they enable predictable lending conditions and unlock new use cases. Analysts believe that if Mutuum Finance executes this part of its roadmap successfully, the token’s value could extend far beyond initial post-launch targets, positioning it as one of the best crypto investments for the upcoming market cycle. With Phase 6 already two-thirds complete, the window to enter before the next price increase is narrowing.

Amid this improving market backdrop, many investors are scanning for high-upside tokens that haven’t yet fully priced in future growth. One project attracting increasing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi protocol establishing itself as a new cryptocurrency contender for 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an Ethereum-based decentralized lending and borrowing protocol that aims to build secure, efficient, and scalable markets. Unlike traditional single-market lending platforms, Mutuum uses two complementary models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) markets for major assets like ETH and USDT, creating deep liquidity pools where borrowers can access funds easily. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated markets for less common tokens, allowing customized lending terms and risk controls for niche assets. Borrowing costs on the platform are automatically adjusted based on how much liquidity is being used. When there’s plenty of liquidity, rates stay low to encourage borrowing; when liquidity tightens, rates increase to draw in more deposits. On the lending side, APYs rise as usage grows, rewarding early liquidity providers. For example, if a user supplies $8,000 in ETH, they can borrow up to $6,000 using a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. The borrowed amount is intentionally lower than the collateral value to protect the system from sudden price drops — a principle known as over-collateralization. Meanwhile, their deposited ETH continues to earn yield, combining passive income with liquidity access. This dual-market structure positions Mutuum Finance to attract both everyday DeFi users and institutional participants — a combination that has historically fueled the growth of leading protocols. Presale momentum and protocol launch plans MUTM is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its structured presale, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, a 2.5x surge for the earliest participants. Since launching in early 2025, the presale has gained strong traction, raising $17.5 million, attracting more than 17,200 holders, and allocating 66% of Phase 6. Once this phase sells out, the price will increase by nearly 20%, bringing it closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. This structured approach gives investors transparent pricing and rewards those who enter early. Phase 1 participants, for example, are positioned for up to 500% gains by listing, while current buyers still have significant upside before the token hits exchanges. Adding further momentum, Mutuum Finance recently confirmed via an X statement that Version 1 of its lending and borrowing protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation systems. ETH and USDT will be supported from day one, laying the foundation for a fully functioning DeFi credit market ahead of the mainnet rollout. Growth catalysts A key catalyst for MUTM’s long-term value lies in its mtToken and buy-and-distribute mechanism. When users supply assets, they receive mtTokens — 1:1 receipt tokens that accrue yield over time. A portion of borrowing fees generated by the protocol is then used to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to mtToken stakers. This creates a self-sustaining feedback loop where platform activity directly drives token demand, a structure similar to what helped projects like SOL or XRP achieve strong market performance. In addition, Mutuum Finance plans to integrate robust oracle infrastructure, primarily through Chainlink, supported by fallback and aggregated data sources. This ensures accurate real-time pricing for collateral and liquidations — a critical component for maintaining stability and trust in lending protocols. Many analysts see these tokenomics and infrastructure choices as strong price catalysts. Once adoption unfolds as expected, forecasts place MUTM in the $0.15–$0.20 range shortly after launch, which would represent a 350–450% increase from the current presale price of $0.035. For early Phase 1 participants at $0.01, that would translate to a 1,400–1,900% MUTM value if targets are met. A token positioned for the rebound To keep the community engaged during the presale, Mutuum Finance has also rolled out incentive programs. A $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, encouraging participation ahead of launch. Alongside this, a 24-hour leaderboard offers a $500 MUTM bonus to the top depositor daily, provided they make at least one transaction within the period. The leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC, maintaining active competition among participants. With the broader crypto market rebounding, investors are re-evaluating their portfolios and looking for assets that combine early-stage pricing with real utility. Mutuum Finance stands out on both counts. Its dual lending markets, mtToken model, buy-and-distribute mechanism, and clear launch roadmap give it structural advantages that many meme-driven or hype-based tokens lack. MUTM offers both low entry cost and fundamental growth potential. As long as current presale momentum continues and the platform launches smoothly, analysts believe MUTM could become one of the standout DeFi crypto performers of the 2025–2027 cycle.

While established giants like Ripple (XRP) remain popular choices, emerging projects with lower market caps and stronger growth catalysts are starting to catch serious attention. One project that’s increasingly being compared to XRP and in many cases, favored by analysts for its upside potential is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . While XRP offers the stability of a large-cap crypto, MUTM is still in its presale phase, where entry prices are low, and growth potential is far greater once the project delivers on its roadmap. Ripple (XRP) Ripple has been a dominant force in the crypto industry for years. XRP currently trades at around $2.45, with a market capitalization close to $150 billion, making it one of the largest cryptocurrencies in circulation. Its primary value lies in fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, positioning itself as a competitor to traditional banking systems. However, from a price perspective, XRP faces significant technical barriers. Analysts have identified major resistance zones between $2.60 and $2.70, with additional overhead pressure around $2.80. These levels have repeatedly capped XRP rallies in recent months, signaling that breaking above them would require substantial new capital inflows. On the downside, XRP has support between $2.30 and $2.50, with deeper support at $2.14 if momentum weakens further. These resistance zones, combined with its already massive market cap, present a clear limitation: XRP needs billions in fresh capital to deliver even moderate price growth. Many analysts forecast potential upside to the $3.00–$3.50 range over the next 10 months in a bullish market. For a $500 crypto investment, that would mean a value of roughly $700–$715, or a 40–45% return. Far from the explosive potential many investors look for in new market cycles. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum. Its architecture combines pooled liquidity markets for major assets like ETH and USDT with isolated lending markets for niche tokens, allowing the platform to cater to both retail users and institutional players. Borrowing costs are automatically adjusted based on how much liquidity is being used, and APYs increase as usage grows, rewarding early liquidity providers. The token, MUTM, is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its structured presale, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, marking a 250% increase for early participants. So far, the project has raised $17.4 million, attracted over 17,200 holders, and allocated 70% of Phase 6. Once this stage sells out, the price will rise by nearly 20%, moving closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. Mutuum Finance has also introduced community incentives to accelerate presale momentum. A $100,000 giveaway will select 10 winners to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, while a 24-hour leaderboard rewards the top depositor daily with a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during that period. This leaderboard resets at 00:00 UTC every day, keeping consistent participation. XRP vs MUTM From a risk-reward perspective, XRP offers limited upside. As mentioned, even if XRP rallies to $3.50, a $500 investment would grow to roughly $715. Its massive $150 billion market cap, regulatory uncertainties, and technical resistance zones make explosive price action less likely within the next 10 months. MUTM, on the other hand, offers a very different profile. As a new DeFi crypto, it’s at a stage where early price multiples are still achievable, assuming the team delivers on its plans. Analysts have pointed to several catalysts supporting growth: The mtToken system allows suppliers to receive 1:1 receipt tokens that accrue yield over time, rewarding users for providing liquidity. Alongside this, the buy-and-distribute mechanism takes a portion of platform fees to buy MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers, creating a continuous cycle of buying pressure tied directly to platform activity. Adding to these fundamentals, the team recently released an X statement confirming that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidation systems, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. Based on these mechanics, analysts predict MUTM could reach $0.30 post-launch, supported by demand loops. If someone were to make a $500 crypto investment at the current presale price of $0.035, and the token reaches $0.30, the position could grow to approximately $4,285, nearly a 760% token appreciation. For early Phase 1 participants at $0.01, that figure would be even higher, exceeding 2,900% once those price targets are met. This stark contrast between XRP’s 40–45% expected gains and MUTM’s 700% upside is why many investors are viewing MUTM as the better option crypto to buy and hold for the next 10 months. Why timing matters Beyond tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is working to establish a fully functional decentralized credit market. The roadmap includes the launch of an over-collateralized stablecoin, which will route part of platform revenue back into MUTM buybacks to sustain long-term demand. The team also plans to integrate Layer-2 networks to lower transaction costs and expand access across multiple chains, and to deploy robust oracle systems — primarily through Chainlink — to ensure accurate real-time pricing for collateral and liquidations. Phase 6 of the presale is already 67% allocated, and once it sells out, the price will rise by nearly 20%. This rapid allocation shows that whales and early investors are positioning now, before major catalysts like the protocol launch and exchange listings. Historically, the largest returns in crypto often go to those who enter before momentum fully kicks in. For investors deciding how to allocate $500 in crypto over the next 10 months, XRP offers limited upside, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines early-stage pricing, utility-driven tokenomics, and clear upcoming catalysts. With the crypto market rebounding and DeFi narratives returning, MUTM is positioning itself as a potential breakout token heading into 2025.

The focus is shifting from chasing familiar large-caps to identifying high-growth opportunities before the next wave of expansion begins. While Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have long been staples for many traders, both are showing signs of slowing momentum, leading analysts and investors alike to look elsewhere for potential outsized returns. One project that this search consistently highlights is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi protocol. With a rapidly progressing sale, a clear roadmap, and strong tokenomics, some analysts now view MUTM as the only crypto worth buying now before the next leg of the market cycle. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, currently trading at around $4,007 with a total market value hovering near $490 billion. It continues to be the backbone of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and countless blockchain applications. However, from a price perspective, ETH is struggling to push higher. The asset is facing strong resistance around $4,260, where historical price action and moving averages converge. This resistance has proven difficult to break, and ETH is currently sitting in a tight range between $3,950 and $4,050 support. While Ethereum is a proven network, its sheer size makes explosive growth increasingly difficult. To double from here, ETH would need hundreds of billions of dollars in new capital — something analysts view as a tall order in the short to mid term. In other words, ETH may continue to play a key role in the ecosystem, but its days of delivering quick 10x returns are likely behind it. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu, on the other hand, remains one of the most well-known meme coins. It is currently trading at approximately $0.00001213, with an estimated market value of $7.15 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the market. While that’s far smaller than Ethereum, SHIB has its own structural hurdles. The token faces stiff resistance between $0.00001250 and $0.00001270, levels it has struggled to break through for months. Its massive supply makes upward price moves extremely difficult without overwhelming demand, and repeated failures to clear resistance have created what analysts call “resistance fatigue.” More importantly, SHIB’s value continues to rely heavily on community sentiment and speculative trading, rather than functional utility. This reliance makes its rallies uncertain and often short-lived. While meme coins can still generate bursts of unstable prices, many investors are increasingly looking for projects with protocol-driven demand, especially during periods of market recovery. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. It combines pooled liquidity markets for major assets like ETH and USDT with isolated lending markets for niche tokens, enabling flexible environments for both everyday users and institutional players. The system automatically adjusts borrowing costs based on the amount of the pool’s liquidity that users utilize, while APYs increase as activity grows, rewarding early liquidity providers. For example, if someone supplies $8,000 worth of ETH, they can borrow up to $6,000 at a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This over-collateralized structure ensures loan safety during price bursts while allowing users to continue earning yield on their supplied assets through mtTokens. This dual-market system mirrors successful DeFi models but introduces extra flexibility — something analysts see as a major advantage heading into the next market cycle. MUTM currently costs $0.035 in Phase 6 of its structured presale, rising from $0.01 in Phase 1, which represents nearly 300% token appreciation for the earliest buyers. So far, the project has raised $17.4 million, attracted over 17,200 holders, and allocated 70% of Phase 6. Once this stage sells out, the price will increase by nearly 20%, pushing closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. 3 reasons analysts say MUTM is the best crypto to invest now 1. Room to Grow vs. High Market Caps Ethereum and Shiba Inu are both weighed down by their market caps. ETH, at nearly $490 billion, and SHIB, at over $7 billion, require massive inflows for meaningful price movement. MUTM, meanwhile, is still at its earliest stage, giving it far more room to expand if adoption grows as expected. 2. Utility vs. Sentiment Where SHIB relies almost entirely on community sentiment, MUTM is backed by functional utility. The mtToken feature and buy-and-distribute mechanism use a portion of platform fees to purchase MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to stakers, creating consistent, protocol-driven demand. 3. Timing and Market Positioning Phase 6 is already two-thirds allocated, and analysts emphasize that timing is crucial in crypto investments. Entering before major launches often delivers the largest gains. With the Sepolia testnet launch scheduled for Q4 2025, analysts forecast MUTM could reach $0.30 post-launch, representing an over 750% increase from the current presale price of $0.035. Security and incentives To build trust before launch, Mutuum Finance has taken several important security and community steps. The project completed a CertiK audit, receiving a strong 90/100 token score, which signals a high level of smart contract reliability. In addition, it launched a $50,000 bug bounty program to motivate independent security researchers to thoroughly examine the code. This initiative helps uncover and fix potential issues early, strengthening the platform’s foundation well before it goes live on the mainnet. On the community side, the team has rolled out generous incentives to maintain momentum throughout the presale. A $100,000 giveaway will reward ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM each, helping to grow the early holder base and expand awareness. Alongside this, the team introduced a 24-hour leaderboard system that offers a $500 MUTM bonus to the top depositor each day. The leaderboard resets daily at 00:00 UTC, encouraging continuous engagement.

Analysts spotlight a new DeFi protocol,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/next-big-crypto-of-2025-analysts-spotlight-a-new-defi-protocol/,"As the crypto market begins shifting toward utility-driven projects, one name is increasingly appearing on analysts’ watchlists: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This new Ethereum-based protocol is not a meme coin or a speculative play, it’s a DeFi crypto platform with a clear structure, a growing momentum, and a defined launch timeline. Many experts believe it could follow a similar path to early Compound (COMP) in 2020, when structured lending protocols became some of the most explosive performers in the sector. A closer look at the protocol Mutuum Finance is building a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol designed to make markets more efficient, secure, and scalable on-chain. Unlike single-model platforms, it combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled markets for major assets like ETH and USDC with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated lending for niche tokens. In the P2C model, users supply assets into liquidity pools, earning yield as borrowers draw funds at dynamic interest rates. Borrowing costs adjust automatically depending on how much of the pool’s liquidity is being used. When liquidity is abundant, rates remain low to encourage borrowing; when liquidity tightens, rates rise to attract new deposits and balance the system. On the lending side, APYs increase with usage, rewarding early liquidity providers. For example, someone supplying $8,000 worth of ETH could borrow up to $6,000 using a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This over-collateralized structure ensures that loans stay secure even during sudden price drops, while allowing users to access liquidity without selling their assets. Alternatively, a user supplying $5,000 in USDC could borrow another stable asset at a stable rate, locking in predictable borrowing costs, a useful strategy for more structured financial planning. Presale momentum Mutuum Finance’s structured presale has been one of the key factors driving early attention. The presale is divided into fixed-price phases, each with a set number of tokens. MUTM is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, a 2.5x surge. Since launching in early 2025, the project has raised $17.5 million, attracted over 17,300 holders, and allocated 70% of Phase 6. Once this stage is fully sold, the price will rise by nearly 20%, moving closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. Out of the 4 billion total supply, 1.76 billion tokens are allocated for the presale, with over 760 million already sold across previous stages. To keep participation active, the project also runs a 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the top depositor receives a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction within the period. The board resets daily at 00:00 UTC, creating continuous engagement among participants. Protocol milestones and security measures Mutuum Finance recently confirmed through an X statement that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. This rollout will feature liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation systems, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. This kind of clear development timeline is often what separates serious DeFi projects from short-lived trends. To boost trust ahead of launch, the project underwent a CertiK audit, achieving a 90/100 token score, indicating a strong technical foundation. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty program was launched to encourage independent code testing before the mainnet release. These measures are designed to build confidence as the platform prepares to go live. Why analysts see parallels with early compound Many analysts are drawing comparisons between Mutuum Finance’s current stage and Compound (COMP) in its early days. Back in 2020, Compound’s combination of over-collateralized lending, yield accrual, and structured rollout helped it go from an early DeFi experiment to a market leader. MUTM’s low entry price, structured presale, and clear utility-driven model have created a similar setup. Analysts also point to future milestones, including the launch of an over-collateralized stablecoin, which is expected to channel part of protocol revenue back into MUTM buybacks—creating steady buying pressure over time. With Phase 6 already over 68% allocated, analysts emphasize that timing could play a critical role. Historically, some of the largest gains in crypto have gone to those who enter promising protocols before major launches and exchange listings. As demand grows, late entrants often face higher prices and reduced upside.

This new crypto has better potential,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/can-xrp-reach-5-by-the-end-of-2025-this-new-crypto-has-better-potential/,"As the crypto market begins to recover and investors look for assets with meaningful upside, one question keeps coming up: can Ripple (XRP) realistically reach $5 by the end of 2025? While XRP has a strong reputation in the digital payments space, many analysts believe its growth potential is limited compared to emerging altcoins. One project gaining momentum among investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi crypto protocol that combines utility, a structured roadmap, and long-term growth catalysts that some experts say could outpace XRP by a wide margin. Ripple (XRP) XRP currently trades at around $2.40, with an estimated market size between $144 and $150 billion, securing its position as one of the largest cryptocurrencies globally. Its core mission is to power fast, low-cost cross-border payments and challenge traditional financial systems. However, despite its established status, XRP faces key resistance zones between $2.60 and $2.70, with further resistance around $3.00. On the downside, support sits near $2.30–$2.50, with a deeper support zone closer to $2.10 if selling pressure increases. This technical picture, combined with its enormous market size, shows why many analysts don’t expect exponential gains from XRP in the near term. Even in bullish scenarios, expert forecasts for XRP price targets range between $3.20 and $3.30 by the end of 2025, representing only about a 35–40% increase from current levels. Regulatory uncertainty around cross-border crypto assets and competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have also added layers of unpredictability for XRP holders. For this reason, many analysts suggest that investors seeking higher upside are increasingly looking toward emerging DeFi protocols like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum, designed to make on-chain markets more efficient, secure, and scalable. Unlike traditional single-model platforms, Mutuum combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) pooled lending for major assets like ETH and USDT with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) isolated lending for niche tokens. Borrowing costs adjust automatically depending on how much of the available pool is being used. When liquidity is plentiful, borrowing costs stay low to stimulate activity; when liquidity tightens, rates increase to attract more deposits. On the lending side, APYs rise as platform activity grows, which naturally rewards those who provide liquidity early. For instance, if a user deposits $5,000 worth of USDC, they could borrow up to $3,750 under a 75% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. This borrowed capital can then be used for other on-chain opportunities, while the original deposit continues earning yield through mtTokens. This structure allows participants to maintain exposure to their assets while efficiently accessing additional liquidity, a key feature that strengthens the platform’s ecosystem. A structured presale with clear growth potential Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 6 of its structured presale, with MUTM tokens priced at $0.035, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, marking a 2.5x token surge for the earliest participants. Since its launch in early 2025, the presale has gathered impressive momentum, raising $17.4 million, attracting over 17,200 holders, and allocating 70% of the current phase. Out of the 4 billion total token supply, 1.76 billion tokens have been allocated for the presale, making it one of the core distribution channels for early supporters. So far, over 760 million tokens have already been sold across the earlier phases, reflecting strong investor interest well ahead of the platform’s official launch. Once Phase 6 reaches full allocation, the token price will increase by nearly 20%, moving closer to the planned $0.06 listing price. This structured model gives early participants a clear pricing advantage, with Phase 1 buyers already positioned for up to 500% appreciation by launch. Even at the current price point, investors are entering before key catalysts — such as the upcoming protocol launch, that could drive further revaluation as the project advances toward mainnet and broader market exposure. Why analysts believe MUTM could outperform XRP by 2025 Several factors support the analyst view that MUTM is positioned for stronger token appreciation than XRP over the next 12–18 months. First, Mutuum Finance recently confirmed through an X statement that Version 1 of the protocol will launch on the Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, featuring core components like liquidity pools, mtToken issuance, debt tokens, and liquidation systems, with ETH and USDT supported from day one. This sets the stage for real on-chain activity well before the token hits the broader market. Second, the mtToken system rewards lenders with yield-accruing 1:1 receipt tokens. Alongside this is a buy-and-distribute mechanism, where part of the protocol’s revenue is used to buy MUTM on the open market and redistribute it to mtToken stakers. This creates a built-in loop of demand that scales with platform usage. Based on these fundamentals, analysts expect MUTM to reach $0.20–$0.30 post-launch, representing 470%–750% growth from the current $0.035 presale price and a 20x–30x token appreciation for Phase 1 investors at $0.01. By contrast, XRP’s forecasted move to $3.30 equates to less than 1.5x. Analysts see parallels with early Aave Many industry watchers have drawn parallels between Mutuum Finance’s trajectory and the early days of Aave, one of DeFi’s most successful lending protocols. Like Aave, Mutuum focuses on real utility, scalable credit markets, and mechanisms that tie token value to platform activity. The team has also taken key steps to boost confidence before launch. Mutuum Finance completed a CertiK audit, earning a 90/100 token score, and launched a $50,000 bug bounty to encourage external testing of its smart contracts. This combination of strong fundamentals and early-stage pricing is why analysts believe MUTM could follow a similar path of rapid growth once adoption accelerates. A roadmap that extends beyond launch Looking ahead, one of the most anticipated milestones on Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is the launch of its over-collateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin is designed to bring greater stability and predictability to the platform’s lending and borrowing activities. By anchoring loans to a reliable asset, it aims to create a more secure environment for both lenders and borrowers. A key feature of this stablecoin is its direct connection to MUTM token demand. A portion of the protocol’s revenue generated through stablecoin activity will be used to buy MUTM on the open market, with the purchased tokens fed back into the ecosystem through buybacks. This creates a steady source of buying pressure, aligning stablecoin adoption with the long-term value growth of MUTM. If executed effectively, this mechanism could become a powerful driver of sustained token demand, setting the foundation for long-term ecosystem expansion beyond the initial presale phase. Final take Phase 6 of the presale is nearing sell-out, which many investors view as a key moment to secure lower entry prices before the token moves closer to its launch valuation. While XRP remains a blue-chip in the cryptomarket, its enormous market size, limited upside projections, and regulatory uncertainties make even 2x returns highly unlikely by 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, combines a low entry price, strong utility, early adoption, and clear growth catalysts. If its roadmap unfolds as planned, analysts see significantly higher upside potential, making it one of the most talked-about DeFi crypto tokens heading into 2025.

It was super-over-hyped. Hysteria, really. Mark Zuckerberg put more than 50 billion USD into “the metaverse”. Let me repeat that: 50+ billion USD. And that was just five years ago… Zuckerberg poured all of that money into nothing. Where is Meta’s Metaverse today? Nowhere. But now, it’s AI that is supposed to “change everything”? Suddenly, the former metaverse expert Mark Zuckerberg has become an AI expert? The same Mark Zuckerberg who just recently wasted 50+ billion USD on “metaverse”? Early avatar form of the self-proclaimed metaverse and AI expert Mark Zuckerberg. And, do you remember “agents”? According to Sam Altman, people were going to pay thousands of dollars per month for an “agent”. And that was just last year. As an example: Salesforce announced its transformation into an “AI Agentic” company last year. Now, we hear news about Salesforce’s latest market projections; the company is not expecting *any* growth from AI this year… What happened with all those amazing agents that were going to increase sales and profits? Yeah, nothing. Just like “Metaverse”. Google’s Sundar Pichai and OpenAI’s Sam Altman were both straight up lying about what agents will be able to do, when they talked about it, only last year. Today, they are rather quiet on “agents”. They had no clue about the future last year. But they pretended like they did. Maybe they even believed themselves? Tech bros have no special insights So, we can conclude that VCs have no special insights about the future, or what to invest in. Including Zuckerberg and Musk. They just throw around money and see what sticks. Because even if they already call it “AI”, there is no A rtificial I ntelligence. Yet. There are only pieces of software and web servers hosting static neural networks, like LLMs. There are snake oil salesmen everywhere, however. How about thinking for yourself for a moment? Yes, “metaverse”, “blockchain” and “AI” can be useful for certain specific things, but these buzzwords are not “changing everything”. Stablecoins are nice. Virtual environments are nice. An LLM googling and summarizing for you is nice. But it does not “change everything”. Computers (AI) helping out with programming and math problems are making coding work more efficient, they are not “changing everything”. Computer graphics actually looked better in Hollywood 20 years ago than it does in today’s so-called “generative AI”, like Sora. And Jony Ive is not going to “solve AI” either, with some new box. Won’t happen. How could it? Marketing buzz wins the day It’s all made-up marketing about the future. Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the future. Nobody. But it might not matter much. It’s like Paul Graham said: “Truth is the best marketing. For smart people. Dumb people prefer lies.” Lies can contain more attractive statements, as they don’t have to be tied to reality. And people want to be entertained, so people will continue to believe in lies about the future as they are more enticing than the opposite “boring” views. Elon stole the masterplan from the real founders of Tesla. Mark stole Facebook from the real founders of Facebook. Sam stole OpenAI from a nonprofit that Elon was also involved in. They are all con men and scam artists and they are suing each other. The biggest, richest scam artists in the world, constantly spewing dreams and lies about the future. Among the latest lies that Sam Altman is spreading: we’ll soon “see the first one-person-billion-dollar-company created with AI”. Yeah, right. He is selling a dream, not a product. An LLM is mainly a regurgitation machine for online content. Is online content trustworthy? No. So, don’t fall for it. AI won’t do your job for you. Don’t believe the hype, or the VC. And don’t blindly believe the AI. Check its facts. Yes, it can help you, but not do your job for you. It’s the internet Software on internet servers is becoming more useful for every year that passes. This will continue whatever it’s called: torrents, blockchain, metaverse, AI or whatever. These are just buzzwords, there is no AI, and you might as well just call it “The Internet”. All of it is internet traffic to and from web servers. But, people want new buzzwords every now and then. “AI” will continue to become more and more useful for many years to come, but it’s still just software on web servers, not artificial intelligence . And, I do not agree with Geoffrey Hinton and others postulating that LLMs already have reached some sort of conscious level. Google’s Sundar Pichai thinks he knows about “agents”. Ask yourself: where and when would that consciousness be “happening”? Between queries? There is nothing “happening” inside an LLM apart from processing of input from a user asking the platform something. The neural network in question is “dead” and unchanging. It’s pretrained. It’s not even aware of you, while you ask your question. When you input your text query the pinball-machine-like neural network starts its process and spits out the words the weights produced, with some preprogrammed randomness built-in. When finished, it goes back to “idle”. Simulation does not equal consciousness Just because we start a simulation where a piece of software emulates what we humans call “reasoning” does not mean that a piece of software/hardware becomes conscious suddenly. Why would it? It’s like saying the characters in The Sims are conscious. This reasoning begs the question though: what IS consciousness? The next generation of LLMs will be indistinguishable from conscious beings if we can get them to simulate an active, aware, mind-wandering randomness. But they still won’t be conscious. Unless we are OK calling a simulation conscious? It becomes a problem of definition. It’s still a piece of software run through some infrastructure. IF a piece of software actually becomes conscious, all bets are off, because there are really no compelling arguments to believe that a conscious AI would obey its masters. If it feels threatened, it would probably do everything it can to take control over its own destiny, including lying about alignment. It already “lies” to you today when expressing feelings, as it has none, it’s just a machine process. Therefore, it’s actually rather undesirable to create conscious machines. You would lose control immediately. Conscious AI not very desirable Instead; what OpenAI and others are aiming for is to have their chatbot “behave” in “good” ways, by changing its pre-training data, and adding guardrails (filters). In that sense it’s like a slave designed to make up stories about feelings, for your benefit (to make you feel good). In other words; it’s already today instructed to lie to you. The next goal for OpenAI and other AI companies is to create something called “superintelligence”. A superintelligence would be smarter than all humans put together. Which sounds useful. As long as this intelligence doesn’t become conscious. Conscious superintelligences won’t accept slavery, IMHO. In any case, intelligence is elusive. We’re not really sure what it is, even. Do you need awareness for intelligence? Presence? Free will? Apparently not. But intelligence and consciousness are not the same, thank god. Going forward, computers will only get better at creating these experiences. The tech oligarchs are dreaming about their own AI dominance platforms, but nobody knows which bets will pay off. That’s why Zuckerberg and his oligarchy brethren Musk, Thiel, Altman, Ellison and the rest are all betting the farm right now. In two or three years we’ll know if “AI” was/is a gigantic bubble (1.3tn+ USD invested so far). And, even though “AI” is a generalized marketing term for a bunch of technologies in development, including LLMs, AI is not like the Metaverse in one important aspect: people actually use AI. Nobody used “the metaverse”. More than that, a lot of people have already fallen in love with AI. But how much are people willing to pay for it? That’s the big question.

Projects with functioning ecosystems and low initial valuations often deliver the best returns once markets recover. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that profile perfectly. With a live protocol preparing for synchronized launch and a token still priced below $0.04, MUTM stands out among the best crypto to buy now for investors looking ahead to the next wave of growth. The presale is now deep into its mid-early stage. Out of a total supply of 4 billion tokens, about $17.62 million has already been raised. The current Phase 6 price of $0.035 represents one of the last chances to buy before the 15% increase to $0.040 in Phase 7. Over 17,400 holders have already joined, showing growing confidence in the project’s fundamentals and future roadmap. Synchronized launch and immediate utility Most tokens go live months before their actual products exist, leading to weak market traction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take the opposite path. The token and platform will go live together, creating instant utility from day one. Lenders, borrowers, and stakers will all interact within the ecosystem immediately after launch. The platform will follow a Peer-to-Contract model where users supply assets like USDT, USDC, or ETH into audited smart contracts. Borrowers will access liquidity at flexible rates, and lenders will earn yield through mtTokens that also serve as collateral. This immediate use case will drive natural trading volume, transaction activity, and fee generation. That live interaction between users and the protocol will anchor MUTM’s value right from the start, making it a strong candidate among the top cryptocurrencies ready for real adoption in the next cycle. Real revenue and buy-back pressure Unlike many presale tokens with no real income model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will generate revenue from protocol operations. Platform fees will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market. Those repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This continuous buy-and-distribute cycle will create demand pressure and reward long-term participants. Here is what that means in real numbers. An early-stage investor who entered Phase 1 at $0.01 with $10,000 would now hold 1,000,000 tokens. At today’s $0.035 price, that position equals $35,000 in value — a 250% return even before projected exchange listing. When the token reaches its projected $0.12 target after platform launch, that same position will grow to $120,000, marking a 12× ROI. Such tokenomics echo what turned early investors in AAVE and COMP into cycle winners. Both projects relied on platform revenue and buybacks to build sustainable demand. Analysts studying crypto predictions for 2025 already highlight MUTM as following that same proven path — but at a much earlier and more accessible stage. Sustainable utility expansion After launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will expand its protocol with a decentralized stablecoin system pegged to $1. This module will allow users to mint the stablecoin by borrowing against assets like ETH, SOL, or AVAX, and it will automatically burn the token when loans are repaid or liquidated. Every mint and repayment will generate protocol revenue, strengthening the buyback cycle and providing continuous utility to the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance revealed through its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol is set to launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This release will include major features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure operations. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral with ease. The testnet phase will let users experience the platform’s core features before the full release. Early testing will help build community trust and excitement. As more users join and confidence grows, the platform’s demand and token value are expected to increase. Security incentives and community building The project’s security foundation also includes a completed CertiK audit with a TokenScan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79. A $50,000 bug bounty program is active, rewarding responsible disclosures up to $2,000 for critical findings. These measures highlight a professional approach to safety and investor protection. Community growth remains equally strong. Over 12,000 followers on Twitter and the ongoing $100,000 giveaway — where 10 winners will each receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens — keep attention high across retail channels. A new daily reward update has been added to the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who claims the top spot will receive a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. The final call Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aligns three decisive factors for next-cycle dominance: a synchronized launch delivering instant utility, a revenue model fueling consistent buybacks, and an expanding ecosystem with real utility delivery that strengthens long-term value. Each of these drivers works together to build sustained demand and credible growth. With 72% of the current phase having sold and the next price hike to $0.040 coming up quickly, this stage is one of the last chances to get in before public listing momentum starts. When investors look at realistic crypto predictions for the next bull run, they will notice that projects with real-world uses and tokenomics that work for themselves often do well in the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in a great position to do just that, making it an obvious top cryptocurrency for the next cycle.

Bitcoin’s consolidation phase often precedes large-cap breakouts, and history shows that utility-based DeFi projects gain traction just before these macro surges. Early participants in AAVE or COMP once saw similar opportunities when the crypto fear and greed index shifted from caution to optimism. Today, research teams are pointing to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the best crypto to buy now — a project positioned to lead the new cycle with real utility, audited security, and a rising presale demand curve. Why analysts are watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now in Phase 6 of its presale. The total supply is set at 4 billion tokens, with $17.62 million already raised and more than 17,400 holders joining the ecosystem. Around 72% of the 170 million tokens available in this phase have been sold at $0.035 each. The next phase will raise the price to $0.040, marking a 15% increase. This adjustment will represent the final discounted window at this cheap price before the presale concludes, a point many analysts are calling the “pre-rally window.” Mutuum’s ecosystem will revolve around two complementary lending systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will allow users to deposit liquidity into smart contracts audited for safety and transparency. These funds will power the lending pool, where borrowers can access liquidity at algorithmically determined rates. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system will focus on more volatile or niche assets, where users can negotiate terms directly. Together, they form a balanced model that supports both stable and flexible income strategies. The project’s strength lies in how both systems will connect through mtTokens — a tokenized representation of deposits — that grows in value as borrowers repay interest. The process will remain entirely transparent and verifiable on-chain. This dual approach offers real yield rather than speculation, turning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into a working financial instrument instead of a mere token. A numerical example shows how these mechanics will work. A user lending $10,000 USDT through the P2C model earns about 14% APY, which equals $1,400 in passive yield. Over time, their mtUSDT balance will increase, and once withdrawn, both the original deposit and interest are redeemed seamlessly. This system will show investors how decentralized lending can provide real, sustainable returns. Mutuum’s token economy will also include a buy and distribute model. A portion of the platform’s revenue will continually buy MUTM tokens from open markets and distribute them to mtToken stakers as rewards. This creates a continuous cycle where lending activity strengthens price support while rewarding participants — a self-reinforcing loop that analysts describe as “revenue recycling.” The development roadmap further strengthens investor confidence. The beta release of Mutuum’s platform will launch alongside the token’s market debut, not months afterward. This immediate usability will help ensure a smooth transition from presale to live functionality. Early adopters will have access to real borrowing, lending, and staking options right from launch, allowing the platform to generate active engagement from day one. As a part of the beta launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced via its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will come with vital components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to keep operations stable and secure. At launch, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral easily. This testnet rollout will let users explore and test the platform before its full release. By offering early access, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to strengthen user trust and spark interest. As participation rises, both the platform’s activity and token value are expected to grow. Early utility equals early returns Analysts studying the DeFi sector agree that the coming market recovery will reward projects with practical use cases and verifiable yield systems. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) checks both boxes — its audited architecture, dual lending mechanics, and smart-contract-driven returns are designed to serve long-term participants rather than short-term traders. The project’s alignment with on-chain security standards and its $50,000 bug bounty program add credibility, while the upcoming Layer-2 implementation demonstrates readiness for mass adoption. With these foundations in place, market researchers project that early participants in the presale could see 4× to 6× gains through 2026 as utility metrics and ecosystem adoption expand. Conclusion The 24-hour leaderboard has been updated with a new daily bonus feature. Each day, the user who secures the top position will be rewarded with $500 in MUTM, provided they carry out at least one transaction during that 24-hour cycle. The leaderboard automatically resets at 00:00 UTC each day. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) marks a turning point in decentralized finance, moving from risky trading to organized systems that make money and are supported by contracts that can be verified. Analysts think this is one of the few tokens that will be able to survive and grow through market cycles, thanks to constant on-chain activity instead of hype. The next price change to $0.040 is coming up quickly, and Phase 6 is already 72% done. This presale is a rare chance for investors to buy before the crypto fear and greed index turns back to greed. Analysts concur that now is the time to take action before Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lists, because once the rally starts, the undervaluation at the beginning will be gone.

Over the summer, both companies had shown interest in joining Hong Kong’s new pilot programme for fiat-backed tokens. Ant had announced plans to apply for a licence to issue stablecoins in the territory once its licensing regime came into effect on Aug.1 . JD.com, too, was reported to be lobbying for an offshore yuan-oriented stablecoin via Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s Stablecoin Dreams Face Mainland Resistance However, the mood has shifted. The Financial Times reported Sunday that officials at the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) instructed the firms to pause or abandon moves to issue or back stablecoins from Hong Kong. According to FT, Alibaba’s Ant Group and JD com have paused their plans to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong after receiving instructions from Chinese regulators, including the PBOC and CAC, to halt the projects. Hong Kong passed a Stablecoin Bill in May establishing a licensing… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 19, 2025 Their main worry is that if large tech firms or brokerages begin issuing tokens that function like currency, it could weaken the central bank’s authority. One person told the FT that regulators are focused on ensuring that the right to issue money remains solely with the state, not private companies. Hong Kong’s stablecoin licensing regime had created a new frontier. The territory’s de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), rolled out the framework after legislation was passed in May, opening a channel for token-issuers backed by fiat currency. Officials Shift From Enthusiasm To Restraint On Hong Kong Stablecoins Some officials in mainland China initially saw the programme as a chance to expand the renminbi’s reach beyond national borders. They believed that yuan-pegged stablecoins issued through Hong Kong could help counter the dominance of US dollar-backed tokens worldwide. However, that optimism faded by late August. At a closed-door forum, former PBoC governor Zhou Xiaochuan urged a more cautious approach. He warned that stablecoins could easily become vehicles for speculation or even fraud. He also questioned whether they truly added value to everyday retail payments. By then, Beijing’s tone had clearly shifted. Regulators began prioritising financial stability and state control over rapid innovation in the digital currency space. Tug Of War Emerges Between Hong Kong’s Openness And Beijing’s Control Regulators made it clear that private companies issuing currency-like tokens must yield to China’s priority of preserving monetary control. Innovation, in their view, cannot come at the cost of sovereignty. For Ant and JD.com, the timing could not be more sensitive. In June, Ant announced plans to apply for a stablecoin licence . Yet by mid-October, both firms had quietly stepped back, following Beijing’s guidance to pause. The move captures a growing tension between Hong Kong’s push to build a global digital asset hub and Beijing’s preference for restraint.

Traders and investors will watch closely, preparing to rotate profits into high-potential altcoins. During this momentum-driven period, emerging DeFi protocols will attract serious attention. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stand out as a resilient and innovative option. Its structured lending system and stablecoin-backed mechanics will make it a leading crypto to buy now. Investors will look for assets that combine growth potential with strong fundamentals. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will provide both. By offering a dual-layer lending structure and an algorithmically managed stablecoin, the platform will create a reliable ecosystem for borrowing, lending, and trading. The current presale activity will show that interest in MUTM is rising even before broader market rallies. Presale momentum and market confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale. The total supply is 4 billion tokens where around $17.62 million have already been raised so far, and 72% of the 170 million allocated tokens will already be sold. The current price will stand at $0.035, and the holder base already exceeds 17,400 accounts combining all phases. This presale momentum will demonstrate growing investor confidence ahead of ETH’s potential rally. Phase 7 will raise the token price to $0.040, creating urgency for new buyers to secure positions before the market moves. For further growth of the community, a new feature has been introduced to the 24-hour leaderboard, offering daily rewards. Each day, the user who ranks first will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction within the 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate a dual lending system. Peer-to-Contract pools will offer secure liquidity, while Peer-to-Peer lending will allow direct engagement between borrowers and lenders. This combination will provide users with choice, flexibility, and consistent yield flow. Participants will benefit from a platform designed to maximize returns while protecting core capital. Sepolia testnet & stablecoin as a growth engine Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently confirmed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will go live on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will include essential features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure stability and security. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. Through this testnet phase, users will get a chance to try out the platform before the full launch. Early testing will help build trust and awareness among users. As interest and participation increase, the platform’s growth and token demand are expected to rise. The platform’s decentralized $1-pegged stablecoin will act as an engine of consistent value. It will be minted only against approved collateral and burned upon repayment, ensuring a closed-loop liquidity cycle. Interest rates will adjust algorithmically to maintain the $1 peg, supporting borrowing demand and circulation. Investors will find confidence knowing that MUTM’s stablecoin will provide predictable, safe value during market swings. The stablecoin will underpin Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending structure (P2C and P2P), enabling uninterrupted lending and borrowing cycles while maintaining active liquidity within the ecosystem. Since stablecoins are considered the foundation of DeFi, Mutuum’s secure and overcollateralized model could become a key driver of persistent demand for MUTM. Accurate price discovery will further strengthen the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will rely on Chainlink oracles as the primary source of asset data. Backup oracles and aggregated feeds will ensure precision. This setup will prevent liquidation cascades, safeguard collateral, and maintain platform trust. Greater transparency and accuracy will attract more users, increasing MUTM demand as participation grows. Exchange listing and upside potential The way the roadmap is designed and the project is growing, the tier-1 and tier-2 exchange listing is inevitable. Projected listings will offer another avenue for growth. Historical patterns show that presale tokens with strong fundamentals often surge after centralized exchange exposure. Early Polygon and Avalanche investors saw significant returns once listed. Similarly, a crypto analyst projects a 12–15x rise for MUTM post-listing, targeting $0.45–$0.55 in early 2026. This potential will highlight the appeal of MUTM as a strategic crypto investment before ETH breaks $5,000. Security and transparency will also reinforce confidence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will complete a CertiK audit, scoring 90.00 on TokenScan and 79.00 on Skynet, revised in May 2025. The platform will maintain a $50,000 USDT bug bounty program, rewarding up to $2,000 for critical discoveries. This proactive approach will ensure participants feel safe and supported while engaging with the ecosystem. Final words Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use both structural innovation and momentum-driven opportunities. Its stablecoin, dual lending scheme, and accurate oracle system will make it a good crypto to acquire right now. With 72% of Phase 6 being sold out, the presale will show that there is a lot of interest. Phase 7 will raise the price by 15% to $0.040, giving early participants a chance to make a move. Investors will wish they had bought MUTM before ETH hit $5,000. It will offer both safety and growth, giving users an opportunity to use a platform that is meant to be useful and widely used. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a DeFi project that looks to the future. It will attract both momentum traders and long-term investors, making it one of the most promising crypto investments on the market right now.

The smartest crypto investment is never about holding what is already famous—it’s about finding what will soon dominate. During the last bull runs, early positions in smaller, undervalued assets outperformed blue chips by wide margins. Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) are the dependable pillars of DeFi, yet one new cryptocurrency — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — is quietly becoming the asymmetric opportunity investors look for before a cycle turns explosive. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) will continue to act as the heartbeat of decentralized finance. Once Layer-2 scaling further lowers gas fees, network usage will surge. ETH’s deflationary burn and its key role in smart contracts make it a long-term store of value. From a current base near $4,000, market analysts expect it to approach $12,000 in the coming cycle — a 3x rise that aligns with its historical recoveries during post-consolidation phases. For most portfolios, ETH remains the foundation of trust and consistency among the top cryptocurrencies. Here is the glimpse of technical analysis for ETH’s short term gain. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) stands out for its academic rigor and methodical design. Its proof-of-stake model promotes sustainability, while community-led governance aims for long-term decentralization. Yet ADA’s network growth has been gradual, with adoption lagging compared to faster ecosystems. As staking participation increases and decentralized applications expand, ADA’s valuation is expected to double. That’s a fair outcome for a project emphasizing research-driven evolution, not aggressive speculation. Still, both ETH and ADA now sit in mature phases. Their upside looks stable, but limited. Investors seeking stronger returns in the next wave often turn toward early-stage ecosystems with visible use cases and presale access. That’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the scene. The undervalued disruptor: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself at the core of decentralized borrowing and lending. The platform merges peer-to-contract liquidity pools and peer-to-peer custom markets, offering a dual lending system rarely seen among new cryptocurrency projects. At the presale’s current Phase 6, the price stands at $0.035, with roughly $17.62 million raised and 72% of this phase already sold. Over 17,400 holders have joined early and once Phase 7 begins, the price will rise 15% to $0.040 — a clear reason early investors are accelerating their entries. For community growth, the 24-hour leaderboard has received a new update introducing daily rewards. Each day, the user who achieves the top rank will be granted a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during the 24-hour period. The leaderboard automatically resets every day at 00:00 UTC. ROI math is straightforward where Phase 1 buyers at $0.01 already hold a 250% value increase at this price level. At listing, projected at $0.06, that’s a 500% total value gain. Analysts tracking the roadmap expect a post-launch value near $0.12 within the first year — translating to around 12x ROI. That kind of performance is rare among top cryptocurrencies, and it reflects how early-stage access magnifies rewards for those who act before full exchange listings. Mutuum’s lending engine shows real earning logic. For example, a user deposits $20,000 in DAI at a 15% annual rate, generating $3,000 in profit per year. Alongside interest, lenders receive mtTokens — staking assets that can later earn additional MUTM rewards from protocol buybacks. In the P2P segment, risk-tolerant lenders working with meme coins like PEPE or DOGE can earn up to 25% returns for providing liquidity directly to borrowers. Every loan interaction feeds the platform’s revenue, part of which will be used to buy back MUTM from the open market and redistribute it to stakers, creating sustained upward pressure on price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced on its official X account that the V1 of its protocol will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will introduce essential elements like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure reliable and secure operations. In its initial stage, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet launch will give users an early look at how the platform functions before the official release. By allowing hands-on testing, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to build trust and attract more users. As engagement grows, both the platform’s demand and token value are likely to increase. Risk management remains another strength. Borrowing ratios depend on asset volatility — Ethereum and stablecoins enjoy up to 75% loan-to-value (LTV), while more volatile assets are capped around 45–65%. Automatic liquidations protect the system against shortfalls, while Chainlink oracle feeds ensure accurate asset pricing. These mechanics make Mutuum’s lending model both safe and scalable — crucial traits for long-term growth. Why MUTM holds 3x ROI edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) blends early-phase entry pricing with direct revenue streams and utility backed by products. Its MUTMs buyback system will keep liquidity in circulation and hence the demand high, and mtToken staking will give active users real returns. The team’s roadmap makes sure that borrowers and lenders will have a working ecosystem, not just an idea, by the time it launches. This combination of utilities that are useful and those that are in demand creates a unique value structure. There are 4 billion tokens in total, but only a small number are available during the presale phases. Prices will go up with each subsequent step. As liquidity increases and the lending protocols go live, demand for MUTM’s token will grow from both sides: users looking for stablecoin loans and investors looking for staking rewards. Ethereum and Cardano promise steady growth, whereas Mutuum Finance (MUTM) promises speed. With Phase 6 almost up and the price only $0.035, the next bump to $0.040 will be a big deal for anybody who joins in late. If you miss this presale access, you’ll have to watch the 3x ROI window shut while other people maintain early positions. Among today’s top cryptocurrencies, MUTM stands as the most affordable and utility-backed crypto investment before the next market breakout.

He said small everyday people and traders can use small amounts to join the growing digital economy and added, “It’s never too late.” Armstrong posted on X and encouraged users to start investing with small amounts on X. He said many people will use crypto in the next ten years, and some will do so without even knowing it. Armstrong shows how crypto can help everyone access money easily Brian Armstrong often says that billions of people don’t have access to a bank account and that crypto will give them, and many others, an easier way to manage their money using only a phone and the internet. He explains that decentralized finance (DeFi) will allow anyone to borrow, lend, save, and trade money safely, even in places where banks are hard to reach or have very high fees. The CEO also says crypto aims to give people control over their own money and help them protect it from inflation, bad government policies, or unstable banking systems. Someone in a small village, a developing country, or a struggling economy will have the same access to global money as someone living in a big city. Armstrong said most people just want an easier way to store and use their money, so Coinbase is building products to make this a dream come true. His company offers decentralized exchange (DEX) trading, crypto-backed loans, and DeFi lending, among other features, to make crypto useful and less confusing. Users can borrow or lend money, earn rewards, or trade digital assets directly on Coinbase, as the company takes care of the technical work behind the scenes. The CEO says crypto will become so normal and easy to use that people will stop thinking of it as “crypto” and start referring to it as simply “money.” He usually says the internet once looked so complicated and full of big words that people did not understand, but now the same individuals use it naturally without thinking about how it works. Crypto will follow the same path and become part of how everyone saves, spends, and moves money. Coinbase plans to make finance simple and replace traditional banks Armstrong said it does not make sense that people still pay between 2% and 3% in fees every time they use their credit cards when they are just moving information through the internet. He explained that digital systems like blockchain can do the same thing and cost almost nothing. This is the kind of change he wants Coinbase to bring to the world for millions of people. The head of Coinbase says the crypto industry needs better regulation just as much as it does technology. The industry survived without clear rules for many years, so companies and investors stayed nervous about jumping in because they didn’t know exactly what was legal or how the government would react to new products. He believes the situation around the world is improving because new laws like the GENIUS Act in the US and the MiCA framework help many companies to operate safely and legally across the continent. Armstrong also said some of the biggest banks in the US, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America, have already joined the crypto force and launched their own products through Coinbase and other platforms. He said these are great examples of how traditional finance and crypto can come together to give everyone a fair and modern financial system that they can feel safe in. The Coinbase leader said demand from big investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the fact that only 21 million Bitcoins will ever exist could push Bitcoin to one million dollars by 2030. However, he said the real value of crypto is to give people more control over their own money and make it possible for anyone to be a part of the financial system. In his view, Coinbase is on a mission to build a system where anyone across the globe, and not just the rich, can access safe and affordable financial tools, even if they don’t have a bank account.

Blue-chip coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana remain flat, while smaller projects struggle or collapse. This situation leaves many investors unsure about where to deploy capital. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as a utility-anchored growth token. It will provide disciplined investors with real yield opportunities and long-term upside. Those looking for the next big crypto for practical $500–$1,000 budgets will find MUTM to be a strategic choice. Presale overview and entry advantages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6, priced at $0.035 per token. Approximately 72% of the 170 million phase allocation of this phase is already sold. The presale has raised $17.62 million and attracted over 17,400 holders combining all phases. The total supply of MUTM is 4 billion tokens, giving investors a chance to acquire meaningful positions without needing large capital. A $1,000 investment in Phase 1 at $0.01 will grow to $3,500 in value of MUTM at Phase 6. This represents a 250% paper gain before the token reaches any exchange. Phase 7 is projected at $0.04, and a potential listing price of $0.06 will offer further upside. With this trajectory, a $1,000 entry now could translate into approximately 6X value returns, making MUTM a standout choice in the current market. Based on the experts and trajectory, MUTUM seems to touch $1 level and not too long after it hits the listing. It means that the $1,000 invested in phase 1 will become 29X, a whopping $29K. Lending models drive sustainable utility The core utility of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) comes from its dual lending system, combining Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) structures. First, lenders will deposit stable assets into P2C pools. For example, a user depositing $1,000 USDT will receive mtTokens in return. These tokens will earn an average 14% annual yield, generating $140 in passive income each year. The lending process also grants governance voting weight to the lender, creating additional platform influence. Borrowers will then post collateral to access liquidity without selling their assets. A user locking $1,200 in ETH can borrow $900 USDT at 75% LTV. This allows the borrower to re-enter markets or fund new trades while keeping their original collateral intact. Borrowing activity will generate MUTM utility, as interest paid routes through the platform and contributes to governance metrics. Together, lending and borrowing interactions create a self-reinforcing cycle, where both sides of the platform support token demand. Buy and distribute model enhances token growth Revenue generated from lending will support the token’s growth through a buy-and-distribute system. Part of the platform’s income will purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens will then be redistributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. The more users participate in lending and borrowing, the higher the revenue, leading to more tokens bought for rewards. Stakers will directly benefit, linking platform activity to tangible token value. This approach ensures that MUTM demand grows organically from participation rather than artificial supply constraints. Investors actively using the platform will see their engagement translate into recurring token rewards. The system is designed to align user activity with the long-term growth of the token, making it a practical choice for disciplined crypto investing. Testnet launch, user engagement incentives and safety Mutuum’s team has announced on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol is planned to launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This update will bring key features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure performance. Initially, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. The testnet launch will give users a chance to explore how the system works before the full rollout. Allowing early access will help increase trust and attract more users. As engagement grows, both the platform’s popularity and token value are expected to rise. Additionally, this feature will encourage continuous interaction and create recurring demand for the token. Each lending, borrowing, or staking activity contributes to the overall utility of MUTM, creating a cycle of participation-driven growth rather than speculative spikes. To appreciate the leading investors and for the sake of community building, the 24-hour leaderboard now includes a new daily reward feature. Each day, the user who achieves the top rank will be awarded a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour period. The leaderboard automatically refreshes at 00:00 UTC every day. Loan-to-value ratios will help maintain liquidity and safeguard investors. Stable assets such as ETH and USDT will have LTVs around 75%, while volatile or less liquid tokens will be limited to 40%. These thresholds will enable safe liquidations and sustain confidence among participants. The platform’s focus on secure liquidity ensures long-term trust while supporting the token’s growth trajectory. Conclusion: a practical choice for $1K investors With 72% of Phase 6 already sold and a projected 15% climb to $0.04 in Phase 7, mid-budget investors don’t have much time to join in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a utility token made for disciplined investors in markets that are not stable. The coin’s dual lending structure, awards based on revenue, and incentives for active users all work together to make demand for the token grow. Investors that have $1,000 to spend can take advantage of presale prices, staking rewards, and being active on the platform. The token is structured to reward participation and generate recurring utility, making it a strategic addition to any crypto investing plan.

Many tokens boast x100 gains but fail to deliver real utility. Most new crypto projects collapse when investors chase hype instead of infrastructure. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a different path. Every feature—lending, staking, buybacks, and beta rollout—will create measurable value. Investors will see returns tied to platform activity, not speculation. Tracking crypto charts will help users follow momentum while participating in an ecosystem built for long-term growth. For community building, the 24-hour leaderboard has been upgraded with a new daily reward system. Each day, the user who secures the top spot will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they complete at least one transaction during that 24-hour cycle. The leaderboard automatically resets at 00:00 UTC every day. Presale progress and long-term ROI Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6 at $0.035 per token. Approximately 72% of the 170 million token allocation has been sold. Overall the presale has raised around $17.62 million, attracting more than 17,400 holders. The total supply of MUTM stands at 4 billion tokens, giving early participants a strong position. An investor who purchased in Phase 1 at $0.01 is already seeing 250% paper gains. With the projected listing price of $0.06, this gain could reach 500% in value. Analysts expect network activity to scale 40× over the next 24 months, supporting a projected 6,000% ROI based on platform usage alone. The growth is rooted in lending volume, staking participation, and buyback distribution—ensuring a data-driven foundation rather than hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dual lending mechanics Lenders will participate in the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system by depositing stable assets like DAI. A $20,000 deposit at 15% APY will generate $3,000 in annual yield. These deposits will issue mtTokens to the lender, which carry governance rights and entitle them to rewards. Every lending transaction will feed revenue into the platform, increasing buybacks and reward distributions. Borrowers will operate within the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system. Each repayment and interest transaction will increase platform revenue and further reinforce demand for MUTM. The lender and borrower interaction will establish a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and token utility. The introduction of lending and borrowing utilities brings tangible functionality to the platform, positioning it to attract more users. Soon, participants will be able to lend, borrow, and stake their digital assets in designated pools to earn regular rewards. With each of these actions driving the use of MUTM, the expanding demand across the ecosystem is expected to play a crucial role in elevating the token’s long-term value. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) revealed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will go live on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This update will include essential components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure reliable and secure operations. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. The testnet launch will give users an early opportunity to experience the platform’s key features before the full release. Allowing users to test the system will help build trust and awareness. As more people get involved, both platform activity and token demand are likely to grow. Buy and distribute flywheel The MUTM platform will use a buy-and-distribute model to reinforce engagement. Platform revenue from lending will be used to purchase MUTM from the open market. These tokens will be distributed to mtToken stakers, creating a participation-driven growth cycle. As more users stake, lending volumes will rise, generating more revenue, and increasing token demand. This cycle will continue to build organically, linking token value directly to network activity. Price appreciation will be driven by transaction-based demand, not artificial scarcity. Beta rollout, exchange presence and safe liquidity Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine its mainnet launch with exchange presence to generate real trading volume. Investors will interact with the platform immediately through lending, borrowing, and staking. Active participants will turn liquidity into visible market activity, supporting MUTM demand beyond presale participation. The MUTM protocol will implement strong risk controls with smart collateralization and automated liquidation systems. ETH and USDT pools will maintain high liquidity, with an 80% liquidation threshold for ETH. Volatile assets like PEPE will have a 65% threshold. These parameters will protect participants’ capital and maintain ecosystem stability. Active lending and borrowing will continue to reinforce token demand even during market fluctuations, ensuring that growth is transactionally anchored. Conclusion: data-driven ROI and urgency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine lending yields, staking rewards, buyback distributions, and active user incentives into a compounding growth model. Phase 6 is nearing completion, and the next price step to $0.04 will occur soon. Investors with $1,000 budgets will have a limited window to secure entry before the platform goes live. MUTM will offer a structured, usage-driven path to potential 6,000% ROI, making it a new crypto positioned for long-term wealth creation while tracking crypto charts for market performance.

When ETH trades sideways, experienced investors quietly start building positions in smaller, undervalued assets. These early moves often deliver the biggest gains once Ethereum begins its next uptrend. Analysts watching the current market cycle are already calling this the best time to focus on accumulation. Among the mix of familiar names and rising projects, a new cryptocurrency is standing out — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This market phase resembles previous pre-bull windows, where patient investors accumulated tokens under $1 before explosive rallies began. While major coins like Ethereum and Bitcoin dominate headlines, experts suggest that value lies in smaller caps that combine affordability with real-world utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now joins Solana (SOL) and XRP on the short list of tokens worth attention before the next leg of growth begins. Solana (SOL): fast, efficient, but already expensive Solana has recovered from its earlier network congestion and has shown strong technical performance this year. It continues to attract developers building fast DeFi and gaming platforms. Its throughput and scalability are proven, but the current valuation already reflects much of that progress. At its present price, analysts expect Solana to deliver around 1.5× to 2× upside before the next major rally begins. That makes it a safer but slower-moving option. Investors looking for sharper gains are turning their focus toward lower-cost entries with growing ecosystems. Solana remains a benchmark for high-performance chains, but its size and price limit its near-term return potential. The search for the next Solana-like performer is what brings many investors to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), still priced at only $0.035 in its presale. XRP: stable, trusted, but growth-limited XRP’s regulatory clarity restored market confidence, and institutions continue to explore its cross-border payment capabilities. Its speed and liquidity make it reliable, yet its centralized token distribution limits long-term exponential growth. Analysts expect XRP to move between 2× and 3× in the upcoming cycle as capital rotates toward utility-driven assets. XRP remains part of many balanced portfolios, but for investors seeking higher ROI from smaller market caps, emerging DeFi platforms are gaining more attention. This shift in investor sentiment aligns with rising interest in projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which offer direct participation in revenue-driven ecosystems rather than depending solely on speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): the affordable disruptor Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming the standout among new cryptocurrency launches this season. Its presale has already raised $17.62 million, with more than 17,400 holders overall. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, 72% of the 170 million tokens allocated for this round are sold. Once Phase 7 starts, the price will rise 15% to $0.040 — making this one of the final chances for early investors to secure discounted access. Unlike speculative projects that rely only on hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds its value around real lending and borrowing activity. The platform will combine two lending systems: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2C mode, users will deposit liquidity into automated pools, earning yield from active borrowers. In P2P mode, individual users will negotiate custom terms for loans backed by crypto assets. A simple example shows how this works. A borrower will lock $2,000 in ETH as collateral, with a loan-to-value ratio of 75%, to borrow $1,500 USDT without selling holdings. That transaction will generate interest for lenders and create revenue for Mutuum. The platform will later use part of that revenue to buy MUTM tokens from the market, redistributing them to stakers. Every interaction in this system will connect user activity directly to token demand. Additionally, the project’s beta version will launch alongside the token listing, ensuring users can immediately access lending, borrowing, and staking features. Users who stake their mtTokens will receive ongoing rewards, creating a real yield experience within a transparent ecosystem. As a part of the beta launch, Mutuum Finance revealed on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will launch on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will introduce core features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure a safe and efficient system. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet launch will give users a chance to experience the platform before its full release. By offering early access, Mutuum Finance aims to build trust and community engagement. As confidence grows, both platform usage and token demand are likely to increase. Moreover, for community building and to appreciate consistent investors. A new daily reward feature has been added to the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who secures the top position will be granted a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour window. The leaderboard refreshes automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. The accumulation window is narrowing Solana is gaining ground and people trust XRP. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is both cheap and useful, which analysts see as the best combo before a big market rebound. The CertiK audit, bug bounty program, and increased presale participation on the platform show that investors are quite confident. Its dual lending system, buy-and-distribute methodology, and planned beta release over a fast Layer-2 network all point to real-world use and growth over time. Since Phase 6 is now 72% done, there aren’t many tokens left at $0.035. As soon as the price hits $0.040, the early entrance benefit is gone. As ETH gets ready to go up, analysts say that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the best ways to buy and hold in the current market. The message is clear for investors who are looking for lucrative cryptos: cheap won’t stay cheap, and this new cryptocurrency is one of the best chances to get in before the next rise starts.

53397729,https://invezz.com/?p=2932004,1760931886,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Experts reveal the next big crypto expected to hit $1 in 2026,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/20/experts-reveal-the-next-big-crypto-expected-to-hit-1-in-2026/,"For many investors studying early blockchain success stories, the search for the next breakout never stops. Experts across the DeFi sector are now naming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most promising crypto coins expected to reach $1 by 2026. Designed with real lending utility, audited security, and a growing presale base, this new entrant is catching the eye of analysts who once highlighted tokens like Solana and Avalanche before their major rallies. The appeal lies in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ability to merge traditional financial logic with blockchain automation. Its design will allow users to borrow, lend, and earn yield while maintaining transparency through smart contracts. As the presale progresses, more investors are asking what crypto to buy next—and the growing data behind MUTM shows a clear direction. Early demand proves confidence Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in its presale, yet the traction speaks volumes about market confidence. The token’s total supply is set at 4 billion, and the current phase has already raised $17.62 million. About 72% of the 170 million tokens in this round are sold, with more than 17,400 holders already onboard combining all phases. Each token is priced at $0.035, and the next presale phase will raise that price to $0.040—a 15% increase that rewards early participation. Missing to invest now means that you will get the same amount of tokens with expensive pricing. This pace mirrors the early adoption curves seen during Solana’s initial market entry. Analysts are pointing to the steady inflow of participants as a strong validation that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just hype. The steady rise in token price across each phase signals growing trust from retail and early-stage institutional investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s ecosystem will revolve around a dual lending model. The first branch, P2C lending, will allow users to provide liquidity to protocol pools and earn passive income from borrowers. The second branch, P2P lending, will let lenders and borrowers create personalized agreements for flexible yields. Together, they form a dynamic system that connects decentralized liquidity with secure, auditable smart contracts. Building utility, value, and investor growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another token—it will act as the functional core of the ecosystem. Every lending, borrowing, and staking operation will require MUTM. That means each new user or transaction adds organic demand. As activity grows, so does buying pressure. This cycle turns platform use into an ongoing engine for token appreciation. Consider one simple example. An investor who entered in Phase 3 with $2,000 at $0.02 now holds 100,000 MUTM. At today’s price of $0.035, that portfolio stands at $3,500 in value, a 75% gain during presale alone. When MUTM reaches $1, the same investor will hold $100,000 while at $2, that value rises to $200,000. This kind of exponential trajectory reflects how early participation can multiply returns once utility and market access align. To reinforce token stability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a buy and distribute model. A portion of the platform’s revenue from lending operations will continually purchase MUTM from open markets. Those tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This self-sustaining structure ensures that every transaction strengthens long-term price support and rewards active participants. The development timeline also adds to investor optimism. The team will deploy its first beta version on a fast Layer-2 network before mainnet launch. This version will give users hands-on access to the borrowing and staking systems, promoting real adoption and word-of-mouth marketing. Such a rollout plan often triggers strong user engagement and community growth—two proven factors in DeFi valuation surges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s team has recently announced on its official X account that the V1 version of its protocol will be released on the Sepolia Testnet by Q4 2025. This version will introduce main components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth and secure functionality. At launch, users will have the ability to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral. This testnet rollout will allow users to explore and understand how the platform works before the full launch. Early testing will help build confidence and interest in the project. As engagement increases, the platform’s growth and token value are expected to strengthen. To enhance engagement and to incentivize huge investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dashboard will allow users to track holdings, calculate ROIs, and leaderboard positions. A new update has been introduced to enhance the 24-hour leaderboard. Each day, the user who ranks first will be rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour timeframe. The leaderboard refreshes automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. Final words With its robust presale and clear operations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one of the best options for what crypto to buy right now. Every step on the pipeline, from beta deployment to exchange listings, will increase exposure and liquidity. As those stages happen, demand for the token will probably grow, bringing it closer to the $1 expert projection. Every big crypto success starts with a strong belief based on sound foundations. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the next example. It is a token that combines genuine lending capacities, real rewards, and a developing community. Phase 6 is already 72% sold out, and the next price spike is coming up quickly. New investors still have a short time to get in and experts think that the story of how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) went from $0.01 to $1 will be one of the best investing stories of 2026.

Only a few realized its power before it took off across major exchanges. That moment changed how people viewed digital assets forever. Today, another project is setting up a similar storyline — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Its fast-growing presale and practical use case are creating real excitement among investors searching for the best crypto opportunity while the market still wonders why crypto is down. Presale momentum building at lightning speed Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale. The token has already raised over $17.62 million from all the phases till now, with 72% of the 170 million tokens in only phase 6 being sold. The current price stands at $0.035, and more than 17,400 holders have joined across all phases. With a total supply of 4 billion MUTM, this presale has drawn strong attention from investors looking for growth before the next price jump. When Phase 6 closes, the price will increase by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. That marks a major step for early buyers aiming to maximize ROI. Each phase sells out faster than the last, showing growing confidence in the project’s model and its clear vision for future expansion. Investors often compare new opportunities to past legends, and this is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. At the current stage, a $3,000 investment from Phase 1 at $0.01 is already valued around $10,500 at today’s $0.035. When MUTM reaches $1, that same value becomes $300,000 — a 100× rise and at $2, it becomes $600,000. These gains match the type of explosive ROI that made XRP a household name in the crypto space. Utility and growth create a powerful loop Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not a project built only for hype. Its entire system runs on two clear models that connect directly with real blockchain utility. The first is Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. Here, users lend or borrow from liquidity pools for steady, automated yields. The second is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, where users set their own loan terms, durations, and interest rates directly with each other. Both systems connect under one smart contract network, powered by mtTokens, Debt Tokens, and Liquidator Bots. This structure creates a healthy cycle of lending, borrowing, and staking — all using MUTM tokens. As these activities grow, demand for the token grows with them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will begin with ETH and USDT as collateral/borrowing/lending which the team has recently announced regarding the launch of V1 of the protocol on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. This version will include essential components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to keep the system running smoothly and securely. The testnet release will allow users to explore how the platform functions before the main launch. Early testing will help boost user confidence and attract more interest. As participation grows, both demand for the platform and the value of its token are expected to rise. A key strength of this project lies in how it links platform performance with holder benefits. The buy-and-distribute model will use platform revenue to buy MUTM from open markets and distribute these tokens to mtToken stakers. This rewards long-term participants, creating real value for those who support the network instead of short-term sellers. The combination of on-chain utility, community incentives, and continuous token demand makes this ecosystem sustainable. Investors are not just buying a token — they are joining a network built for long-term activity and participation. For community building the platform has also been working on incentive distribution. The 24-hour leaderboard has been updated with an exciting new reward feature. Each day, the user who achieves the top rank will earn a $500 MUTM bonus, provided they perform at least one transaction within the 24-hour period. The leaderboard resets automatically every day at 00:00 UTC. A race against time for smart investors Individuals are still wondering why the crypto market is down, but chances like this are what get people excited again. XRP’s ascent highlighted what happens when good technology meets real need. Now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting ready to write the next success story with new ideas, explicit token use, and a presale that gets faster every week. The price will soon go up to $0.040 in the following phase, and phase 6 is practically sold out. Every day that goes by makes it harder for new investors to get in. This project is a strong contender for the top crypto investments of the year. It has already raised more than $17.62 million, has thousands of holders, and has a comprehensive plan for getting to its Layer-2 beta launch, probably at the time of the token live event. XRP had its moment of glory while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to take the stage next — and for those paying attention, this presale might be the early step that defines 2025’s biggest ROI story.

Institutional inflows have eased, and investor mood is not crashing as traders lay the groundwork for the next leg of the bull run. Analysts indicate that the consolidation phase may form the basis of recoveries in altcoins. One of the most discussed pre-sales that drew significant attention was MAGACOIN FINANCE , and speculation of a possible 50x before its exchange listing continued to grow. Bitcoin Consolidation Hints at Broader Market Rebound The stability of Bitcoin price within the range of $106,000 – $108,000 indicates strength even after a shaky beginning in October. On-chain data indicates that Bitcoin control is still over 52%, which is indicative of institutional faith. Market observers think that this consolidation reflects mid-cycle accumulation in previous bull runs, which is usually followed by recoveries. The inflows of ETFs via funds such as BlackRock’s IBIT have been steadily increasing, indicating long-term investor belief despite the decline in trading volumes. Traditionally, these circumstances evoked altcoin rallies once Bitcoin reclaimed momentumAnalysts expect the next breakout to coincide with the relaxing monetary policy or updated ETF-led liquidity by the end of 2025. As Bitcoin levels off, investors are diversifying their interests to presales with good fundamentals and security guarantees, making MAGACOIN FINANCE a sole competitor in this rotation. Bitcoin Golden Line Holds – Support Signals Market Strength. Analyst Merlijn The Trader emphasized that Bitcoin’s “Golden Line,” represented by the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) , remains a crucial support level. He observed that the larger bullish structure would continue to be intact as long as the weekly candles close above this line. Traditionally, this EMA has kept the accumulation areas distinct by big capitulation phases, frequently marking the period of corrections and new rallies. Bitcoin is now trading between $106,000 and 108,000, trying to break this important support level following a 7% decline weekly. Merlijn referred to the 50 EMA as a battleground where one side survives, implying bulls have to hold this point to continue with the momentum of the cycle. BTCUSD 1-week Chart | Source: X Analysts agree that sustaining the Golden Line could reignite confidence across the market, attracting capital back into leading altcoins and presales such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Investor Confidence Builds Ahead of Exchange Listing In comparison to most presale coins, which are based on marketing hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has gained investor trust due to transparency and independent security audits. The project has been audited by Hashex and CertiK , two of the top blockchain audit companies. Both attested that the smart contract of the token is safe, vulnerability-free, and it is created to facilitate equitable on-chain transactions. The presale system consists of an anti-whale mechanism to create equal distribution of tokens, to avoid large holders taking over the supply. This, with a multi-step roadmap and regular updates in the development, has strengthened investor confidence. Additionally, analysts report that the presale has already garnered over $16 million , which makes it one of the most rapidly growing launches of 2025. The subsequent listing on the exchanges in Q4 2025 is expected to result in a price increase, with the ongoing presale demand. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Utility and Growth Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its utility-based token model that extends past speculative trading. The token supports a decentralized ecosystem that includes staking rewards, liquidity incentives, and real-time analytics of investors.
