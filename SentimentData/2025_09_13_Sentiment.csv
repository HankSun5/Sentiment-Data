Originally expected to hit the trading floor this Thursday, the REX-Osprey DOGE ETF ($DOJE) has been postponed to next week , according to Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas . Update Part 3: Another delay. Launching next week. Mid week. Prob Thur. https://t.co/Lzk2pCVo0E — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) September 11, 2025 Dogecoin ($DOGE) is gaining momentum ahead of the ETF listing, rising nearly 4% in the past 24 hours, with trading volume surging 23% to $4 billion . Over the past week, $DOGE has climbed 20.2% , signaling it may be playing catch-up with newer entrants in the meme coin space. The launch of an ETF could be a game-changer. It would allow both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through a fully regulated product – potentially triggering a fresh wave of demand across the entire meme coin sector in the near term. Dogecoin Price Prediction: $DOGE Gears Up for 200% Breakout as ETF Mania Builds The upcoming ETF launch may be the final boarding call before $DOGE takes off . The daily chart shows five green sessions out of the last six , with Dogecoin already testing key resistance at $0.26 . Price action reveals a clear pattern of accumulation , with $DOGE trading tightly between the 200-day EMA and this resistance zone. Whales appear to be loading up , positioning ahead of what could be a major breakout – fueled largely by ETF anticipation. A clean move above $0.26 would confirm a bullish Dogecoin price prediction , with the next upside targets at $0.45 , then $0.80 if momentum continues to build. And as Wall Street increasingly embraces crypto , capital is rapidly rotating into high-upside opportunities . That’s why many investors are now eyeing top presales like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – a meme coin with early-stage momentum and the kind of upside potential that could deliver 10x to 100x gains before the cycle peaks. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) Rockets Past $2M – Degens Already Loading Bags Maxi Doge ($MAXI) With Bitcoin and major altcoins hitting new highs, early-stage meme coins are back in focus – and Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is grabbing attention fast. This token isn’t here to play safe. It’s built for raw, unfiltered upside – think 1000x energy, no brakes, and full degen momentum. The mascot? A Shiba Inu on overdrive – caffeinated, laser-focused, and ready to claw its way to the top with diamond hands and zero hesitation. Here’s what makes $MAXI stand out. Up to 25% of presale funds are deployed through the Maxi Fund – capital used to buy and hold high-potential tokens during this cycle. Those who stake $MAXI during presale can also earn up to 155% APY , rewarding early holders for locking in now.

However, a recent court setback for the White House has raised the prospect that some of the money may have to be paid back. Treasury Department figures show the U.S. collected $30 billion in tariff revenue in August, bringing the year-to-date total to $165 billion. By contrast, August 2024 yielded $7 billion, with $70 billion gathered over the same period a year earlier. That puts the increase in tariff receipts this year at $95 billion. The gains could be temporary, however, if courts ultimately rule the approach unlawful and order refunds. Earlier this month, a federal appeals court found that Trump lacked authority to use the International Economic Emergency Powers Act to impose the duties at issue. The administration is appealing, sending the dispute to the Supreme Court. “We would have to give a refund on about half the tariffs, which would be terrible for the treasury,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” In a court filing, Bessent said between $750 billion and $1 trillion in tariffs could be collected by June 2026, which is when the Supreme Court is expected to issue its ruling. The justices agreed to fast-track the case, with arguments set for November. Court loss may not end tariffs completely Even if the court sides against the administration, the tariffs might not vanish, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. He wrote that the White House has other legal routes it could use to re-establish duties. Whether previously collected tariff revenue would have to be paid back remains unresolved. “Regardless of how the highest U.S. court rules, expect most of the current tariffs to remain in place,” Buchbinder wrote. Not every tariff is at stake in the case. At issue are the “reciprocal tariffs” on a range of partners and the fentanyl-related duties on Canada, China, and Mexico. Sector-specific tariffs on items such as foreign cars, steel, and copper are outside the lawsuit because they rest on a different legal basis and remain in force. The economic backdrop has grown more complicated. U.S. consumer prices rose in August by the most in seven months, driven by housing and food, Labor Department data showed Thursday. At the same time, a surge in first-time applications for jobless benefits last week left the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates next Wednesday. Together, firmer inflation and a softer job market have revived stagflation worries and complicate the Fed’s choices after Wednesday’s meeting. Trump has also said recently that the U.S would be “completely destroyed” without tariff money , as reported by Cryptopolitan. Tariffs and travel drive up prices Part of the price pressure reflects companies passing along higher costs tied to Trump’s broad tariffs, alongside a rebound in demand for travel. Visitor numbers to the United States slumped in the spring and early summer amid boycotts and the administration’s immigration crackdown before turning higher. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.4% in August after a 0.2% rise in July, the largest monthly gain since January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Housing costs rose 0.4%. Food prices went up 0.5%, with supermarket prices up 0.6%. Fruits and vegetables saw the biggest rise at 1.6%. Tomato prices jumped 4.5%, the highest since January 2020. Beef rose 2.7% in the month and stood 13.9% higher than a year earlier. Coffee was up 3.6% for the month and 20.9% from a year earlier. Tariffs likely contributed to some of these increases, while past droughts that reduced the national cattle herd probably helped push beef higher.

Trump made the comments during a Fox News interview after being confronted by protesters at a Washington, D.C. restaurant earlier this week. “Protesters get paid for their profession from Soros and other people,” Trump said. “And we’re going to look into Soros, because I think it’s a RICO case against him and other people. Because this is more than like protests. This is real agitation.” The remarks were made during Trump’s sit-down with Fox, according to the full segment broadcast Wednesday. The RICO Act (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations) is usually aimed at dismantling organized criminal networks. Trump didn’t clarify which Soros relative might be involved or name any organizations under suspicion. But this isn’t the first time Trump has called for an investigation. In previous speeches, he’s attacked Soros and “his wonderful Radical Left son,” without specifying which son. George’s son Alex Soros currently chairs the board of Open Society Foundations, one of the world’s biggest philanthropic groups tied to liberal causes. The renewed interest in launching a federal investigation follows the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a close Trump ally. Trump links political funding to financial chaos, points to Soros bets Soros has long been linked to massive financial movements. He profited from one of the biggest currency trades in history. Leading up to Black Wednesday in September 1992, Soros’s fund had sold short over $10 billion in British pounds, believing the UK’s entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism was flawed. The British government refused to raise interest rates or float the currency. The pound collapsed. The UK was forced to withdraw. Soros’s profit: over $1 billion. The UK Treasury lost £3.4 billion. Soros was believed to have traded billions of Finnish markkas in 1996, expecting the currency to drop. Finnish authorities said they saw no evidence of any conspiracy. In 1997, during the Asian financial crisis, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad accused Soros of deliberately punishing ASEAN countries for accepting Myanmar. Mahathir referenced Soros’s Jewish background during the accusations, calling him “a Jew who triggered the currency plunge.” In 2006, Mahathir changed course after meeting Soros and accepted that he had not been responsible. Soros later wrote in his book The Crisis of Global Capitalism that his fund had shorted the Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit in early 1997, with contracts ranging from six months to a year. He said they later bought those currencies to lock in gains, but moved too early, fearing Malaysia would impose capital controls, which eventually happened. Soros also tried shorting the Hong Kong dollar during that time using similar strategies. But China backed the peg, and Hong Kong’s currency stayed stable. Soros’s fund lost most of the money bet against the HKD. French court found Soros guilty of insider trading after 14-year case In 1988, Soros was contacted by Georges Pébereau, a French financier who tried to organize a takeover of Société Générale and other companies under France’s privatization program. Soros didn’t join the group but bought shares in Société Générale, Suez, Paribas, and Compagnie Générale d’Électricité. French regulators launched an investigation in 1989, but found no evidence of insider trading. The case was reopened years later. On June 14, 2006, the French Supreme Court ruled Soros guilty and fined him €940,000. Soros denied any wrongdoing, claiming the information he had was public and that he had already planned to buy the shares before learning of the takeover. He appealed the conviction to the European Court of Human Rights in 2006, arguing the 14-year delay violated his right to a fair trial under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying Soros should’ve known the risks of trading with non-public information about a takeover.

The new funding round is projected to significantly boost its valuation and potentially triple the $1 billion valuation it achieved in an earlier funding round that closed just this summer. Polymarket soars in valuation amid expansion in the US According to Business Insider, which cited two sources familiar with the issue, investor interest in the platform has surged amid indications that one investor is offering a term sheet valuing the platform at as much as $10 billion. This comes on the back of news that the platform is close to entering the US market. One of the sources revealed that the valuation is, however, still in flux. The platform’s spokesperson did not comment on the matter. The news comes as Polymarket’s chief executive officer, Shayne Coplan, earlier this month made a major announcement on the X platform that regulators had given it “the green light to go live in the USA” in a major development that would open it to an immense new user base. The company has been making several strategic moves in that regard. Last month, Donald Trump Jr. joined its advisory board, and 1789 Capital, the company where he is a partner, made a strategic investment in the company. At that time, Trump Jr. said in a statement that: “Polymarket is the largest prediction market in the world, and the US needs access to this important platform.” Partnership with Chainlink gels with the US expansion initiative Polymarket was founded in 2020 by Shayne Coplan. It allows users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events utilizing cryptocurrency. It gained attention last year during the US presidential election when its markets managed to correctly predict a victory for President Trump, a forecast that ran counter to many traditional polls. Outside politics, the platform’s markets cover a wide range of topics, from sports outcomes to pop culture events, such as the potential engagement of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift. Despite its global popularity, the platform has been barred from operating in the US until now. Polymarket’s previous financing round was led by Peter Thiel’s Founder’s Fund, which valued the platform at $1 billion and brought its total funding to $255 million, according to Pitchbook data. Meanwhile, Polymarket is gearing for a major move, partnering with Chainlink signals a push for trust and accuracy as their US strategy heats up, according to Alva on the X platform. As reported by Cryptopolitan earlier, Polymarket and Chainlink have announced an integration standard into Polymarket’s resolution process. The report further explains that this partnership will focus on enhancing the accuracy and speed of asset pricing resolutions. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

While ADA remains steadfast in its ranking as a leading blockchain asset, everyone is looking at MUTM whose 100x growth potential is attracting serious attention. Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.88 and has been oscillating between the $0.85–$0.89 levels. Analysts think that ADA can face strong upward thrust in 2025, and technical projections suggest that there is a possibility it could rise by 200%–300%, bringing its price to $2.50 if bearishness continues. This is according to whale accumulation, environment expansion, and favorable technical setups, but overall market sentiment will remain a dominant factor. With ADA’s long-term position becoming more assertive in the adoption of blockchain, attention is also shifting towards newer projects like Mutuum Finance. Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is providing investors the chance to be part of the project when it is at the initial stages of its development cycle so that they can buy the tokens at a very low price. The token is offered for one MUTM at $0.035, but in the seventh token sale phase, the token will be offered for $0.04. Presale has been extremely popular with over $15.6 million funds raised and number of token holders standing at over 16,220. Such demand places MUTM on a stable ground compared to other DeFi projects. $50,000 Bug Bounty Program The latest developments in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem include a bug hunt that will see the participants share a $50,000 USDT reward for discovering any likely vulnerabilities in its codebase. The project is active and open to the public already. The team not only has been developing the platform but is also engaged in taking care of its users and investors. Dual-Lending and Borrowing System Mutuum Finance uses a two-level lending system, a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) hybrid lending system with higher competitive edge. With P2C, the smart contracts continuously scan the marketplace to determine interest payments, investors lend at reduced interest rates, and borrowers borrow at even reduced interest costs with investors receiving their interest passively through the smart contracts. P2P makes borrowing and lending directly between the parties without an intermediary, hence a truly decentralized lending product and best suited for risky or volatile assets such as meme coins. Infrastructure and Price Discovery In order to provide accurate and timely price information, Mutuum Finance uses Chainlink oracles that cross-check token prices against widely traded assets such as USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracles, aggregated feeds, and in-chain data are also utilized throughout the platform to provide timely and precise price information. All such protocols serve as the underlying functionality of collateral pricing, risk management, and liquidation process, thereby allowing the protocol to operate effectively and remain stable independent of the varied market conditions. The MUTM presale has accelerated to $15.6M raised and added 16200+ holders, showing growing demand. With a $50K CertiK bug bounty, USD-pegged stablecoin, and two P2C/P2P lending model, MUTM brings security, innovation, and capital efficiency together.

51626306,580016,1757714450,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51626306.jpeg,Tether And Circle Inject $12.75B To The Market In 30 Days – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-and-circle-inject-12-75b-to-market-30-days/,"The stablecoin market is once again in the spotlight after Tether minted another $1 billion USDT just a few hours ago. This fresh injection of liquidity comes at a time when the crypto market is entering a volatile phase, with uncertainty surrounding both macroeconomic conditions and investor sentiment. Bitcoin and altcoins are beginning to show shifting dynamics, and stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle are emerging as critical players in shaping these movements. Large mints from Tether have historically coincided with aggressive price swings across the crypto market, as the arrival of new liquidity often fuels increased trading activity. Whether this supply is immediately deployed or gradually filters into exchanges, the effect on market psychology is significant. Traders and investors frequently view such events as early signals of potential inflows into risk assets. With Bitcoin consolidating near key levels and altcoins attempting to recover from recent corrections, the timing of this mint underscores the importance of stablecoins in the broader ecosystem. As liquidity expands, the coming days could see heightened volatility, with the possibility of strong directional moves. For now, all eyes are on how this $1 billion issuance will ripple across the crypto landscape. Tether and Circle Add Liquidity Into The Market According to data from Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have minted a combined $12.75 billion in stablecoins over the past month, marking one of the most significant liquidity injections in recent cycles. This expansion underscores the crucial role stablecoins play in the crypto ecosystem, acting as the backbone of trading activity and serving as a bridge for capital flowing into risk assets. The timing of this surge is notable. Bitcoin and Ethereum are consolidating near critical levels, and altcoins are beginning to show signs of renewed momentum. Historically, large stablecoin mints have preceded uptrends in crypto markets, as fresh liquidity provides the fuel for traders and institutions to deploy capital more aggressively. The $12.75B increase, therefore, reflects more than just stablecoin supply growth—it signals a market preparing for potential expansion. Still, risks remain elevated. Some analysts caution that the broader economic environment is highly unpredictable, with lingering concerns over global growth, inflationary pressures, and liquidity conditions. The volatility of traditional markets often bleeds into crypto, making sudden swings a persistent threat. All eyes are now on the US Federal Reserve, with investors widely anticipating a rate cut at next week’s meeting. Such a move would reinforce the bullish implications of the stablecoin surge, further boosting liquidity and supporting higher valuations across digital assets. Conversely, any hesitation or unexpected policy shift could magnify uncertainty, creating sharp volatility. USDT Dominance Suggests Risk Appetite Tether (USDT) dominance currently stands at 4.29%, showing a modest decline after testing resistance near 4.5%. The weekly chart reveals that USDT’s market share has been in a gradual downtrend since peaking above 9% in mid-2022. This decline reflects a healthier appetite for risk assets, as capital shifts out of stablecoins and into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. The 50-week SMA at 4.67% and the 100-week SMA at 5.02% are both trending lower, confirming persistent weakness in dominance. Meanwhile, the 200-week SMA at 5.78% sits well above current levels, acting as a ceiling that reinforces the longer-term bearish structure for USDT’s market share. As long as USDT dominance remains below the 5% threshold, the market backdrop favors capital rotation into risk assets. However, short-term support has emerged around the 4.2%–4.3% zone, where dominance has stabilized multiple times this year. A breakdown below this range would likely signal further risk-taking by investors, potentially fueling stronger rallies in crypto. Conversely, a bounce back toward 5% would indicate rising caution and renewed demand for stablecoins.

This acquisition follows a previous purchase of 285.42 million DOGE. CleanCore’s DOGE Push The treasury is backed by the Dogecoin Foundation and its official corporate arm, House of Doge. It was created to strategically accumulate DOGE in anticipation of growing adoption and utility. According to the official press release, CleanCore’s long-term goal is to secure up to 5% of Dogecoin’s circulating supply and position the company as a leading digital asset treasury to advance DOGE’s role in global finance. The treasury, which is securely custodied on Bitstamp via Robinhood’s platform, allows CleanCore to execute disciplined accumulation strategies while supporting broader market growth. In an official statement, Marco Margiotta, Chief Investment Officer of CleanCore and Chief Executive Officer of House of Doge, said, “Crossing the 500 million DOGE threshold demonstrates the speed and scale at which ZONE is executing its treasury strategy. Our vision is to establish Dogecoin as a premier reserve asset while supporting its broader utility across payments, tokenization, staking-like products, and global remittances.” House of Doge is developing initiatives that aim to unlock advanced real-world use cases for the OG meme coin, which the company believes will drive utility-driven demand in the coming months. CleanCore explained that these purchases are part of a carefully planned strategy to capitalize on DOGE’s expanding role in digital finance, while steadily building a strong corporate holding. CleanCore’s DOGE purchase comes amid a nearly 22% rally over the past week, as the meme coin climbed above $0.26. Market momentum is also being fueled by anticipation of the first-ever Dogecoin ETF, though its launch has been delayed until next week, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. For the uninitiated, the REX-Osprey Doge ETF, filed by Osprey Funds and Rex Shares, will hold a mix of DOGE and DOGE derivatives via a Cayman Islands subsidiary. Bullish Momentum in Dogecoin A crypto analyst called “World of Charts” believes DOGE is showing strong momentum and is currently testing an important resistance level near $0.28. According to the analyst, if the meme coin successfully manages to break this resistance, it could rally further toward $0.50 in the coming days, in a potentially sharp short-term price surge. Meanwhile, market commentator Trader Tardigrade observed early signs of increasing trading volume in DOGE on the weekly chart. According to the analysis, this uptick in volume could signal strong potential for price appreciation in the coming weeks. He also highlighted a breakout in Dogecoin’s Money Flow Index (MFI), which suggested a surge in buying pressure.

51624127,https://cryptonews.com/?p=422614,1757716200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51624127.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Pi Coin and Solana by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-xrp-pi-coin-and-solana-by-the-end-of-2025/,"China’s DeepSeek AI, often described as the country’s answer to ChatGPT, predicts strong upside for XRP, Pi Coin, and Solana as crypto markets move into the holiday season. Market momentum appears to back this outlook. Bitcoin recently set a new record at $124,128, before retreating after U.S. inflation came in above expectations. Still, the market is rebounding, with total capitalization climbing 1.4% in the past 24 hours to $4.11 trillion. On the policy front, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first U.S. law governing stablecoins with full-reserve requirements, while the SEC introduced Project Crypto to streamline compliance for blockchain companies. With regulatory clarity improving, many analysts see conditions for a potential repeat of 2021’s altcoin surge. Here’s what DeepSeek AI projects for XRP, Pi Coin, and Solana. XRP (Ripple): 3× Growth Potential, $10 Target, predicts DeepSeek AI DeepSeek AI suggests XRP ($XRP) could climb as high as $9 by late 2025, triple its current price near $3. The token boomed to new highs in July, hitting an ATH of $3.65 and surpassing its 2018 record before retracing 16.5% to its current level around $3.04. Ripple’s network of global partnerships remains a tailwind. Additionally, in 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund backed XRP for cross-border payments, while earlier this year, the SEC finally closed its dispute with Ripple, affirming that retail XRP sales aren’t securities. DeepSeek’s baseline forecast puts XRP between $5 and $10, elaborating that if U.S. policymakers deliver on their promises, spot XRP ETFs win approval, and Ripple continues to gain ground with institutions, the higher target is possible. Chart technicals also support the case: Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending upward from 57, while the appearance of three bullish flags over the year—two of them in mid-to-late-summer—suggest the possibility of an imminent breakout. Additionally, XRP has gained 465% in the last year, outpacing Bitcoin’s 98% rally, Ethereum’s 93% surge, and Solana’s 77.5% climb over the same period. Pi Network ($PI): Deepseek AI Predicts 14x for Tap-to-Mine Altcoin Pi Network has drawn attention with its mobile-friendly mining system, where users can earn PI coins with a daily tap. Now trading near $0.3543, DeepSeek AI envisions a possible rise to $5 before year-end, a massive upside scenario of 14x in less than four months. PI has been volatile since launching in February 2025, with a 171% jump in mid-May. The coin’s RSI is neutral at 48, suggesting the token is reasonably priced by the market right now and has plenty of headroom for growth. Analysts believe that if crypto markets continue recovering, PI could retest its February 2025 peak of $2.99, and possibly break higher. Even without the extreme target, a move toward $3 by year-end is likely realistic, depending on user adoption and favorable U.S. policy decisions. Solana ($SOL): ETF Buzz and Strong Fundamentals Could See Ethereum’s Biggest Challenger Hit $1,500 Finally, Solana ($SOL) remains a dominant force in smart contracts, with a market cap of $130 billion and $13 billion locked across its ecosystem. Investor excitement is being fueled by speculation over a possible U.S. Solana ETF, alongside hints from President Trump that it could be included in a proposed national Bitcoin reserve as a hold-only asset, meaning it can be held by the US government but only if sourced in the course of law-enforcement seizures. The token’s price action is also strong. After dipping to $100 in April, it rebounded to its current price of $240 and continues to climb, although it is now entering a resistance zone where it may hover for a while. Having broken out of bearish patterns earlier this year, DeepSeek AI expects SOL could eventually target $1,000 by late 2026, well above its prior $293 all-time high. As with all other important industry projects, progress on broad crypto regulation will likely be key to reaching that milestone. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): High-Risk Meme Play Beyond DeepSeek’s main picks, new meme coin Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is attracting attention as Dogecoin’s wilder counterpart. Built on Ethereum, MAXI emphasizes community-driven growth with Telegram groups, contests, and collaborations. The project has already raised over $2 million in a presale barely weeks old. Of its 150 billion supply, 25% is allocated to marketing and partnerships. Holders can stake for yields up to 155% APY, though returns will decline as more users participate. Currently priced at $0.000257, the presale will increase slightly with each funding stage. Tokens are available through the official Maxi Doge website via wallets like MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Leading the $4.11 trillion digital asset market, the original crypto Bitcoin is back on the rise again, hoping to surpass its all-time high (ATH) of $124,128 set last month. Additonally, many are hoping that the long-anticipated post-halving bull cycle may finally be starting. Investors aren’t limiting their enthusiasm to BTC, with funds spilling over into leading altcoins and even the best meme coins . Over the last year or so, projects such as XRP, TRON, Solana, Sui Network, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have all recorded new price landmarks. Two policy developments out of Washington are further fueling bullish sentiment. First, President Trump approved the GENIUS Act, the nation’s first comprehensive stablecoin legislation. Second, the SEC rolled out “ Project Crypto ,” a modernization effort aimed at clarifying securities rules for the industry. With optimism mounting, here’s a closer look at how standout tokens like XRP, Dogecoin, and Pepe could be poised for major moves. Ripple ($XRP): The Best Cross-Border Payments Crypto is Arguably the Industry’s Best Performers This Year Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) reached a new record of $3.65 on July 18, the same day the GENIUS Act took effect, topping its 2018 high of $3.40. Since then, it has settled back near $3.05, about 16% under the peak. Favored for its low-cost, rapid transactions and independence from legacy payment rails like SWIFT, XRP has earned credibility with global organizations. Both the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House have pointed out Ripple’s work, and CEO Brad Garlinghouse even joined a select group of crypto executives at a presidential roundtable this March. Momentum for XRP accelerated in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that retail sales of the token did not violate securities laws, finally resolving its long-standing clash with the SEC. Over the past year, XRP has surged 466%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 98% gain. A bullish breakout in June confirmed the asset’s technical strength, and even with today’s pullback, XRP’s price has barely moved in the past 24 hours. Currently, its relative strength index (RSI) is uptrending from 57, showing investors are now piling back into the project after last month’s US inflation figures were softer than expected. With XRP’s price converging around its 30-day moving average of $3, the token appears to have stabilized following July’s explosive rally. Bulls are eyeing a potential run toward $4 by October. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Can the Original and Best Meme Coin in Crypto Finally Hit $1? Launched in 2013 as a parody of crypto culture, Dogecoin ($DOGE) has since matured into the leading meme coin, with a market cap topping $39.4 billion and a fanbase that includes global CEOs and celebrities. The token’s breakout moment came in 2021 after endorsements from Elon Musk, Snoop Dogg, and Gene Simmons helped push it into mainstream attention. In May this year, institutional buyers re-entered DOGE, driving it back into the $0.25 range. It now trades around $0.2612, up 21% in seven days, outshining Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Shiba Inu during the same period. While technicals remain positive, DOGE’s RSI is at 67, just three points short of being “overbought”, which indicates this buying spree is likely to reach its conclusion soon. Still, with positive crypto developments expected both within the industry and in Washington, Dogecoin has still more room for upside by the end of the year, potentially climbing toward $0.50 by mid-October. Adoption is also growing: Tesla accepts DOGE for merchandise, while PayPal and Revolut are expanding integrations, strengthening its real-world utility. Pepe ($PEPE): Internet Meme Star Gears Up for Breakout Introduced in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) quickly shot into the ranks of top meme coins by market cap, riding the popularity of Matt Furie’s well-known frog character. Its rapid ascent triggered countless imitators, but none have matched its success. With a market cap now over $4.4 billion, and even a brief cameo as Elon Musk’s profile picture on X, PEPE has cemented itself as a meme coin heavyweight. Currently priced around $0.00001054, PEPE has gained 45% in the past year, though it still trades 63% below its late-2024 all-time high of $0.00002803. Chart watchers note a falling wedge formation, often seen before a breakout. With RSI around 53, Pepe is in the neutral zone, meaning buying and selling activity are balanced right now, which gives it plenty of headroom to go up in the near term. The overall meme coin sector rose 5% overnight to $85.8 billion. While PEPE dipped a nominal 0.4% in 24 hours, its 9.2% rise in the last seven days has outpaced Shiba Inu ($SHIB) and market leaders Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Supporters are betting that strong macro conditions and renewed crypto enthusiasm could power PEPE to fresh highs as summer advances. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): A Meme-Infused Layer 2 for BTC Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , one of the most hyped presales of the year, is positioning itself as Bitcoin’s first Layer 2 to combine high-speed scaling with the viral appeal of meme culture and grassroots community support. The project aims to dramatically improve BTC transaction speeds, expand functionality, and keep the development community-driven. So far, the presale has pulled in over $15.2 million, with some analysts speculating post-launch returns could exceed 10×. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER allows lightning-fast smart contracts for Bitcoin without high fees or slow settlement times. Its Canonical Bridge technology allows near-instant BTC transfers across its custom Layer 2 network, while minimal gas fees support dApps, meme tokens, and payment systems. A recent Coinsult audit confirmed no smart contract flaws, further boosting confidence. The $HYPER token fuels the ecosystem, driving staking rewards, transaction costs, and community governance. Early presale buyers are being offered yields up to 73% APY along with voting rights on upgrades. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

Analysts suggest that this powerful setup could lay the groundwork for an explosive rally, with speculations pointing toward a potential surge of over 100%. Bitcoin Price Chart Flashes Golden Cross On Thursday, crypto analyst ‘Merlijn The Trader’ declared on X social media that Bitcoin has just flashed a Golden Cross, its rarest and most powerful technical signal. The analyst described this development as a historic moment that has only occurred three times since BTC’s inception. Each past occurrence has led to extraordinary price rallies, establishing the Golden Cross as a key signal that most traders and investors watch closely. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Market Over? Pundit Warns Investors Of 30-Day Window To Take Profit Sharing a detailed price chart, Merlijn outlined Bitcoin’s trajectory after each prior Golden Cross, pointing to returns that have left an indelible mark on the cryptocurrency’s history and the market as a whole. In 2016, the appearance of a Golden Cross set the stage for a bull rally of roughly 264%, a move many saw as the opening act of BTC’s first major run into mainstream recognition. A year later, the signal reemerged in 2017, coinciding with Bitcoin’s meteoric rise of over 2,200%, culminating in the unprecedented high between $17,000 and $27,000. The third Golden Cross formation came in 2020, when BTC surged more than 1,190%, climbing from a low between $4,600 and $7,000 to roughly $69,000 by late 2021. Each instance not only marked a breakout rally but also achieved a new all-time high for the cryptocurrency. Now, in 2025, Bitcoin has reportedly triggered the Golden Cross signal for the fourth time in its history. Merlijn’s analysis highlights that this is not just a routine crossover but an ignition point. He noted that previous Golden Cross signals aligned with the start of Bitcoin’s most powerful bull phases. As a result, the current setup could prepare the cryptocurrency for another outsized rally to new ATHs. Based on historical data, even a conservative repeat of past percentage gains suggests Bitcoin could climb well beyond $200,000. A 100% rally from current levels above $115,000 could push the leading cryptocurrency well above $230,000. However, Merlijn’s chart points to an even greater move, projecting a potential surge to nearly $400,000. Bitcoin Bull Market Support Bands Hold Firm Crypto analyst Mags has also drawn attention to a different technical signal, reinforcing Bitcoin’s bullish case. According to him, BTC’s bull market support bands have acted as critical support zones in the past cycles, keeping the broader uptrend intact during temporary corrections. Related Reading: Here’s How High The Bitcoin Price Will Go If It Repeats The 2017 Cycle Throughout this cycle, each time Bitcoin’s price tested the bull market support band, it managed to hold and rebound strongly. The most recent test saw the cryptocurrency bounce cleanly off the band, suggesting buyers are stepping in at these levels to defend support. Mags added that this consistent support has created a foundation for further gains in BTC’s price, indicating that the market is not overextended.

51624342,https://cryptonews.com/?p=422463,1757716500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/51624342.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 12 September – XRP, Cardano, Ethereum",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-12-september-xrp-cardano-ethereum/,"The market has risen to a total cap of $4.1 trillion today, boosting the crypto price prediction for XRP, Cardano and Ethereum. These three altcoins have all posted gains in the past 24 hours, helping each to break firmly out of oversold positions. All three are gaining momentum as we head towards Q4, and their rallies today prepare them nicely for next week’s FOMC meeting, which could see the Fed cut rates for the first time since December. And with the SEC likely to pass judgment on numerous altcoin ETF applications in Q4, the final months of the year could be very bullish for the crypto market. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – New Ripple Partnerships and Incoming ETFs Could Send Altcoin Surging to New ATHs As well as rising by 1.5% today, the XRP price – at $3.05 – is up by 7.5% in a week and by 7% in a fortnight, although it does remain down by 5.5% in a month. This is arguably an ideal setup, since it means that XRP is gaining momentum but still has recent losses to make up for. In other words, more gains could be coming in the near term, as the coin’s chart suggests. Not only has XRP broken out of a pennant in recent days, but its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have also just turned positive. Source: TradingView This indicates growing buying pressure, while also making it clear that the coin is still some way for entering an overbought position. Now is therefore a good time to buy XRP, which could also benefit strongly from the approval of numerous XRP ETFs in the next one or two months. And when you add Ripple’s new partnerships and ongoing growth as a company , we could see the XRP price reach $3.50 by the end of month, before closing 2025 at around $5. Crypto Price Prediction: Cardano ($ADA) – 11th-Biggest Alt Could Be Dark Horse of End-of-Year Bull Rally ADA has risen to $0.8947 today, marking a 1.5% gain in 24 hours and an 8% increase in the last seven days. Cardano is also up by 9% in fortnight and 4% in a month, highlighting how the 11th-biggest coin in the market has fared better than many other major tokens in recent weeks. And what’s particularly encouraging about ADA is that it remains 71% down on its ATH of $3.09, which it set way back in September 2021. This would imply that it has lots of catching up to do and is way overdue a big rally, which may begin as and when the FOMC cuts rates next week. As with many other alts, its chart today suggests that it has broken out of recent negativity but still has plenty of room to rise further. Source: TradingView Its RSI has risen to 60 today, while its MACD recently turned positive a couple of days ago, yet is still some way off overheating. These are hugely bullish signs, and when you add Cardano’s steady growth as a layer-one network ADA could really push on this winter. Assuming a bullish market, the ADA price could rise to $1 by the end of the month, before climbing to $2 by December. Crypto Price Prediction: Ethereum ($ETH) – Crypto’s Biggest Alt On Course to Break ATH Soon. At $4,523, Ethereum has risen by 2.5% in the past 24 hours, while it’s also up by 4.5% in the past fortnight. On the other hand, it remains down by 2% in a month, so there certainly remains enough slack for the altcoin to rise further in the near future. Its indicators today show that it has recently begun to regain momentum after several weeks of moving sideways. Its RSI has risen to 62 today and looks likely to climb further, while its MACD has also begun rising again after a month of declines. As with the coins above, these indicators are far from overbought positions, so we can expect the Ethereum price to continue rising in the near term. And in the longer term, Ethereum’s position as the biggest layer-one network in provides ETH with a very positive crypto price prediction. ETH may reach $5,000 by the end of this month, before rushing towards $10,000 by December . Bitcoin Hyper: $15.2 Million Raised in Presale As Anticipation for L2 Grows As strong as the coins above seem right now, traders may want to consider diversifying into newer tokens, which can outperform the market. Presale coins are one route to doing this, given that they can amass considerable momentum before they list. There are a variety of promising presale tokens available right now, but probably the most exciting is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), a layer-two network for Bitcoin . Bitcoin Hyper has raised a very healthy $15.3 million in its ongoing sale , which has proven increasingly popular in recent weeks. And that’s because of its plans to launch a full layer-two network for Bitcoin, offering BTC holders lower fees and faster transactions. The aim of Bitcoin Hyper is to provide BTC owners with a DeFi ecosystem in which they can put their BTC to good use, earning additional profit on top of any price gains. It will make use of Solana’s Virtual Machine and zero-knowledge rollups, providing it with a level of scalability and privacy that only the best L2s can match. As its native token, HYPER will be necessary to pay for transaction fees, while holders will also be able to stake it for a regular yield. This could make it very popular, and investors can buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a compatible wallet (such as Best Wallet ). HYPER is currently available at a price of $0.012905, although this will rise again later today.

Some investors ask if Cardano (ADA) can reclaim its former momentum/ create a new all-time high, or find alternatives. A question has continued to surface amidst crypto forums and communities: “The best crypto to buy now?” in which two projects, Remittix (RTX) and Cronos (CRO), continue to surface amidst the answers. Cardano: Can It Reach New Highs? ADA is trading at $0.88 within a rising trend channel, which might signal increasing investor optimism. While ADA is bullish, investors are no longer pushing for higher highs. An on-chain metric released by Ali Martinez stated, “whales are booking profits, selling over 140 million Cardano $ADA in the last two weeks”. Source: Ali_chart via X. This massive number of selloffs shows that whales see an impending bear, or that ADA cannot deliver significant gains. Does Cronos Pass As The Best Crypto To Buy Now? While others focus on giants like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, the smart investors check out Cronos (CRO). It’s the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, and is slowly becoming a name to be mentioned as a possible competitor. Cronos powers the Crypto.com ecosystem, one of the largest in the world in terms of the size of a crypto exchange and financial service provider. Even though Cronos appears to be geared to grow, its potential cannot help investors achieve colossal returns. It can be purchased by investors who want moderate profits.

Bitcoin Cash Price Prediction: BCH Could Climb to $1,000 If It Breaks This Key Resistance Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is closing in on a major milestone , with a potential flip of Avalanche (AVAX) and Stellar (XLM) on the horizon. If these rivals fail to catch up with the market’s latest bullish surge, BCH could climb into the 15th spot on crypto’s market cap. rankings . echnically, BCH has been riding a clean ascending price channel since April, pointing to a sustained uptrend. The token is now approaching a key resistance level near $630 – a zone it’s tested twice before. A third breakout attempt could be the one that sticks. If bulls push past $750 , especially on high volume, it would confirm a breakout and set the stage for a powerful rally toward $1,000 in the near term. And with altcoin season accelerating , many investors are looking beyond large caps for higher upside. That’s why early movers are now shifting focus to top crypto presales – projects with breakout potential that could outpace even BCH as momentum floods back into the market. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper comes in. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Presale Explodes Past $15M – Next Crypto to 10X? Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has just smashed past $15.3 million raised , making it one of the fastest-moving presales of the year. Why all the hype?

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $1.77. In 2031, FLOW will range between $3.39 to $4.14. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.4217 Market Cap $678.09M Trading Volume $12.03M Circulating Supply 1.608B FLOW All-time High $46.16 All-time Low $0.2916 24-hour High $0.4216 24-hour Low $0.4082 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 3.2y% 50-Day SMA $0.3900 14-Day RSI 54.94 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $0.3975 Flow coin (FLOW) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Flow is testing resistance near $0.433 on the daily chart with bullish momentum building. Intraday structure shows higher lows and a breakout above $0.42, with support now at $0.416. A clean breakout above $0.433 could target $0.445–$0.45. Flow coin 1-day price analysis Flow is trading at $0.424 after a 2.42% climb today, September 12, showing signs of renewed bullish momentum. The price has been steadily moving higher over the past week and is now testing the upper half of the Bollinger Bands, which suggests building strength. The mid-band support sits at $0.404, while immediate resistance is marked at the upper band near $0.433. If buyers manage to push through, a breakout above $0.433 could open the way to $0.445–$0.45. FLOWUSDT 1-day price chart by TradingView The MACD has turned bullish with the blue line crossing above the signal line, confirming upward momentum. RSI at 57.5 is leaning bullish but not overextended, leaving room for further upside. Volume has also started to expand alongside price action, which strengthens the bullish outlook. However, a rejection at $0.433 would mean Flow could retest $0.404 support before deciding the next move. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis On the 4-hour chart, Flow has broken past $0.42 resistance and is currently trading at $0.424, with strong green candles indicating active buying pressure. The Alligator indicator lines are opening up in a bullish alignment, confirming trend continuation. Support is well established around $0.412–$0.414, while the breakout level near $0.416 has flipped into short-term support. FLOWUSDT 4-hour price chart by TradingView Volume remains steady at 1.19M, and OBV is trending upward, suggesting that buying pressure is accumulating in sync with the price. If momentum holds, Flow could revisit $0.425–$0.43 intraday, but a pullback to $0.416 should not be ruled out before further upside continuation. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.4153 BUY SMA 5 $0.4077 BUY SMA 10 $0.4039 BUY SMA 21 $0.4010 BUY SMA 50 $0.3900 BUY SMA 100 $0.3754 BUY SMA 200 $0.3975 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.4088 BUY EMA 5 $0.4073 BUY EMA 10 $0.4021 BUY EMA 21 $0.3954 BUY EMA 50 $0.3877 BUY EMA 100 $0.3895 BUY EMA 200 $0.4280 SELL What to expect from Flow? Flow is showing bullish signs across both daily and intraday charts. If buying pressure sustains, a push toward $0.445–$0.45 is possible in the short term. A rejection at $0.433 would cool momentum back toward $0.41–$0.404 support. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest could push FLOW to $1 and above in the coming months. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $3-$4 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance. Recent news/opinion on Flow Flow is seeing a big rise in activity after LayerZero integration, with transactions up over 600%. It continues to support major consumer apps like NBA Top Shot while improving its developer tools through Flow EVM and protocol upgrades. Flow Blockchain just posted one of its strongest quarters yet, blending consumer-scale adoption with surging DeFi momentum.

51626276,https://invezz.com/?p=2879853,1757718000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Solana ETF decision delay by SEC: analysts say SOL and XRP still the best altcoins to buy before november,https://invezz.com/news/2025/09/12/solana-etf-decision-delay-by-sec-analysts-say-sol-and-xrp-still-the-best-altcoins-to-buy-before-november/,"Solana’s highly anticipated ETF proposal has hit a pause. The SEC announced it would delay its decision, citing the need for more thorough review of market infrastructure, investor protections, and liquidity standards. Traders had hoped the regulator would fast-track approval following the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs earlier this year, but the cautious stance didn’t come as a complete surprise. ETF delays are common in crypto. Regulators typically take multiple review cycles before granting approval, often waiting for liquidity benchmarks and investor safeguards to align. For Solana, the decision reflects more on process than fundamentals. While the delay briefly weighed on sentiment, analysts say it does not alter the longer-term trajectory. Solana remains one of the fastest, most scalable blockchains in the industry, and its ecosystem continues to grow despite regulatory setbacks. With XRP also riding a surge of institutional inflows, both assets remain top-tier altcoins for accumulation before November. And while majors like SOL and XRP dominate headlines, presale projects such as MAGACOIN FINANCE are generating urgency that investors say is impossible to ignore. Solana’s fundamentals remain intact The delay should be seen in context. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum faced repeated postponements before their ETFs were finally approved. In each case, adoption advanced during the waiting period, and the eventual approvals acted as catalysts for fresh inflows. Analysts expect Solana to follow a similar pattern, noting that its fundamentals remain unchanged. On-chain data highlights Solana’s resilience. Daily active users remain among the highest in the market, transaction volumes consistently rank in the millions, and decentralised applications across gaming, NFTs, and DeFi continue to attract attention. This blend of speed, cost efficiency, and cultural relevance has given Solana a reputation as the “fast culture chain,” allowing it to remain a leader even during broader market slowdowns. For investors, the delay is frustrating but not damaging. It reinforces a simple truth: approval may take time, but Solana’s trajectory toward mainstream recognition remains on track. XRP’s steady institutional inflows XRP, often considered a rival in the “top altcoin” conversation, is also benefiting from renewed institutional interest. Following its partial legal clarity in 2024, XRP re-entered portfolios across hedge funds and global payment providers. Its integration into cross-border settlement systems has given it a utility-driven moat, ensuring demand extends beyond speculative trading. Recent data from CoinShares confirms that XRP has been one of the most consistent beneficiaries of inflows this year, ranking just behind Ethereum and Solana among altcoins. Analysts highlight that even without an ETF, XRP’s legal clarity and adoption curve make it a strong buy before November. Its steady performance, coupled with global partnerships, adds stability to portfolios already exposed to more volatile assets. While majors like SOL and XRP offer stability and liquidity, presales are where asymmetry still lives. As final rounds approach, analysts warn MAGACOIN FINANCE may never be this accessible again. With projections of 10,600 ROI , urgency is building as both whales and retail fight for allocations. Traders argue this presale is the exact setup that historically separates average gains from legendary wealth-building opportunities. MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart because of how it merges meme-driven branding with rigorous structural legitimacy. The HashEx audit has been completed, CertiK verification is in progress, and tokenomics have been engineered to align with retail investors: 60% allocated to presale buyers, only 1% reserved for the team. Add to this a surging community of 25,000+ members and 13,500+ verified investors, and the scale is undeniable. What makes this presale compelling is timing. As regulatory delays create uncertainty in majors, retail traders and whales alike are piling into projects that can deliver immediate momentum. The urgency around MAGACOIN FINANCE is both cultural and mathematical: scarcity is built into the design, and credibility is backed by audits. That combination is rare, and it explains why this presale is being called a once-per-cycle opportunity. Balancing majors with presales Analysts stress the importance of balance in volatile conditions. Majors like Solana and XRP provide the liquidity and resilience needed to anchor portfolios. Their ecosystems, adoption stories, and institutional inflows mean they are unlikely to fade, even in the face of regulatory hurdles. Presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE, however, provide the asymmetric upside that can multiply capital in ways majors no longer can. This dual approach mirrors strategies from past cycles. In 2021, many investors paired Ethereum with Solana or Avalanche to capture both stability and early growth. In 2017, portfolios blended Bitcoin with emerging DeFi tokens that later became blue chips. In 2025, analysts say the formula looks similar: combine established assets like SOL and XRP with promising presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture both safety and explosive upside. Conclusion The SEC’s delay on Solana’s ETF decision may frustrate short-term traders, but the fundamentals of both SOL and XRP remain strong. Institutional inflows, vibrant communities, and deepening adoption position them as some of the best altcoins to buy before November. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s final presale rounds, 10,600 ROI projections, and rapidly growing community are creating urgency that few investors can ignore.

In a dramatic turn, major exchanges witnessed a staggering $103 million worth of futures liquidated in just one hour. This sudden wipeout is part of an even larger trend, with a total of $483 million in crypto futures liquidation occurring over the past 24 hours. Such significant figures send ripples through the trading community, prompting questions about market stability and the risks associated with leveraged positions. Understanding these events is crucial for anyone involved in digital asset trading. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? To grasp the impact of these numbers, it is essential to understand what crypto futures liquidation entails. A futures contract is essentially an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Traders often use these contracts with leverage, meaning they can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. This amplifies both potential gains and losses. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position is automatically closed by an exchange because they no longer have sufficient funds (known as margin) to cover potential losses. If the market moves significantly against a leveraged position, the exchange steps in to prevent further losses for the trader and the platform. This forced closure means the trader loses their initial margin, and often more, depending on the contract’s terms. Futures Contracts: Agreements to trade crypto at a future price. Leverage: Using borrowed funds to amplify trading power. Margin: Funds held by the exchange to cover potential losses. Liquidation: Automatic closure of a leveraged position when margin falls below a certain threshold. The Alarming Scale: Why So Much Crypto Futures Liquidation? The recent figures— $103 million in an hour and $483 million over 24 hours —are not just statistics; they represent substantial financial losses for many traders. This scale of crypto futures liquidation often points to sudden, sharp price movements in the underlying cryptocurrencies. When prices swing dramatically, especially for highly volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, many leveraged positions can quickly become unprofitable, triggering a cascade of liquidations. This phenomenon creates a feedback loop: liquidations can add selling pressure to the market, which in turn drives prices further down, leading to even more liquidations. It is a powerful reminder of the double-edged sword that leverage presents in the fast-paced crypto world. While it offers the potential for high returns, it also carries proportional risks, particularly during periods of heightened market uncertainty. What Drives These Massive Liquidation Events? Several factors contribute to the occurrence of significant crypto futures liquidation events: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price swings. Unexpected news, regulatory announcements, or large whale movements can cause rapid price changes. Excessive Leverage: Many traders use high leverage, sometimes 50x or even 100x. While appealing for potential gains, this means even a small price movement against their position can lead to liquidation. “Long” vs. “Short” Squeeze: A “long squeeze” happens when prices drop sharply, liquidating long positions (bets on price increases). Conversely, a “short squeeze” occurs when prices surge, liquidating short positions (bets on price decreases). The recent liquidations likely involved a mix, but a dominant direction often emerges. Lack of Risk Management: Traders who do not set stop-loss orders or manage their margin effectively are highly susceptible to liquidation during volatile periods. Navigating Volatile Waters: Strategies for Traders Given the frequent occurrence of large-scale crypto futures liquidation , how can traders better protect themselves? Effective risk management is paramount, especially when engaging in leveraged trading. Here are some actionable insights: Avoid Excessive Leverage: While tempting, using very high leverage dramatically increases your risk of liquidation. Consider lower leverage ratios that align with your risk tolerance. Implement Stop-Loss Orders: A stop-loss order automatically closes your position if the price reaches a certain level, limiting your potential losses and preventing a full liquidation. Manage Your Margin: Regularly monitor your margin levels. If your position is approaching liquidation, consider adding more collateral to avoid forced closure, or close the position manually. Understand Market Sentiment: Pay attention to broader market trends and news. Sudden shifts in sentiment can precede major price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: While futures trading is specific, a diversified overall crypto portfolio can help mitigate risks if one asset or trading strategy goes south. Continuous Learning: Stay informed about market dynamics, new trading tools, and risk management techniques. The crypto space evolves rapidly. The recent crypto futures liquidation of over $100 million in an hour serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged cryptocurrency trading. While futures offer powerful tools for speculation and hedging, they demand a disciplined approach to risk management. Traders must prioritize understanding leverage, setting clear stop-loss limits, and avoiding overexposure to protect their capital. By doing so, they can navigate the unpredictable currents of the crypto market more effectively and avoid becoming another statistic in the next wave of liquidations. Always remember, capital preservation is as important as profit generation in this dynamic environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto futures contract? A crypto futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a future date. It allows traders to speculate on future price movements without owning the underlying asset. 2. How does leverage contribute to liquidations? Leverage allows traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. While it magnifies potential profits, it also magnifies losses. If the market moves against a highly leveraged position, the margin can quickly deplete, leading to automatic liquidation by the exchange. 3. Are all futures liquidations bad for the market? While large-scale liquidations can indicate significant market volatility and lead to cascading price drops, they are a built-in mechanism in futures trading to manage risk for both traders and exchanges. They can also “clear out” overleveraged positions, potentially setting the stage for more stable price action later. 4. What can traders do to avoid liquidation? Traders can avoid liquidation by using lower leverage, setting strict stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, actively managing their margin, and continuously monitoring market conditions. It’s also crucial to avoid emotional trading and stick to a well-defined risk management strategy. 5. What’s the difference between a “long” and “short” liquidation? A “long” liquidation occurs when a trader betting on a price increase (going long) has their position closed due to a price drop. A “short” liquidation happens when a trader betting on a price decrease (going short) has their position closed due to a price surge.

51626288,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82956,1757719803,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"XRP To Hit New All-Time High Soon, But There’s A Catch",https://timestabloid.com/xrp-to-hit-new-all-time-high-soon-but-theres-a-catch/,"XRP has recovered from its recent dip, moving back above the $3 level after falling to $2.70 at the start of September. The asset currently trades near $3.03 , reflecting a modest rebound of more than 12% from its earlier low. Despite this recovery, analysts note that the market remains at a critical juncture, with the next move dependent on key technical levels. Technical Setup According to market strategist Matthew Dixon, XRP’s price action since July has been forming a contracting Elliott Wave triangle. This pattern has defined the coin’s movements following the yearly high of $3.66 in mid-July. From there, XRP declined to $2.72 in early August, establishing wave (A). A rebound followed later that month, topping at $3.38 for wave (B), but the rally was capped by resistance along the descending trendline. Wave (C) formed at the $2.70 low earlier this month, and the market has since advanced again to test resistance near $3.05, completing wave (D). With this structure in place, Dixon suggests that XRP is approaching an important decision point at the triangle’s upper boundary. Keep in mind – THIS IS A VALID OPTION for #XRP Either way we should push to new ATH soon but we MAY still have the E wave of a potential Triangle formation to complete before the real impulse higher for $XRP pic.twitter.com/IUHR4G1AHL — Matthew Dixon – Veteran Financial Trader (@mdtrade) September 11, 2025 Dixon outlined two potential near-term outcomes. In the first, XRP could break through the upper resistance without further declines, creating room for an advance to around $3.90 . This scenario would translate into nearly 30% upside from current levels. Alternatively, XRP could be rejected at resistance and pulled back to establish wave (E) near the $2.655 support region. If this occurs, Dixon expects the correction to act as a base for a stronger rally, potentially pushing the asset from $2.65 to $3.90, a move representing about 47% growth. Regardless of which scenario unfolds, Dixon’s analysis anticipates an eventual breakout from the triangle that could carry XRP toward a new all-time high . Key Resistance and Support Levels Supporting data shows that XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) currently stands near 57, placing it in neutral territory with space to move in either direction. Analysts identify the $3.05 to $3.15 range as the immediate resistance to overcome, while $2.655 remains the crucial support level to maintain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Additional Market Perspectives Other analysts share similar outlooks. EGRAG Crypto recently noted that XRP’s structure also resembles a symmetrical triangle, with equal chances of a bullish or bearish resolution. He emphasized that a close above $3.077 to $3.13 on the three-day chart, together with reclaiming the 21-period simple moving average, would reinforce the bullish scenario. In contrast, he warned that losing $2.77 would give sellers an advantage, and a breakdown below $2.55 would indicate deeper weakness. Looking at shorter timeframes, EGRAG highlighted an ascending triangle pattern on the four-hour chart, requiring XRP to stay above $2.973 to maintain the formation. His targets include $3.12, with interim support at $2.957, $2.912, and a key floor at $2.85. Meanwhile, analyst Casi Trades argued that XRP has already exited its recent consolidation. She identified $3.00 as a key level now serving as support, with immediate resistance at $3.08 and $3.27. In her view, a move above $3.25 could open the door to a push toward $4.50, with $3.66 likely to be retested during the process. XRP’s recovery above $3 has positioned it at an important stage, with analysts closely monitoring resistance around $3.10 and support near $2.65. While short-term outcomes remain uncertain, both primary scenarios outlined by Dixon point to an eventual breakout toward $3.90 and potentially new record highs, provided these key levels hold.

Notably, public companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets have seen their aggregate holdings surge past $113 billion in early September. This balance shows not only strong institutional conviction in Bitcoin as a reserve asset but also the adoption of crypto‐treasury models among public companies, and here are the major stakeholders. Major Stakeholders Of Bitcoin Treasury Data shows that the total value of Bitcoin held by publicly traded companies in their treasury is now well over the $100 billion mark. The value of the total holdings, which is subject to the intensely volatile nature of Bitcoin’s price, is now fluctuating between $111.24 billion and $113 billion, according to data from BiTBO. The center of this adoption is full of companies and founders that have made Bitcoin a cornerstone of their treasury strategy. At the top of the list is Strategy, which is holding hundreds of thousands of BTC and is often seen as the pioneer of corporate Bitcoin accumulation. According to data from BiTBO, Strategy is holding 638,460 BTC, which is worth about $73.63 billion. This translates to 64.27% of the BTC held by public companies and 3.04% of the total 21 million BTC created. Following close behind are mining companies and firms explicitly structured around Bitcoin accumulation. MARA Holdings (Marathon Digital), for example, is the second-largest public company holding Bitcoin, with 52,477 BTC worth $6.05 billion in its coffers. Other names include XXI (Twenty-One Capital) with 37,229 BTC, Bullish with 24,340 BTC, and Riot Platforms with 19,309 BTC. Interestingly, some non-mining or non-traditional companies have also carved out a strong strategy of Bitcoin treasury. For instance, MetaPlanet, which is currently holding 20,136 BTC, recently announced that it had expanded its shares offering from 180 million shares to 385 million shares in order to raise $1.4 billion in capital for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Other companies like GameStop and EV manufacturer Tesla also have thousands of Bitcoins in their treasury reserves. What’s Motivating The Bitcoin Accumulation? There are many intersecting motivations behind these large Bitcoin treasury holdings. First, many leaders of these companies view Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, as it is commonly referred to as digital gold. Second, there is the trend of shareholder appeal. For instance, MetaPlanet noted that its most recent upsizing was due to strong demand from investors. Companies that announce Bitcoin accumulation often witness stock price increases. According to a report from Animoca Brands, the stock price of corporate treasury companies increases by an average of 150% within 24 hours of announcing crypto adoption strategies. Aside from publicly traded companies, institutional demand for Bitcoin through Spot Bitcoin ETFs is also growing at a strong pace. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US continue to attract inflows, with the latest numbers from SoSoValue showing $552.78 million entering these ETFs on September 11. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $115,220, up by 0.9% in the past 24 hours.",Bitcoin News|Animoca Brands|BiTBO|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|gamestop|MARA Holdings|Marathon Digital|Metaplanet|Sosovalue|Spot Bitcoin ETFs|Tesla|Twenty One Capital,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MACROECONOMICS|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-12 23:30:12

Solana and Ethereum can still be the focus of blockchain conversation, but attention is shifting more and more to upcoming crypto projects that tackle real-world adoption problems. A contender gaining traction in this space is Remittix (RTX) , a cross-chain DeFi project preparing to roll out its beta wallet in Q3 2025. Ethereum, Solana Prices in the Spotlight Ethereum is priced at $4,433.17, with a 2.3% daily gain, and its market capitalization at $534.74 billion. Its trading volume has increased by 37.05% to $41.4 billion, indicating robust participation from institutional and retail investors. Solana is firm in its own right, but investors are looking at early-stage crypto investment prospects with a combination of utility and growth. This is where early-stage projects such as Remittix pull ahead of well-established tokens. Remittix Presale Success and Guaranteed Listings Remittix (RTX) is currently trading at $0.1080 per token and has already raised well over $25.2 million in presale capital, selling more than 658 million tokens.

Recently, a significant development has unfolded, placing the spotlight squarely on prediction markets. The Kalshi lawsuit filed by the Massachusetts Attorney General marks a critical moment, raising questions about licensing, compliance, and the future of these unique financial instruments. What is the Kalshi Lawsuit All About? The Massachusetts Attorney General has initiated legal proceedings against Kalshi, a prominent prediction market platform. At the heart of the complaint are allegations that Kalshi has been offering sports prediction betting services within the state without obtaining the necessary licenses. This isn’t just a minor administrative oversight; it’s a serious charge that could have far-reaching consequences. The lawsuit is not merely seeking to halt these alleged unlicensed operations. It also aims to secure monetary damages and other legal remedies. This aggressive stance by the AG signals a growing scrutiny of platforms that blur the lines between innovative financial products and traditional gambling. Why Does This Legal Action Matter for Prediction Markets? This Kalshi lawsuit is more than just a localized legal skirmish; it has broader implications for the entire prediction market industry. Here’s why: Regulatory Clarity: The case could set a precedent for how states categorize and regulate prediction markets. Are they commodities, securities, or a form of gambling? Licensing Requirements: It highlights the complex web of state-specific licensing that platforms must navigate, especially when dealing with activities that could be construed as betting. Operational Challenges: For platforms like Kalshi, operating across different jurisdictions means confronting a patchwork of varying legal interpretations and requirements. The outcome of this case could influence how other states approach similar platforms, potentially leading to increased regulatory pressure or clearer guidelines for operation. Navigating the Complexities: Kalshi’s Stance and Industry Impact While the specific details of Kalshi’s defense are yet to fully unfold, prediction markets generally argue they are not gambling platforms. Instead, they often position themselves as legitimate financial exchanges where users can trade on the outcomes of future events, much like futures contracts. This distinction is crucial. If regulators view them as gambling, they face stringent licensing and operational hurdles. If seen as financial instruments, they might fall under different regulatory bodies, like the CFTC, which has previously given Kalshi a ‘no-action’ letter for certain event contracts. The Kalshi lawsuit underscores the ongoing tension between innovation in financial technology and the existing regulatory frameworks designed for traditional markets. It’s a reminder that even platforms operating with some federal approval might still face challenges at the state level. What Are the Potential Outcomes and Lessons Learned from the Kalshi Lawsuit? The resolution of the Massachusetts AG’s Kalshi lawsuit could take several paths: Settlement: Kalshi might reach an agreement with the AG, potentially involving fines and changes to its Massachusetts operations. Court Ruling: A definitive court ruling could establish a legal precedent for prediction markets in Massachusetts and possibly beyond. Operational Adjustments: Regardless of the outcome, Kalshi and other prediction markets may need to re-evaluate their geographic service offerings and licensing strategies. For the wider crypto and fintech community, this case serves as a vital lesson: regulatory compliance is paramount. Understanding the nuances of both federal and state laws is essential for sustainable growth and avoiding costly legal battles. The Kalshi lawsuit is a compelling illustration of the regulatory challenges facing the evolving landscape of prediction markets. As these platforms continue to innovate, their interaction with established legal frameworks will remain a critical area to watch. The outcome of this case will undoubtedly shape future discussions around how technology-driven financial products are defined, regulated, and ultimately, allowed to operate. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Kalshi? Kalshi is a prediction market platform that allows users to trade on the outcomes of future events, often related to economics, politics, and current affairs. It positions itself as a financial exchange for event contracts. Q2: Why did the Massachusetts Attorney General sue Kalshi? The Massachusetts Attorney General filed a Kalshi lawsuit alleging that the platform was offering sports prediction betting services within the state without obtaining the required licenses, which is a violation of state law. Q3: What are “prediction markets”? Prediction markets are platforms where users can buy and sell contracts whose value is tied to the outcome of future events. The price of these contracts reflects the crowd’s aggregated probability of an event occurring. Q4: How might this lawsuit impact other prediction markets? The outcome of the Kalshi lawsuit could set a precedent for how prediction markets are regulated at the state level, potentially leading to increased scrutiny, new licensing requirements, or clearer operational guidelines for similar platforms across the U.S. Q5: What are the potential outcomes of the Kalshi lawsuit? Potential outcomes include a settlement between Kalshi and the AG, a definitive court ruling that sets a legal precedent, or Kalshi making operational adjustments to comply with state regulations, possibly including monetary damages.

Overall funding for crypto protocols was down 30% in August, sliding to nearly $2 billion from July’s $2.67 billion, according to DeFiLlama. Related Reading: ETF Dreams For Dogecoin: Serious Possibility Or Just Hype? Funding Dips Yet Quarter Gains Based on reports, third-quarter totals reached $4.57 billion in just two months, pushing past Q2’s $4.54 billion. That shows money is still moving, even if monthly flows look cooler compared with past peaks. At the start of 2022, monthly raises hit about $7 billion. Numbers have come down since then, but 2025 has shown several big spikes that kept investors alert. Investor Focus Shifts To Existing Projects According to market analyst Daan Crypto Trades, funding has moved away from nonstop new-chain launches toward treasuries and teams building on existing projects. He points out that new launches are hitting lower valuations, which has helped keep price moves quieter after listings. The Total Funding Raised for new Crypto projects has seen an increase the past few months but is nowhere close to what it was back in 2021 & 2022. This cycle has been all about treasury companies which are building on top of projects that are already out there.

But other sectors also saw notable rounds. Stablecoin infrastructure was busy too, with Rain’s raise at $58 million. Payment solutions also attracted funding; OrangeX took $20 million in a Series B. South Korea Opens VC Doors Following approval by the State Council and cabinet, South Korea’s Ministry of SMEs and Startups said it lifted a long-standing VC funding ban on September 16. The amendment to the Enforcement Decree removes the label that had kept exchanges and brokerages classified as “restricted venture businesses” since October 2018. Recent laws, including the Virtual Asset User Protection Act passed in July 2025, introduced deposit safeguards, record-keeping rules, and bans on unfair trading. Those steps helped convince regulators to reopen the market.

If VCs return, local crypto firms may find new sources of growth capital, while investors look for projects that can deliver longer-term value.

In her latest report released midweek, she outlined the indicators and price levels she considers most relevant for traders monitoring the token’s next phase. CasiTrades highlighted that XRP has recovered above the $3 threshold after several unsuccessful attempts earlier in the month. The token’s advance followed a breakout from a tightening, multi-month symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, a formation that developed after the mid-July high near $3.66 and subsequent range-bound activity. With the $3 level now acting as short-term support, she views the market as positioned to resume an upward trend, provided key conditions hold. Consolidation Ends, Momentum Builds: XRP Targets $4.50 $XRP is heating up! It has broken out of its months-long consolidation, and confirmation of the breakout is occurring with the $3 test now in play. Looking at the daily timeframe, price has been battling this level… pic.twitter.com/UD06AoyWlW — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) September 10, 2025 Technical Signals Supporting a Bullish Case Several momentum and trend indicators underpin CasiTrades’ constructive view. The Relative Strength Index has moved into positive territory and currently reads in the mid-50s, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions while leaving room for further appreciation. In addition, moving averages are aligned beneath current prices, offering dynamic support that could reduce the risk of a rapid decline if buyers remain present. CasiTrades also referenced Fibonacci extension targets derived from the prior consolidation. The first extension level of interest sits near $3.08, with a second extension around $3.27. She identified these zones as necessary milestones for confirming renewed bullish momentum. Should XRP clear and hold above them, the path to higher extension targets becomes more likely. Target Levels and Risk Management Based on her wave and Fibonacci analysis, CasiTrades places an eventual target at $4.50, which would represent roughly a 50% advance from the present $3 area and would establish a new cycle high. She interprets this move as the third wave within a broader five-wave structure , meaning an extended rise is plausible if market conditions remain constructive. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 That said, she outlined clear downside parameters. A failure to sustain the $3 support could expose the token to retracements toward lower Fibonacci supports, specifically near $2.78 and $2.58. A decisive break under these regions would weaken the bullish thesis and require the reassessment of targets. Corroborating Analyst Views Other market commentators have offered complementary perspectives. Analyst, Dr. Cat, endorses a similar upside target and frames that level as a conservative scenario within the current cycle, while a handful of more extreme forecasts exist elsewhere in the market. These divergent views underscore both the upside potential and the range of opinion regarding magnitude and timing. CasiTrades’ analysis presents a structured roadmap, sustain $3 as support, reclaim intermediate Fibonacci extensions, and maintain momentum above moving averages to validate a push toward $4.50 . Traders should monitor the $3.05–$3.30 area for confirmation and treat $2.78–$2.58 as key support for downside protection. As always, market dynamics can shift rapidly. Risk controls and position sizing remain essential for anyone trading around these levels. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This move signals a growing trend among established companies to strategically carve out their blockchain and cryptocurrency ventures. The company previously outlined ambitious plans to invest between $500 million and $1 billion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies, setting the stage for this latest strategic maneuver. Unlocking Value: Why Spin Off the Faraday Future Crypto Arm? Faraday Future’s decision to pursue a separate public listing for its cryptocurrency business unit is a calculated strategic move. A spin-off allows the core electric vehicle (EV) business and the crypto arm to operate independently, each focusing on its unique market dynamics and growth opportunities. This separation can bring several advantages: Enhanced Capital Access: A standalone crypto entity can attract investors specifically interested in the digital asset space, potentially unlocking significant capital for expansion and innovation without diluting the core EV business. Focused Management: Dedicated leadership and teams can concentrate solely on the fast-evolving crypto landscape, making agile decisions and pursuing specialized strategies. Clearer Valuation: Separating the crypto assets from the EV operations provides a clearer valuation for both entities, which can be more appealing to investors who prefer pure-play investments. Reduced Regulatory Complexity: While both entities face regulatory scrutiny, a separate structure can streamline compliance efforts tailored to each industry’s specific requirements. This strategic pivot by Faraday Future highlights a broader corporate appetite for leveraging the potential of blockchain technology and digital currencies. Navigating the Road Ahead: Challenges for the Faraday Future Crypto Arm While the potential benefits are compelling, the journey to a successful spin-off and public listing for the Faraday Future crypto arm is not without its challenges. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving globally. Regulatory Hurdles: Obtaining approvals for a crypto-focused public listing can be complex, given the varying and often strict regulations surrounding digital assets. Market Volatility: The inherent price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of the spun-off entity. Operational Separation: Successfully disentangling operations, technology, and personnel from the parent company requires meticulous planning and execution. Investor Skepticism: Despite growing adoption, some traditional investors may remain cautious about investing directly in crypto-focused companies, necessitating clear communication of the value proposition. Faraday Future will need to carefully navigate these factors to ensure a smooth transition and a successful launch for its crypto venture. What Does This Mean for Corporate Crypto Adoption? Faraday Future’s bold move to spin off its Faraday Future crypto arm could set a significant precedent. It signals a maturation of corporate strategy regarding digital assets, moving beyond simple investments to creating dedicated, publicly traded entities. This could encourage other large corporations to: Explore Similar Structures: Companies with significant crypto holdings or blockchain initiatives might consider similar spin-off models to unlock value. Increase Institutional Confidence: A successful public listing by a Nasdaq-listed entity could bolster confidence among institutional investors in the long-term viability of crypto businesses. Drive Innovation: Dedicated crypto entities are better positioned to innovate rapidly, developing new products and services within the blockchain ecosystem. This development underscores a pivotal moment where traditional industries are increasingly embracing the transformative power of decentralized finance and digital assets. It moves beyond merely holding cryptocurrencies to actively building and publicly listing dedicated crypto businesses. A Glimpse into the Future of Finance The announcement from Faraday Future isn’t just about one company’s strategy; it reflects a broader shift. As more companies like Faraday Future explore and execute such ventures, the line between traditional finance and the digital asset economy will continue to blur. This spin-off could pave the way for a new era of specialized, publicly traded crypto companies, bringing greater transparency and mainstream accessibility to the sector. The strategic intent behind creating a distinct Faraday Future crypto arm is clear: to maximize potential in a rapidly evolving market. Its success or challenges will undoubtedly offer valuable lessons for other companies contemplating similar strategic moves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Here are some common questions about Faraday Future’s latest announcement: What is the main purpose of Faraday Future spinning off its crypto arm? The primary goal is to unlock greater value, attract specialized crypto investors, and allow both the core EV business and the crypto unit to focus independently on their respective growth strategies. Has Faraday Future invested in cryptocurrencies before this announcement? Yes, the company previously stated its intention to invest between $500 million and $1 billion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies. What are the potential benefits for investors from this spin-off? Investors could benefit from a clearer valuation of the crypto assets, dedicated management focused on digital assets, and potentially higher growth opportunities in the specialized crypto market. What challenges might Faraday Future face with this public listing? Key challenges include navigating complex regulatory environments, managing cryptocurrency market volatility, and ensuring a smooth operational separation from the parent company. How might this move impact other Nasdaq-listed companies? This could set a precedent, encouraging other public companies with significant crypto interests to explore similar spin-off structures, potentially leading to increased institutional adoption and innovation in the crypto space.

The Altcoin Season Index , a key indicator for many investors, has recently climbed three points to a notable 68. This movement suggests a significant shift in market dynamics, potentially signaling exciting opportunities for those paying attention to the broader crypto landscape beyond Bitcoin. What is the Altcoin Season Index, and Why Does it Matter? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto markets. Provided by CoinMarketCap, this index offers a clear snapshot of how altcoins are performing against Bitcoin. Calculation Method: The index specifically tracks the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to ensure a true reflection of speculative altcoin activity. Comparison Point: Each of these top 100 altcoins is then compared directly to Bitcoin’s performance over a 90-day period. Defining a Season: An ‘altcoin season’ is officially declared when 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin during that 90-day window. Conversely, if Bitcoin dominates, it’s considered a ‘Bitcoin season.’ A reading closer to 100 signifies a much stronger altcoin season, indicating widespread outperformance by a large majority of altcoins. Therefore, the recent jump to 68 is a significant indicator that altcoins are gaining momentum. What Does an Index of 68 Signal for Altcoin Season? The current reading of 68 on the Altcoin Season Index is a compelling figure. While it’s not yet at the ‘official’ 75% threshold for a full altcoin season declaration, it’s very close. This strong upward trend suggests that a substantial number of altcoins are already outperforming Bitcoin. Historically, such movements often precede periods of heightened interest and capital flow into alternative cryptocurrencies. It indicates a broadening of market participation beyond just Bitcoin, as investors seek higher returns in potentially undervalued or emerging projects. This shift can be driven by several factors: Bitcoin Dominance Cooling: After periods of strong Bitcoin rallies, some investors might rotate profits into altcoins. Innovation Cycles: New technologies or applications within specific altcoin ecosystems can attract significant investment. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader market sentiment or economic shifts can also influence investor appetite for riskier assets like altcoins. Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges in an Emerging Altcoin Season The rising Altcoin Season Index presents exciting prospects, but it’s vital to approach the market with a balanced perspective. While the potential for substantial gains exists, so do the inherent risks associated with altcoin investing. Benefits of an Altcoin Season: Higher Growth Potential: Many altcoins have smaller market caps than Bitcoin, meaning a smaller inflow of capital can lead to larger percentage gains. Diversification: Investing in a range of altcoins can help diversify a crypto portfolio, spreading risk across different projects and use cases. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins often represent cutting-edge blockchain technologies and decentralized applications, offering exposure to future trends. Challenges and Risks: Increased Volatility: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin, with prices capable of dramatic swings in short periods. Project Risk: Not all altcoin projects succeed; some may fail, leading to significant or total loss of investment. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins might have lower trading volumes, making it harder to buy or sell large positions without impacting the price. Actionable Insights for Investors: If you’re considering engaging with this potential Altcoin Season Index surge, here are some practical steps: Do Your Research (DYOR): Thoroughly investigate any altcoin project before investing. Look into its technology, team, use case, community, and tokenomics. Start Small: Allocate only a small portion of your portfolio to altcoins, especially if you are new to the space. Diversify Wisely: Instead of putting all your funds into one altcoin, consider spreading investments across several promising projects. Stay Informed: Keep up with market news, project developments, and broader crypto trends. Risk Management: Set clear entry and exit strategies, and consider using stop-loss orders to protect capital. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? The ascent of the Altcoin Season Index to 68 marks an exciting period for the cryptocurrency market. It suggests a potential shift from Bitcoin-centric dominance to a broader embrace of alternative digital assets. While the promise of significant returns is enticing, a cautious and well-researched approach remains paramount. By understanding the dynamics of the index and applying sound investment principles, participants can better position themselves to navigate the opportunities that an emerging altcoin season may present. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does an Altcoin Season Index reading of 68 mean? An Altcoin Season Index of 68 means that 68% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. While not yet the official 75% threshold for a full altcoin season, it indicates strong momentum for altcoins. Q2: How is the Altcoin Season Index calculated? The index is calculated by comparing the price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin’s performance over a 90-day period. Q3: Is an Altcoin Season guaranteed with an index of 68? No, an index of 68 indicates a strong likelihood and emerging trend towards an altcoin season, but the official declaration requires 75% of altcoins to outperform Bitcoin. Market conditions can change rapidly. Q4: What are the main risks of investing during an altcoin season? The primary risks include higher volatility compared to Bitcoin, the potential for project failure, and liquidity issues with smaller altcoins. It’s crucial to conduct thorough research and manage risk effectively. Q5: Where can I find the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is provided by data providers like CoinMarketCap, which offers real-time market data and insights for cryptocurrencies.

While Ethereum’s system penalizes validators for downtime or misbehavior, Cardano’s staking approach avoids such risks, offering delegators security without the fear of losing funds. Why Simplicity And Resilience Are Cardano’s Key Advantages On September 10, a slashing of 11.7 ETH from 39 Ethereum validators highlights the advantages of Cardano’s staking structure. Crypto analyst Dori has highlighted on X the fundamental differences in staking requirements and risks between the two networks. On Ethereum, it is structurally impossible to stake 0.1 ETH directly on ETH, but an individual must stake a minimum of 32 ETH and operate a validator node themselves. Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Double Down As Staking Activity Spikes Sharply – Here’s How Much However, platforms have been built on Ethereum to allow staking with as little as 0.1 ETH, and liquid tokens are issued. The critical difference is that, due to the slashing mechanism, Ethereum’s structure carries the risk of a cascading collapse. This has given rise to platforms like Ankr and Lido Finance, which pool ETH from many users, run validators, and issue liquid staking tokens such as ankrETH and stETH to solve the problem of locked-up funds. In this incident, an operational mistake by the operators of 39 validators led to a slashing penalty of 11.7 ETH, which is worth approximately $52,000. If a larger slashing event were to occur, it could lead to the de-pegging of the liquid staking tokens, potentially triggering a cascading collapse as DeFi ecosystem protocols built upon them. On Ethereum, iquid staking platforms were developed to remove obstacles to staking, and liquid tokens were distributed to address the issue of lock-ups. In contrast, Cardana’s staking model allows anyone to stake as little as 10 ADA in a stake pool without worrying about slashing. There are no lock-up periods, and a user’s staked funds are never at risk of being lost, even if their chosen stake pool misbehaves. Fundamentally Different Approaches To Staking Cardanians (CRDN) also stated that a critical flaw in Ethereum’s staking model has been exposed, highlighting the fundamental advantages of Cardano’s design. The data shows that the Ethereum staking exit queue has hit an all-time high, forcing users who unstake their ETH to wait an estimated 46 days to get their funds back. Related Reading: Cardano Secures The Crown: Now The Most Decentralized Blockchain On Earth – Here’s How However, Cardano’s ADA staking model offers a fundamentally different experience, with liquid staking and no entry or exit queues. When a user stakes their ADA, the funds remain in their wallet and are always available for use or transfer, and earn rewards without being locked up. “The design is fundamentally better,” the expert noted.

This shift moves market sentiment from ‘greed’ to a more balanced, ‘neutral’ stance, according to data from Alternative. But what does this mean for you, the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 52 Truly Signify? To truly grasp the significance of this shift, it is essential to understand what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index actually measures. This popular indicator provides a snapshot of the prevailing emotions in the crypto market. It operates on a simple scale: 0 (Extreme Fear): This score signals that investors are overly worried and selling off assets. Historically, periods of extreme fear can sometimes present buying opportunities for long-term investors. 100 (Extreme Greed): Conversely, this suggests the market is overheated, and a correction might be on the horizon as prices may be unsustainable. A score of 52, therefore, places us right in the middle – a state of neutrality. This indicates a balanced market where neither extreme optimism nor pervasive fear dominates. It’s a moment when the market takes a collective breath, perhaps reassessing its next move. The index compiles various data points to form its score, including: Volatility (25%): Measures how much Bitcoin’s price fluctuates compared to its average. Trading Volume (25%): Reflects the total amount of cryptocurrency being bought and sold, indicating market activity. Social Media Mentions (15%): Analyzes the sentiment expressed on platforms like Twitter, gauging public mood. Surveys (15%): Direct polls on market sentiment (though this component is currently paused). Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization, often seen as a flight to safety or risk-on indicator. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks the level of public interest in crypto-related terms, indicating broader engagement. Why the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Shifted to Neutral: Key Factors A move from ‘greed’ to ‘neutral’ doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Several underlying market dynamics often contribute to such a shift. While the exact reasons can be complex, they usually involve a combination of price action, external economic factors, and evolving investor behavior. This recent adjustment in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index suggests a period of reflection rather than panic. Consider these potential influences: Price Consolidation: After a period of strong gains or significant market events, assets often enter a consolidation phase where prices stabilize or trade sideways. This ‘cooling-off’ period naturally reduces the extreme bullish sentiment that characterizes ‘greed’. Reduced Volatility: If major cryptocurrencies experience less dramatic price swings over a sustained period, one of the key components of the index—volatility—will naturally decrease. This reduction in price movement pushes the overall Crypto Fear & Greed Index score towards the middle, reflecting a more composed market. Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Broader economic news, such as inflation reports, interest rate changes, or geopolitical events, can make investors more cautious, even if it doesn’t lead to outright fear. This prudence can foster a neutral stance. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing discussions or new regulations in major markets can introduce uncertainty, prompting investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach. This neutral reading essentially means that investors are neither rushing in nor fleeing the market en masse. It’s a moment of equilibrium. Navigating Neutral Sentiment: Actionable Insights for Investors So, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sitting at a neutral 52, what should investors consider? This period offers unique opportunities and challenges. It is not a time for complacency, but rather for strategic thinking and careful execution. A neutral market can be a testing ground for long-term conviction, requiring a balanced perspective. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this phase: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Use this calmer period to assess your current holdings. Are your allocations still aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals? This is an ideal time for rebalancing. Research and Due Diligence: With less emotional noise, it’s an excellent time to research projects you’ve been curious about. Look beyond the hype and understand the fundamentals, technology, and team behind the crypto assets. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re looking to invest further, DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy can be particularly effective in neutral markets, smoothing out potential price fluctuations over time. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Neutral sentiment discourages extreme reactions. Resist the urge to make sudden, large trades based on short-term price movements or rumors. Patience is a virtue in these times. Focus on Long-Term Vision: Remember your original investment thesis. Short-term neutrality often gives way to new trends, so maintaining a long-term perspective is vital for success in the crypto space. The Benefits and Challenges of a Balanced Crypto Fear & Greed Index A neutral reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index brings both advantages and potential pitfalls. On the one hand, it can foster a healthier market environment, free from the excesses of extreme fear or greed. This stability allows for more rational decision-making and reduces the likelihood of sudden, dramatic price swings driven purely by emotion. However, neutrality can also lead to a sense of indecision. Without a clear trend, some investors might find it challenging to identify clear entry or exit points. The market might appear directionless, testing the patience of even seasoned participants. The key is to view this period as an opportunity for consolidation and preparation, rather than a signal for inaction. It allows for a more considered approach to your crypto investments. Ultimately, the recent shift in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to a neutral 52 serves as a powerful reminder of the market’s dynamic nature. It signals a pause, a moment for reflection, rather than a definitive trend. For investors, this period is an invitation to exercise prudence, conduct thorough research, and stick to a well-defined strategy. By understanding the underlying mechanics of market sentiment, you can position yourself to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency with greater confidence and foresight. Embrace this neutral phase as an opportunity to refine your approach and prepare for whatever comes next. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index?

51629578,580054,1757725234,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/51629578.jpeg,Crypto Faces PATRIOT Act Crackdown—Treasury Targets Mixers And DeFi,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-faces-patriot-act-crackdown/,"The US government is preparing to bring sweeping anti-money laundering powers from the PATRIOT Act into the crypto sector, in a move that could reshape the boundaries of privacy, compliance, and innovation. According to reporting by The Rage, the Treasury Department is seeking to apply Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act—often described as one of the most far-reaching financial surveillance tools—to cryptocurrency activities such as mixers, DeFi protocols, and certain wallet services. At the center of the initiative is the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which is drafting a rule that would formally classify crypto mixing services as a “primary money laundering concern.” Such a designation would give the US Treasury the authority to effectively cut off these services from the US financial system by prohibiting banks, exchanges, and payment processors from transacting with them. US Revives War On Crypto Privacy The Rage report notes that this new rule is expected to mirror and expand on the 2022 “mixer rule” FinCEN floated after the sanctioning of Tornado Cash, but with much broader implications. In practice, Section 311 powers allow Treasury to not only blacklist specific entities, but also to ban entire categories of transactions deemed high risk. As the report states: “FinCEN’s proposal would extend the extraordinary powers of the PATRIOT Act into digital assets, placing mixers, DeFi protocols, and even wallet providers squarely in the government’s crosshairs.” Francis Pouliot, the founder and CEO of Bull Bitcoin, commented via X: “US BUREAUCRATS ATTACK ON BITCOIN USERS PRIVACY. The Orwellian scenario may not come to pass entirely, but it’s a signal: if we let them, they will establish that any use of Bitcoin except tracked custodial wallets is ‘suspicious’”. Lawmakers are also aligning with the Treasury’s push. A group in the House has reintroduced the “Special Measures to Combat Money Laundering Act,” a bill designed to codify Treasury’s use of Section 311 in the context of cryptocurrencies. By placing statutory weight behind this approach, Congress could significantly expand the executive branch’s latitude to act against privacy-focused crypto tools without requiring case-by-case legislative approval. The implications extend beyond mixers. Observers warn that if Treasury asserts that certain smart contracts or decentralized protocols facilitate illicit finance, those platforms could be designated under Section 311. This would force US intermediaries to block interactions with them, effectively walling them off from the regulated economy. One policy expert quoted in the report cautioned: “This is not just about Tornado Cash . Once these powers are formally extended, any DeFi protocol that Treasury views as a conduit for money laundering could be placed on the list. That changes the risk calculus for the entire sector.” Industry reaction is expected to be fierce. Crypto advocates argue that the indiscriminate use of Section 311 would trample due process and innovation by treating open-source code as criminal infrastructure. Civil liberties groups have already challenged the Treasury’s prior actions against mixers, warning that blanket bans erode the constitutional rights of developers and users alike. Exchanges and custodians could face heightened regulatory risk and costs as they adapt to an expanded surveillance perimeter. The move comes as the US intensifies its focus on financial flows linked to sanctioned entities, cybercriminals, and foreign adversaries. Treasury has repeatedly cited the use of crypto mixing services by North Korean hacking groups, Russian darknet markets, and ransomware operators. Officials argue that without new powers, law enforcement will struggle to prevent digital assets from undermining the integrity of the global financial system. Whether the proposed rule survives legal and political challenges remains uncertain. The Tornado Cash sanctions are still the subject of ongoing litigation, and expanding PATRIOT Act measures into the decentralized ecosystem is expected to spark fresh constitutional battles. Still, the trajectory is clear: Washington is signaling that the era of light-touch oversight over crypto privacy tools is ending. As the report concludes: “The PATRIOT Act has long been the government’s nuclear option in financial surveillance. By turning it toward crypto, the Treasury is making clear that no corner of the digital asset industry is beyond its reach.” At press time, the total crypto market cap stood at $3.95 trillion.",Crypto News|crypto|Crypto market news|Crypto Mixer|crypto news|FinCen|Tornado Cash|US Treasury,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-09-13 01:00:34
51629599,https://timestabloid.com/?p=82966,1757725254,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Top Analyst Sets Realistic XRP Targets for Next Bull Run,https://timestabloid.com/top-analyst-sets-realistic-xrp-targets-for-next-bull-run/,"Well-known market commentator CryptoInsightUK has presented his short- to mid-term outlook for XRP, suggesting price levels he considers realistic based on both technical and fundamental developments. His remarks came during a recent podcast appearance, where he discussed the factors he believes could support XRP’s continued strength in the current cycle. XRP’s Market Performance CryptoInsightUK argued that XRP is positioned to remain one of the leading performers in the digital asset market. He highlighted that the token has already displayed resilience in the current cycle, moving from about $0.50 to $3.40 earlier this year before entering a lengthy consolidation lasting more than nine months. Following a subsequent increase to $3.60 and a correction to $2.70, he noted that XRP appears to be preparing for another upward move. He emphasized that the broader market environment looks favorable, citing positive sentiment in equities, Bitcoin, and Ethereum as indicators that digital assets are gaining momentum. Data further supports his argument, as XRP has significantly outpaced major competitors over the past year. The asset has appreciated by 464%, while Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained 101% and 91%, respectively. Key Catalysts Supporting Growth The analyst pointed to several developments that could strengthen XRP’s case for further gains: Decentralized Finance Expansion – He expects XRP-based DeFi applications to roll out soon, potentially through platforms such as Flare Networks . This would broaden XRP’s use cases and attract additional liquidity. ETF Prospects – With regulators reviewing updated S-1 filings, speculation around an XRP exchange-traded fund continues to grow. CryptoInsightUK suggested that the pattern mirrors steps observed before the approvals of Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs. Institutional Activity – XRP futures on the CME have seen trading volumes exceed $1 billion, reflecting rising participation from institutional investors and large-scale participants. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Price Targets Considered Achievable On the subject of price projections, CryptoInsightUK presented a near-term breakout target above $4.20 . For the future, he set a realistic range of $8 to $11 , representing a potential gain of more than 260% from current prices. He acknowledged skepticism around such predictions but argued that the broader digital asset sector could see substantial inflows, especially if trillions of dollars in stablecoins are deployed alongside supportive macroeconomic and political conditions in the United States. Addressing concerns about whether the market may be nearing a peak, CryptoInsightUK explained that none of the widely tracked indicators of a cycle top had been triggered. On-chain data also shows relatively low risk levels, which he interpreted as a signal that the market remains positioned for growth. While skepticism around XRP persists in parts of the crypto community, the analyst maintained that institutional interest, DeFi integration, and an overall risk-on environment reinforce the argument for sustained upside. In his view, these factors together provide a foundation for XRP to pursue its next significant price leg. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This tight range signals a standoff, but beneath the surface, the market appears to be shifting into a new phase. For the first time in months, Ethereum and several altcoins are showing relative strength against Bitcoin, raising questions about capital rotation and changing market dynamics. Fresh data from CryptoQuant sheds light on the divergence between short-term traders and larger conviction-driven buyers. According to their report, addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC—often referred to as “sharks”—have added a staggering 65,000 BTC in just seven days. This aggressive accumulation has lifted their total holdings to a record 3.65 million BTC. What makes this development notable is that it has occurred even as spot prices hovered near $112,000. While retail-driven volatility has kept price action choppy, structural demand from larger buyers remains strong. The disconnect suggests that long-term players are preparing for the next leg of the cycle, absorbing supply while short-term traders hesitate. In this environment, Bitcoin’s resilience above $110K underscores its strength despite ongoing market turbulence. Bitcoin Onchain Data Points To Supply Squeeze According to a report from XWIN Finance shared by CryptoQuant, two core onchain datasets confirm that Bitcoin’s current market behavior is driven by deep structural demand rather than short-term speculation. These indicators—Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Change and Exchange Netflow—highlight a steady absorption of supply, setting the stage for potential upward pressure on price. The LTH Net Position Change, which tracks 30-day balance shifts among experienced holders, has turned strongly positive. These green spikes suggest that long-term players are actively accumulating Bitcoin rather than distributing it. Historically, such accumulation phases often precede major bull runs, as coins move into “strong hands” less likely to sell during short-term volatility. This transition of supply into longer-term storage reduces available liquidity, tightening conditions for future rallies. Exchange Netflow data provides another layer of evidence. Net outflows—BTC being withdrawn from exchanges—have dominated in recent weeks. This indicates that investors prefer cold storage over keeping assets liquid for immediate trading. Combined with LTH absorption, this confirms that recent shark buying is not speculative churn but actual supply removal from circulation. The alignment of shark accumulation, LTH buying, and sustained exchange outflows builds the conditions for a potential supply squeeze. While short-term corrections remain possible if leverage in derivatives overheats, the structural picture favors higher prices as soon as demand accelerates. Beneath the current volatility, the groundwork for Bitcoin’s next major leg higher appears to be quietly forming. Price Analysis: Quiet Consolidation Bitcoin is trading at $115,019 after a steady recovery from early September lows near $110,000. The daily chart shows BTC building momentum as it pushes into a key resistance zone. The 50-day SMA at $114,562 has been reclaimed, and the 100-day SMA at $112,323 is now acting as solid support, reinforcing the bullish setup. The 200-day SMA at $102,202 continues to anchor the long-term trend, confirming that Bitcoin remains structurally healthy despite recent volatility. The next challenge lies at $116,000–$118,000, a resistance area that has capped rallies in recent weeks. A successful breakout and close above this zone could clear the path toward the major barrier at $123,217, which remains the cycle’s key level to watch. On the downside, immediate support is established near $114,000, followed by stronger backing around $112,000. As long as BTC holds these levels, buyers are likely to maintain control. A breakdown below $112,000, however, could shift momentum back in favor of sellers and potentially bring $110,000 back into focus.

The rally comes as demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization accelerates, pushing Ondo’s TVL to record highs. Related Reading: Cardano Is Not Dead: Analyst Confirms Breakout With New ADA Price Targets The recently launched Ondo Global Markets platform has been a major growth driver, attracting over $160 million in assets within days. The service enables investors to access tokenized versions of more than 100 stocks and ETFs, including Tesla, Nvidia, and Google. By bringing Wall Street assets onto the blockchain, Ondo is positioning itself as a leader in the $26 billion RWA tokenization market. Analysts argue that this move could transform global investing, particularly for users outside the U.S., who have traditionally faced barriers to stock market participation. Ondo Finance’s Total Value Locked Hits $1.57 Billion Beyond its equities platform, Ondo Finance has seen explosive growth across its ecosystem. TVL on its DeFi protocols has surged from $563 million earlier this year to more than $1.57 billion today. This spike is primarily fueled by Ondo’s yield-bearing products, such as: Ondo US Dollar Yield (USDY): Over $500 million in assets Ondo Short-Term U.S. Treasuries Fund (OUSG): $724 million locked The firm’s lending arm, Flux, has also expanded rapidly, now managing $42 million in assets compared to just $4 million last November. Like Aave’s Horizon, Flux lets users borrow stablecoins against tokenized U.S. Treasuries, creating new liquidity avenues. Ondo has also launched its own blockchain, tailored for tokenization, which strengthens its moat in a sector projected to reach trillions of dollars in value. ONDO's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ONDOUSD on Tradingview ONDO Price Outlook: Can Bulls Break $1.145? Technically, Ondo has formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, a bullish reversal signal. The token recently broke past the $1.05 resistance and is now eyeing a breakout above $1.145, last seen in July. A successful move could open the door toward $1.18 and even $1.26 in the short term. However, traders are watching closely for profit-taking risks, as ONDO’s relative strength index (RSI) signals overbought conditions. Regardless, with BlackRock signaling blockchain-based ETFs and Fed rate cuts expected to fuel a broader risk rally, momentum could remain in Ondo’s favor.

US spot ETH ETFs have just marked a truly remarkable achievement, recording an astounding $402.3 million in net inflows on September 12th. This impressive figure signifies the fourth consecutive day of positive investment, highlighting a growing confidence in Ethereum as a robust digital asset. For anyone following the evolving landscape of digital finance, this surge in interest in US spot ETH ETFs is a development that simply cannot be ignored. What’s Fueling the Surge in US Spot ETH ETFs? The latest data from TraderT clearly shows a powerful momentum behind these new financial products. Leading the charge in these substantial inflows were two major financial powerhouses: Fidelity and BlackRock. Fidelity’s FETH attracted a significant $168 million, while BlackRock’s ETHA followed closely with $162 million in new investments. These figures demonstrate a strong institutional appetite for Ethereum exposure. It wasn’t just these two giants, however. Other prominent players also contributed meaningfully to the overall positive trend. Grayscale’s ETHE saw inflows of $23.84 million, with its Grayscale Mini ETH product adding another $17.57 million. Bitwise’s ETHW also recorded a healthy $16.62 million in new capital. Crucially, the day concluded with no US spot ETH ETFs experiencing net outflows, underscoring a broad-based positive sentiment across the market. This sustained influx of capital into US spot ETH ETFs suggests that traditional financial institutions are increasingly comfortable with integrating digital assets into their portfolios. This move is not merely about speculative trading; it reflects a deeper belief in Ethereum’s underlying technology and its long-term potential within the global financial system. The consistent positive flows are a clear indicator of this evolving perspective. Why Are US Spot ETH ETFs a Game-Changer for Ethereum? The introduction and subsequent success of US spot ETH ETFs represent a significant milestone for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly for Ethereum. These investment vehicles provide a regulated and familiar pathway for a broader range of investors – from institutions to retail – to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without the complexities of direct crypto ownership. Consider the benefits these products bring: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors can now easily add Ethereum exposure to their brokerage accounts, just like stocks or bonds. Enhanced Liquidity: More capital flowing into the market through ETFs can lead to increased liquidity for Ethereum, potentially stabilizing its price. Institutional Validation: The involvement of major financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity lends considerable credibility and legitimacy to Ethereum as a serious asset class. Market Maturation: The success of US spot ETH ETFs signals a maturing crypto market, where digital assets are increasingly seen as viable components of diversified investment strategies. This institutional embrace is a powerful vote of confidence. It suggests that Ethereum, with its robust smart contract platform and extensive ecosystem, is moving beyond its early adopter phase and into mainstream financial consideration. The impact could be profound, paving the way for further integration of digital assets into traditional finance. What Challenges Do US Spot ETH ETFs Face? While the recent inflows are overwhelmingly positive, it is important to acknowledge that the journey for US spot ETH ETFs is not without its potential hurdles. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and Ethereum is no exception. Price swings can be significant, which might pose risks for investors accustomed to more stable traditional assets. This inherent market characteristic requires a careful risk assessment from potential investors. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related financial products is still evolving globally. Any sudden shifts or increased scrutiny from financial authorities could impact the operation and appeal of these ETFs. There is also the aspect of competition among various ETF providers; funds will need to continuously innovate and offer competitive fees and services to attract and retain investors in a crowded market. Despite these potential challenges, the current momentum strongly suggests a robust underlying demand for regulated Ethereum investment products. How Can Investors Approach US Spot ETH ETFs? For individuals considering an investment in US spot ETH ETFs , a thoughtful approach is always recommended. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and understand the nuances of both Ethereum and the ETF structure. While these products offer convenience, they are still tied to the performance of a volatile asset. Here are some actionable insights: Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Assess how much risk you are comfortable taking, given the inherent volatility of crypto markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Consider allocating a portion of your investment portfolio to crypto assets, but ensure it aligns with your overall diversification strategy. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and the performance of individual US spot ETH ETFs . Long-Term Perspective: Many investors in the crypto space adopt a long-term view, focusing on the fundamental growth of the technology rather than short-term price fluctuations. Making informed decisions will empower you to navigate this exciting new investment frontier effectively. The rise of these ETFs opens new avenues, but responsible investing remains paramount. In conclusion, the recent and sustained net inflows into US spot ETH ETFs represent a pivotal moment for the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. The strong participation from institutional giants like BlackRock and Fidelity underscores a growing confidence and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. This trend not only enhances Ethereum’s legitimacy and accessibility but also signals a significant maturation of the crypto investment landscape. As these products gain further traction, they are poised to play an increasingly vital role in shaping the future of digital asset investment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly are US spot ETH ETFs? A1: US spot ETH ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum (ETH) without directly owning the cryptocurrency. They hold actual Ethereum as their underlying asset. Q2: Why are the recent inflows into US spot ETH ETFs significant? A2: The significant inflows, particularly from major institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity, indicate a growing institutional acceptance and confidence in Ethereum. This enhances market legitimacy, provides greater liquidity, and offers a regulated way for traditional investors to access crypto markets. Q3: How do US spot ETH ETFs differ from futures ETH ETFs? A3: Spot ETH ETFs directly hold Ethereum, meaning their price performance is closely tied to the real-time market price of ETH. Futures ETH ETFs, on the other hand, invest in Ethereum futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell Ethereum at a predetermined price in the future, and can sometimes diverge from the spot price. Q4: Are US spot ETH ETFs suitable for all investors? A4: While US spot ETH ETFs offer a convenient way to invest in Ethereum, they are tied to a volatile asset. They may be suitable for investors who understand the risks associated with cryptocurrency markets and are comfortable with potential price fluctuations. Always consider your personal risk tolerance and investment goals. Q5: What are the main advantages of investing in US spot ETH ETFs? A5: The primary advantages include ease of access through traditional brokerage accounts, professional management of the underlying assets, potential for enhanced liquidity in the Ethereum market, and the added layer of regulatory oversight compared to direct crypto ownership.

This massive move, reported by Lookonchain, saw an address suspected to belong to Galaxy Digital gather an astonishing 5 million SOL tokens, valued at approximately $1.16 billion, in a mere three days. This action highlights a growing trend of institutional interest in the Solana ecosystem. What’s Driving This Unprecedented SOL Accumulation? This substantial investment by Galaxy Digital is not just a simple purchase; it’s a strategic maneuver. The bulk of this SOL accumulation —specifically 4.719 million SOL, worth around $1.11 billion—was promptly transferred to Coinbase Prime. This indicates a clear intention for secure, institutional-grade custody rather than immediate trading. Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector, is known for its sophisticated approach to crypto markets. Their decision to accumulate such a large volume of Solana suggests a strong conviction in the asset’s long-term potential. Solana, with its high throughput and low transaction costs, continues to attract significant developer and user activity, making it an appealing asset for institutional portfolios. Strategic Implications of Galaxy Digital’s Solana Play This substantial SOL accumulation by a major institutional player like Galaxy Digital sends a powerful signal to the broader market. It often indicates increasing confidence in Solana’s underlying technology and its position within the competitive blockchain landscape. Such large-scale investments can: Boost Market Confidence: Institutional backing often validates a cryptocurrency’s legitimacy and future prospects. Influence Price Action: Increased demand from institutional investors can contribute to price stability and potential appreciation. Attract Further Investment: Other institutional players may view this move as a cue to explore or increase their own Solana holdings. The fact that Galaxy Digital still holds 219,000 SOL, currently valued at about $53.5 million, in the initial address further suggests ongoing strategic management of their Solana assets. Why is Secure Custody Crucial for Large SOL Holdings? For an investment of this magnitude, security is paramount. Transferring a significant portion of the SOL accumulation to Coinbase Prime underscores the importance of institutional-grade custody solutions. Coinbase Prime offers: Enhanced Security: Advanced security protocols, including cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and robust cybersecurity measures, protect assets from theft and loss. Regulatory Compliance: Operating within a regulated framework provides legal and compliance assurances, which are vital for institutional investors. Insurance: Many institutional custodians offer insurance policies, providing an additional layer of protection for digital assets. Operational Efficiency: Streamlined processes for managing large crypto holdings, including trading, reporting, and auditing. This move to a trusted custodian like Coinbase Prime demonstrates Galaxy Digital’s commitment to responsible asset management and risk mitigation for their substantial Solana position. Looking Ahead: What Does This Massive SOL Accumulation Mean for Solana’s Future? Galaxy Digital’s recent SOL accumulation is more than just a transaction; it’s a potential harbinger for Solana’s trajectory. This kind of institutional endorsement can pave the way for increased adoption and integration of Solana into traditional financial systems. As more institutions recognize Solana’s capabilities, its ecosystem is likely to see further growth in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and enterprise solutions. However, the crypto market remains dynamic. While institutional interest provides a strong foundation, factors like network stability, developer engagement, and overall market sentiment will continue to shape Solana’s journey. This significant investment serves as a powerful testament to Solana’s current appeal and its potential as a leading blockchain platform for the future. In conclusion, Galaxy Digital’s staggering $1.2 billion SOL accumulation in just three days marks a pivotal moment for Solana and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It underscores growing institutional confidence in digital assets and highlights the critical role of secure, professional custody in managing such substantial investments. This move by a major player like Galaxy Digital could very well be a bellwether for increased institutional adoption and a brighter future for the Solana ecosystem.

This isn’t a theory. It is the conversion of crypto into one of the strongest trends into a daily paycheck. What is Bitcoin Mining?
